unadvised decision of the supreme court
 
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.310 align:start position:0%
unadvised decision of the supreme court
rendered

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 align:start position:0%
rendered
 
00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:31.039 align:start position:0%
in 19 i'm sorry in 2005 in 2005
 
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
um at that time
 
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
the issue before the court was whether
 
00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
the expiration
 
00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
of the term of a lease
 
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
with respect to restricted property and
 
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
and by restricted property
 
00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
that means property that is is
 
00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
residential property that is leased
 
00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 align:start position:0%
uh by by a landlord who
 
00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better term is in the
 
00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 align:start position:0%
business of leasing real estate uh it
 
00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't apply
 
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
for example to someone who
 
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.390 align:start position:0%
for example to someone who
um

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
if you owned a uh
 
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
a duplex or a three or four family house
 
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
and you were you were an occupant yours
 
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.430 align:start position:0%
and you were you were an occupant yours
yourself

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
yourself
 
00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
that would not be considered restricted
 
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
property if you leased less than
 
00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
even if you don't live in in a
 
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
property if you if you
 
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
own less than i believe it is for
 
00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 align:start position:0%
rental units you know
 
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
rental properties other other than the
 
00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
property you live in then that's not
 
00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
considered restricted property so it's
 
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.670 align:start position:0%
considered restricted property so it's
basically

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
the kind of property we're talking about
 
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.309 align:start position:0%
the kind of property we're talking about
is

00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:37.029 align:start position:0%
is
are

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:39.199 align:start position:0%
rental units that are rented by a
 
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
landlord who
 
00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better term is in the
 
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
business of renting property that's uh
 
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
they they own they have you know a
 
00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
substantial number of
 
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.390 align:start position:0%
substantial number of
properties

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
properties
 
00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
uh at any rate
 
00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
the issue in this supreme court case
 
00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:56.309 align:start position:0%
the issue in this supreme court case
was

00:06:56.309 --> 00:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:06:56.319 --> 00:06:57.350 align:start position:0%
was
um

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:59.189 --> 00:06:59.199 align:start position:0%
a landlord intended
 
00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
entered into a lease for a term of one
 
00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:02.790 align:start position:0%
entered into a lease for a term of one
year

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:06.639 align:start position:0%
and at the end of the term the landlord
 
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
notified the tenant that
 
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
he was not going to renew the lease
 
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
and the issue before the court was
 
00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
whether under
 
00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
rsa 540 colon 2
 
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
the termination of the leaf the end of
 
00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
the least term constituted good cause
 
00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:26.469 align:start position:0%
the least term constituted good cause
for

00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:27.430 align:start position:0%
for
um

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
term for evicting the tenant um and the
 
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
supreme court in a four to one decision
 
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
held that it did not
 
00:07:37.909 --> 00:07:37.919 align:start position:0%
that um the mere fact that the lease
 
00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
term was up
 
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
um was not a good reason
 
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
to evict the tenant um
 
00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
and the the
 
00:07:47.199 --> 00:07:49.189 align:start position:0%
and the the
um

00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
rationale for the case was
 
00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
uh frankly
 
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.110 align:start position:0%
uh frankly
um

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
hard for me to understand it was based
 
00:07:59.350 --> 00:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
on the idea that
 
00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.550 align:start position:0%
on the idea that
um

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:03.029 --> 00:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
the tenant um
 
00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
the landlord in this circumstance is
 
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
really only interested in profit um has
 
00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.469 align:start position:0%
really only interested in profit um has
no

00:08:08.469 --> 00:08:08.479 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh interest beyond that and is law and
 
00:08:13.749 --> 00:08:13.759 align:start position:0%
if there wasn't some
 
00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
other reason uh
 
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
misconduct by the tenant or you know not
 
00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
paying the rent or something like that
 
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
then the landlord shouldn't be able to
 
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.270 align:start position:0%
then the landlord shouldn't be able to
um

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
evict the tenant just because the lease
 
00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
term had ended
 
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
justice nedo
 
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.469 align:start position:0%
justice nedo
um

00:08:32.469 --> 00:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
concurred in the result only he he
 
00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
concurred in the judgment because
 
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
on some other grounds but with respect
 
00:08:40.949 --> 00:08:40.959 align:start position:0%
to that rationale
 
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
he essentially said look this
 
00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
this ruling by the majority essentially
 
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
says that
 
00:08:51.509 --> 00:08:51.519 align:start position:0%
if a landlord enters into a lease with a
 
00:08:51.519 --> 00:08:52.550 align:start position:0%
if a landlord enters into a lease with a
tenant

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
tenant
 
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
the term of the lease doesn't really
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
matter the least potentially is a
 
00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
perpetual lease
 
00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
so that if you know unless the tenant
 
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
has done something else like failed to
 
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
pay the rent
 
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
or you know
 
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
interfered with other tenants or damaged
 
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
the property
 
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
the mere expiration of the lease term
 
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
is not enough
 
00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:18.399 align:start position:0%
uh to evict the tenant so it i think
 
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
and i think justice nedo was absolutely
 
00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
right in his in uh his disagreement with
 
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
the majority it it really says to a
 
00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.150 align:start position:0%
the majority it it really says to a
landlord

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
landlord
 
00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.750 align:start position:0%
landlord
um

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
when you enter into a lease the term of
 
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
the lease is in in many respects
 
00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
meaningless it doesn't it uh because
 
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.470 align:start position:0%
meaningless it doesn't it uh because
you're

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:40.720 align:start position:0%
um you cannot
 
00:09:42.389 --> 00:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
evict the tenant
 
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
even when the lease term expires
 
00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:46.870 align:start position:0%
even when the lease term expires
um

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that that
 
00:09:51.269 --> 00:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
you know that is is really sort of a
 
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
fundamental at fundamentally at odds
 
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
with the notion of freedom of contract
 
00:09:59.190 --> 00:09:59.200 align:start position:0%
um the landlord and tenant enter into an
 
00:10:01.269 --> 00:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
agreement whether it's for a
 
00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
um a year lease or a five-year lease or
 
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
whatever the term of the lease may be
 
00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:09.839 align:start position:0%
they both enter into that and there's no
 
00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
suggestion there was no suggestion in
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
that case and there's nothing in uh
 
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh in the proposed legislation that
 
00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
would say
 
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
that you know if there's if somehow a
 
00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
landlord has misrepresented something to
 
00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
a tenant about the term of the lease or
 
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:26.160 align:start position:0%
whatever that that that um that wouldn't
 
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
be a basis for granting the tenant some
 
00:10:30.949 --> 00:10:30.959 align:start position:0%
relief but assuming both the landlord
 
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
and the tenant have
 
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
knowingly and understandably entered
 
00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
into a lease for a specific term
 
00:10:37.279 --> 00:10:38.310 align:start position:0%
into a lease for a specific term
this

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:10:40.949 --> 00:10:40.959 align:start position:0%
the proposed legislation would say
 
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
that the expiration of the term of the
 
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.750 align:start position:0%
that the expiration of the term of the
lease

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
lease
 
00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
is a grounds for evicting the tenant
 
00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.350 align:start position:0%
is a grounds for evicting the tenant
um

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:50.069 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:10:50.069 --> 00:10:50.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
the um the one caveat that you'll notice
 
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
in the legislation is
 
00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
i did think that the majority in the and
 
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
the name of the case by the way i
 
00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:03.839 align:start position:0%
just is aimco properties versus
 
00:11:03.839 --> 00:11:05.350 align:start position:0%
just is aimco properties versus
dieselwitz

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
dieselwitz
 
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
it's reported at 152 new hampshire 587
 
00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:12.959 align:start position:0%
it was decided in 2005.
 
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
the one thing that that i thought that
 
00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
the majority did have a point on and
 
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
that's the reason that i'll i'll get to
 
00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
um why the legislation proposed
 
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
legislation is drafted as it is
 
00:11:26.069 --> 00:11:26.079 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
if you have a very short
 
00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
for example a month to month lease term
 
00:11:36.949 --> 00:11:36.959 align:start position:0%
unless there are other circumstances i
 
00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.350 align:start position:0%
think that
there

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
you know there there probably is an
 
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.389 align:start position:0%
you know there there probably is an
expectation

00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
expectation
 
00:11:45.750 --> 00:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
on the part
 
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
of both the landlord but particularly
 
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
the tenant that
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
if though if the lease is for a month is
 
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
on a month-to-month basis that assuming
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
the tenant
 
00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
abides by the rules pays the rent
 
00:11:59.190 --> 00:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
whatever the tenant is is not going to
 
00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.230 align:start position:0%
whatever the tenant is is not going to
be

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
you know told to leave at the end of the
 
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
first or second month uh you know some
 
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
very short period of time
 
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.550 align:start position:0%
very short period of time
so

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
to account for
 
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
for and i think in those circumstances i
 
00:12:12.389 --> 00:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
think that an argument could be made
 
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
that it would that the landlord
 
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.470 align:start position:0%
that it would that the landlord
shouldn't

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
shouldn't
 
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
be able to just end it at the end of the
 
00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
first or second month or whatever and so
 
00:12:21.509 --> 00:12:21.519 align:start position:0%
to account for that
 
00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
this proposed legislation is drafted so
 
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
that it would
 
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
the the expiration of the term of the
 
00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:29.910 align:start position:0%
the the expiration of the term of the
lease

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
lease
 
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
would only constitute a basis for
 
00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.509 align:start position:0%
would only constitute a basis for
eviction

00:12:33.509 --> 00:12:33.519 align:start position:0%
eviction
 
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
at the six-month point in other words if
 
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
the lease is for six months or longer
 
00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
then the expiration of the lease would
 
00:12:41.519 --> 00:12:42.230 align:start position:0%
then the expiration of the lease would
be

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:12:44.949 --> 00:12:44.959 align:start position:0%
a grounds for eviction or
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
to deal with the situation of a
 
00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
month-to-month lease if it if there's if
 
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
there is in fact a month-to-month
 
00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.550 align:start position:0%
there is in fact a month-to-month
tenancy

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
tenancy
 
00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:53.990 align:start position:0%
tenancy
um

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:54.870 align:start position:0%
um
then

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
then the the x then at the end of of the
 
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
six month period of that in other words
 
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
when it when that tenancy has been
 
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
in effect for six months
 
00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:05.670 align:start position:0%
in effect for six months
then

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:07.839 align:start position:0%
the the next time it came up on the
 
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
seventh month for example would be
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
the basis for um
 
00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.350 align:start position:0%
the basis for um
uh

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
or i'm sorry i guess i should say on the
 
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
uh when it came up for renewal at the
 
00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:17.829 align:start position:0%
uh when it came up for renewal at the
end

00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:17.839 align:start position:0%
end
 
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
it would be now in effect for six months
 
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
then that would be a the the landlord
 
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
would have the option to say
 
00:13:27.829 --> 00:13:27.839 align:start position:0%
um i'm not renewing it
 
00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
um i think that there are as i said i
 
00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
fundamentally the the majority's
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
decision in that case just really sort
 
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
of undercut
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
basic contract rights in my view and the
 
00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:44.240 align:start position:0%
other thing i think as a policy matter
 
00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:46.959 align:start position:0%
it i i actually think that
 
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
having the law the way it is may
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
actually inhibit
 
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
um landlords willingness
 
00:13:58.069 --> 00:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
to uh rent to what
 
00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
you know for example what i would
 
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
characterize as marginal candidates in
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
other words suppose that a landlord has
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to rent a property
 
00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
to a tenant and the landlord is you know
 
00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
just based upon meeting with the tenant
 
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
talking with the tenant has some
 
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
question about
 
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
you know is is this is this tenant uh
 
00:14:24.389 --> 00:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
going to be able to
 
00:14:24.399 --> 00:14:25.670 align:start position:0%
going to be able to
uh

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
conduct uh himself or herself properly
 
00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
are they gonna take care of the property
 
00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
are they going to
 
00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
are they going to
 
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
not interfere with the neighbors are
 
00:14:36.389 --> 00:14:36.399 align:start position:0%
they going to be you know sort of loud
 
00:14:41.269 --> 00:14:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
a landlord might well conclude well look
 
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna rent to i'm gonna i've only
 
00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
i'm only renting this property for six
 
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:49.600 align:start position:0%
months or a year
 
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:50.629 align:start position:0%
months or a year
so

00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
you know okay i'm running a risk uh that
 
00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:54.959 align:start position:0%
maybe on maybe my
 
00:14:54.959 --> 00:14:55.750 align:start position:0%
maybe on maybe my
uh

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
decision to to rent the property is
 
00:14:59.670 --> 00:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
wrong but it's only going to be for a
 
00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
year but under under this supreme court
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
decision the landlord
 
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
has to has to basically think look
 
00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
when i make when i make this uh this
 
00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.269 align:start position:0%
when i make when i make this uh this
contract

00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
contract
 
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm potentially
 
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
leasing this property in perpetuity to
 
00:15:18.389 --> 00:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
the to the tenant because if the tenant
 
00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't if the tenant doesn't you know
 
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
actually destroy the property and the
 
00:15:26.949 --> 00:15:26.959 align:start position:0%
tenant pays the rent um
 
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
then i'm i'm i'm i'm on the hook i'm i'm
 
00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
at risk for the entire
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
for however long the tenant might want
 
00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
to stay there
 
00:15:38.069 --> 00:15:38.079 align:start position:0%
so justice lynn i don't want to cut you
 
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
off but we we're only scheduled for a
 
00:15:41.829 --> 00:15:41.839 align:start position:0%
half an hour this morning no i'm sorry
 
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
you're right so i'm i'm i'm done i think
 
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
i've basically stated the reason why i
 
00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.350 align:start position:0%
i've basically stated the reason why i
think

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh this is important and i hope um i
 
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
hope the committee will agree
 
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:56.389 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
committee

00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
yes representative alexander
 
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chair thank you
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
is there ex was there um before the case
 
00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
was ruled on was there um
 
00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:10.160 align:start position:0%
like existing case law that would that
 
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
would indicate that they would rule that
 
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
way just based on past practices
 
00:16:16.949 --> 00:16:16.959 align:start position:0%
now you know it's interesting i the um
 
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:20.959 align:start position:0%
majority opinion does not
 
00:16:23.829 --> 00:16:23.839 align:start position:0%
does not see suggest that
 
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
you know that there was prior case law
 
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
that that uh
 
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
that sort of supported his position they
 
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
they basically said that the statutory
 
00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
language other good cause was ambiguous
 
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
and they went into legislative history
 
00:16:40.629 --> 00:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
which said um
 
00:16:42.629 --> 00:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
from which they drew the conclusion that
 
00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
that you know
 
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
the end of the lease term was not um was
 
00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.550 align:start position:0%
the end of the lease term was not um was
not

00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
a was not good cause i
 
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
respectfully disagree with their
 
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
reasoning that's i guess that's all i
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
could say
 
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:02.829 --> 00:17:02.839 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
representative glenn
 
00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:06.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
if if he's available let me see
 
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
he can only testify if he unmutes there
 
00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
you go that took a little bit to find
 
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
 
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
we can okay awesome
 
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
let me clarify one thing when i signed
 
00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
in i was going through the options there
 
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
was no option for advocate
 
00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
the only option that seemed closest
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
appropriate was a lobbyist so i picked
 
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
that because there was no better choice
 
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not a lobbyist i'm an advocate for
 
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
property owners
 
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
i heard um that question
 
00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:55.909 align:start position:0%
i heard um that question
okay

00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:17:58.710 --> 00:17:58.720 align:start position:0%
so um many of you know me well short
 
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
introduction i lead
 
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:02.070 align:start position:0%
introduction i lead
the

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
group of landlords across the state
 
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
involving new landlord tenant law
 
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
give a weekly update that goes out to
 
00:18:11.669 --> 00:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
about four thousand different emails and
 
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
different associations around the state
 
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
so i'm involved with the landlords
 
00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
across the entire state many
 
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
we're definitely in favor of this bill
 
00:18:26.549 --> 00:18:26.559 align:start position:0%
i agree with the points that the sponsor
 
00:18:30.549 --> 00:18:30.559 align:start position:0%
made and the problem that
 
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
exists here is that when a contract
 
00:18:35.909 --> 00:18:35.919 align:start position:0%
expires we feel that the contract should
 
00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
be up
 
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that is plaguing
 
00:18:46.549 --> 00:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
property owners is that
 
00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
it can be very hard to prove
 
00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:50.950 align:start position:0%
it can be very hard to prove
situations

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
situations
 
00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
uh that would warrant evicting a tenant
 
00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
or having them move if it's not
 
00:18:59.830 --> 00:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
non-payment of rent
 
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
and there are many many issues where
 
00:19:05.110 --> 00:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
you have a tenant maybe smoking in the
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
apartment that's against the rules
 
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
you have a tenant that's dealing drugs
 
00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
using drugs
 
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
a tenant that's
 
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
a tenant that has unauthorized roommates
 
00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
unauthorized pets being a disturbance to
 
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
the other tenants in the building
 
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
these things although theoretically you
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
could evict for
 
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
they're extremely hard to do and you
 
00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799 align:start position:0%
have to prove that in a court of law
 
00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:39.039 align:start position:0%
and almost a hundred percent none of the
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
other tenants that are in the building
 
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
complaining about this bad behavior are
 
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
willing to testify in court because
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
they're afraid of retribution
 
00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:48.789 align:start position:0%
they're afraid of retribution
so

00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:48.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
the easiest thing
 
00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
to do in this case would be to say at
 
00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
the end of your lease we're not renewing
 
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
now that's not allowed
 
00:19:59.830 --> 00:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
and it causes a lot of problems
 
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
and speaking to
 
00:20:02.789 --> 00:20:02.799 align:start position:0%
some of our
 
00:20:02.799 --> 00:20:04.310 align:start position:0%
some of our
landlord

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
landlord
 
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
specialist attorneys that specialize in
 
00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
real estate
 
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
it's virtually impossible to get
 
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
somebody out that's dealing drugs you
 
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
can't prove it
 
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
so there are many instances that
 
00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
for the protection of all the tenants
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
and the property and the building
 
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
we'd like to be able to
 
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
simply have a tenant move when it's the
 
00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:26.559 align:start position:0%
end of the lease
 
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
i'm very willing to take question i i
 
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
would very much welcome questions i
 
00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:32.870 align:start position:0%
would very much welcome questions i
often

00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
often
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
observe that people don't quite
 
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:36.880 align:start position:0%

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:39.440 align:start position:0%

justice at new hampshire legal
 
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
assistance i have been involved with the
 
00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
statute since its initially good cause
 
00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
eviction statute since its uh enactment
 
00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
in 1985.
 
00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
uh i actually had the chance to uh the
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
privilege to uh test to um argue the
 
00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
jevitt's case before the new hampshire
 
00:21:35.909 --> 00:21:35.919 align:start position:0%
supreme court
 
00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
um i want to start by saying that
 
00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:41.190 align:start position:0%
um i want to start by saying that
um

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
i have great respect
 
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
for former chief justice lynn and i
 
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
understand his position
 
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh under normal circumstances that
 
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
position would make perfect sense if
 
00:21:57.270 --> 00:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
if you had a reasonable supply and
 
00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.470 align:start position:0%
if you had a reasonable supply and
demand

00:21:58.470 --> 00:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
demand
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
situation but the problem is
 
00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:02.310 align:start position:0%
situation but the problem is
that

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
only twice in my 40 plus years as an
 
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
attorney in new hampshire only twice has
 
00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:10.480 align:start position:0%
there been a reasonable supply and
 
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
demand equation that one was during the
 
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
savings and loan uh
 
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
crash and then of course the 2007-2008
 
00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.029 align:start position:0%
crash and then of course the 2007-2008
uh

00:22:21.029 --> 00:22:21.039 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
real estate disaster and economic
 
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
disaster today we have a vacancy rate of
 
00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:28.070 align:start position:0%
disaster today we have a vacancy rate of
1.8

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
1.8
 
00:22:31.029 --> 00:22:31.039 align:start position:0%
in belknap county it's one percent less
 
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
than one percent in rockingham county
 
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
the statewide median rent for a
 
00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
two-bedroom apartment
 
00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:41.029 align:start position:0%
two-bedroom apartment
1413.

00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:41.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
that we have more than 30 000 households
 
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire who pay over half of
 
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
their income for rent
 
00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:49.830 align:start position:0%
their income for rent
now

00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
just by way of background
 
00:22:54.149 --> 00:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:22:56.549 --> 00:22:56.559 align:start position:0%
former chief justice lynn said correctly
 
00:22:58.789 --> 00:22:58.799 align:start position:0%
that for very small-time landlords the
 
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
good cause requirement does not apply
 
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
but for all other landlords in new
 
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire it does and has been ever
 
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
since 1985
 
00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
which means that if you in that a
 
00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
landlord has to have a good reason to
 
00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
evict somebody
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
now but and this is really
 
00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.149 align:start position:0%
now but and this is really
important

00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
important
 
00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
the it is not a perpetual lease the
 
00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
landlord can evict not only for
 
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
something the tenant did wrong
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
but the tenant the landlord can evict
 
00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
for other good cause and the statute
 
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
specifically says that other good cause
 
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
includes any legitimate business or
 
00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
economic reason
 
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
if you need
 
00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:45.919 align:start position:0%
to increase the rent and the tenant
 
00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
chooses not to or can't afford to pay
 
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
the higher rent that is specifically
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
other good cause for eviction if the
 
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
landlord wants to renovate the property
 
00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
that's other good cause for eviction if
 
00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
he wants to sell the property in most
 
00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
cases that will be other good cause for
 
00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.350 align:start position:0%
cases that will be other good cause for
eviction

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
eviction
 
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
the manufactured housing law the
 
00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
eviction law which has existed since the
 
00:24:09.029 --> 00:24:09.039 align:start position:0%
70s says in a mobile home park in a
 
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing park the only
 
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
evictions that are permitted are for
 
00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
tenant fault and in that situation the
 
00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
industry has been thriving not
 
00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
withstanding a much tighter good cause
 
00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.750 align:start position:0%
withstanding a much tighter good cause
requirement

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.269 align:start position:0%
requirement
now

00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
if a landlord who doesn't have a lease
 
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
has to prove good cause
 
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
why shouldn't a landlord a professional
 
00:24:36.149 --> 00:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
landlord have to prove good cause in the
 
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
aimco case nco versus javits that the uh
 
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
justice referred to
 
00:24:46.149 --> 00:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
that landlord was a mega corporation
 
00:24:46.159 --> 00:24:47.510 align:start position:0%
that landlord was a mega corporation
owning

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
owning
 
00:24:50.310 --> 00:24:50.320 align:start position:0%
aimco properties operates all over the
 
00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:51.430 align:start position:0%
aimco properties operates all over the
country

00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:24:53.269 --> 00:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
and what they want to do
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
is just is have a what is essentially a
 
00:25:00.149 --> 00:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
probationary tenancy in in hp 227 that's
 
00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
a six-month probationary tenancy after
 
00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
which time
 
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
you can just say no thank you i don't
 
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
want you here anymore
 
00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
if the court's decision in javits and
 
00:25:14.789 --> 00:25:14.799 align:start position:0%
i'm just to read briefly from it but i
 
00:25:17.669 --> 00:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
think i think they got it just right
 
00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
it says we're the mere expiration of the
 
00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:23.039 align:start position:0%
leaps that constitute good cause for
 
00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
eviction it could enable landlords to
 
00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:28.240 align:start position:0%
evict when the true reason for eviction
 
00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:33.669 --> 00:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
it was enacted to prevent landlords from
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
evicting tenants for ill motivated
 
00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.269 align:start position:0%
evicting tenants for ill motivated
reason

00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
if if the mere expiration of the lease
 
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
were good cause a landlord who did not
 
00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
wish to continue to renting to a tenant
 
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
for any reason
 
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
for example because the landlord the
 
00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:51.919 align:start position:0%
tenant became disabled during the course
 
00:25:54.390 --> 00:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
of the tenancy he could evict the tenant
 
00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
at the end of the lease
 
00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
let me just ask you this i assume that
 
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
most of you are homeowners
 
00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
so what would you think
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
if the bank
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
that holds your mortgage
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
every six months could come along and
 
00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:11.039 align:start position:0%
say you know what i'll give you back
 
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
your money but i want you to move
 
00:26:16.149 --> 00:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
the forceful eviction
 
00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
can lead you it
 
00:26:20.230 --> 00:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
obvious to the fact that kids have to go
 
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
to a different school people have to go
 
00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
to a different city or town that they
 
00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
can lose mental health providers they
 
00:26:29.669 --> 00:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
can lose their you know their doctor
 
00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:31.919 align:start position:0%
they lose their community and all too
 
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
often in the market we have it leads to
 
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
absolute homelessness
 
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
i urge you i know there's so many things
 
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
i could
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
talk to about here but just
 
00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
but i i won't let me just say two things
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
number one our neighbors in vermont
 
00:26:54.149 --> 00:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
um i'm sorry oh
 
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
let me just go that there was a letter
 
00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
written um to the committee by paul
 
00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
stewart of stuart property management
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
they managed 3 000
 
00:27:09.269 --> 00:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
3 000 units across new hampshire and the
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
question is they are opposed to this
 
00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:14.559 align:start position:0%
because they understand the dangers
 
00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
involved in uh and the the lack of
 
00:27:17.679 --> 00:27:19.190 align:start position:0%
involved in uh and the the lack of
rationality

00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
rationality
 
00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
for allowing people to be evicted from
 
00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:24.400 align:start position:0%
one of life's most basic necessities to
 
00:27:26.549 --> 00:27:26.559 align:start position:0%
lose that without establishing good
 
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:29.200 align:start position:0%
cause doesn't make sense in a market
 
00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
like this and i'll say one final thing
 
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
one of the things that does happen more
 
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
often than not in my experience is when
 
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
you have a lease expiration and a
 
00:27:42.549 --> 00:27:42.559 align:start position:0%
subsequent eviction the result most of
 
00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
the time is a negotiated settlement in
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
which the tenant gets the time to
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
maximize their chance to find another
 
00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.149 align:start position:0%
maximize their chance to find another
place

00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
um that's the practical on the ground so
 
00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.310 align:start position:0%
um that's the practical on the ground so
okay

00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
if you could just wrap up i am very
 
00:27:59.590 --> 00:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm done and i'd be happy to answer
 
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
any questions representative sylvia do
 
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
you have a question
 
00:28:07.029 --> 00:28:07.039 align:start position:0%
yes just briefly
 
00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
if um
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
we acknowledge that there is a
 
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:13.919 align:start position:0%
supply problem in rental
 
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
can you understand how the state
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
interference with these contracts is
 
00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
causing such problems to vary
 
00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
i can't except for one thing
 
00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
representative sylvia i there are
 
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
countless developers out there who are
 
00:28:31.909 --> 00:28:31.919 align:start position:0%
dying to create multi-family housing and
 
00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
are creating an enormous demand for
 
00:28:38.549 --> 00:28:38.559 align:start position:0%
rental housing uh that they complain uh
 
00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
is being uh thwarted by municipal uh
 
00:28:44.789 --> 00:28:44.799 align:start position:0%
regulations i don't see any lack of
 
00:28:47.909 --> 00:28:47.919 align:start position:0%
interest in becoming a landlord
 
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:48.880 align:start position:0%

new hampshire community loan fund and by
 
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360 align:start position:0%

i practiced law in the real estate area
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%

in the legislature
 
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
on the commerce committee i'm currently
 
00:29:51.269 --> 00:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
in my position as the director of
 
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
resident owned communities those are
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
resident owned manufactured housing
 
00:29:58.230 --> 00:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
parks that are run by the residents that
 
00:29:59.350 --> 00:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
live there
 
00:30:02.310 --> 00:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
we work with 134 communities that
 
00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
represent over 8
 
00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
200 households and
 
00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
rsa 540 is not the only eviction statute
 
00:30:12.149 --> 00:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
i think elliot berry just referred to
 
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
this the manufactured housing eviction
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
statute is contained in 205 a
 
00:30:20.549 --> 00:30:20.559 align:start position:0%
and it also covers almost mirroring the
 
00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
same provisions cause causes for
 
00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
eviction non-payment of rent failure to
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
comply with local regulations disturbing
 
00:30:29.669 --> 00:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
the peace of other
 
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh residents and the failure to comply
 
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
with rules our only difference is also a
 
00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
park closure is the only exception to
 
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
the cause um
 
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
for the eviction and we have um done
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
evictions for all of the things that
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
have been named in this test of
 
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
testimony violation of rules repeatedly
 
00:30:51.909 --> 00:30:51.919 align:start position:0%
drug dealing in the community during my
 
00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
tenure at the resident on community
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
within those confines and we don't have
 
00:30:59.909 --> 00:30:59.919 align:start position:0%
the other good cause or business or
 
00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
economic uh reason um piece that is in
 
00:31:06.149 --> 00:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
540. so our manufactured housing statute
 
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
is a little more restrictive when it
 
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
comes to evictions it has been there for
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
50 years though and i would say it has
 
00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
worked every time we have needed needed
 
00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
it when somebody has to be
 
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
evicted i want to just reiterate what
 
00:31:22.389 --> 00:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
elliot just said in a time when rental
 
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
vacancies are almost non-existent the
 
00:31:27.669 --> 00:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
housing supply for purchase is less than
 
00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
a month if we no new homes came on the
 
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
market the supply would be completely
 
00:31:33.669 --> 00:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
exhausted in three weeks in the state of
 
00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that housing is really
 
00:31:38.789 --> 00:31:38.799 align:start position:0%
critical for all kinds of lifetime
 
00:31:41.509 --> 00:31:41.519 align:start position:0%
reasons as elliott was just saying
 
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
when and i think public policy warrants
 
00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
making housing more secure
 
00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:49.120 align:start position:0%
not less secure at this point
 
00:31:51.669 --> 00:31:51.679 align:start position:0%
more stable particularly when because of
 
00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
our new hampshire constitution that
 
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
burden is going to fall on your cities
 
00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
and towns if in fact people are homeless
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
because they can't find housing that's
 
00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
what our per um
 
00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.509 align:start position:0%
what our per um
our

00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
constitution provides so i i would i
 
00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
would go back to um justice lynn's
 
00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
marginal candidate that he talked about
 
00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:14.799 align:start position:0%
and all of those examples that he gave
 
00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
about you know conducting themselves
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
probably properly uh damage noise all of
 
00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
those those are already contained as
 
00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:24.559 align:start position:0%
cause in the statute and in my practice
 
00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
and in what i'm seeing in manufactured
 
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
housing those are working just fine so i
 
00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
would caution i i'm opposed to the
 
00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
passage of house bill 227 and i would i
 
00:32:36.549 --> 00:32:36.559 align:start position:0%
would caution the community to think of
 
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
not from a contractual standby but the
 
00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
broader public policy reasons to not
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
implement this at that time
 
00:32:45.669 --> 00:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and i'd be glad to
 
00:32:47.909 --> 00:32:47.919 align:start position:0%

00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
 
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:53.669 --> 00:33:53.679 align:start position:0%
we oppose this bill
 
00:33:53.679 --> 00:33:55.190 align:start position:0%
we oppose this bill
um

00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
any bill that potentially reverses a
 
00:33:59.350 --> 00:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
supreme court ruling really does need or
 
00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
i think bears a need for heightened
 
00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
level of scrutiny uh and for good reason
 
00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:06.389 align:start position:0%
level of scrutiny uh and for good reason
um

00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:08.069 --> 00:34:08.079 align:start position:0%
as we know this bill would allow most
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
landlords to utilize leases to evict a
 
00:34:12.069 --> 00:34:12.079 align:start position:0%
tenant upon the termination date of a
 
00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
lease with no cause beyond the fact that
 
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
that there's a date in that lease
 
00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
um we find this problematic on two
 
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
primary counts
 
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
first um this would give unilateral
 
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
control of an eviction to any landlord
 
00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
who utilizes a lease
 
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
in effective this gives a landlord
 
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
powers that were formerly only allocated
 
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
to a judge the power to evict is
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
in our opinion not to be taken lightly
 
00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:39.839 align:start position:0%
the power to put an individual a family
 
00:34:42.069 --> 00:34:42.079 align:start position:0%
a child out of their home
 
00:34:42.079 --> 00:34:43.349 align:start position:0%
a child out of their home
um

00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
needs to be wielded by an objective
 
00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
third party who can weigh the reasons
 
00:34:48.790 --> 00:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
and justifications for such a powerful
 
00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.149 align:start position:0%
and justifications for such a powerful
decision

00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:51.909 align:start position:0%
decision
um

00:34:51.909 --> 00:34:51.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
the second consideration that it feels
 
00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
we need to be considered is what at
 
00:34:56.950 --> 00:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
least means to both the landlord and a
 
00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:58.550 align:start position:0%
least means to both the landlord and a
tenant

00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
tenant
 
00:34:59.829 --> 00:34:59.839 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:35:01.589 --> 00:35:01.599 align:start position:0%
there are benefits and responsibilities
 
00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839 align:start position:0%
within the lease for both parties
 
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
um it's meant to protect a landlord
 
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
against a tenant who
 
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
negatively affects the
 
00:35:13.829 --> 00:35:13.839 align:start position:0%
um the development they live in it also
 
00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
allows the family
 
00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:17.270 align:start position:0%
allows the family
to

00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
within a certain set of behaviors allows
 
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:26.150 --> 00:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
for the resident the lease is a security
 
00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:27.190 align:start position:0%
for the resident the lease is a security
instrument

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
instrument
 
00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:29.240 align:start position:0%
it ensures that if certain behaviors are
 
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are fulfilled they
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
remain in control of an asset
 
00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
because truly a lease
 
00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
for for a person who's renting is an
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
asset whether they realize it or not and
 
00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
it's an important asset
 
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
a safe and secure home
 
00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
with a right to live there secured by a
 
00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:48.069 align:start position:0%
with a right to live there secured by a
lease

00:35:48.069 --> 00:35:48.079 align:start position:0%
lease
 
00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
the lease which
 
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
outlines acceptable behavior and
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable expectations is a powerful
 
00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
and a real asset to a family
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
allowing the landlord to strip a family
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
of this asset for really no good cause
 
00:36:01.589 --> 00:36:01.599 align:start position:0%
is not acceptable a good lease works
 
00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
both ways it's not just there to protect
 
00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
the landlord from a resident it's vice
 
00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.430 align:start position:0%
the landlord from a resident it's vice
versa

00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
versa
 
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
we have had to evict people for
 
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
drug possession
 
00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
for unauthorized people living there for
 
00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
smoking we have managed to to
 
00:36:17.829 --> 00:36:17.839 align:start position:0%
secure an eviction on every one of those
 
00:36:17.839 --> 00:36:18.870 align:start position:0%
secure an eviction on every one of those
causes

00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
causes
 
00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
um there are lease violations and if you
 
00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
do your job as a landlord you will you
 
00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
will be able to
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
evict a resident if indeed they've
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
broken their rules
 
00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
so should an eviction action become
 
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
necessary it absolutely needs to be
 
00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
adjudicated by a judge not unilaterally
 
00:36:37.109 --> 00:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
by one party or the other and this is
 
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
only exacerbated
 
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
as other speakers have mentioned today
 
00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
given our current housing situation in
 
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:36:48.069 --> 00:36:48.079 align:start position:0%
the ability to find a home is incredibly
 
00:36:50.390 --> 00:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
difficult in order and
 
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
and once you secure that home
 
00:36:54.069 --> 00:36:54.079 align:start position:0%
and you follow the rules by which you've
 
00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
agreed to and the landlord has agreed to
 
00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
again this leases is when it's put into
 
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
place it's it's in it is
 
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
to benefit both parties so as an
 
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
advocate um
 
00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
for people who rent housing and as a
 
00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:09.599 align:start position:0%
local landlord southwestern opposes
 
00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
house bill 227 i certainly can take any
 
00:37:13.589 --> 00:37:13.599 align:start position:0%
questions and i really appreciate your
 
00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
time today
 
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there
 
00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:23.109 --> 00:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony

manchester uh we faced multiple
difficulties

00:39:33.349 --> 00:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
difficulties
 
00:39:33.359 --> 00:39:34.550 align:start position:0%
difficulties
um

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
one of them being that in the house that
 
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
we were living in or renting
 
00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
um during the winter time uh
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
the the uh the the heat the heat went
 
00:39:46.079 --> 00:39:47.430 align:start position:0%
the the uh the the heat the heat went
off

00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
off
 
00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:48.550 align:start position:0%
off
um

00:39:48.550 --> 00:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:49.349 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:39:49.349 --> 00:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
we weren't able to
 
00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
the we we spoke to the landlord about
 
00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
the situation and
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
asked if he could you know fix it um
 
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
since it was winter and the landlord um
 
00:40:07.589 --> 00:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
you know didn't do that and so we had to
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
seek help outside of
 
00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
communicating with our landlord
 
00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
and so we actually got code involved and
 
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
code um came and
 
00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
checked out the place and
 
00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:21.990 align:start position:0%
checked out the place and
um

00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
and said yeah the heat's not working the
 
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
pipe that brings the heat to your unit
 
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
is broken
 
00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:30.390 align:start position:0%
is broken
and

00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
having that knowledge that our landlord
 
00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
still didn't
 
00:40:37.349 --> 00:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
still didn't fix the place up um didn't
 
00:40:39.190 --> 00:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
fix the heat
 
00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
which was crucial during the winter
 
00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:43.670 align:start position:0%
which was crucial during the winter
um

00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:43.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
i'm bringing this up because
 
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
i would say i'm a reasonable person and
 
00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
as a christian and
 
00:40:53.589 --> 00:40:53.599 align:start position:0%
a believer
 
00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
i think that fairness is something that
 
00:40:58.309 --> 00:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
we should all strive for in a uh
 
00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
as a communi uh as a in our community
 
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire
 
00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:03.270 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire
um

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
that means fairness for renters and
 
00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
landlords um i believe that right now
 
00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
with the soul of america
 
00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
at stake in
 
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
people um
 
00:41:18.069 --> 00:41:18.079 align:start position:0%
struggling to make ends meet
 
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
especially for uh renters
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
um communication is super important um
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
uh in a situation where you know a
 
00:41:28.319 --> 00:41:29.349 align:start position:0%
uh in a situation where you know a
renter

00:41:29.349 --> 00:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
renter
 
00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
may not you know have necessarily have
 
00:41:35.349 --> 00:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
no control over what you know a
 
00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:38.079 align:start position:0%
circumstance maybe they lost their job
 
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
or maybe their employer cut their um
 
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
hours that they're working
 
00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
i think it's it's always it's um by
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's important for to seek fairness
 
00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
in that situation
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
and give people a fair chance um
 
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
if the landlord wants i'm i'm gonna wrap
 
00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:58.230 align:start position:0%
if the landlord wants i'm i'm gonna wrap
up

00:41:58.230 --> 00:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
um if the landlord wants uh
 
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:04.079 align:start position:0%
the tenant to
 
00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:42:07.270 --> 00:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
get out or leave
 
00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
i think the
 
00:42:10.870 --> 00:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
tenants should at least have a ch um
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
a fair chance of finding a another place
 
00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
where in our situation we you know we we
 
00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:18.550 align:start position:0%
where in our situation we you know we we
left

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
left
 
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
not because we weren't able to pay our
 
00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:21.589 align:start position:0%
not because we weren't able to pay our
rent

00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
rent
 
00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
um we had to leave because it was unsafe
 
00:42:26.069 --> 00:42:26.079 align:start position:0%
for us um
 
00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
no heat
 
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
you know um
 
00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
is you know heat is a central thing so i
 
00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
think if you can give people fairness
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
um to stay housed and not be thrown in
 
00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
the streets
 
00:42:41.829 --> 00:42:41.839 align:start position:0%
and um with right now with our
 
00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
overwhelming uh population of
 
00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
homelessness um it would it would do us
 
00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
good to not add on to that
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%

00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
permitting me i realize that you've got
 
00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
a very busy day there was only one point
 
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
that was mentioned
 
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
by one of the witnesses that i think
 
00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
it's important to
 
00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
to address
 
00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
particularly for those members of the
 
00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
committee who are not lawyers the
 
00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
suggestion was made that because this
 
00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
legislation would overrule
 
00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
a supreme court decision that somehow
 
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
sort of some special there needs to be
 
00:43:48.550 --> 00:43:48.560 align:start position:0%
some special reason to do that um i i
 
00:43:50.309 --> 00:43:50.319 align:start position:0%
think the lawyers in the room will will
 
00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
understand that that is absolutely not
 
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
the case if
 
00:43:57.990 --> 00:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
if if if this were and a case before the
 
00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
supreme court or
 
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire and the question was
 
00:44:05.190 --> 00:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
should that decision uh the the aimco
 
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
decision be overruled yes it's very true
 
00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
that the the doctrine of starry decisis
 
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
would require that that there be some
 
00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
special reason not just that the case
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
was was wrongly decided but some special
 
00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
reason to overrule it but that
 
00:44:23.109 --> 00:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
absolutely does not apply
 
00:44:25.030 --> 00:44:25.040 align:start position:0%
to you as a legislator you are the
 
00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
representative of the people
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
there's no special rule that applies you
 
00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
just have to decide what is the right
 
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
decision to make and that's really all i
 
00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
have that's all i have to say thank you
 
00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:39.040 align:start position:0%

00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
00:44:50.309 --> 00:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
and with that i'm going to close the
 
00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
hearing on representative smith had a
 
00:44:55.349 --> 00:44:55.359 align:start position:0%

00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
question um
 
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
for represented
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
representative lynn on i'm sorry
 
00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
mr chairman i know your time is sure
 
00:45:11.109 --> 00:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
but does um representative lin believe
 
00:45:11.119 --> 00:45:12.309 align:start position:0%
but does um representative lin believe
that

00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:45:12.319 --> 00:45:13.910 align:start position:0%
that
in

00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:45:15.349 --> 00:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire house of
 
00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
representatives it is only lawyers who
 
00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
can understand
 
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
the implications of the relationship
 
00:45:24.550 --> 00:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
between law
 
00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
and actions of the judicial branch
 
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
no i don't but i do think that it's that
 
00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
lawyers are are apt to be
 
00:45:34.150 --> 00:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
more familiar with the doctrine of
 
00:45:36.069 --> 00:45:36.079 align:start position:0%
starry decisis than
 
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
than non-lawyers i i'm i'm i
 
00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
you know i've uh as a non-lawyer if uh
 
00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
if if you you may you may very well be
 
00:45:47.990 --> 00:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
aware of that but i suspect that there
 
00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
may be many not many non-lawyers who are
 
00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:51.910 align:start position:0%
may be many not many non-lawyers who are
not

00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question thank you
 
00:45:59.109 --> 00:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
for your response representative lynn
 
00:46:01.109 --> 00:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
and with that i will close the hearing
 
00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
on house bill 227 and
 
00:46:07.349 --> 00:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
i'm going to give the clerk a couple of
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
which he has asked me to do what's next
 
00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:15.839 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
i note on house bill 160 that there are
 
00:46:29.750 --> 00:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
eight people who have signed up to speak
 
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
so and we are behind we are behind right
 
00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
now and so i am going to ask my
 
00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
people if they would
 
00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
keep their
 
00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
testimony concise and to the point
 
00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:45.839 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of that bill is
 
00:46:48.069 --> 00:46:48.079 align:start position:0%
representative conley
 
00:46:50.309 --> 00:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
and i don't see representative conley
 
00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
having signed up
 
00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
and but i see that representative conley
 
00:46:59.270 --> 00:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
is on the attendee list so i will
 
00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
i will call upon representative conley
 
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:04.720 align:start position:0%

00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
this bill would require advance notice
 
00:47:23.109 --> 00:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
for rent increases that exceed five
 
00:47:23.119 --> 00:47:25.030 align:start position:0%
for rent increases that exceed five
percent

00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
as many on this committee know and have
 
00:47:29.589 --> 00:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
already heard this morning uh
 
00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
we have a real housing crisis in the
 
00:47:31.359 --> 00:47:32.470 align:start position:0%
we have a real housing crisis in the
state

00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:34.390 align:start position:0%
state
um

00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
and as we heard uh the median cost of a
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
two bedroom apartment now exceeds 1400 a
 
00:47:41.510 --> 00:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
month that uh increased by five percent
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
over 2019 despite the covet 19 pandemic
 
00:47:49.109 --> 00:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
um the vacancy rates uh have remained
 
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
quite low
 
00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:51.349 align:start position:0%
quite low
um

00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
despite the pandemic
 
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
you know over the last five years
 
00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh rents in stratford county where i
 
00:47:59.910 --> 00:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
live have grown by 26 percent
 
00:48:02.069 --> 00:48:02.079 align:start position:0%
uh same in hillsborough it's even higher
 
00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
in rockingham 28
 
00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
double-digit increases in sullivan
 
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
grafton coast counties
 
00:48:08.480 --> 00:48:09.510 align:start position:0%
grafton coast counties
um

00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
so we know that there's a real
 
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
affordability challenge in the state
 
00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:16.150 align:start position:0%
affordability challenge in the state
um

00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:17.829 --> 00:48:17.839 align:start position:0%
and this is just this is not sort of an
 
00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
abstract data set you know we know we
 
00:48:21.910 --> 00:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
heard earlier this year the governor's
 
00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:23.030 align:start position:0%
heard earlier this year the governor's
office

00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh for emergency relief and recovery go
 
00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
for heard testimony just highlighting
 
00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
the hardships faced by our state's
 
00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:31.030 align:start position:0%
the hardships faced by our state's
tenants

00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
tenants
 
00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
we heard from a prominent economist that
 
00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
half of renters in the state are paying
 
00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
more than 30 percent of their income for
 
00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:38.470 align:start position:0%
more than 30 percent of their income for
rent

00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
rent
 
00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
so in this era of steadily rising rents
 
00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh very low vacancy
 
00:48:45.270 --> 00:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
this bill is one key objective it's just
 
00:48:47.430 --> 00:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
to give renters sufficient time to find
 
00:48:49.589 --> 00:48:49.599 align:start position:0%
replacement housing in the event that
 
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
their existing rental
 
00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
is set to increase beyond what they can
 
00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
afford when their lease ends
 
00:48:59.190 --> 00:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
so we know the current law gives 30 days
 
00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
or requires 30 days notice for these
 
00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
higher rents many landlords in the state
 
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
voluntarily give additional time they
 
00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
let their tenants know
 
00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
with much more notice but not all of
 
00:49:09.599 --> 00:49:11.270 align:start position:0%
with much more notice but not all of
them

00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
so 30 days you know in this low vacancy
 
00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.750 align:start position:0%
so 30 days you know in this low vacancy
market

00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
market
 
00:49:17.990 --> 00:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
where it's hard to find uh replacement
 
00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
housing just isn't enough time
 
00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh it used to be as many of us can
 
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
recall you know you if you're priced out
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
of one unit or you're you want to move
 
00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
for some reason you can just look around
 
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
the corner look elsewhere in your
 
00:49:32.309 --> 00:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
community but that's not the case
 
00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
anymore it's not hard to imagine you
 
00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
know someone forced to move due to you
 
00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
know rising rent
 
00:49:40.069 --> 00:49:40.079 align:start position:0%
having to change jobs
 
00:49:41.829 --> 00:49:41.839 align:start position:0%
take their kids out of school find new
 
00:49:44.069 --> 00:49:44.079 align:start position:0%
child care
 
00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
all these things
 
00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
and it's a direct link between the high
 
00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
cost of housing in new hampshire and the
 
00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
worsening homelessness crisis that we're
 
00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:52.640 align:start position:0%
seeing playing out in our cities
 
00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
and communities
 
00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:56.000 align:start position:0%
around the state including on the
 
00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.750 align:start position:0%
around the state including on the
seacoast

00:49:57.750 --> 00:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
seacoast
 
00:49:59.190 --> 00:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
members of this committee might remember
 
00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
an earlier version
 
00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
last year passed
 
00:50:05.829 --> 00:50:05.839 align:start position:0%
the committee and the house with
 
00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support it died in the senate
 
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
in the covid shortened session
 
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
it's worth making very clear that this
 
00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
bill would not in any way restrict how
 
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
much any landlord could charge any
 
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
tenant for rent at any time
 
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
this is strictly about requiring notice
 
00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
for higher rents and only rents that
 
00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
exceed a certain threshold
 
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
so i asked this committee to recommend
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
passage to small but important
 
00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:32.069 align:start position:0%
passage to small but important
protection

00:50:32.069 --> 00:50:32.079 align:start position:0%
protection
 
00:50:34.790 --> 00:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
for you know new hampshire renters so
 
00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
that i'm happy to take any questions
 
00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative are there any
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:48.390 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
today

00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:50.309 --> 00:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:50:53.589 --> 00:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
yes i do yeah
 
00:50:55.109 --> 00:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative connolly for
 
00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question um i'm looking at
 
00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
lines um 21 to 25 on page
 
00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:01.829 align:start position:0%
lines um 21 to 25 on page
one

00:51:01.829 --> 00:51:01.839 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:51:04.549 --> 00:51:04.559 align:start position:0%
um page one it says like if a landlord
 
00:51:06.549 --> 00:51:06.559 align:start position:0%
increases more than one notice or issues
 
00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:08.160 align:start position:0%
more than one dose of rent increase in a
 
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
six day period um basically says that
 
00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:11.910 align:start position:0%
six day period um basically says that
like

00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
um it
 
00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
after the it's after the last six it's
 
00:51:18.549 --> 00:51:18.559 align:start position:0%
60 days after the last notice of rent
 
00:51:18.559 --> 00:51:19.670 align:start position:0%
60 days after the last notice of rent
increase

00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
increase
 
00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
um i guess my question is could a
 
00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
landlord issue a notice of rent increase
 
00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
for five days like every day for five
 
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
days of like five percent and that still
 
00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
works under this
 
00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:33.670 align:start position:0%
works under this
bill

00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:51:36.790 --> 00:51:36.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh the intent
 
00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
of that is to
 
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
prevent um
 
00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
a landlord from using smaller increment
 
00:51:47.589 --> 00:51:47.599 align:start position:0%
increases over over an extended period
 
00:51:50.309 --> 00:51:50.319 align:start position:0%
to sort of bypass the limits outlined in
 
00:51:51.190 --> 00:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:54.069 align:start position:0%
the bill
um

00:51:54.069 --> 00:51:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:56.549 --> 00:51:56.559 align:start position:0%
i i don't believe the scenario you
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
describe would be possible under the
 
00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
under the the terms of this bill that's
 
00:52:08.230 --> 00:52:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:10.240 align:start position:0%
are you all set representative alexander
 
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for
 
00:52:20.230 --> 00:52:20.240 align:start position:0%
representative connolly
 
00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
sing none thank you again thank you for
 
00:52:24.309 --> 00:52:24.319 align:start position:0%

the next person to testify will be nick
 
00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:31.190 align:start position:0%
the next person to testify will be nick
norman

00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
there we go i found it quickly this time
 
00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much for giving me the
 
00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak okay thank you very
 
00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:38.710 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak okay thank you very
much

00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
and um so same introduction before
 
00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:52:46.710 --> 00:52:46.720 align:start position:0%
we would be against this bill i'm
 
00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
talking about property owners and
 
00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.069 align:start position:0%
talking about property owners and
landlords

00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
landlords
 
00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:52.720 align:start position:0%
anytime that you are controlling
 
00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:54.230 align:start position:0%
anytime that you are controlling
rents

00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
rents
 
00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
then you're starting rent control
 
00:52:59.589 --> 00:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
this is the beginnings
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
beginnings of rent control rent control
 
00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
is a failed policy proven over and over
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
again across the entire country
 
00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
it leads to
 
00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
warped rental markets in terms of
 
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
amounts of rent
 
00:53:16.309 --> 00:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh un
 
00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh maintained properties just many many
 
00:53:21.349 --> 00:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
problems so
 
00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
this is although you may think it's
 
00:53:26.390 --> 00:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
small it's the camel's nose and the tent
 
00:53:28.549 --> 00:53:28.559 align:start position:0%
of rent control and definitely should be
 
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
there are many situations where
 
00:53:36.790 --> 00:53:36.800 align:start position:0%
landlords are faced with enormous
 
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
increases in expenses
 
00:53:41.829 --> 00:53:41.839 align:start position:0%
it might be new heating systems new
 
00:53:44.069 --> 00:53:44.079 align:start position:0%
major systems roofs we've had some
 
00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
landlords that have had 20 increases on
 
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
property taxes
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh how landlords recoup those expenses
 
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
really ought to be up to
 
00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
the landlord
 
00:53:56.950 --> 00:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
there's a fundamental flaw with the way
 
00:53:59.589 --> 00:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
that the bill is designed
 
00:53:59.599 --> 00:54:00.549 align:start position:0%
that the bill is designed
and

00:54:00.549 --> 00:54:00.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:54:02.710 --> 00:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
what happens in our rental market now is
 
00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
that tenants are required to give a
 
00:54:06.549 --> 00:54:06.559 align:start position:0%
30-day notice whenever they want to
 
00:54:06.559 --> 00:54:08.630 align:start position:0%
30-day notice whenever they want to
leave

00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
leave
 
00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
so if tenants are giving 30-day notices
 
00:54:14.309 --> 00:54:14.319 align:start position:0%
but the landlord is giving 60-day notice
 
00:54:17.589 --> 00:54:17.599 align:start position:0%
of rent increase and someone says okay i
 
00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
want to take this extra time to look for
 
00:54:20.950 --> 00:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
something on the market
 
00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
they're going to find a very limited
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
supply on the market that's 60 days out
 
00:54:28.069 --> 00:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
an extremely limited supply on the
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
market is 90 days out what that's going
 
00:54:31.589 --> 00:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
is create waiting lists and extra demand
 
00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
for apartments
 
00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:37.589 align:start position:0%
for apartments
and

00:54:37.589 --> 00:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:54:41.829 --> 00:54:41.839 align:start position:0%
falsely yet again increase the demand
 
00:54:41.839 --> 00:54:42.870 align:start position:0%
falsely yet again increase the demand
for

00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:54:44.950 --> 00:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
rental housing without increasing the
 
00:54:47.109 --> 00:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
supply and that's going to drive up
 
00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
rents so there's an extremely
 
00:54:51.109 --> 00:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
fundamental flaw with the way that the
 
00:54:53.349 --> 00:54:53.359 align:start position:0%
bill is written is going to actually
 
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
cause a worsening of the
 
00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.190 align:start position:0%
cause a worsening of the
housing

00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
housing
 
00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:00.070 align:start position:0%
affordable housing issue
 
00:55:00.070 --> 00:55:02.309 align:start position:0%
affordable housing issue
[Music]

00:55:02.309 --> 00:55:02.319 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:55:04.549 --> 00:55:04.559 align:start position:0%
and this goal can be entirely
 
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
accomplished by existing contract law
 
00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
tenants and landlords can make
 
00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
agreements about rent increases
 
00:55:13.589 --> 00:55:13.599 align:start position:0%
tenants can can ask three months before
 
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
the end of the lease about what the the
 
00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
new rent is going to be all of this can
 
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
be worked out by mutual agreement
 
00:55:22.309 --> 00:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
there's no need for a law
 
00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:24.640 align:start position:0%
we would please recommend that this be
 
00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:25.670 align:start position:0%
we would please recommend that this be
killed

00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
killed
 
00:55:28.790 --> 00:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
and voted inexpedient to legislate
 
00:55:31.109 --> 00:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
i am very much available for questions
 
00:55:32.790 --> 00:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
and would very welcome questions thank
 
00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
00:55:38.710 --> 00:55:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
hey oh yes representative maclean
 
00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
yeah um just a quick question um given
 
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
given the the limitations in the housing
 
00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
market right now
 
00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:51.190 align:start position:0%
market right now
um

00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:51.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
if the bill were amended to say that
 
00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
that 60-day relationship had to be both
 
00:55:57.750 --> 00:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
sides you know not just from the
 
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
landlord but also from the tenant would
 
00:56:03.190 --> 00:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
that equilibrate things um or would you
 
00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
see that as problematic as well
 
00:56:08.069 --> 00:56:08.079 align:start position:0%
well it would make it more equal
 
00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
it would be better i i think it's still
 
00:56:13.589 --> 00:56:13.599 align:start position:0%
problematic to be legislating things
 
00:56:14.789 --> 00:56:14.799 align:start position:0%
like this
 
00:56:16.789 --> 00:56:16.799 align:start position:0%
we have an essential problem with
 
00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
affordable housing that's definitely a
 
00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
problem i agree that's a problem but
 
00:56:24.549 --> 00:56:24.559 align:start position:0%
that problem is created by
 
00:56:24.559 --> 00:56:26.630 align:start position:0%
that problem is created by
legislation

00:56:26.630 --> 00:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:56:28.789 --> 00:56:28.799 align:start position:0%
anytime there's an additional regulation
 
00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
an additional restriction ultimately
 
00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
that furthers
 
00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:34.470 align:start position:0%
that furthers
the

00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:34.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:56:37.030 --> 00:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
pushing up rents rental supply down and
 
00:56:38.549 --> 00:56:38.559 align:start position:0%
continues to worsen the housing
 
00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:40.559 align:start position:0%
affordability problem
 
00:56:43.109 --> 00:56:43.119 align:start position:0%
so yeah it'd be a little bit better but
 
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:55.829 align:start position:0%
 
there

00:56:55.829 --> 00:56:55.839 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:56:57.349 --> 00:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair thank you
 
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
very much mr norman you mentioned the
 
00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
replacing the heating system and your
 
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:04.640 align:start position:0%
email you mentioned uh
 
00:57:08.230 --> 00:57:08.240 align:start position:0%
other capital expenses um
 
00:57:10.789 --> 00:57:10.799 align:start position:0%
why is it unreasonably expect landlords
 
00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
to do what other businesses do and you
 
00:57:15.589 --> 00:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
know maintain a capital budget you know
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
set money aside
 
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
for possible capital expenses especially
 
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
if you're a large landlord even though
 
00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
you don't know when the eating system
 
00:57:25.270 --> 00:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
one building might fail it's fairly
 
00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:28.480 align:start position:0%
predictable over time so why not
 
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
expect landlords to deal with capital
 
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
expenses the way
 
00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:33.839 align:start position:0%
all other businesses do rather than just
 
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
allowing them to you know
 
00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
raise the price
 
00:57:40.789 --> 00:57:40.799 align:start position:0%
raise the price with with no notice um
 
00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
when their customers uh can't easily
 
00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
move to another apartment so
 
00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:46.150 align:start position:0%
move to another apartment so
um

00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
and i understand the part of the the tax
 
00:57:50.309 --> 00:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
increases um even though tax rates don't
 
00:57:52.069 --> 00:57:52.079 align:start position:0%
go up pretty particularly sometimes the
 
00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
assessments go up so why
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
why can't landlords do capital managers
 
00:57:57.990 --> 00:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
handle them the same way every other
 
00:57:59.270 --> 00:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
business does
 
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:03.030 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
representative

00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:58:05.910 --> 00:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
so it's just not always possible we do
 
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
the best that we can you'd be surprised
 
00:58:11.510 --> 00:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
the margins on real estate are much
 
00:58:13.430 --> 00:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
smaller than you realize
 
00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:14.870 align:start position:0%
smaller than you realize
and

00:58:14.870 --> 00:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:15.829 align:start position:0%
and
it's

00:58:15.829 --> 00:58:15.839 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:58:19.910 --> 00:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's not that simple is your answer
 
00:58:23.109 --> 00:58:23.119 align:start position:0%
if we can yeah we're building a capital
 
00:58:23.119 --> 00:58:24.390 align:start position:0%
if we can yeah we're building a capital
reserve

00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
reserve
 
00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
and that could be replaced over time
 
00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
but it's just many times not possible
 
00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
the amount of rent versus the amount of
 
00:58:35.349 --> 00:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
expenses and the increased regulation
 
00:58:37.750 --> 00:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
that costs more and more money is making
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
thank you a follow-up mr chair if you
 
00:58:45.829 --> 00:58:45.839 align:start position:0%
yeah although i don't know
 
00:58:47.589 --> 00:58:47.599 align:start position:0%
um what is
 
00:58:47.599 --> 00:58:49.030 align:start position:0%
um what is
and

00:58:49.030 --> 00:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:49.349 align:start position:0%
and
guess like

00:58:49.349 --> 00:58:49.359 align:start position:0%
guess like
 
00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
not an attorney so i'm asking a question
 
00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
i don't really know the answer to but
 
00:58:54.789 --> 00:58:54.799 align:start position:0%
what how does this work in the
 
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
commercial real estate market where the
 
00:58:58.710 --> 00:58:58.720 align:start position:0%
power differential between the tenants
 
00:58:59.829 --> 00:58:59.839 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
landlord is uh you know much less said
 
00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
um so how does this how does how is this
 
00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
issue resolved in um in commercial
 
00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:08.390 align:start position:0%
issue resolved in um in commercial
leases

00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
leases
 
00:59:09.349 --> 00:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
which are very different from
 
00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
residential leases i understand
 
00:59:14.309 --> 00:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
right uh thank you for again for the
 
00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:16.799 align:start position:0%
question i'm going to have to say that i
 
00:59:18.549 --> 00:59:18.559 align:start position:0%
am not an expert in commercial real
 
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
estate well meaning
 
00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
all of my
 
00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
real estate is residential
 
00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
i would say probably 95 or more of the
 
00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
contacts in my large network that i deal
 
00:59:33.589 --> 00:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
with with landlords are all residential
 
00:59:36.069 --> 00:59:36.079 align:start position:0%
apartments so i could not give you a
 
00:59:38.630 --> 00:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
good answer to that question all right
 
00:59:40.470 --> 00:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
oh thanks that's fine
 
00:59:43.349 --> 00:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:45.829 --> 00:59:45.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman so my quick
 
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
question is does this bill even pertain
 
00:59:51.349 --> 00:59:51.359 align:start position:0%
to commercial real estate
 
00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
um i thought
 
00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
it was for just for residential
 
00:59:59.510 --> 00:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm new at this so bear with me
 
01:00:02.470 --> 01:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh line four it says this section shall
 
01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
apply to all residential rental property
 
01:00:07.829 --> 01:00:07.839 align:start position:0%
so this doesn't even apply to commercial
 
01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
is that correct that's the way i would
 
01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
understand it exactly line four says
 
01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
specifically residential property except
 
01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:16.640 align:start position:0%
non-restricted and non-restricted is
 
01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:17.910 align:start position:0%
non-restricted and non-restricted is
residential

01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
residential
 
01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
a small
 
01:00:22.069 --> 01:00:22.079 align:start position:0%
subclass of residential
 
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:24.000 align:start position:0%

speak in support of house bill 160 this
 
01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
morning and let you know that large
 
01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:34.559 align:start position:0%
increases to rent
 
01:01:37.829 --> 01:01:37.839 align:start position:0%
can and has caused
 
01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
in the past people to become homeless
 
01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
i testified
 
01:01:44.950 --> 01:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
regarding this bill last year when you
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
were hearing it and shared a story which
 
01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
i will just very briefly summarize for
 
01:01:50.069 --> 01:01:50.079 align:start position:0%
you today
 
01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:53.040 align:start position:0%
we had a 70 year old resident come to us
 
01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:54.309 align:start position:0%
we had a 70 year old resident come to us
um

01:01:54.309 --> 01:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:56.069 --> 01:01:56.079 align:start position:0%
who was living on his social security
 
01:01:58.230 --> 01:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
payments he was living in an apartment
 
01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
that uh he was paying 770 for rent uh
 
01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
there was a change in management the
 
01:02:09.190 --> 01:02:09.200 align:start position:0%
rent went up to 1 595
 
01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:02:14.069 --> 01:02:14.079 align:start position:0%
he gave his notice to property manager
 
01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
but there was a change in staffing and a
 
01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
miscommunication and so his
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
um notice
 
01:02:24.390 --> 01:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
was not received by the new company and
 
01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
therefore on their records he owed this
 
01:02:28.789 --> 01:02:28.799 align:start position:0%
even though he tried to leave because he
 
01:02:30.069 --> 01:02:30.079 align:start position:0%
couldn't afford it
 
01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
he was being held accountable for this
 
01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
new rent of almost 1600 a month which
 
01:02:37.829 --> 01:02:37.839 align:start position:0%
then prevented him from
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
um applying for and getting a new
 
01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
apartment so it's a little bit of a
 
01:02:43.589 --> 01:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
complicated situation but the bottom
 
01:02:47.349 --> 01:02:47.359 align:start position:0%
line is large rental increases
 
01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
where people do not have enough time to
 
01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:51.190 align:start position:0%
where people do not have enough time to
[Applause]

01:02:51.190 --> 01:02:51.200 align:start position:0%
[Applause]
 
01:02:53.589 --> 01:02:53.599 align:start position:0%
find a new place to live can cause
 
01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
people to become homeless
 
01:02:57.430 --> 01:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
as one of the largest shelters in the
 
01:02:59.030 --> 01:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
state i can tell you
 
01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:00.390 align:start position:0%
state i can tell you
that

01:03:00.390 --> 01:03:00.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
we serve people who have experienced a
 
01:03:04.549 --> 01:03:04.559 align:start position:0%
lot of different
 
01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
challenges i won't reiterate what's
 
01:03:09.030 --> 01:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
already been spoken about the state of
 
01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:09.829 align:start position:0%
already been spoken about the state of
the

01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:03:12.309 --> 01:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
um housing market but i will say that
 
01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
the lack of affordable housing
 
01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
is one of the greatest challenges that
 
01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:19.839 align:start position:0%
we face in helping people exit our
 
01:03:19.839 --> 01:03:21.510 align:start position:0%
we face in helping people exit our
shelter

01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
shelter
 
01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
our lengths of stay how long people stay
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
in our shelter has been steadily
 
01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
increasing over the past five years and
 
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
i really believe a part of that is the
 
01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
fact that there's just so few places for
 
01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
people to go so once people are are
 
01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.029 align:start position:0%
people to go so once people are are
housed

01:03:35.029 --> 01:03:35.039 align:start position:0%
housed
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
i think it's critically important that
 
01:03:38.069 --> 01:03:38.079 align:start position:0%
we do everything we can to keep them
 
01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
stably housed
 
01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
and having opportunities and time to
 
01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
move should a rent increase happen
 
01:03:47.589 --> 01:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
um is just one factor i think that would
 
01:03:49.029 --> 01:03:49.039 align:start position:0%
would help so
 
01:03:51.109 --> 01:03:51.119 align:start position:0%
again i appreciate your time this
 
01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
morning and i'd be happy to answer any
 
01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have
 
01:03:59.109 --> 01:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
great thank you
 
01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
thank you again mr chairman i i speak in
 
01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
support of uh hb 160. just um i'll be as
 
01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
brief as i can
 
01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
number one
 
01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
it's important to note the number of
 
01:04:25.109 --> 01:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
exceptions in the coverage of the bill
 
01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
so that small landlords are not affected
 
01:04:31.589 --> 01:04:31.599 align:start position:0%
but more fundamentally if you are a rep
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
if you're renting the a fourteen hundred
 
01:04:36.309 --> 01:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
and thirteen dollar a month two bedroom
 
01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
apartment the statewide median
 
01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:42.640 align:start position:0%
you can increase your rent 70
 
01:04:43.829 --> 01:04:43.839 align:start position:0%
a month
 
01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
and not be affected by this bill
 
01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
say you're lucky you're you know you
 
01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
found a place for a thousand dollars a
 
01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:51.430 align:start position:0%
found a place for a thousand dollars a
month

01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
month
 
01:04:54.230 --> 01:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
because a five percent increase which is
 
01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
a threshold where the bill kicks in you
 
01:04:59.670 --> 01:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
can still have to eat a 50
 
01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
a 50 a month rent increase
 
01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh and the bill has no effect whatsoever
 
01:05:09.589 --> 01:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
to call this rent control
 
01:05:12.390 --> 01:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry but that's absolute nonsense
 
01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:15.839 align:start position:0%
but vermont by the way requires a 60 to
 
01:05:18.950 --> 01:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
a 60-day notice for all rent increases
 
01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
maine 45-day notice for all rent
 
01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
increases the landlord can rent the
 
01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:28.640 align:start position:0%
raise the rent as much as he or she
 
01:05:32.069 --> 01:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
wants and the only effect is that of
 
01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
this bill is that you may have to give
 
01:05:38.069 --> 01:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
up to 60 days at two months notice
 
01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's asking very much
 
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
and if they're worried about a rent
 
01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
control bill i'm sure they'll be back
 
01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
big time
 
01:05:48.870 --> 01:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh to oppose the rent control bill and
 
01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
quite frankly i can't imagine that you
 
01:05:53.510 --> 01:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
all would pass it
 
01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:55.670 align:start position:0%
all would pass it
um

01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:58.630 --> 01:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
i think one other thing in when you get
 
01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
into the issue of repairs
 
01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
right you may have to make some capital
 
01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
improvements guess what you don't just
 
01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:07.039 align:start position:0%
go into your bank account and take the
 
01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
money to do that you go to the bank and
 
01:06:11.510 --> 01:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
you figure out some financing for the
 
01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
repairs and as uh
 
01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
paul stewart pointed out in his letter
 
01:06:17.349 --> 01:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
in support of
 
01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
160 the very large landlord
 
01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
you're gonna you're gonna arrange your
 
01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:23.670 align:start position:0%
you're gonna you're gonna arrange your
financing

01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
financing
 
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
in a period that will take 60 days
 
01:06:29.589 --> 01:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
there's no problem in building in a
 
01:06:31.589 --> 01:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
60-day period
 
01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
while you're negotiating your financing
 
01:06:37.510 --> 01:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
for the you know for the rehabilitation
 
01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
this is just a simple bill to give
 
01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
people the maximum opportunity possible
 
01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
to find a
 
01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
replacement housing uh in a very very
 
01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
tight market
 
01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
um so i urge you to pass the bill i
 
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
promised i would be briefed and this is
 
01:06:56.309 --> 01:06:56.319 align:start position:0%
briefer than i ever am thank you and
 
01:06:58.390 --> 01:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
it's much appreciated so is there any
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%

today thank you very much next person to

01:07:14.390 --> 01:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
hello can everyone hear me
 
01:07:15.589 --> 01:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
we can
 
01:07:16.789 --> 01:07:16.799 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:07:18.789 --> 01:07:18.799 align:start position:0%
my name is chris norwood and i'm the
 
01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
public policy chair for 2021 for the new
 
01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire association of realtors i
 
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
represent some 7 000 members
 
01:07:29.829 --> 01:07:29.839 align:start position:0%
and we are opposed to house bill 160 as
 
01:07:29.839 --> 01:07:30.950 align:start position:0%
and we are opposed to house bill 160 as
drafted

01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
drafted
 
01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
i do want to reference representative
 
01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
horrigan's question about commercial
 
01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
tenancies and while this is a
 
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
residential bill
 
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
i think that representative horgan's
 
01:07:42.230 --> 01:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
question does reference what we feel is
 
01:07:44.230 --> 01:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
the remedies provided to landlords and
 
01:07:46.390 --> 01:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
tenants right now are to sign a
 
01:07:48.069 --> 01:07:48.079 align:start position:0%
longer-term lease
 
01:07:51.190 --> 01:07:51.200 align:start position:0%
that protects both landlords and tenants
 
01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
by fixing their costs and their income
 
01:07:55.109 --> 01:07:55.119 align:start position:0%
stream and that's what currently takes
 
01:07:57.109 --> 01:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
place in the commercial market and it's
 
01:07:58.710 --> 01:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
by and large what i predominantly
 
01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
practice uh in our business
 
01:08:04.069 --> 01:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
we recognize that there's vacancy
 
01:08:04.079 --> 01:08:05.430 align:start position:0%
we recognize that there's vacancy
challenges

01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
challenges
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
and cost of rental we do feel that the
 
01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:08.950 align:start position:0%
and cost of rental we do feel that the
solution

01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
solution
 
01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
is increase in inventory
 
01:08:13.109 --> 01:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
not to
 
01:08:17.749 --> 01:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
provide measures such as house bill 160.
 
01:08:19.590 --> 01:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
increasing cost liability and
 
01:08:21.829 --> 01:08:21.839 align:start position:0%
regulations we feel will lead to
 
01:08:25.269 --> 01:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
consolidation whereby the mom and pop
 
01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
property owners will leave and
 
01:08:30.789 --> 01:08:30.799 align:start position:0%
consolidation will take place while with
 
01:08:34.149 --> 01:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
larger landlords acquiring more property
 
01:08:36.709 --> 01:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
thereby limiting competition
 
01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
we do not think that that helps tenants
 
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh other folks have talked about uh
 
01:08:44.789 --> 01:08:44.799 align:start position:0%
property owners not being able to
 
01:08:47.910 --> 01:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
accurately predict their expenses um
 
01:08:50.149 --> 01:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
there's there's other expenses in here
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
that change sometimes utility costs are
 
01:08:54.789 --> 01:08:54.799 align:start position:0%
included within rent so not just the
 
01:08:54.799 --> 01:08:56.070 align:start position:0%
included within rent so not just the
capital

01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
capital
 
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
costs of putting in a new boiler let's
 
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
say but the actual fuel costs are
 
01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
included in the rent
 
01:09:05.189 --> 01:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
um so in the end i'll just try and be
 
01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
brief we feel that the uh the bigger
 
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
answer to the rent problem is simple we
 
01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
think we need more apartments we need to
 
01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
make housing more available uh we do not
 
01:09:18.709 --> 01:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
think that this is the solution we think
 
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
that this um will create more
 
01:09:23.349 --> 01:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
consolidation and we do think that there
 
01:09:25.749 --> 01:09:25.759 align:start position:0%
are remedies presently available which
 
01:09:27.189 --> 01:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
again are
 
01:09:29.829 --> 01:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
locking in longer term leases for both
 
01:09:29.839 --> 01:09:30.950 align:start position:0%
locking in longer term leases for both
parties

01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
parties
 
01:09:33.749 --> 01:09:33.759 align:start position:0%
so we would appreciate you to itl
 
01:09:35.829 --> 01:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
hb 160.
 
01:09:38.229 --> 01:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
 
01:09:43.030 --> 01:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
seeing them thank you
 
01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:51.910 --> 01:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:53.430 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
i will be brief i will not go through my
 
01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh introduction again
 
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
you're welcome except to remind folks
 
01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
that we do own operate manage and
 
01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
maintain over 500 units of housing in
 
01:10:07.110 --> 01:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
southwestern new hampshire as a landlord
 
01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
we are in support of this bill
 
01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:10.790 align:start position:0%
we are in support of this bill
um

01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:13.990 --> 01:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
a 60 to 90 day notice for five and eight
 
01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
percent rent increases is reasonable
 
01:10:19.189 --> 01:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
certainly fair in this housing market uh
 
01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
speaking as both a landlord as well as
 
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
an advocate uh the effect of such an
 
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
increase is exponentially larger for any
 
01:10:26.709 --> 01:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
individual family that lives paycheck to
 
01:10:26.719 --> 01:10:27.990 align:start position:0%
individual family that lives paycheck to
paycheck

01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
paycheck
 
01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.030 align:start position:0%
paycheck
um

01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
proper notice is a term widely used and
 
01:10:33.669 --> 01:10:33.679 align:start position:0%
respected in this industry in rental
 
01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
housing industry
 
01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
given our housing market this sort of
 
01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
minimal tenant protection we're not
 
01:10:40.310 --> 01:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
saying they can't do a five or an eight
 
01:10:41.830 --> 01:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
percent increases they have to wait an
 
01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
extra 30 or 60 days to allow the family
 
01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
or the household to either either find
 
01:10:48.630 --> 01:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
another place which is a
 
01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
a high bar or rearrange financing so
 
01:10:52.950 --> 01:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
they can they can they can deal with the
 
01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
with the rent increase
 
01:10:57.030 --> 01:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
proper notice
 
01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
from large increases in housing costs
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
appear prudent
 
01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
equitable proper so we are in support of
 
01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
160 thank you very much
 
01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
any questions for mr tebow
 
01:11:13.189 --> 01:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
again thank you for your testimony today
 
01:11:14.390 --> 01:11:14.400 align:start position:0%
we have three more people who have
 
01:11:16.709 --> 01:11:16.719 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak all uh indicating
 
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
that they're in support of the
 
01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:21.430 align:start position:0%
that they're in support of the
legislation

01:11:21.430 --> 01:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
and hopefully they can be brief the
 
01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:31.189 --> 01:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
yes thank you so much for having me my
 
01:11:32.709 --> 01:11:32.719 align:start position:0%
name is harrison kansler i'm the
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
executive director of the mount
 
01:11:36.229 --> 01:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
washington valley housing coalition
 
01:11:39.189 --> 01:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
we are in support of this bill
 
01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
i several of my points have already been
 
01:11:43.110 --> 01:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
brought up so i will go straight to the
 
01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
economic situation in the mount
 
01:11:46.709 --> 01:11:46.719 align:start position:0%
washington valley right now a part of
 
01:11:48.550 --> 01:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
the reason we support this bill is that
 
01:11:50.950 --> 01:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
far too often our employers who are
 
01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
already closing their shops and their
 
01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:54.630 align:start position:0%
already closing their shops and their
locations

01:11:54.630 --> 01:11:54.640 align:start position:0%
locations
 
01:11:56.950 --> 01:11:56.960 align:start position:0%
more often than is typical are having to
 
01:11:59.030 --> 01:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
shut their doors even more frequently
 
01:12:01.669 --> 01:12:01.679 align:start position:0%
because they are losing their employees
 
01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
rent increases are definitely something
 
01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
that we are familiar with here in the
 
01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
valley as more folks are buying up
 
01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
property here and raising rents
 
01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
but the problem is in in carroll county
 
01:12:13.990 --> 01:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
we actually have about a zero percent uh
 
01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate so
 
01:12:18.070 --> 01:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
even if you had 90 days it would be very
 
01:12:20.709 --> 01:12:20.719 align:start position:0%
hard we see the 90 days more uh the 60
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
or 90 days more as an opportunity to
 
01:12:24.790 --> 01:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
readjust your budget potentially
 
01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
approach your employer and figure out
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
how you can afford that increase um
 
01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
which would go a huge way for our
 
01:12:32.470 --> 01:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
employers to be able to keep their doors
 
01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:33.350 align:start position:0%
employers to be able to keep their doors
open

01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
open
 
01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
um you know if
 
01:12:37.110 --> 01:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
if an employee should lose their housing
 
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
it is likely that they will have to
 
01:12:40.630 --> 01:12:40.640 align:start position:0%
leave the area uh because they just will
 
01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
not have any other opportunity to find
 
01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
housing in the area
 
01:12:46.149 --> 01:12:46.159 align:start position:0%
so for that reason we support the bill i
 
01:12:49.430 --> 01:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
did send a more in-depth written
 
01:12:51.030 --> 01:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
testimony and i would ask that you
 
01:12:53.830 --> 01:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
please read that thank you
 
01:12:55.669 --> 01:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
01:12:57.270 --> 01:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:12:59.830 --> 01:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
for mr kansler
 
01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
seeing them again thank you
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
hi everyone um erica perez is actually
 
01:13:23.189 --> 01:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
going to speak on behalf of new
 
01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire youth movement here she should
 
01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:27.679 align:start position:0%
be up next but i'm just here in full
 
01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:29.920 align:start position:0%
support of this bill i really believe
 
01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
that people deserve notice before
 
01:13:35.510 --> 01:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
rent increases in case they need to find
 
01:13:37.830 --> 01:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
another place to live i live in dover i
 
01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
know the housing market here is
 
01:13:42.070 --> 01:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
extremely expensive and i know a lot of
 
01:13:43.990 --> 01:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
people have had to move out of the area
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
because of rent increases young people
 
01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
in particular um are
 
01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
often renting and you know struggling to
 
01:13:52.630 --> 01:13:52.640 align:start position:0%
afford places especially here in the
 
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
covid pandemic so i just ask you to
 
01:13:58.630 --> 01:13:58.640 align:start position:0%
be kind to renters and give them
 
01:14:00.149 --> 01:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
more of a heads up notice but i'd love
 
01:14:11.430 --> 01:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:15.189 --> 01:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
hey erica prez perez did not sign up to
 
01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
speak until i see she's an attendee
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
hi um thank you for allowing me to speak
 
01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:23.189 align:start position:0%
hi um thank you for allowing me to speak
um

01:14:23.189 --> 01:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:24.950 --> 01:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
my name is erica perez i'm with the
 
01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire youth movement and i'm from
 
01:14:28.390 --> 01:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
manchester new hampshire
 
01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:29.750 align:start position:0%
manchester new hampshire
um

01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:32.149 --> 01:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
so it may seem reasonable to raise rent
 
01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
if a landlord sees fit but to allow the
 
01:14:35.910 --> 01:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
whims of someone who makes their living
 
01:14:37.830 --> 01:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
from someone else's need for a home
 
01:14:39.669 --> 01:14:39.679 align:start position:0%
isn't reasonable
 
01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
notice is the very least that new
 
01:14:43.590 --> 01:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire renters deserve even 60 days
 
01:14:45.110 --> 01:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
is not enough notice but it's something
 
01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
that we could settle for new hampshire
 
01:14:50.149 --> 01:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
has a minimum wage of 7.25 which i'm
 
01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
sure you're all aware but we do have
 
01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
high rents lower rent areas may not be
 
01:14:56.070 --> 01:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
the safest or the best place to live and
 
01:14:57.750 --> 01:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
landlords take advantage of the fact
 
01:14:59.350 --> 01:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
that there is no better place to go
 
01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:00.870 align:start position:0%
that there is no better place to go
economically

01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
economically
 
01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
um representative horgan made a great
 
01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
point earlier if renters are indeed a
 
01:15:07.350 --> 01:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
business they should take responsibility
 
01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
for their properties in the upkeep so
 
01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
that they don't need multiple occupants
 
01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
to fork over more money that they may
 
01:15:15.510 --> 01:15:15.520 align:start position:0%
not have especially in a pandemic where
 
01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
many people have had their hours cut and
 
01:15:20.310 --> 01:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
seen their savings dwindle
 
01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
once you have strike against your
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
renters history it is incredibly hard to
 
01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
find housing because people refuse to
 
01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
run to you despite your circumstances no
 
01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
matter the circumstance um and landlords
 
01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
already have protections in their
 
01:15:35.830 --> 01:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
contracts that they write up um renters
 
01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
deserve protections too and with all due
 
01:15:39.669 --> 01:15:39.679 align:start position:0%
respect to someone who has lived off of
 
01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
eight dollars an hour with a rent um of
 
01:15:45.669 --> 01:15:45.679 align:start position:0%
400 at the time even a 20 increase in my
 
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
rent would have crushed me seeing as i
 
01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:49.360 align:start position:0%
was already struggling to pay for things
 
01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
like gas and rent and new clothing um so
 
01:15:54.790 --> 01:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
frankly any opposition to this bill is
 
01:15:57.830 --> 01:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
frankly a sign of greed um and thank you
 
01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
for listening and for your time
 
01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:04.400 align:start position:0%

this proposal
 
01:17:31.830 --> 01:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
we view this bill as a notice bill uh
 
01:17:35.110 --> 01:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
essential to creating housing stability
 
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
the issue of housing stabilities move
 
01:17:38.709 --> 01:17:38.719 align:start position:0%
front and center during the pandemic you
 
01:17:39.990 --> 01:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
know how do you comply with a
 
01:17:42.149 --> 01:17:42.159 align:start position:0%
stay-at-home order if you don't have a
 
01:17:44.470 --> 01:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
home how are you safer at home if you
 
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
don't have a place to live
 
01:17:49.270 --> 01:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
we need notice because of our supply
 
01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
program the latest data are that new
 
01:17:54.229 --> 01:17:54.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire needs 20 000 more
 
01:17:56.630 --> 01:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
units to meet demand
 
01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
we are very appreciative of mr norwood's
 
01:18:01.030 --> 01:18:01.040 align:start position:0%
association's attention to the supply
 
01:18:04.149 --> 01:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
problem but it will take some time and
 
01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh notice is just a good policy
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
has been noted the bill doesn't limit in
 
01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
any way what a landlord can charge it
 
01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
can certainly pass along
 
01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:16.630 align:start position:0%
can certainly pass along
increases

01:18:16.630 --> 01:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
increases
 
01:18:19.350 --> 01:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
to capital expenses fuel
 
01:18:20.790 --> 01:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
what it does
 
01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
simply acknowledge is that if you go
 
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
forward with an increase and that's more
 
01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
than your current tenant can afford that
 
01:18:30.149 --> 01:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
you just give them enough time to find a
 
01:18:32.149 --> 01:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
new place i really don't think there's
 
01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
any economist that would say that giving
 
01:18:37.430 --> 01:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
more notice drives up costs
 
01:18:39.910 --> 01:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
is housing a right or a widget purchased
 
01:18:43.189 --> 01:18:43.199 align:start position:0%
on the market i noted uh this when i
 
01:18:44.950 --> 01:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
testified in support of this bill last
 
01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
year i imagine that every of you member
 
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
of your committee may feel a little bit
 
01:18:50.870 --> 01:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
differently about this and no matter
 
01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
where you fall along that continuum we
 
01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
can all agree that if you don't make
 
01:18:57.430 --> 01:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
enough to afford a major increase in
 
01:18:59.350 --> 01:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
your rent but it's just good public
 
01:19:01.270 --> 01:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
policy to give you enough time to find
 
01:19:03.510 --> 01:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
another one so we urge your ought to
 
01:19:05.669 --> 01:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
pass recommendation for house bill 160
 
01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:19:08.310 --> 01:19:08.320 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from his
 
01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:11.590 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions from his
margalin

01:19:11.590 --> 01:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
sing none thank you for your testimony
 
01:19:18.790 --> 01:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
that's all i have for speakers uh
 
01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:21.350 align:start position:0%
that's all i have for speakers uh
currently

01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
currently
 
01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:24.550 align:start position:0%
currently
and

01:19:24.550 --> 01:19:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:26.630 --> 01:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
i see a hand up for martha stone but she
 
01:19:30.070 --> 01:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
so with that i'll close the hearing on
 
01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
house bill 160.
 
01:19:36.630 --> 01:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
i'd note that there were
 
01:19:38.790 --> 01:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
numbers of people who signed up either
 
01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
in support or opposition there were 36
 
01:19:43.590 --> 01:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
people who signed up in support of the
 
01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:44.470 align:start position:0%
people who signed up in support of the
bill

01:19:44.470 --> 01:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:19:47.110 --> 01:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
and 18 who signed up in opposition to
 
01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
the bill indicated they did not wish to
 
01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:53.189 align:start position:0%
the bill indicated they did not wish to
speak

01:19:53.189 --> 01:19:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:58.709 --> 01:19:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
after we hear house bill 550
 
01:20:06.550 --> 01:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
550 house bill 550 is relative to the
 
01:20:12.149 --> 01:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
non-payment of rent during the state of
 
01:20:12.159 --> 01:20:15.510 align:start position:0%
non-payment of rent during the state of
emergency

01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
again the
 
01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:18.719 align:start position:0%
primary sponsor of that bill is
 
01:20:21.189 --> 01:20:21.199 align:start position:0%

01:20:24.390 --> 01:20:24.400 align:start position:0%

hb 550 does one critically important
 
01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:40.390 align:start position:0%
hb 550 does one critically important
thing

01:20:40.390 --> 01:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:20:42.310 --> 01:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
it would halt the eviction process for
 
01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
non-payment of rent for no more than 30
 
01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
days if and only if the tenant can show
 
01:20:49.350 --> 01:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
they've applied for assistance through
 
01:20:51.030 --> 01:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
one of the housing
 
01:20:53.030 --> 01:20:53.040 align:start position:0%

assistance programs now available in our
state

state
 
01:20:56.229 --> 01:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
that period is intended to give the
 
01:20:59.350 --> 01:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
tenant and the landlord potentially time
 
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
to pursue that funding
 
01:21:02.550 --> 01:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
that we know
 
01:21:05.350 --> 01:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
will be available now under the
 
01:21:07.590 --> 01:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
stimulus program approved by congress or
 
01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
the relief program excuse me
 
01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
these provisions would be temporary they
 
01:21:12.630 --> 01:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
would expire
 
01:21:16.390 --> 01:21:16.400 align:start position:0%
when the covid19 state of emergency ends
 
01:21:18.630 --> 01:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
as we know the pandemic has caused a lot
 
01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:20.719 align:start position:0%
of uncertainty a lot of job loss a lot
 
01:21:22.709 --> 01:21:22.719 align:start position:0%
of reduced hours
 
01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
a number of federal programs have
 
01:21:26.229 --> 01:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
emerged to
 
01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
extend or expand our safety net
 
01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:31.030 align:start position:0%
extend or expand our safety net
um

01:21:31.030 --> 01:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
but despite these programs we know from
 
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
the time in which the eviction
 
01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:37.030 align:start position:0%
the time in which the eviction
uh

01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:38.229 align:start position:0%
uh
uh

01:21:38.229 --> 01:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
ban expired this summer to the end of
 
01:21:41.669 --> 01:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
the year we know there were hundreds of
 
01:21:43.990 --> 01:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
evictions so the circumstances for each
 
01:21:45.590 --> 01:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
aren't obviously available but it's safe
 
01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
to presume that a number of those people
 
01:21:49.669 --> 01:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
who lost their homes to do non-payment
 
01:21:52.709 --> 01:21:52.719 align:start position:0%
would have qualified for assistance
 
01:21:54.550 --> 01:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
and it's also safe to presume that many
 
01:21:56.070 --> 01:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
people did not know these programs
 
01:21:57.750 --> 01:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
existed they had
 
01:21:59.910 --> 01:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
difficulty accessing them
 
01:22:01.750 --> 01:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
or any number of other challenges might
 
01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
have arisen
 
01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
so again this 30-day period just gives
 
01:22:07.510 --> 01:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
people facing eviction this narrow
 
01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
window to pursue this support before
 
01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
they lose their home
 
01:22:12.709 --> 01:22:12.719 align:start position:0%
it does not
 
01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
in any way sort of allow them to not pay
 
01:22:18.709 --> 01:22:18.719 align:start position:0%
rent or or otherwise violate the lease
 
01:22:21.510 --> 01:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
so in short it's just a temporary and
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
critical lifeline for tenants facing
 
01:22:24.950 --> 01:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
financial difficulties due to the
 
01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:26.790 align:start position:0%
financial difficulties due to the
pandemic

01:22:26.790 --> 01:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
01:22:29.270 --> 01:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
the governor to his credit uh really
 
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
worked hard to try to address this issue
 
01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:33.190 align:start position:0%
last year
 
01:22:33.190 --> 01:22:34.709 align:start position:0%
last year
[Music]

01:22:34.709 --> 01:22:34.719 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:22:36.790 --> 01:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
and i would consider this bill to be
 
01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
something that meshes with uh what the
 
01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
governor and gopher has already acted on
 
01:22:44.790 --> 01:22:44.800 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your help uh for your
 
01:22:47.270 --> 01:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh time and appreciate
 
01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:48.070 align:start position:0%
uh time and appreciate
uh

01:22:48.070 --> 01:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:22:49.750 --> 01:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
your your time and i'm happy to take
 
01:22:51.910 --> 01:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
questions representative conley did you
 
01:22:55.110 --> 01:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
submit written testimony
 
01:22:57.110 --> 01:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh representative i did not i'm happy to
 
01:23:03.110 --> 01:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:05.590 --> 01:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
is are there any other questions for
 
01:23:09.830 --> 01:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you for your
 
01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
testimony i have a question if that's
 
01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
okay yes yep you sure
 
01:23:17.350 --> 01:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative for taking
 
01:23:19.030 --> 01:23:19.040 align:start position:0%
my question what is the difference
 
01:23:20.390 --> 01:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
between this bill and the current
 
01:23:22.470 --> 01:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
executive order that um the emergency
 
01:23:25.590 --> 01:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
order that the governor enacted
 
01:23:28.709 --> 01:23:28.719 align:start position:0%
thank you representative so that the key
 
01:23:30.709 --> 01:23:30.719 align:start position:0%
objective for this bill
 
01:23:32.709 --> 01:23:32.719 align:start position:0%
um and i'm i'm not directly answering
 
01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna get there but i'm going to go
 
01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:35.430 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna get there but i'm going to go
a little

01:23:35.430 --> 01:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
a little
 
01:23:36.870 --> 01:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
wider is
 
01:23:39.990 --> 01:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
to address the uncertainty around the
 
01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:40.950 align:start position:0%
to address the uncertainty around the
federal

01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
federal
 
01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:42.149 align:start position:0%
federal
eviction

01:23:42.149 --> 01:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
eviction
 
01:23:42.159 --> 01:23:43.270 align:start position:0%
eviction
um

01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
ban through the cdc that's been extended
 
01:23:47.430 --> 01:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
through march
 
01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
and the uncertainty around um
 
01:23:53.669 --> 01:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
the application of the kovid 19 relief
 
01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh funded by congress
 
01:23:57.830 --> 01:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
so we've got a number of different
 
01:24:00.310 --> 01:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
programs that are intended to
 
01:24:02.149 --> 01:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
keep people in their homes who have been
 
01:24:04.709 --> 01:24:04.719 align:start position:0%
affected by kova 19
 
01:24:04.719 --> 01:24:05.590 align:start position:0%
affected by kova 19
and

01:24:05.590 --> 01:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:24:07.830 --> 01:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
they don't always mesh particularly well
 
01:24:09.669 --> 01:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
or there's uncertainty and the whole
 
01:24:12.629 --> 01:24:12.639 align:start position:0%
point here is just just to give people
 
01:24:14.830 --> 01:24:14.840 align:start position:0%
um the time and the
 
01:24:17.669 --> 01:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
wherewithal to uh to use these programs
 
01:24:19.110 --> 01:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
that are there specifically for this
 
01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:20.310 align:start position:0%
that are there specifically for this
purpose

01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:21.270 align:start position:0%
purpose
um

01:24:21.270 --> 01:24:21.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
so uh to the specifics of uh
 
01:24:27.110 --> 01:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
i would i would leave it to another uh
 
01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
person to maybe address that in
 
01:24:30.709 --> 01:24:30.719 align:start position:0%
specifically but that is the objective
 
01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:38.629 --> 01:24:38.639 align:start position:0%
are you okay representative
 
01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
um it's a follow-up if i could
 
01:24:45.270 --> 01:24:45.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um so i i guess i'm
 
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
wondering because the governor's order
 
01:24:48.790 --> 01:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
that's currently enacted has to be
 
01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
renewed every 21 days due to the state
 
01:24:52.229 --> 01:24:52.239 align:start position:0%
of emergency so this would just extend
 
01:24:53.350 --> 01:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
it nine days
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
if this passed and it would expire at
 
01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
the end of a state of emergency
 
01:24:58.950 --> 01:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
so if once this bill goes through the
 
01:25:00.629 --> 01:25:00.639 align:start position:0%
entire process of
 
01:25:00.639 --> 01:25:02.149 align:start position:0%
entire process of
um

01:25:02.149 --> 01:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:02.159 --> 01:25:03.350 align:start position:0%
um
like

01:25:03.350 --> 01:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:25:05.110 --> 01:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
passing a bill would this ability even
 
01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:11.430 --> 01:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
forgive me um
 
01:25:13.030 --> 01:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
yes uh
 
01:25:15.830 --> 01:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
so that i anticipated that question so
 
01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:18.149 align:start position:0%
so that i anticipated that question so
um

01:25:18.149 --> 01:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:19.430 --> 01:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
we don't know what's going to happen in
 
01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
the future
 
01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
and we certainly didn't know what was
 
01:25:24.070 --> 01:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
going to happen with kova 19 relief and
 
01:25:26.229 --> 01:25:26.239 align:start position:0%
with the cdc extension back when this
 
01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
bill was filed uh that said um
 
01:25:32.790 --> 01:25:32.800 align:start position:0%
this is just a way of ensuring
 
01:25:35.830 --> 01:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
that those protections exist uh when we
 
01:25:37.110 --> 01:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
have other things that are out of our
 
01:25:38.229 --> 01:25:38.239 align:start position:0%
control this is something the
 
01:25:41.189 --> 01:25:41.199 align:start position:0%
legislature can control uh and and
 
01:25:42.390 --> 01:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
that's why i think it's important to
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:46.709 --> 01:25:46.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:25:48.390 --> 01:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions for
 
01:25:51.590 --> 01:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
sing none again thank you for your
 
01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
testimony today
 
01:25:57.510 --> 01:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
the next person to test it we only have
 
01:25:59.110 --> 01:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
three other people who have signed up to
 
01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:00.470 align:start position:0%
three other people who have signed up to
testify

01:26:00.470 --> 01:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
testify
 
01:26:06.830 --> 01:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:10.870 --> 01:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
berry thank you mr chairman uh
 
01:26:13.350 --> 01:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
so very very briefly and i'm not sure i
 
01:26:15.669 --> 01:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
understood if i may have misunderstood
 
01:26:18.310 --> 01:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
uh representative alexander's question
 
01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
but right now as to evictions there
 
01:26:24.229 --> 01:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
there is no more any moratorium or any
 
01:26:27.189 --> 01:26:27.199 align:start position:0%
relevant uh governor's order uh what we
 
01:26:30.390 --> 01:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
have is the cdc moratorium on eviction
 
01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
for non-payment of rent that expires on
 
01:26:34.709 --> 01:26:34.719 align:start position:0%
march 31st
 
01:26:34.719 --> 01:26:35.750 align:start position:0%
march 31st
um

01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:39.030 --> 01:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
after march 31st we may have very
 
01:26:40.709 --> 01:26:40.719 align:start position:0%
big big trouble
 
01:26:40.719 --> 01:26:41.910 align:start position:0%
big big trouble
but

01:26:41.910 --> 01:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:26:44.390 --> 01:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
let me just tell you where the law is
 
01:26:48.790 --> 01:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
right now right now if a tenant uh gets
 
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
an eviction notice for non-payment of
 
01:26:54.629 --> 01:26:54.639 align:start position:0%
rent their right to pay and stay
 
01:26:57.910 --> 01:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
expires after the the expiration of the
 
01:27:03.110 --> 01:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
notice to quit there is no possible way
 
01:27:06.229 --> 01:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
that somebody can apply to the for the
 
01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
federal funds uh within the seven day
 
01:27:11.910 --> 01:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
period to cure the non-payment i want to
 
01:27:13.830 --> 01:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
be clear a landlord can't accept it
 
01:27:15.990 --> 01:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
after that but they don't have to
 
01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
what were what's being proposed here
 
01:27:21.669 --> 01:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
um is right and and i'm sorry let me
 
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
also make clear the current status of
 
01:27:27.030 --> 01:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
the relief fund the cares act funds that
 
01:27:29.590 --> 01:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
were available to help tenants pay
 
01:27:32.709 --> 01:27:32.719 align:start position:0%
rental arrearages uh due to copen that
 
01:27:37.310 --> 01:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
has expired uh as f as of december 18
 
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
2020 tenants could not apply the new
 
01:27:43.110 --> 01:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
federal program which is going to bring
 
01:27:45.830 --> 01:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of money for this purpose into new
 
01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire 200 million dollars for this
 
01:27:51.990 --> 01:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
in the uk and utilities but that is not
 
01:27:53.910 --> 01:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
close to up and running right now i'm
 
01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
not even sure the state has received it
 
01:27:57.669 --> 01:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
they haven't decided who's going to be
 
01:27:59.990 --> 01:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
the administrator and it's going to have
 
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
more requirements than the cares program
 
01:28:06.390 --> 01:28:06.400 align:start position:0%
did and in the cares program it took
 
01:28:09.750 --> 01:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
generally around 45 days
 
01:28:12.790 --> 01:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
for the applications to be processed and
 
01:28:15.669 --> 01:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
and payment to be made so that extra
 
01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
time that you need that
 
01:28:20.550 --> 01:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
this bill provides for the tenants to to
 
01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:21.510 align:start position:0%
this bill provides for the tenants to to
pay

01:28:21.510 --> 01:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
pay
 
01:28:23.590 --> 01:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
it doesn't stop the landlord from filing
 
01:28:26.229 --> 01:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
the eviction it just provides more time
 
01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
for the tenant to go through the process
 
01:28:32.550 --> 01:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
and have a reasonable chance of getting
 
01:28:35.669 --> 01:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
getting a grant that will solve
 
01:28:37.669 --> 01:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
the problem for the tenant
 
01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
it's a win-win situation
 
01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
and i hope due to the
 
01:28:45.189 --> 01:28:45.199 align:start position:0%
one last point
 
01:28:47.350 --> 01:28:47.360 align:start position:0%
the it's true that the governor the
 
01:28:49.030 --> 01:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
emergency period
 
01:28:51.510 --> 01:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
only lasts for 21 days i think that's
 
01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:52.310 align:start position:0%
only lasts for 21 days i think that's
right

01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:53.030 align:start position:0%
right
but

01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:28:55.510 --> 01:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
the governor obviously has been renewing
 
01:28:58.870 --> 01:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
these time and time and time again given
 
01:29:01.270 --> 01:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
the status of covid right now i could
 
01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
really i could see this don't the
 
01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
emergency orders going well into the
 
01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:06.149 align:start position:0%
emergency orders going well into the
fall

01:29:06.149 --> 01:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
fall
 
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
and if this moves through the
 
01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:08.709 align:start position:0%
and if this moves through the
legislature

01:29:08.709 --> 01:29:08.719 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:29:10.870 --> 01:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
quickly it can certainly provide a lot
 
01:29:13.270 --> 01:29:13.280 align:start position:0%
of relief for a lot of people
 
01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
and that's what i got to say
 
01:29:21.270 --> 01:29:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:22.870 --> 01:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank thank you for your
 
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
testimony again this morning
 
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
and nick norman
 
01:29:31.189 --> 01:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:32.870 --> 01:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
very good thank you so much for the
 
01:29:35.110 --> 01:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak once again
 
01:29:37.270 --> 01:29:37.280 align:start position:0%
i'll bypass introductions i know time is
 
01:29:40.390 --> 01:29:40.400 align:start position:0%
short the landlord position on this bill
 
01:29:42.550 --> 01:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
would be to be against the bill and to
 
01:29:44.229 --> 01:29:44.239 align:start position:0%
vote to kill the bill
 
01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:29:48.790 --> 01:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
an enormous amount of
 
01:29:51.430 --> 01:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
programs that have come out in support
 
01:29:51.440 --> 01:29:52.470 align:start position:0%
programs that have come out in support
of

01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:29:55.270 --> 01:29:55.280 align:start position:0%
tenants getting assistance
 
01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:57.510 align:start position:0%
tenants getting assistance
and

01:29:57.510 --> 01:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:30:01.510 --> 01:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:03.270 --> 01:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
seems to be never ending eviction
 
01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:05.669 align:start position:0%
seems to be never ending eviction
moratoriums

01:30:05.669 --> 01:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
moratoriums
 
01:30:08.229 --> 01:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
there's a overlapping of federal and
 
01:30:08.239 --> 01:30:09.350 align:start position:0%
there's a overlapping of federal and
state

01:30:09.350 --> 01:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:30:12.470 --> 01:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
moratoriums and cdc moratoriums it is
 
01:30:14.950 --> 01:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
getting very very confusing we don't
 
01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
think that there needs to be anything
 
01:30:18.310 --> 01:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
else to confuse the whole eviction
 
01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:20.629 align:start position:0%
else to confuse the whole eviction
process

01:30:20.629 --> 01:30:20.639 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:30:23.270 --> 01:30:23.280 align:start position:0%
this is very late to the party
 
01:30:25.750 --> 01:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
vaccines are coming out the 200 million
 
01:30:27.350 --> 01:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
is coming out
 
01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:28.470 align:start position:0%
is coming out
there's

01:30:28.470 --> 01:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:30:31.030 --> 01:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
just lots of benefits
 
01:30:32.870 --> 01:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
we have landlords that are suffering
 
01:30:36.070 --> 01:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
from tenants that have not paid rent
 
01:30:39.189 --> 01:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
since february of last year
 
01:30:42.070 --> 01:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
it's just ridiculous
 
01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:43.189 align:start position:0%
it's just ridiculous
so

01:30:43.189 --> 01:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:43.199 --> 01:30:44.790 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:30:44.790 --> 01:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:46.950 --> 01:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
we would be opposed for it
 
01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:48.470 align:start position:0%
we would be opposed for it
and

01:30:48.470 --> 01:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:49.430 align:start position:0%
and
uh

01:30:49.430 --> 01:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:30:51.910 --> 01:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
i should make something clear that maybe
 
01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
is this confused by what elliot may have
 
01:30:57.590 --> 01:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
just presented
 
01:30:59.750 --> 01:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
there is a cdc eviction moratorium
 
01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:00.870 align:start position:0%
there is a cdc eviction moratorium
presently

01:31:00.870 --> 01:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
presently
 
01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
and the only thing a tenant has to do to
 
01:31:05.430 --> 01:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
get protection
 
01:31:06.870 --> 01:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
on that
 
01:31:09.910 --> 01:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
is to present a cdc declaration just
 
01:31:12.870 --> 01:31:12.880 align:start position:0%
present a piece of paper to the landlord
 
01:31:14.790 --> 01:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
and by the ruling of the new hampshire
 
01:31:17.270 --> 01:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
courts the entire eviction process has
 
01:31:20.550 --> 01:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:22.470 --> 01:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
so i don't think that we need to create
 
01:31:25.830 --> 01:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:28.390 --> 01:31:28.400 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to take any questions
 
01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
if not i think thank you for your
 
01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
testimony mr norman
 
01:31:40.310 --> 01:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
and the last person we have to testify
 
01:31:42.870 --> 01:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
is ben mortal
 
01:31:50.629 --> 01:31:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:55.270 --> 01:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:57.510 --> 01:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
but again alyssa margolin although
 
01:32:00.229 --> 01:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
didn't didn't sign up but has her hand
 
01:32:07.910 --> 01:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:11.430 --> 01:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
i do mr chairman and i'm sorry i did
 
01:32:14.070 --> 01:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
sign up this morning um albeit a little
 
01:32:16.310 --> 01:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
bit after nine so perhaps i didn't make
 
01:32:18.629 --> 01:32:18.639 align:start position:0%
your list thank you for hearing housing
 
01:32:20.390 --> 01:32:20.400 align:start position:0%
action new hampshire's testimony we are
 
01:32:23.110 --> 01:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
in support of house bill 550. our
 
01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
coalition has been very involved in
 
01:32:27.430 --> 01:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
helping secure housing stabilization
 
01:32:27.440 --> 01:32:28.870 align:start position:0%
helping secure housing stabilization
resources

01:32:28.870 --> 01:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
resources
 
01:32:30.709 --> 01:32:30.719 align:start position:0%
we were really pleased when the
 
01:32:32.470 --> 01:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
governor's office for emergency relief
 
01:32:34.470 --> 01:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
and recovery stood up the new hampshire
 
01:32:36.870 --> 01:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
housing relief program very early in the
 
01:32:39.110 --> 01:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
pandemic and we were really an example
 
01:32:42.310 --> 01:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
to other states in a step forward on
 
01:32:44.950 --> 01:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
housing stability but as other uh
 
01:32:46.870 --> 01:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
testifiers have noted it's a very
 
01:32:49.750 --> 01:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
dynamic landscape there's currently no
 
01:32:53.189 --> 01:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
uh state more uh torium on eviction
 
01:32:55.350 --> 01:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
there is the cdc eviction moratorium
 
01:32:57.990 --> 01:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
that's due to expire on march 31
 
01:33:00.229 --> 01:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
there's the expiration of the
 
01:33:02.070 --> 01:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
early relief program and the
 
01:33:06.070 --> 01:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
anticipation of the new program created
 
01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
by the relief bill passed in december
 
01:33:10.629 --> 01:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
and of course we're all waiting to see
 
01:33:13.030 --> 01:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
what happens in congress with the the
 
01:33:14.950 --> 01:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
newest um
 
01:33:18.390 --> 01:33:18.400 align:start position:0%
the newest proposal for relief
 
01:33:20.149 --> 01:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
um we think that putting this kind of
 
01:33:22.790 --> 01:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
policy in play would actually create
 
01:33:24.070 --> 01:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
some needed
 
01:33:26.229 --> 01:33:26.239 align:start position:0%
stability and understanding of the
 
01:33:28.629 --> 01:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
process in a dynamic and ever-changing
 
01:33:28.639 --> 01:33:29.910 align:start position:0%
process in a dynamic and ever-changing
landscape

01:33:29.910 --> 01:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
landscape
 
01:33:32.470 --> 01:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
there is some lag time between the time
 
01:33:33.750 --> 01:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
a tenant
 
01:33:35.510 --> 01:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
applies for
 
01:33:37.990 --> 01:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
the um the relief and
 
01:33:40.629 --> 01:33:40.639 align:start position:0%
then when the landlord is made whole
 
01:33:43.350 --> 01:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
and of course we are counting on our
 
01:33:45.830 --> 01:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
state agency partners to
 
01:33:48.070 --> 01:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
vet these applications and be good
 
01:33:50.950 --> 01:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
stewards of taxpayer resources
 
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
so we think this would be
 
01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:53.910 align:start position:0%
so we think this would be
good

01:33:53.910 --> 01:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:33:56.390 --> 01:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
to help us you know navigate
 
01:33:58.229 --> 01:33:58.239 align:start position:0%
the landscape right now but also any
 
01:34:01.350 --> 01:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
kind of state of emergency in the future
 
01:34:04.709 --> 01:34:04.719 align:start position:0%
we really shouldn't create um housing
 
01:34:08.229 --> 01:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
instability and we we shouldn't um
 
01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
you know create uh homelessness when
 
01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
tenants are simply just awaiting their
 
01:34:14.950 --> 01:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
assistance we really shouldn't let
 
01:34:17.510 --> 01:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy uh get in the way and just
 
01:34:20.390 --> 01:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
having the courts hit pause for 30 days
 
01:34:23.430 --> 01:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
um in order for our systems to respond
 
01:34:25.669 --> 01:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
um thoughtfully it you know makes good
 
01:34:27.189 --> 01:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
sense and therefore we recommend that
 
01:34:30.470 --> 01:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
you pass house bill 550.
 
01:34:32.870 --> 01:34:32.880 align:start position:0%

and i believe that that
 
01:34:44.629 --> 01:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
uh ends the list of those people who
 
01:34:46.629 --> 01:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
wish to testify there were
 
01:34:48.149 --> 01:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
a number of people who expressed
 
01:34:50.629 --> 01:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
opinions there were 34
 
01:34:52.229 --> 01:34:52.239 align:start position:0%
in advance of the hearing today there
 
01:34:56.310 --> 01:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
were 34 in support and 18 opposed
 
01:34:57.990 --> 01:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
and with that i'll close the hearing on
 
01:35:00.870 --> 01:35:00.880 align:start position:0%

01:35:05.830 --> 01:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate a break at some point in time
 
01:35:07.270 --> 01:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
in the morning so
 
01:35:09.030 --> 01:35:09.040 align:start position:0%

why don't we
re

01:35:10.390 --> 01:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
re
 
01:35:13.189 --> 01:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
take a brief recess and come back at
 
01:35:14.950 --> 01:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
about a quarter of and give everybody an
 
01:35:16.709 --> 01:35:16.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity to

so we'll we'll reconvene at quarter of
 
01:42:50.629 --> 01:42:50.639 align:start position:0%

okay i'll call the house judiciary
 
01:42:59.990 --> 01:43:00.000 align:start position:0%

our next bill to be heard this morning
 
01:43:18.629 --> 01:43:18.639 align:start position:0%

my name is sherry frost i represent
 
01:43:50.070 --> 01:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
dover's ward 4 stratford 16. being
 
01:43:51.590 --> 01:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
mindful of the heavy workload that the
 
01:43:53.590 --> 01:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
committee has this day i would introduce
 
01:43:55.109 --> 01:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
the bill and with the chair's permission
 
01:43:57.109 --> 01:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
we'll read into the record the testimony
 
01:43:59.030 --> 01:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
of the community member on whose behalf
 
01:44:00.629 --> 01:44:00.639 align:start position:0%
i submitted this bill
 
01:44:01.830 --> 01:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
i understand that there are a couple of
 
01:44:03.430 --> 01:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
attorneys who signed up to speak after
 
01:44:05.189 --> 01:44:05.199 align:start position:0%
me who can clarify any questions that
 
01:44:08.470 --> 01:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
you may have okay hb 360 is a bit of
 
01:44:10.550 --> 01:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
housekeeping to clear up some ambiguity
 
01:44:12.870 --> 01:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
in rental law that applies to shared
 
01:44:15.990 --> 01:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
owner-occupied spaces so when an owner
 
01:44:18.070 --> 01:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
rents a room to a tenant but the living
 
01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
spaces are shared in common
 
01:44:21.990 --> 01:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
specifically it requires that in the
 
01:44:23.750 --> 01:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
event of a dispute the tenant must
 
01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
disclose that the situation is a 540b
 
01:44:29.189 --> 01:44:29.199 align:start position:0%
shared space rental and is not subject
 
01:44:33.189 --> 01:44:33.199 align:start position:0%
to the remedies outlined in 540a
 
01:44:35.990 --> 01:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
um i will happily email this
 
01:44:38.470 --> 01:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
testimony to the committee
 
01:44:40.709 --> 01:44:40.719 align:start position:0%
as soon as i'm done here uh jonathan
 
01:44:44.229 --> 01:44:44.239 align:start position:0%
dowling of dover asked that this be
 
01:44:46.229 --> 01:44:46.239 align:start position:0%
submitted into law and this is his
 
01:44:46.239 --> 01:44:47.430 align:start position:0%
submitted into law and this is his
testimony

01:44:47.430 --> 01:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:44:49.669 --> 01:44:49.679 align:start position:0%
hb 360 needs to pass because it's
 
01:44:51.510 --> 01:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
imperative that our rental laws clarify
 
01:44:53.189 --> 01:44:53.199 align:start position:0%
a confusing situation for tenants
 
01:44:55.030 --> 01:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
landlords and the courts
 
01:44:58.229 --> 01:44:58.239 align:start position:0%
nhrsa 540b deals with owner-occupied
 
01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
rentals these shared space rentals have
 
01:45:02.709 --> 01:45:02.719 align:start position:0%
a tenant living in a room and sharing
 
01:45:04.790 --> 01:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
common spaces such as a kitchen and or
 
01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:05.830 align:start position:0%
common spaces such as a kitchen and or
bathroom

01:45:05.830 --> 01:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
bathroom
 
01:45:07.510 --> 01:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
knowing the sensitivity of shared space
 
01:45:09.590 --> 01:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
when things do not work out the statute
 
01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
provides different procedures for
 
01:45:13.270 --> 01:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
removal or eviction of a tenant
 
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
the problem is that many of the parties
 
01:45:16.229 --> 01:45:16.239 align:start position:0%
do not have adequate knowledge of the
 
01:45:18.790 --> 01:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
procedures in the 540b that differ from
 
01:45:20.629 --> 01:45:20.639 align:start position:0%
a traditional rental property eviction
 
01:45:22.709 --> 01:45:22.719 align:start position:0%
process this includes both the tenant
 
01:45:24.070 --> 01:45:24.080 align:start position:0%
and the court
 
01:45:25.990 --> 01:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
due to ambiguities in the law i lived in
 
01:45:28.470 --> 01:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
a potentially dangerous shared space
 
01:45:30.229 --> 01:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
even with a protective order given to me
 
01:45:32.229 --> 01:45:32.239 align:start position:0%
by the court against the tenant i was
 
01:45:33.910 --> 01:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
still told by the court to allow the
 
01:45:35.830 --> 01:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
tenant to remain in the property for two
 
01:45:38.310 --> 01:45:38.320 align:start position:0%
weeks after i took lawful possession
 
01:45:39.990 --> 01:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
the issue was that after publicly
 
01:45:41.830 --> 01:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
shaming me on social media the tenant
 
01:45:44.070 --> 01:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
received incorrect advice and filed for
 
01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
540a protections not once stating that
 
01:45:50.149 --> 01:45:50.159 align:start position:0%
it was a shared space rental under 540b
 
01:45:51.590 --> 01:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
the court then applied the typical
 
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
process and accused me of a lockout
 
01:45:55.590 --> 01:45:55.600 align:start position:0%
after the tenant refused to participate
 
01:45:57.109 --> 01:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
in the hearing a permanent protective
 
01:45:58.629 --> 01:45:58.639 align:start position:0%
order was given to me and the tenant was
 
01:46:00.870 --> 01:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
removed this was weeks after being
 
01:46:02.950 --> 01:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
lawfully evicted the eviction that
 
01:46:04.870 --> 01:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
followed all state laws and was served
 
01:46:06.470 --> 01:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
by a third party
 
01:46:07.750 --> 01:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
this measure
 
01:46:09.590 --> 01:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
would clarify the process to protect
 
01:46:11.590 --> 01:46:11.600 align:start position:0%
people who rent rooms and shared spaces
 
01:46:13.990 --> 01:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
540b properties our state's eviction
 
01:46:15.430 --> 01:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
laws are important to protect tenants
 
01:46:17.430 --> 01:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
from disreputable landlords but they
 
01:46:19.350 --> 01:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
also allow for bad faith by tenants who
 
01:46:20.790 --> 01:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
abuse the system
 
01:46:22.629 --> 01:46:22.639 align:start position:0%
requiring a tenant to state clearly the
 
01:46:25.030 --> 01:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
type of property they are filing a 540a
 
01:46:27.189 --> 01:46:27.199 align:start position:0%
petition for will inform the court if
 
01:46:28.950 --> 01:46:28.960 align:start position:0%
tenancy laws have been followed more
 
01:46:31.590 --> 01:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
clearly than currently and prevent a
 
01:46:33.750 --> 01:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
tenant from abusing the situation
 
01:46:36.390 --> 01:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
and in 540b properties protect landlords
 
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
trying to get out of a poor situation
 
01:46:40.709 --> 01:46:40.719 align:start position:0%
courts would need to recognize that laws
 
01:46:43.189 --> 01:46:43.199 align:start position:0%
differ and not to give temporary order
 
01:46:45.910 --> 01:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
that may violate the 540p statute this
 
01:46:48.070 --> 01:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
will also provide a penalty for filing
 
01:46:50.070 --> 01:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
false information to the court thank you
 
01:46:55.270 --> 01:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:57.750 --> 01:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
and that's all i have
 
01:46:59.590 --> 01:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
does that conclude you
 
01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:00.629 align:start position:0%
does that conclude you

01:47:49.750 --> 01:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:51.750 --> 01:47:51.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much again for the
 
01:47:53.830 --> 01:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak to the committee
 
01:47:57.030 --> 01:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
this is i hopefully as you've just
 
01:47:59.669 --> 01:47:59.679 align:start position:0%
noticed is very very simple bill it
 
01:48:01.990 --> 01:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
actually doesn't change anything in the
 
01:48:04.390 --> 01:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
existing law as we read it what it does
 
01:48:07.669 --> 01:48:07.679 align:start position:0%
is it clarifies the existing law
 
01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
makes it easier for courts to understand
 
01:48:14.229 --> 01:48:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:15.590 --> 01:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
looking to
 
01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:16.830 align:start position:0%
looking to
to

01:48:16.830 --> 01:48:16.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:48:18.390 --> 01:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
to um
 
01:48:20.390 --> 01:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
you know to adjudicate
 
01:48:22.550 --> 01:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
we think that it would
 
01:48:24.790 --> 01:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
make things simpler it would reduce
 
01:48:26.229 --> 01:48:26.239 align:start position:0%
actions that should not even be
 
01:48:29.350 --> 01:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
litigated reduce caseloads facilitate
 
01:48:31.350 --> 01:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
quicker comprehension of the issues
 
01:48:33.669 --> 01:48:33.679 align:start position:0%
before a judge
 
01:48:35.750 --> 01:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
it's very reasonable to ask
 
01:48:38.790 --> 01:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
a tenant to just state on a 540a
 
01:48:43.990 --> 01:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
petition that they're in reshared
 
01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:45.189 align:start position:0%
petition that they're in reshared
facility

01:48:45.189 --> 01:48:45.199 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:48:47.350 --> 01:48:47.360 align:start position:0%
and if if you think that it might be
 
01:48:49.109 --> 01:48:49.119 align:start position:0%
confusing for attendant to know which
 
01:48:50.870 --> 01:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
class of property he's in the court
 
01:48:52.950 --> 01:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
forum could just be simply
 
01:48:55.189 --> 01:48:55.199 align:start position:0%
to answer a couple questions and then
 
01:48:56.870 --> 01:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
the the judge
 
01:48:58.950 --> 01:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
and the court system would know which
 
01:49:02.390 --> 01:49:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:04.390 --> 01:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
that's really it for my testimony i
 
01:49:05.830 --> 01:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
think it makes a lot of sense and it
 
01:49:07.669 --> 01:49:07.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't change present law
 
01:49:10.550 --> 01:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to take any questions
 
01:49:17.830 --> 01:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:20.310 --> 01:49:20.320 align:start position:0%
singhan thank you for your testimony
 
01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
the next person who signed up to testify
 
01:49:27.510 --> 01:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:30.229 --> 01:49:30.239 align:start position:0%
uh hello again again i can be very brief
 
01:49:33.030 --> 01:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
here um i don't have a problem with the
 
01:49:35.189 --> 01:49:35.199 align:start position:0%
concept of in this bill at all i should
 
01:49:36.790 --> 01:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
say that i was one of the people who
 
01:49:39.350 --> 01:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
negotiated what turned out to be rsa
 
01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:41.189 align:start position:0%
negotiated what turned out to be rsa
540-b

01:49:41.189 --> 01:49:41.199 align:start position:0%
540-b
 
01:49:43.270 --> 01:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure
 
01:49:45.030 --> 01:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:49:47.109 --> 01:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
number one that you understand that this
 
01:49:50.310 --> 01:49:50.320 align:start position:0%
is only applies to you you know to the
 
01:49:53.270 --> 01:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable situation where the tenant
 
01:49:57.030 --> 01:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
is re sharing part of the facility a
 
01:50:00.149 --> 01:50:00.159 align:start position:0%
dining room a kitchen a bathroom with
 
01:50:02.790 --> 01:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
the owner of the premises in that case
 
01:50:05.189 --> 01:50:05.199 align:start position:0%
under the current law right now the
 
01:50:08.550 --> 01:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
tenant uh the landlord nearly
 
01:50:10.550 --> 01:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
merely needs to give three
 
01:50:13.270 --> 01:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
seven or 30 days notice by just posting
 
01:50:17.030 --> 01:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
it on the primary door uh to the rented
 
01:50:19.910 --> 01:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
premises they do not after that expires
 
01:50:22.229 --> 01:50:22.239 align:start position:0%
they don't have to go to court at all
 
01:50:24.470 --> 01:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
but the current law says if the landlord
 
01:50:27.510 --> 01:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't do that the tenant can bring an
 
01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
action under rsa 540 a4 uh in order to
 
01:50:35.030 --> 01:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
get back in until the notice requirement
 
01:50:37.270 --> 01:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
is met um
 
01:50:39.750 --> 01:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
i agree that there probably is a problem
 
01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
here and all i would like to ask that
 
01:50:44.470 --> 01:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
you do or let me just say one uh thing
 
01:50:47.750 --> 01:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
to explain my position the
 
01:50:50.629 --> 01:50:50.639 align:start position:0%
it is very rare for the tenant to have
 
01:50:54.950 --> 01:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
any idea whether his or her occupancy is
 
01:50:58.310 --> 01:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
regulated by rsa 540b they probably
 
01:51:00.310 --> 01:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
don't even know what a shared facility
 
01:51:03.109 --> 01:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
is under the law so all i would ask and
 
01:51:04.709 --> 01:51:04.719 align:start position:0%
i've already in order to try to help
 
01:51:08.470 --> 01:51:08.480 align:start position:0%
this along i emailed
 
01:51:11.830 --> 01:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
with david king the chief judge of the
 
01:51:15.109 --> 01:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
uh circuit court who did indicate to me
 
01:51:18.790 --> 01:51:18.800 align:start position:0%
that he didn't see why the 540a form
 
01:51:22.310 --> 01:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
could not be uh um
 
01:51:24.390 --> 01:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
modified to
 
01:51:26.709 --> 01:51:26.719 align:start position:0%
create the simple question that would
 
01:51:28.790 --> 01:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
notify the judge and the tenant if
 
01:51:32.470 --> 01:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
they're a 540b situation so all i would
 
01:51:34.790 --> 01:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
ask is that maybe you insert something
 
01:51:37.189 --> 01:51:37.199 align:start position:0%
in there that says upon
 
01:51:37.199 --> 01:51:38.390 align:start position:0%
in there that says upon
uh

01:51:38.390 --> 01:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:51:42.390 --> 01:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh upon forms created or uh created by
 
01:51:44.629 --> 01:51:44.639 align:start position:0%
the court system but otherwise the
 
01:51:46.390 --> 01:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
tenant who
 
01:51:49.830 --> 01:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
who was un locked out without notice
 
01:51:52.390 --> 01:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
will have no idea that he's supposed to
 
01:51:56.550 --> 01:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
put down uh rsa 540b on the petition and
 
01:51:58.390 --> 01:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
therefore will not get the relief that
 
01:52:00.709 --> 01:52:00.719 align:start position:0%
the current statute requires but with a
 
01:52:02.790 --> 01:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
simple amendment directing the court to
 
01:52:05.510 --> 01:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
modify the form i don't have any problem
 
01:52:07.430 --> 01:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
and again justice king told me i could
 
01:52:09.430 --> 01:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
share with the committee uh that he
 
01:52:11.910 --> 01:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't see why that can't be done
 
01:52:16.790 --> 01:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:17.990 --> 01:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:52:20.390 --> 01:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for
 
01:52:25.350 --> 01:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:27.910 --> 01:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much mr chairman i'm
 
01:52:31.109 --> 01:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
not sure if this is for mr berry or for
 
01:52:35.589 --> 01:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
you but we have been given um a proposed
 
01:52:37.990 --> 01:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
amendment uh by
 
01:52:42.030 --> 01:52:42.040 align:start position:0%
representative frost it's 2021
 
01:52:45.830 --> 01:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
0201 h and
 
01:52:48.229 --> 01:52:48.239 align:start position:0%
representative frost did not
 
01:52:50.229 --> 01:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
submit the amendment before the
 
01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
committee all we have is a printed copy
 
01:52:57.589 --> 01:52:57.599 align:start position:0%
and i before this hearing ended i wanted
 
01:53:00.310 --> 01:53:00.320 align:start position:0%
to make sure that
 
01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
if this should have been submitted to us
 
01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:04.629 align:start position:0%
if this should have been submitted to us
officially

01:53:04.629 --> 01:53:04.639 align:start position:0%
officially
 
01:53:07.189 --> 01:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
that that happened
 
01:53:07.199 --> 01:53:08.390 align:start position:0%
that that happened
okay

01:53:08.390 --> 01:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:53:11.510 --> 01:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you i i guess
 
01:53:12.390 --> 01:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
we could
 
01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:13.910 align:start position:0%
we could
uh

01:53:13.910 --> 01:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:53:15.510 --> 01:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh well
 
01:53:18.149 --> 01:53:18.159 align:start position:0%
i'll call upon uh representative frost
 
01:53:19.830 --> 01:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
to address that
 
01:53:22.310 --> 01:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
and but before i do that i'll just ask
 
01:53:24.470 --> 01:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
if there are any other questions
 
01:53:28.870 --> 01:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:31.750 --> 01:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
xenon thank you mr oh no i uh
 
01:53:36.390 --> 01:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:39.270 --> 01:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
sorry i wasn't fast enough um so
 
01:53:41.910 --> 01:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
according to mr barry then if a
 
01:53:44.950 --> 01:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
different amendment was put in it would
 
01:53:47.830 --> 01:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
eliminate the confusion
 
01:53:50.629 --> 01:53:50.639 align:start position:0%
by saying there was a simple form
 
01:53:54.790 --> 01:53:54.800 align:start position:0%
um is is someone going to um give us any
 
01:53:58.629 --> 01:53:58.639 align:start position:0%
language for that said amendment or
 
01:54:02.709 --> 01:54:02.719 align:start position:0%
yeah i could i mean i'll offer uh yeah
 
01:54:05.350 --> 01:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
it's a very simple amendment but if um
 
01:54:06.629 --> 01:54:06.639 align:start position:0%
if you would like me
 
01:54:09.109 --> 01:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
to do so i can provide it to uh the
 
01:54:12.070 --> 01:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
chairman or the whoever i'm supposed to
 
01:54:15.589 --> 01:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
provide it to uh within 24 hours for
 
01:54:18.070 --> 01:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
sure i just want to make sure that
 
01:54:18.080 --> 01:54:19.510 align:start position:0%
sure i just want to make sure that
i'm

01:54:19.510 --> 01:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
01:54:21.350 --> 01:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
straight on this because i was a little
 
01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:22.390 align:start position:0%
straight on this because i was a little
confused

01:54:22.390 --> 01:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
confused
 
01:54:25.030 --> 01:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:54:27.109 --> 01:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr mr terrify might this is
 
01:54:29.669 --> 01:54:29.679 align:start position:0%
representative frost um yes i was i was
 
01:54:32.390 --> 01:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
approached by um
 
01:54:36.070 --> 01:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
attorney barry and um
 
01:54:39.350 --> 01:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
asked about this so we submitted a um i
 
01:54:41.750 --> 01:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
i submitted the the amendment but then
 
01:54:44.070 --> 01:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
it was decided that the the problem that
 
01:54:46.709 --> 01:54:46.719 align:start position:0%
the amendment addresses can be taken
 
01:54:49.430 --> 01:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
care of by that change in the form so
 
01:54:51.430 --> 01:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
just a tick box on the form needs to be
 
01:54:54.229 --> 01:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
fixed so that we we can we can throw the
 
01:54:56.229 --> 01:54:56.239 align:start position:0%
amendment that you have in your hand out
 
01:54:58.470 --> 01:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
and put a new one in that addresses the
 
01:55:01.270 --> 01:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
form that the the tenants fill out
 
01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:03.430 align:start position:0%
form that the the tenants fill out
okay

01:55:03.430 --> 01:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
okay

and so the amendment that you had
 
01:55:09.030 --> 01:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
previously submitted we can ignore
 
01:55:10.950 --> 01:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
and you're not intending to go forward
 
01:55:13.109 --> 01:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
with that but uh
 
01:55:15.830 --> 01:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
mr barry you're going to be providing us
 
01:55:18.390 --> 01:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
with the language for a another
 
01:55:20.550 --> 01:55:20.560 align:start position:0%
amendment to address the issue which
 
01:55:22.070 --> 01:55:22.080 align:start position:0%

01:56:02.310 --> 01:56:02.320 align:start position:0%

like me you're drowning in emails and
 
01:56:25.109 --> 01:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's hard to find
 
01:56:27.189 --> 01:56:27.199 align:start position:0%
to make the connections with the
 
01:56:29.990 --> 01:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:33.189 --> 01:56:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:33.199 --> 01:56:35.669 align:start position:0%

01:56:53.350 --> 01:56:53.360 align:start position:0%
i s deuce i i now see elite
 
01:56:54.870 --> 01:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
attorney becker
 
01:56:56.629 --> 01:56:56.639 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:56:59.510 --> 01:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
with the hand raised so attorney becker
 
01:57:03.910 --> 01:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:07.990 --> 01:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:09.910 --> 01:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to testify today i i
 
01:57:12.310 --> 01:57:12.320 align:start position:0%
worked with representative frost on the
 
01:57:15.510 --> 01:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
crafting of this amendment i've had
 
01:57:16.950 --> 01:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
several of these kind of unique
 
01:57:19.830 --> 01:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
situations come forward in my practice
 
01:57:22.790 --> 01:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
where a landlord
 
01:57:24.629 --> 01:57:24.639 align:start position:0%
rents a room in their home
 
01:57:27.669 --> 01:57:27.679 align:start position:0%
shares their home with an individual
 
01:57:27.679 --> 01:57:28.870 align:start position:0%
shares their home with an individual
and

01:57:28.870 --> 01:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:57:30.790 --> 01:57:30.800 align:start position:0%
right as
 
01:57:33.350 --> 01:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
the landlord seeks to to
 
01:57:35.589 --> 01:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
kind of terminate the tenancy things go
 
01:57:37.589 --> 01:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
south very fast
 
01:57:39.350 --> 01:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
these can become very volatile
 
01:57:42.709 --> 01:57:42.719 align:start position:0%
situations as i think rsa 540b kind of
 
01:57:45.750 --> 01:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
contemplates with the short termination
 
01:57:47.830 --> 01:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
of tenancy process
 
01:57:50.310 --> 01:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
and i think that this
 
01:57:53.030 --> 01:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
this bill is important because
 
01:57:55.750 --> 01:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
in my experience
 
01:57:58.390 --> 01:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
there is some ambiguity in the law
 
01:58:01.750 --> 01:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
um and it's misunderstood by a lot of
 
01:58:04.149 --> 01:58:04.159 align:start position:0%
lay people landlords
 
01:58:04.159 --> 01:58:05.109 align:start position:0%
lay people landlords
tenants

01:58:05.109 --> 01:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
tenants
 
01:58:06.950 --> 01:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
the judiciary
 
01:58:09.830 --> 01:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
um and law enforcement so it creates a
 
01:58:11.510 --> 01:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
real headache for
 
01:58:15.350 --> 01:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
landlords that are seeking to
 
01:58:18.070 --> 01:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
terminate a tenancy and it can be a
 
01:58:23.350 --> 01:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:23.360 --> 01:58:25.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:58:25.030 --> 01:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:58:26.950 --> 01:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
all right when you started off by saying
 
01:58:29.270 --> 01:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
that you helped craft the
 
01:58:32.149 --> 01:58:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:33.830 --> 01:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
i helped craft the bill
 
01:58:35.270 --> 01:58:35.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:58:36.629 --> 01:58:36.639 align:start position:0%
for that
 
01:58:36.639 --> 01:58:38.470 align:start position:0%
for that
and

01:58:38.470 --> 01:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:58:40.550 --> 01:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh is there are there any questions uh
 
01:58:44.870 --> 01:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:46.550 --> 01:58:46.560 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:58:52.629 --> 01:58:52.639 align:start position:0%
i don't see anybody else who wishes uh
 
01:58:54.790 --> 01:58:54.800 align:start position:0%
that to testify who hasn't testified
 
01:58:57.910 --> 01:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
that i do see nick norman's hand up do
 
01:59:00.950 --> 01:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
you are you asking to testify again mr
 
01:59:03.990 --> 01:59:04.000 align:start position:0%

01:59:21.430 --> 01:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:21.440 --> 01:59:23.270 align:start position:0%

so

02:10:01.189 --> 02:10:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:01.199 --> 02:10:17.030 align:start position:0%

house judiciary committee
 
02:12:47.669 --> 02:12:47.679 align:start position:0%
our next bill to be heard this morning
 
02:12:50.390 --> 02:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
is house bill 395 fn relative to
 
02:12:52.950 --> 02:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
consideration of home share income
 
02:12:54.709 --> 02:12:54.719 align:start position:0%
and exempting rentals of shared
 
02:12:56.550 --> 02:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
facilities from requirements under the

real estate practice act
 
02:13:01.109 --> 02:13:01.119 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor is representative
 
02:13:01.119 --> 02:13:02.550 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor is representative
burroughs

02:13:02.550 --> 02:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
burroughs
 
02:13:03.990 --> 02:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
and representative burroughs would you
 
02:13:16.950 --> 02:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:19.510 --> 02:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
um i don't see representative burroughs
 
02:13:21.510 --> 02:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
on the attendee list
 
02:13:24.069 --> 02:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
i know she was there earlier she has an
 
02:13:26.310 --> 02:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
old uh version of zoom so i had to
 
02:13:27.990 --> 02:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
promote her to a panelist she should be
 
02:13:42.790 --> 02:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:45.189 --> 02:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
she's on now um
 
02:13:48.950 --> 02:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
mr chair i don't know if
 
02:13:50.790 --> 02:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
it doesn't look like she's muted so
 
02:13:53.189 --> 02:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
anita can you speak
 
02:13:55.589 --> 02:13:55.599 align:start position:0%
i think the problem is that um
 
02:13:58.069 --> 02:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs has a video
 
02:14:00.149 --> 02:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
feed but it doesn't appear that she's
 
02:14:01.910 --> 02:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
connected to audio
 
02:14:01.920 --> 02:14:05.189 align:start position:0%
connected to audio
ah

02:14:05.189 --> 02:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:07.270 --> 02:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
so i don't i don't see a microphone for
 
02:14:10.069 --> 02:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
you representative pearls um
 
02:14:11.750 --> 02:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
and you would need to look at your audio
 
02:14:15.189 --> 02:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
settings in the lower left
 
02:14:15.199 --> 02:14:18.790 align:start position:0%
settings in the lower left
um

02:14:18.790 --> 02:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:18.800 --> 02:14:19.750 align:start position:0%
 
but

02:14:19.750 --> 02:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:14:19.760 --> 02:14:20.550 align:start position:0%
but
you

02:14:20.550 --> 02:14:20.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:14:22.550 --> 02:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
or you could you could also access the
 
02:14:24.870 --> 02:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
meeting by telephone representative
 
02:14:27.350 --> 02:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
pearls using um
 
02:14:38.069 --> 02:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:39.270 --> 02:14:39.280 align:start position:0%
this is
 
02:14:41.669 --> 02:14:41.679 align:start position:0%
this is similar to what happened to uh
 
02:14:43.990 --> 02:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
supreme court justice convoy last week
 
02:14:52.560 --> 02:14:52.570 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:52.570 --> 02:15:07.270 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:15:07.270 --> 02:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:09.669 --> 02:15:09.679 align:start position:0%
perhaps what we could do is uh call upon
 
02:15:13.669 --> 02:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
other speakers and then come back to
 
02:15:18.229 --> 02:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:21.510 --> 02:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
and perhaps she if she can't
 
02:15:22.390 --> 02:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
have her
 
02:15:23.910 --> 02:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
computer function to make that work
 
02:15:26.950 --> 02:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps she could call in
 
02:15:29.109 --> 02:15:29.119 align:start position:0%
mr chair i would be happy to introduce
 
02:15:32.390 --> 02:15:32.400 align:start position:0%

people you know really is critical to
 
02:17:50.469 --> 02:17:50.479 align:start position:0%
the future of new hampshire we are at
 
02:17:51.830 --> 02:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
present the second oldest state in the
 
02:17:52.950 --> 02:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
country with one of the lowest
 
02:17:54.950 --> 02:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
unemployment rates and on top of this
 
02:17:56.709 --> 02:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
we're the number one exporter of high
 
02:17:58.309 --> 02:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
school graduates seeking a four-year
 
02:18:00.629 --> 02:18:00.639 align:start position:0%
degree with some 62 percent of these
 
02:18:01.990 --> 02:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
young people leaving the state every
 
02:18:04.790 --> 02:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
year some eventually come back but many
 
02:18:07.509 --> 02:18:07.519 align:start position:0%
don't in short new hampshire needs all
 
02:18:09.110 --> 02:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
the people we can get in general and all
 
02:18:10.469 --> 02:18:10.479 align:start position:0%
the young people we can get in
 
02:18:12.870 --> 02:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
particular our businesses need workers
 
02:18:15.030 --> 02:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
and customers our towns need volunteer
 
02:18:17.270 --> 02:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
board members our non-profits churches
 
02:18:19.270 --> 02:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
and civic clubs all need volunteers to
 
02:18:21.270 --> 02:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
accomplish their vital missions without
 
02:18:22.709 --> 02:18:22.719 align:start position:0%
which our communities just can't
 
02:18:24.870 --> 02:18:24.880 align:start position:0%
function so
 
02:18:26.709 --> 02:18:26.719 align:start position:0%
about three years ago state workplace
 
02:18:29.030 --> 02:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
commissioned a survey to collect data on
 
02:18:30.709 --> 02:18:30.719 align:start position:0%
why young people stay in new hampshire
 
02:18:32.709 --> 02:18:32.719 align:start position:0%
and why they might leave and the number
 
02:18:34.549 --> 02:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
one reason we found
 
02:18:36.549 --> 02:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
young people leaving is that they can't
 
02:18:39.110 --> 02:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
afford to live here our housing on both
 
02:18:41.030 --> 02:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
the rental and home ownership sides is
 
02:18:43.030 --> 02:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
just too expensive and we heard this
 
02:18:45.830 --> 02:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
again and again and again uh last fall
 
02:18:47.509 --> 02:18:47.519 align:start position:0%
and winter as we were out talking to
 
02:18:49.270 --> 02:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
young people in nine locations across
 
02:18:50.790 --> 02:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
the state as part of our policy and
 
02:18:53.270 --> 02:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
pints series
 
02:18:55.349 --> 02:18:55.359 align:start position:0%
so you know housing in new hampshire is
 
02:18:57.589 --> 02:18:57.599 align:start position:0%
expensive for everyone
 
02:18:59.830 --> 02:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
but it's especially expensive expensive
 
02:19:01.990 --> 02:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
for young people who by being early in
 
02:19:04.389 --> 02:19:04.399 align:start position:0%
their careers generally make less money
 
02:19:06.389 --> 02:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
than their more experienced counterparts
 
02:19:07.990 --> 02:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
young people also face the additional
 
02:19:10.150 --> 02:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
burden of student loan debt indeed here
 
02:19:11.190 --> 02:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire we have one of the
 
02:19:13.349 --> 02:19:13.359 align:start position:0%
highest student loan debts uh debt loads
 
02:19:14.950 --> 02:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
in the country and when you're paying
 
02:19:16.309 --> 02:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
hundreds of dollars in student loan
 
02:19:18.070 --> 02:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
payments each month on top of a car
 
02:19:20.309 --> 02:19:20.319 align:start position:0%
payment it makes it that much harder to
 
02:19:22.950 --> 02:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
afford housing that's already uh pretty
 
02:19:25.589 --> 02:19:25.599 align:start position:0%
expensive and so it's network play we're
 
02:19:27.589 --> 02:19:27.599 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill because uh you
 
02:19:29.190 --> 02:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
know it seeks to remove some of the
 
02:19:31.990 --> 02:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
disincentives to home sharing and uh you
 
02:19:33.429 --> 02:19:33.439 align:start position:0%
know this is a way we can continue to
 
02:19:35.270 --> 02:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
try to make new hampshire housing and
 
02:19:36.709 --> 02:19:36.719 align:start position:0%
new hampshire just a little bit more
 
02:19:38.950 --> 02:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
affordable for young people and everyone
 
02:19:40.549 --> 02:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
for that matter
 
02:19:42.230 --> 02:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
you know home sharing is just a small
 
02:19:43.429 --> 02:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
part of the overall housing
 
02:19:45.669 --> 02:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
affordability solution that could be but
 
02:19:47.750 --> 02:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
one that can be implemented immediately
 
02:19:49.429 --> 02:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
and really at no cost to anyone as it
 
02:19:50.870 --> 02:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't require new housing to be
 
02:19:54.070 --> 02:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
designed cited approved or constructed
 
02:19:56.309 --> 02:19:56.319 align:start position:0%
so for these reasons we are in support
 
02:19:58.070 --> 02:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
stay work play is in support of house
 
02:20:00.469 --> 02:20:00.479 align:start position:0%
bill 395 and we appreciate your
 
02:20:03.990 --> 02:20:04.000 align:start position:0%

i'm not going to reiterate um my written
 
02:21:04.950 --> 02:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
testimony just to give you a little bit
 
02:21:08.309 --> 02:21:08.319 align:start position:0%
background about how this came to be um
 
02:21:10.630 --> 02:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
this the home share actually started up
 
02:21:12.469 --> 02:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
in the mount washington valley
 
02:21:14.070 --> 02:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
because we have
 
02:21:16.230 --> 02:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of people particularly
 
02:21:19.349 --> 02:21:19.359 align:start position:0%
seniors who have may have a large home
 
02:21:21.830 --> 02:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
or plenty of space and
 
02:21:23.670 --> 02:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
despite having a big home may need
 
02:21:25.750 --> 02:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
additional income or may simply want
 
02:21:28.230 --> 02:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
company or want want roommates who might
 
02:21:31.030 --> 02:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
be able to help with snow plowing and uh
 
02:21:32.950 --> 02:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
even food shopping and preparing meals
 
02:21:35.270 --> 02:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
so that's how this came about um it was
 
02:21:38.150 --> 02:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
the program was modeled um on a a
 
02:21:40.469 --> 02:21:40.479 align:start position:0%
simpler program in vermont and it is
 
02:21:41.830 --> 02:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
applicable not just for the mount
 
02:21:43.590 --> 02:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
washington ballot but to across the
 
02:21:47.510 --> 02:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
state um it was put on hiatus um because
 
02:21:50.870 --> 02:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
of covert um but um i i believe somebody
 
02:21:52.550 --> 02:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
will be tested mary and dr marion
 
02:21:54.870 --> 02:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
jackson will be testifying um that
 
02:21:57.030 --> 02:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
there's been increasing interest in the
 
02:22:00.070 --> 02:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
program uh once once covered it becomes
 
02:22:02.550 --> 02:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
safe to do for so cause we have so many
 
02:22:04.790 --> 02:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
people coming to the valley to help out
 
02:22:07.110 --> 02:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
in the hospitality industry and the ski
 
02:22:08.870 --> 02:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
industry and this would really be
 
02:22:11.670 --> 02:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
helpful um and
 
02:22:13.349 --> 02:22:13.359 align:start position:0%
i personally know of a number of people
 
02:22:15.349 --> 02:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
who are in this situation who either
 
02:22:17.510 --> 02:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
need can't find housing they're forced
 
02:22:19.830 --> 02:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
to live an hour away in berlin or in
 
02:22:22.710 --> 02:22:22.720 align:start position:0%
brownfield maine um even nurses can't
 
02:22:24.469 --> 02:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
find housing here so it will be very
 
02:22:27.190 --> 02:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
helpful um although it's not gonna to um
 
02:22:29.270 --> 02:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
solve the housing sort this housing
 
02:22:32.230 --> 02:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
shortage um this bill was um put
 
02:22:36.950 --> 02:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
together hb 1305 in 1324 from 2020. both
 
02:22:39.510 --> 02:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
those bills passed through um committee
 
02:22:41.990 --> 02:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
um unanimously and because the covert
 
02:22:44.389 --> 02:22:44.399 align:start position:0%
got way late so um the two bills were
 
02:22:47.590 --> 02:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
put together the first part of the bill
 
02:22:50.070 --> 02:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
would exempt income from a home share
 
02:22:52.070 --> 02:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
arrangement from the determination of
 
02:22:54.230 --> 02:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
net assets for the purposes of
 
02:22:56.710 --> 02:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
determining eligibility for certain
 
02:22:59.030 --> 02:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
property tax exemptions
 
02:23:02.150 --> 02:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
exemptions and public eligibility
 
02:23:04.469 --> 02:23:04.479 align:start position:0%
determination and the second part would
 
02:23:07.910 --> 02:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
not would serve to not categorize these
 
02:23:09.830 --> 02:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
transactions as a real estate
 
02:23:09.840 --> 02:23:11.110 align:start position:0%
transactions as a real estate
transaction

02:23:11.110 --> 02:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
transaction
 
02:23:12.630 --> 02:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
and to
 
02:23:14.309 --> 02:23:14.319 align:start position:0%
exempt them from licensure and
 
02:23:15.990 --> 02:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
regulation by the new hampshire real
 
02:23:18.230 --> 02:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
estate commission and i'll talk to that
 
02:23:20.309 --> 02:23:20.319 align:start position:0%
one very briefly and first to say that
 
02:23:20.319 --> 02:23:21.349 align:start position:0%
one very briefly and first to say that
um

02:23:21.349 --> 02:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:22.630 --> 02:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
both the
 
02:23:25.110 --> 02:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
real estate association and the
 
02:23:27.110 --> 02:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
professional licensing bureau are
 
02:23:27.120 --> 02:23:28.790 align:start position:0%
professional licensing bureau are
neutral

02:23:28.790 --> 02:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
neutral
 
02:23:31.670 --> 02:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of this part of the bill
 
02:23:33.670 --> 02:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
and the reason it's to be exempt is
 
02:23:35.429 --> 02:23:35.439 align:start position:0%
because the home share actually takes
 
02:23:38.070 --> 02:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
over a lot of the functions of um that
 
02:23:40.630 --> 02:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
the realtors previously did
 
02:23:42.469 --> 02:23:42.479 align:start position:0%
the people are screened by the home
 
02:23:43.910 --> 02:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
share program
 
02:23:45.190 --> 02:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
they're then brought together and they
 
02:23:47.510 --> 02:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
do their own their own form of beliefs
 
02:23:49.510 --> 02:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
they put that together themselves so
 
02:23:51.190 --> 02:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
that's taking it out of the hands of the
 
02:23:53.830 --> 02:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
the real the realtors and um and it's
 
02:23:56.070 --> 02:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
really unnecessary because again the
 
02:23:59.030 --> 02:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
parties involved are the ones who um
 
02:24:02.070 --> 02:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
who make that come to the agreement um
 
02:24:03.830 --> 02:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
in reading the bill for the hundredth
 
02:24:07.030 --> 02:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
time i um i saw something that i think
 
02:24:09.990 --> 02:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
actually probably um should be changed
 
02:24:12.830 --> 02:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
and just written the wording
 
02:24:12.840 --> 02:24:14.630 align:start position:0%
and just written the wording
um

02:24:14.630 --> 02:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:17.590 --> 02:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
it talks about um
 
02:24:20.309 --> 02:24:20.319 align:start position:0%
that some of the home share uh folks may
 
02:24:23.590 --> 02:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
receive um or reduce rent in exchange
 
02:24:25.670 --> 02:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
for chores and i'm not sure that that
 
02:24:27.270 --> 02:24:27.280 align:start position:0%
needs to be in the bill because not
 
02:24:30.150 --> 02:24:30.160 align:start position:0%
everybody not everybody um has that type
 
02:24:32.150 --> 02:24:32.160 align:start position:0%
of arrangement some people just just
 
02:24:34.550 --> 02:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
come in and they rent the space and the
 
02:24:37.429 --> 02:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
um owner does not need or want tours or
 
02:24:39.910 --> 02:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing so it's it's it's a
 
02:24:42.950 --> 02:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
it's a nice to have but um not everybody
 
02:24:46.150 --> 02:24:46.160 align:start position:0%
um who is involved in this practice um
 
02:24:49.590 --> 02:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
will do so so um again i i've already
 
02:24:52.230 --> 02:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
given testimony and and in the i know i
 
02:24:55.429 --> 02:24:55.439 align:start position:0%
have to 115 to speak but i will i will i
 
02:24:57.110 --> 02:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
will ease your mind and i will not be
 
02:24:59.190 --> 02:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
doing that and i will stop and ask
 
02:24:59.200 --> 02:25:01.030 align:start position:0%
doing that and i will stop and ask
questions

02:25:01.030 --> 02:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:25:03.030 --> 02:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
okay representative sylvia did you have
 
02:25:05.670 --> 02:25:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:07.110 --> 02:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
02:25:09.830 --> 02:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh i see the term in
 
02:25:12.150 --> 02:25:12.160 align:start position:0%
here home chair but i don't see it
 
02:25:14.309 --> 02:25:14.319 align:start position:0%
defined anywhere in the statutes is that
 
02:25:17.429 --> 02:25:17.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:17.439 --> 02:25:21.429 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:25:21.429 --> 02:25:21.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:24.469 --> 02:25:24.479 align:start position:0%
i i don't we don't have a specific um
 
02:25:26.870 --> 02:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
um definition of it but i think it's i i
 
02:25:29.110 --> 02:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
think in the name itself is pretty it
 
02:25:31.990 --> 02:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
pretty um explains it you're sharing
 
02:25:33.510 --> 02:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
you're sharing your home with somebody
 
02:25:36.150 --> 02:25:36.160 align:start position:0%
in this case you know we're targeting um
 
02:25:37.750 --> 02:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
workers and and
 
02:25:41.349 --> 02:25:41.359 align:start position:0%
either individual workers or families
 
02:25:43.510 --> 02:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
and to my knowledge the program that was
 
02:25:43.520 --> 02:25:44.790 align:start position:0%
and to my knowledge the program that was
initiated

02:25:44.790 --> 02:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
initiated
 
02:25:46.469 --> 02:25:46.479 align:start position:0%
in the mount washington valley was the
 
02:25:47.990 --> 02:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
first of its kind
 
02:25:50.150 --> 02:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
they suggested that we not
 
02:25:52.389 --> 02:25:52.399 align:start position:0%
um specifically talk to that in the
 
02:25:54.070 --> 02:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
language of the bill but just make it
 
02:25:56.790 --> 02:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:59.110 --> 02:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:26:01.750 --> 02:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
and representative burch
 
02:26:04.070 --> 02:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and and thank you
 
02:26:06.230 --> 02:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs it's good to
 
02:26:07.349 --> 02:26:07.359 align:start position:0%
see you here
 
02:26:09.510 --> 02:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
in judiciary again
 
02:26:09.520 --> 02:26:10.469 align:start position:0%
in judiciary again
um

02:26:10.469 --> 02:26:10.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:26:11.510 --> 02:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
for those of us who are not
 
02:26:14.630 --> 02:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
sophisticated about these issues
 
02:26:17.750 --> 02:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
i want to follow up your answer that you
 
02:26:19.910 --> 02:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
just gave because i'm wondering about
 
02:26:21.349 --> 02:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
the target
 
02:26:21.359 --> 02:26:22.230 align:start position:0%
the target
of

02:26:22.230 --> 02:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:26:24.870 --> 02:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
this legislation i hear
 
02:26:27.110 --> 02:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
affordable housing i hear
 
02:26:27.120 --> 02:26:28.710 align:start position:0%
affordable housing i hear
seniors

02:26:28.710 --> 02:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
seniors
 
02:26:30.950 --> 02:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
but i'm wondering whether the target of
 
02:26:33.510 --> 02:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
this legislation is really
 
02:26:33.520 --> 02:26:35.110 align:start position:0%
this legislation is really
because

02:26:35.110 --> 02:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:26:35.120 --> 02:26:35.990 align:start position:0%
because
the

02:26:35.990 --> 02:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:26:38.469 --> 02:26:38.479 align:start position:0%
valley is a big ski area
 
02:26:41.030 --> 02:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
and these are people perhaps
 
02:26:42.389 --> 02:26:42.399 align:start position:0%
would this allow
 
02:26:44.950 --> 02:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh people who want to allow who want to
 
02:26:44.960 --> 02:26:45.990 align:start position:0%
uh people who want to allow who want to
have

02:26:45.990 --> 02:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:26:48.469 --> 02:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
other skiers come and have
 
02:26:52.630 --> 02:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
14 people in their uh homes renting
 
02:26:55.910 --> 02:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
and exempt them from any kind of state
 
02:26:59.110 --> 02:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
regulation uh no
 
02:26:59.120 --> 02:27:00.710 align:start position:0%
regulation uh no
no

02:27:00.710 --> 02:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:27:03.110 --> 02:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
just to finish how would this
 
02:27:05.750 --> 02:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
not apply to that
 
02:27:07.750 --> 02:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't it doesn't at all
 
02:27:10.550 --> 02:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
representative burch um this is not this
 
02:27:12.950 --> 02:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
is not for first of all there is an
 
02:27:15.990 --> 02:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
agreement involved um that is a long a
 
02:27:19.349 --> 02:27:19.359 align:start position:0%
longer term rental um so it's not it's
 
02:27:21.030 --> 02:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
not for a week or
 
02:27:24.389 --> 02:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
six months it is it is specifically um
 
02:27:27.590 --> 02:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
for people to to have a home so no it is
 
02:27:29.429 --> 02:27:29.439 align:start position:0%
not targeting skiers and this would not
 
02:27:31.990 --> 02:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
be applicable to them and the home share
 
02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:32.950 align:start position:0%
be applicable to them and the home share
program

02:27:32.950 --> 02:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:27:34.309 --> 02:27:34.319 align:start position:0%
the one that is set up in the mount
 
02:27:36.870 --> 02:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
washington valley would not entertain
 
02:27:39.110 --> 02:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
those types of agreements at all in in
 
02:27:41.349 --> 02:27:41.359 align:start position:0%
the in the they do the matchmaking and
 
02:27:44.389 --> 02:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
they would not entertain that
 
02:27:46.070 --> 02:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up
 
02:27:46.080 --> 02:27:47.990 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up
representative

02:27:47.990 --> 02:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:27:50.230 --> 02:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering if there's anything
 
02:27:51.670 --> 02:27:51.680 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
02:27:53.110 --> 02:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
that would keep
 
02:27:56.309 --> 02:27:56.319 align:start position:0%
um this from happening
 
02:27:58.150 --> 02:27:58.160 align:start position:0%
no there isn't but i think we'd be open
 
02:28:00.230 --> 02:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
to adding a clause if you feel that that
 
02:28:03.190 --> 02:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
would be important to do so
 
02:28:05.830 --> 02:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:08.870 --> 02:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
representative alexander
 
02:28:11.590 --> 02:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chair and uh thank you
 
02:28:13.429 --> 02:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
to my former colleague on judiciary for
 
02:28:14.790 --> 02:28:14.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:28:18.230 --> 02:28:18.240 align:start position:0%
um my question is or my question concern
 
02:28:20.469 --> 02:28:20.479 align:start position:0%
is around not defining the term home
 
02:28:20.479 --> 02:28:21.510 align:start position:0%
is around not defining the term home
share

02:28:21.510 --> 02:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
share
 
02:28:23.510 --> 02:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
because we've heard a lot of
 
02:28:25.830 --> 02:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
testimony today about landlord right
 
02:28:28.389 --> 02:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
tenant rights all that jazz and i guess
 
02:28:29.750 --> 02:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
are we going to run into the trouble
 
02:28:31.429 --> 02:28:31.439 align:start position:0%
that we're running in right now with the
 
02:28:33.270 --> 02:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
other bills that we're discussing by not
 
02:28:35.030 --> 02:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
actually defining what home share is in
 
02:28:35.040 --> 02:28:38.469 align:start position:0%
actually defining what home share is in
statute

02:28:38.469 --> 02:28:38.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:40.230 --> 02:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
i think that you know frank i think that
 
02:28:42.870 --> 02:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
would be for the committee to um
 
02:28:46.469 --> 02:28:46.479 align:start position:0%
to discern um i i personally think that
 
02:28:48.150 --> 02:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
that you know
 
02:28:49.990 --> 02:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
the home share is clear but you know
 
02:28:51.590 --> 02:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
again would intert would be happy to
 
02:28:53.750 --> 02:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
entertain i'm putting a definition of
 
02:28:56.790 --> 02:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:59.830 --> 02:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:59.840 --> 02:29:00.630 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:29:00.630 --> 02:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:29:04.469 --> 02:29:04.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:06.230 --> 02:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i had i had
 
02:29:08.150 --> 02:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
lowered my hand because representative
 
02:29:10.550 --> 02:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
alexander had kind of covered it but um
 
02:29:13.110 --> 02:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
speaking to representative burch's point
 
02:29:16.070 --> 02:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
i think i think his point is again why
 
02:29:19.590 --> 02:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
we need a definition of home chair
 
02:29:19.600 --> 02:29:21.110 align:start position:0%
we need a definition of home chair
also

02:29:21.110 --> 02:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
also
 
02:29:23.910 --> 02:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
now i appreciate that i i actually i i i
 
02:29:27.990 --> 02:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:40.309 --> 02:29:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:42.469 --> 02:29:42.479 align:start position:0%
you're muted representative chase i
 
02:29:42.479 --> 02:29:48.230 align:start position:0%
you're muted representative chase i
think

02:29:48.230 --> 02:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:48.240 --> 02:29:49.349 align:start position:0%
 
hello

02:29:49.349 --> 02:29:49.359 align:start position:0%
hello
 
02:29:51.830 --> 02:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
hello can you hear me we can hear you
 
02:29:54.230 --> 02:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
now okay sorry i'm having difficulties
 
02:29:55.830 --> 02:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
with this new computer
 
02:29:57.830 --> 02:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you again and
 
02:30:00.309 --> 02:30:00.319 align:start position:0%
uh representative burroughs what exactly
 
02:30:03.270 --> 02:30:03.280 align:start position:0%
is the criteria for long term did you
 
02:30:06.070 --> 02:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
state that is it a year is it three
 
02:30:08.469 --> 02:30:08.479 align:start position:0%
years six months that
 
02:30:09.990 --> 02:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
that's a good question representative
 
02:30:12.550 --> 02:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
chase that actually will depend on the
 
02:30:15.590 --> 02:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
two parties and what a lot of people do
 
02:30:17.750 --> 02:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
like in the vermont um in the scenario
 
02:30:19.429 --> 02:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
of the vermont agency that this is
 
02:30:21.990 --> 02:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
modeled on oftentimes people will do a
 
02:30:25.429 --> 02:30:25.439 align:start position:0%
trial run maybe 30 60 days and then they
 
02:30:27.590 --> 02:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
decide the beauty of this program is
 
02:30:29.990 --> 02:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
that the two parties decide what they
 
02:30:31.910 --> 02:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
want to do and what kind of arrangement
 
02:30:33.510 --> 02:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
they want to make
 
02:30:33.520 --> 02:30:34.469 align:start position:0%
they want to make
but

02:30:34.469 --> 02:30:34.479 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:30:37.349 --> 02:30:37.359 align:start position:0%
again the agency the again in this case
 
02:30:40.070 --> 02:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
is the gibson center will not entertain
 
02:30:42.150 --> 02:30:42.160 align:start position:0%
um scenarios where their skiers are
 
02:30:43.990 --> 02:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
looking for a place to stay for for a
 
02:30:45.270 --> 02:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks
 
02:30:48.070 --> 02:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
to get a cheap rent that kind of thing
 
02:30:51.349 --> 02:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
could i follow up with that
 
02:30:54.710 --> 02:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
you may thank you very much and uh okay
 
02:30:57.190 --> 02:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
so then that makes me wonder about those
 
02:30:59.429 --> 02:30:59.439 align:start position:0%
people what if they go in there with the
 
02:31:01.270 --> 02:31:01.280 align:start position:0%
pretense if they're just going to rent
 
02:31:04.070 --> 02:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
for the winter season or for
 
02:31:05.830 --> 02:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
a couple of months and it's on a trial
 
02:31:08.309 --> 02:31:08.319 align:start position:0%
basis are there going to be regulations
 
02:31:10.309 --> 02:31:10.319 align:start position:0%
for that so it's not the
 
02:31:12.150 --> 02:31:12.160 align:start position:0%
keep picking on skiers but people that
 
02:31:15.510 --> 02:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
are just going up there to recreate
 
02:31:16.630 --> 02:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
well they're good they're going to have
 
02:31:18.630 --> 02:31:18.640 align:start position:0%
to go through this screening process so
 
02:31:20.469 --> 02:31:20.479 align:start position:0%
it would be a lot of work
 
02:31:23.190 --> 02:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
for them to to go through this pretense
 
02:31:25.110 --> 02:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
to get to get that and it's not like
 
02:31:26.870 --> 02:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
they're going to get cheap digs
 
02:31:29.750 --> 02:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
you know so there you know there is a um
 
02:31:31.349 --> 02:31:31.359 align:start position:0%
again the one the re some people say
 
02:31:32.550 --> 02:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
well why don't you just do this on
 
02:31:34.950 --> 02:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
craigslist well craigslist doesn't go
 
02:31:36.550 --> 02:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
through screening it doesn't do criminal
 
02:31:38.630 --> 02:31:38.640 align:start position:0%
background track check which is one of
 
02:31:40.870 --> 02:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
the things the program does so they'd
 
02:31:42.309 --> 02:31:42.319 align:start position:0%
have to go through a heck of a lot of
 
02:31:45.110 --> 02:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
work um just to get lodging and i don't
 
02:31:46.870 --> 02:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
think it would be worth their while to
 
02:31:47.750 --> 02:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
do it
 
02:31:50.230 --> 02:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much
 
02:31:57.750 --> 02:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:00.309 --> 02:32:00.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
02:32:02.309 --> 02:32:02.319 align:start position:0%
good morning representative burroughs
 
02:32:05.110 --> 02:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
it's great to see you i have a couple of
 
02:32:06.870 --> 02:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
questions um
 
02:32:08.790 --> 02:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
and one is how is this arrangement
 
02:32:12.309 --> 02:32:12.319 align:start position:0%
different from a rooming house
 
02:32:14.469 --> 02:32:14.479 align:start position:0%
oh okay well i think i think the main
 
02:32:16.950 --> 02:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
differential here is the screening
 
02:32:19.830 --> 02:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
process again um and there may be
 
02:32:21.590 --> 02:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
programs that are going to be set up in
 
02:32:23.270 --> 02:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
different parts of the state so right
 
02:32:25.750 --> 02:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
now the gibson center being the only one
 
02:32:28.150 --> 02:32:28.160 align:start position:0%
that i know of i can only speak to that
 
02:32:29.750 --> 02:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
but um
 
02:32:31.030 --> 02:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
but um
 
02:32:33.429 --> 02:32:33.439 align:start position:0%
it's not a rooming house because because
 
02:32:35.349 --> 02:32:35.359 align:start position:0%
there you know there's this again it's
 
02:32:36.710 --> 02:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
the screening it's the criminal
 
02:32:39.190 --> 02:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
backgrounds check and ultimately the two
 
02:32:42.950 --> 02:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
parties do agree upon what the terms are
 
02:32:44.870 --> 02:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
but there's a lot of background that
 
02:32:46.790 --> 02:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
goes into it that might not happen with
 
02:32:49.270 --> 02:32:49.280 align:start position:0%
a rooming house scenario so it also
 
02:32:52.230 --> 02:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
provides the safety net for a senior who
 
02:32:54.230 --> 02:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
may be concerned about who's coming into
 
02:32:56.230 --> 02:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
their home and they have secure some
 
02:32:58.790 --> 02:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
security knowing that the person um
 
02:33:01.190 --> 02:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a criminal record you know
 
02:33:02.710 --> 02:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
not involved with drugs that kind of
 
02:33:02.720 --> 02:33:04.389 align:start position:0%
not involved with drugs that kind of
thing

02:33:04.389 --> 02:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
thing
 
02:33:07.030 --> 02:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
thank you may i ask a second question mr
 
02:33:07.040 --> 02:33:13.830 align:start position:0%
thank you may i ask a second question mr
chair

02:33:13.830 --> 02:33:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:17.190 --> 02:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
may i ask a second question mr chair
 
02:33:20.550 --> 02:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
you certainly may okay thank you um
 
02:33:22.309 --> 02:33:22.319 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs
 
02:33:24.950 --> 02:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
my question is around fitness for
 
02:33:27.429 --> 02:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
um human habitability
 
02:33:30.790 --> 02:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
um and housing code
 
02:33:34.950 --> 02:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
regulations is our home share
 
02:33:40.469 --> 02:33:40.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:43.190 --> 02:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
that is an excellent question
 
02:33:45.429 --> 02:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
um and i don't know
 
02:33:47.670 --> 02:33:47.680 align:start position:0%
i i'm going to leave if you don't mind
 
02:33:50.550 --> 02:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
dr jackson i believe will be on the call
 
02:33:52.389 --> 02:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
and she could better answer that in
 
02:33:54.309 --> 02:33:54.319 align:start position:0%
terms of what they do if there's any
 
02:33:56.230 --> 02:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
inspection and what they do in terms of
 
02:33:57.990 --> 02:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
that so i would like to defer that
 
02:34:00.070 --> 02:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
question to her if you don't mind thank
 
02:34:03.510 --> 02:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:05.190 --> 02:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative
 
02:34:06.790 --> 02:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
burroughs yes
 
02:34:09.830 --> 02:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:12.150 --> 02:34:12.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman sorry bear with me
 
02:34:14.790 --> 02:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
because again this is all new to me so
 
02:34:17.349 --> 02:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm curious is there some sort of a
 
02:34:19.510 --> 02:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
certificate that comes along with this
 
02:34:21.270 --> 02:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
what's to prevent
 
02:34:23.910 --> 02:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
people from having
 
02:34:26.150 --> 02:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
10 people in their homes with these
 
02:34:28.950 --> 02:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
rooms how do they prove that this was
 
02:34:30.870 --> 02:34:30.880 align:start position:0%
through the home share program and not
 
02:34:32.309 --> 02:34:32.319 align:start position:0%
that they just
 
02:34:37.270 --> 02:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
um rented rooms am i missing something
 
02:34:39.510 --> 02:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i i'm not sure how to
 
02:34:42.469 --> 02:34:42.479 align:start position:0%
answer that question because again
 
02:34:45.349 --> 02:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
you've got a signed agreement between
 
02:34:46.710 --> 02:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
two parties
 
02:34:49.030 --> 02:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
you know let's let's just say mary smith
 
02:34:50.950 --> 02:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
wants to rent to to
 
02:34:51.910 --> 02:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:34:51.920 --> 02:34:52.950 align:start position:0%
you know
um

02:34:52.950 --> 02:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:52.960 --> 02:34:53.910 align:start position:0%
um
donna

02:34:53.910 --> 02:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
donna
 
02:34:55.670 --> 02:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
and they signed an agreement and if
 
02:34:57.750 --> 02:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
donna was to show up with 10 people
 
02:34:59.750 --> 02:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
she'd have you would do what you did
 
02:35:01.830 --> 02:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
would do in a in any other scenario you
 
02:35:03.990 --> 02:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
would you would um
 
02:35:05.349 --> 02:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
the agreement would not be being
 
02:35:08.870 --> 02:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
followed and you would have cause to to
 
02:35:11.510 --> 02:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
remove them from the home
 
02:35:14.309 --> 02:35:14.319 align:start position:0%
up mr chairman you may i'm sorry i don't
 
02:35:15.990 --> 02:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
i don't think i phrased my question
 
02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:17.510 align:start position:0%
i don't think i phrased my question
correctly

02:35:17.510 --> 02:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
02:35:19.910 --> 02:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
so say my neighbor
 
02:35:22.630 --> 02:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
tells me they're in this home share
 
02:35:22.640 --> 02:35:24.070 align:start position:0%
tells me they're in this home share
thing

02:35:24.070 --> 02:35:24.080 align:start position:0%
thing
 
02:35:25.670 --> 02:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
and they have
 
02:35:29.510 --> 02:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:31.670 --> 02:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
that are actually going weekly but
 
02:35:33.429 --> 02:35:33.439 align:start position:0%
they're telling me
 
02:35:35.830 --> 02:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
that it's through the home share program
 
02:35:39.190 --> 02:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:42.870 --> 02:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
this from being abused when there's not
 
02:35:45.030 --> 02:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
a formal agreement with that home shared
 
02:35:47.349 --> 02:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
thing am i making any sense
 
02:35:49.030 --> 02:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
yeah no i understand what you're saying
 
02:35:52.309 --> 02:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
and again the home share the agency
 
02:35:54.550 --> 02:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
would not in any way facilitate
 
02:35:56.469 --> 02:35:56.479 align:start position:0%
that type of arrangement so let's just
 
02:35:58.870 --> 02:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
say donna then i mean i'm sorry i think
 
02:36:01.590 --> 02:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
i said sue was the homeowner if sue goes
 
02:36:04.389 --> 02:36:04.399 align:start position:0%
out on her own and fills the rooms up um
 
02:36:07.030 --> 02:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
she's that is something outside the
 
02:36:09.910 --> 02:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
boundaries of the home share
 
02:36:11.910 --> 02:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
and i don't think the agency could could
 
02:36:14.469 --> 02:36:14.479 align:start position:0%
be liable for that or responsible for
 
02:36:14.479 --> 02:36:20.150 align:start position:0%
be liable for that or responsible for
that

02:36:20.150 --> 02:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:22.630 --> 02:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
could i just follow up on that
 
02:36:25.270 --> 02:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
if as i look at the bill
 
02:36:28.389 --> 02:36:28.399 align:start position:0%
does the bill require that this be done
 
02:36:31.750 --> 02:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
through an agency
 
02:36:40.070 --> 02:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:40.080 --> 02:36:42.070 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:36:42.070 --> 02:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:36:43.750 --> 02:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
and uh there are other questions for
 
02:36:48.389 --> 02:36:48.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:50.150 --> 02:36:50.160 align:start position:0%

02:38:30.710 --> 02:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
served carroll county district 2 during
 
02:38:33.750 --> 02:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
the last last session and i was
 
02:38:36.469 --> 02:38:36.479 align:start position:0%
one of the co-sponsors on these bills
 
02:38:38.870 --> 02:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
and i was the lead sponsor on the real
 
02:38:41.590 --> 02:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
estate portion of the bill and so i did
 
02:38:44.309 --> 02:38:44.319 align:start position:0%
want to just um follow up actually um
 
02:38:46.070 --> 02:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
before i give my testimony on some of
 
02:38:47.270 --> 02:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
the questions you all have been
 
02:38:47.280 --> 02:38:48.309 align:start position:0%
the questions you all have been
mentioning

02:38:48.309 --> 02:38:48.319 align:start position:0%
mentioning
 
02:38:51.670 --> 02:38:51.680 align:start position:0%
um this is a complicated um topic
 
02:38:53.110 --> 02:38:53.120 align:start position:0%
that there is
 
02:38:55.590 --> 02:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
some definition in statute um home share
 
02:38:58.550 --> 02:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
is in reference to the rental of shared
 
02:39:00.950 --> 02:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
facilities shared facilities are defined
 
02:39:02.950 --> 02:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
in rsa 540b
 
02:39:05.429 --> 02:39:05.439 align:start position:0%
a shared facility is real property
 
02:39:07.750 --> 02:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
rented for residential purposes which
 
02:39:10.230 --> 02:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
has separate sleeping areas for each
 
02:39:13.270 --> 02:39:13.280 align:start position:0%
occupant and in which each occupant has
 
02:39:15.590 --> 02:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
access to and shares with the owner of
 
02:39:18.309 --> 02:39:18.319 align:start position:0%
the facility one or more significant
 
02:39:20.870 --> 02:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
portions of the facility in common this
 
02:39:22.950 --> 02:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
would be something like a kitchen a
 
02:39:25.990 --> 02:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
dining area or a bathroom
 
02:39:28.710 --> 02:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
um so just i know that that was kind of
 
02:39:30.230 --> 02:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
a concern a lot of you had raised so i
 
02:39:32.469 --> 02:39:32.479 align:start position:0%
just wanted to note that that is what
 
02:39:35.110 --> 02:39:35.120 align:start position:0%
home share is it would fall under um
 
02:39:36.870 --> 02:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
that i believe it would fall under that
 
02:39:38.469 --> 02:39:38.479 align:start position:0%
definition that was my understanding
 
02:39:40.309 --> 02:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
when i worked with
 
02:39:42.050 --> 02:39:42.060 align:start position:0%
ols last year
 
02:39:42.060 --> 02:39:43.670 align:start position:0%
ols last year
[Music]

02:39:43.670 --> 02:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:39:45.429 --> 02:39:45.439 align:start position:0%
by that definition
 
02:39:45.439 --> 02:39:46.309 align:start position:0%
by that definition
um

02:39:46.309 --> 02:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:47.910 --> 02:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
that i think answers some of the other
 
02:39:49.750 --> 02:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
questions you had as well each occupant
 
02:39:51.670 --> 02:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
must have their own sleeping facility so
 
02:39:53.670 --> 02:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
as far as having you know 10 people in
 
02:39:55.990 --> 02:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
one room that would not count that would
 
02:39:57.990 --> 02:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
just be called airbnb and we see it all
 
02:39:59.910 --> 02:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
the time up here
 
02:40:01.830 --> 02:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
in fact if you want to regulate that i
 
02:40:03.990 --> 02:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
would please let me know
 
02:40:05.990 --> 02:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
because it is currently not regulated
 
02:40:09.349 --> 02:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
really um but no this this is um this is
 
02:40:11.990 --> 02:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
just a program wherein um specifically
 
02:40:13.349 --> 02:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
elderly folk
 
02:40:16.550 --> 02:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
can work with um can come to an
 
02:40:16.560 --> 02:40:17.510 align:start position:0%
can work with um can come to an
agreement

02:40:17.510 --> 02:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
02:40:19.349 --> 02:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
with some other folks um and they're
 
02:40:20.710 --> 02:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
brought together
 
02:40:22.309 --> 02:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
through this program so how the home
 
02:40:24.710 --> 02:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
share program facilitates this is
 
02:40:27.590 --> 02:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
essentially they take in homeowners they
 
02:40:28.710 --> 02:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
do a
 
02:40:31.349 --> 02:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
personality profile test with them um
 
02:40:33.429 --> 02:40:33.439 align:start position:0%
they take kind of you know what what
 
02:40:35.670 --> 02:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
they're offering as a living facility
 
02:40:37.110 --> 02:40:37.120 align:start position:0%
and what they're looking for for
 
02:40:38.870 --> 02:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
compensation sometimes it's purely
 
02:40:40.550 --> 02:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
monetary sometimes there's no money
 
02:40:42.389 --> 02:40:42.399 align:start position:0%
involved at all could as as
 
02:40:44.389 --> 02:40:44.399 align:start position:0%
representative burrows uh suggested it
 
02:40:46.230 --> 02:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
could just be you know shoveling the
 
02:40:48.790 --> 02:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
walkway on a day like today or something
 
02:40:50.790 --> 02:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
of that nature you know taking helping
 
02:40:52.630 --> 02:40:52.640 align:start position:0%
take care of the facility
 
02:40:52.640 --> 02:40:53.590 align:start position:0%
take care of the facility
um

02:40:53.590 --> 02:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:55.270 --> 02:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
and what the home share program then
 
02:40:57.349 --> 02:40:57.359 align:start position:0%
also does is reaches out to potential
 
02:40:59.590 --> 02:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
tenants who come in and do the very
 
02:41:02.790 --> 02:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
similar you know personality test um and
 
02:41:04.469 --> 02:41:04.479 align:start position:0%
they work with them in that regard and
 
02:41:06.389 --> 02:41:06.399 align:start position:0%
then what they do is it's it's very much
 
02:41:08.389 --> 02:41:08.399 align:start position:0%
like a dating app they basically say hey
 
02:41:10.550 --> 02:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
you two are a compatible match get
 
02:41:14.150 --> 02:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
together they have um lease agreements
 
02:41:16.630 --> 02:41:16.640 align:start position:0%
that are examples that the that the
 
02:41:19.349 --> 02:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
homeowner can look at but ultimately
 
02:41:21.270 --> 02:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
whatever compensation is decided upon
 
02:41:23.510 --> 02:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
whatever agreement is decided upon is
 
02:41:25.190 --> 02:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
between those parties and the home share
 
02:41:27.030 --> 02:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
program does not actually facilitate
 
02:41:29.510 --> 02:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
that transaction all they do is pair
 
02:41:31.190 --> 02:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
them together
 
02:41:31.200 --> 02:41:32.230 align:start position:0%
them together
um

02:41:32.230 --> 02:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:35.429 --> 02:41:35.439 align:start position:0%
so that that's how that piece works um
 
02:41:37.429 --> 02:41:37.439 align:start position:0%
and just to give you some ideas on on
 
02:41:39.590 --> 02:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
that elderly piece again um carroll
 
02:41:41.590 --> 02:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
county it was already stated that new
 
02:41:43.510 --> 02:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire is one of the oldest states in
 
02:41:46.150 --> 02:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
the country by mr stewart carroll county
 
02:41:48.550 --> 02:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
where this would be operating is is one
 
02:41:50.150 --> 02:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
of the oldest counties in the state and
 
02:41:52.230 --> 02:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
one of the most rapidly aging
 
02:41:55.190 --> 02:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
aarp actually did a study
 
02:41:58.309 --> 02:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
um looking specifically at rural
 
02:42:01.030 --> 02:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
communities and in elderly communities
 
02:42:03.910 --> 02:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
in rural areas they found that 72
 
02:42:07.429 --> 02:42:07.439 align:start position:0%
percent of of retirees in rural
 
02:42:10.389 --> 02:42:10.399 align:start position:0%
communities said that they want
 
02:42:12.950 --> 02:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
what they'd really like is to remain in
 
02:42:15.349 --> 02:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
their community as long as possible and
 
02:42:15.359 --> 02:42:16.790 align:start position:0%
their community as long as possible and
73

02:42:16.790 --> 02:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
73
 
02:42:18.230 --> 02:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
said that not only do they want to
 
02:42:20.150 --> 02:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
remain in their community but they want
 
02:42:23.190 --> 02:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
to remain in their current residence
 
02:42:24.870 --> 02:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:42:28.070 --> 02:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
would allow for programs uh nonprofit
 
02:42:29.510 --> 02:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
programs who want to operate this
 
02:42:31.110 --> 02:42:31.120 align:start position:0%
matching system
 
02:42:33.670 --> 02:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
to operate within our state
 
02:42:35.670 --> 02:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
and so that is why um
 
02:42:37.429 --> 02:42:37.439 align:start position:0%
i wanted to give you all my testimony i
 
02:42:39.190 --> 02:42:39.200 align:start position:0%
sent you a written testimony that really
 
02:42:41.349 --> 02:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
gets into the weeds on kind of the real
 
02:42:43.110 --> 02:42:43.120 align:start position:0%
estate aspect of it i won't go into that
 
02:42:45.910 --> 02:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
detail um unless you would like me to
 
02:42:48.710 --> 02:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm open to any questions and um
 
02:42:50.710 --> 02:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
though i am not representing the the
 
02:42:52.070 --> 02:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
mount washington valley uh housing
 
02:42:53.830 --> 02:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
coalition in this testimony i do know
 
02:42:56.309 --> 02:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
that they support this bill if if that
 
02:43:02.870 --> 02:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:15.510 --> 02:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:17.190 --> 02:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
we can't hear you
 
02:43:17.200 --> 02:43:19.270 align:start position:0%
we can't hear you
sorry

02:43:19.270 --> 02:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:43:19.280 --> 02:43:21.270 align:start position:0%
sorry
yeah

02:43:21.270 --> 02:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:43:23.750 --> 02:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
question this sounds like this is all
 
02:43:25.030 --> 02:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about is going
 
02:43:27.349 --> 02:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
through an agency our representative
 
02:43:29.349 --> 02:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
borough said that it's not required to
 
02:43:32.230 --> 02:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
be done through an agency so how would
 
02:43:32.240 --> 02:43:33.590 align:start position:0%
be done through an agency so how would
um

02:43:33.590 --> 02:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:34.950 --> 02:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
would that mean there would be no
 
02:43:36.469 --> 02:43:36.479 align:start position:0%
matching and
 
02:43:38.309 --> 02:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
if someone did not go through an agency
 
02:43:39.750 --> 02:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
they're doing it on their own and how
 
02:43:41.990 --> 02:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
was that regulated
 
02:43:43.750 --> 02:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
would you still be aware that they're
 
02:43:47.670 --> 02:43:47.680 align:start position:0%
trying to use this um this homeowner's
 
02:43:49.670 --> 02:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
sharing arrangement
 
02:43:51.990 --> 02:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
well so to the best of my understanding
 
02:43:53.910 --> 02:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
i've got a spare room in my house and as
 
02:43:55.910 --> 02:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
a homeowner i'm perfectly within my
 
02:43:57.110 --> 02:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
legal rights to rent it out to
 
02:43:58.710 --> 02:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
whomsoever i choose
 
02:44:00.870 --> 02:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
um for whatever compensation i deem
 
02:44:04.150 --> 02:44:04.160 align:start position:0%
necessary um so what what the home so i
 
02:44:06.150 --> 02:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
mean that is
 
02:44:08.790 --> 02:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
not regulated because it's my right as a
 
02:44:11.510 --> 02:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
homeowner to to rent that space out
 
02:44:13.750 --> 02:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
again what the focus here is on is what
 
02:44:16.870 --> 02:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
the program does um if i do that you
 
02:44:18.389 --> 02:44:18.399 align:start position:0%
know if i decide to rent it out
 
02:44:20.150 --> 02:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
unilaterally without the assistance of
 
02:44:21.349 --> 02:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
any program
 
02:44:23.830 --> 02:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
i am now having to do any sort of
 
02:44:25.429 --> 02:44:25.439 align:start position:0%
background checks i'm having to hope
 
02:44:27.429 --> 02:44:27.439 align:start position:0%
that this person through a few meetings
 
02:44:29.190 --> 02:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
is someone who i'm gonna become i have
 
02:44:31.110 --> 02:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
two very young children in my house i
 
02:44:32.790 --> 02:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
have to be comfortable with my children
 
02:44:34.230 --> 02:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
being around this person on a regular
 
02:44:36.469 --> 02:44:36.479 align:start position:0%
basis right so what the home share
 
02:44:37.750 --> 02:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
program does
 
02:44:41.269 --> 02:44:41.279 align:start position:0%
is is it covers those bases right it it
 
02:44:43.510 --> 02:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
acts as the again as that kind of that
 
02:44:45.910 --> 02:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
personal liaison to ensure that this
 
02:44:47.990 --> 02:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
person is going to
 
02:44:50.070 --> 02:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
fit within your household
 
02:44:51.510 --> 02:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
and is going to fit with you on a social
 
02:44:54.389 --> 02:44:54.399 align:start position:0%
basis so so again this this doesn't have
 
02:44:55.830 --> 02:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
anything to do with regulating whether
 
02:44:57.429 --> 02:44:57.439 align:start position:0%
or not i can have someone in my home
 
02:45:00.309 --> 02:45:00.319 align:start position:0%
because i can do that under state law as
 
02:45:01.910 --> 02:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
much as i want
 
02:45:04.230 --> 02:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
it's what it what it is doing is saying
 
02:45:07.429 --> 02:45:07.439 align:start position:0%
that this program can function so that
 
02:45:09.830 --> 02:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
the elder people who have units
 
02:45:11.590 --> 02:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
available in their homes feel more
 
02:45:13.990 --> 02:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
comfortable opening their doors to allow
 
02:45:16.550 --> 02:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
young professionals ideally in our areas
 
02:45:18.389 --> 02:45:18.399 align:start position:0%
to stay in new hampshire work in new
 
02:45:18.399 --> 02:45:20.710 align:start position:0%
to stay in new hampshire work in new
hampshire

02:45:20.710 --> 02:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:45:23.670 --> 02:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
thank you yup
 
02:45:29.349 --> 02:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:32.389 --> 02:45:32.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman so
 
02:45:34.309 --> 02:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
is this home share
 
02:45:38.309 --> 02:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
program already in the works
 
02:45:41.670 --> 02:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
so it it was um it started they have
 
02:45:43.910 --> 02:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
gone through the process of there's i
 
02:45:46.950 --> 02:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
believe a website that has some some uh
 
02:45:48.790 --> 02:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
documents on it that people can use
 
02:45:51.670 --> 02:45:51.680 align:start position:0%
however prior to it actually being
 
02:45:51.680 --> 02:45:52.950 align:start position:0%
however prior to it actually being
enacted

02:45:52.950 --> 02:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
enacted
 
02:45:55.269 --> 02:45:55.279 align:start position:0%
it was put on hiatus due to the coveted
 
02:45:55.279 --> 02:45:56.710 align:start position:0%
it was put on hiatus due to the coveted
pandemic

02:45:56.710 --> 02:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
02:45:58.710 --> 02:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
so the plan is that if we can get this
 
02:46:00.950 --> 02:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
legislation put into place that would
 
02:46:03.830 --> 02:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
allow it to function on on a regular
 
02:46:05.510 --> 02:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
basis that once
 
02:46:07.510 --> 02:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
things ideally return to a place where
 
02:46:09.429 --> 02:46:09.439 align:start position:0%
you all can be in your big comfy
 
02:46:12.630 --> 02:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
committee chairs um then we can also
 
02:46:14.550 --> 02:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
look at you know potentially having this
 
02:46:16.070 --> 02:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
functioning um
 
02:46:18.630 --> 02:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
again within our community
 
02:46:23.110 --> 02:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:24.550 --> 02:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
yes you may yes
 
02:46:26.070 --> 02:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:46:27.590 --> 02:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
the other part of this bill that we
 
02:46:29.590 --> 02:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
don't seem to be talking about is the
 
02:46:29.600 --> 02:46:32.150 align:start position:0%
don't seem to be talking about is the
property

02:46:32.150 --> 02:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:35.110 --> 02:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
liable to taxation hi please explain
 
02:46:38.150 --> 02:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
this to me and how this is going to work
 
02:46:40.710 --> 02:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
because i think this goes back to my
 
02:46:42.550 --> 02:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
my question regarding the certificate
 
02:46:44.309 --> 02:46:44.319 align:start position:0%
how did they prove to the town if
 
02:46:46.070 --> 02:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
they're looking for a tax break on their
 
02:46:48.309 --> 02:46:48.319 align:start position:0%
property taxes is that correct
 
02:46:50.469 --> 02:46:50.479 align:start position:0%
correct yeah so so
 
02:46:51.990 --> 02:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
you bring up an excellent point so what
 
02:46:54.150 --> 02:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
this would be is obviously if
 
02:46:57.110 --> 02:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
if they have done this proper if they've
 
02:46:59.030 --> 02:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
done this through the program through
 
02:47:00.790 --> 02:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
the home share program then the home
 
02:47:03.190 --> 02:47:03.200 align:start position:0%
share program has record that
 
02:47:05.910 --> 02:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
whatever income they are receiving
 
02:47:08.790 --> 02:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
they are getting because of this program
 
02:47:11.670 --> 02:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
because they are offering a a
 
02:47:17.110 --> 02:47:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:19.030 --> 02:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know as much about this
 
02:47:20.630 --> 02:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
potentially as representative burroughs
 
02:47:23.030 --> 02:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
but i will do my best in in saying that
 
02:47:25.750 --> 02:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
essentially again the target audience
 
02:47:28.150 --> 02:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
for the home sharer the person who's
 
02:47:29.590 --> 02:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
opening their door
 
02:47:31.910 --> 02:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
is the retired community is the elderly
 
02:47:34.150 --> 02:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
community in our area many of them are
 
02:47:36.550 --> 02:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
on fixed incomes and there are quite a
 
02:47:39.269 --> 02:47:39.279 align:start position:0%
few who are looking for some sort of tax
 
02:47:41.590 --> 02:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
abatement or are on some sort of program
 
02:47:43.670 --> 02:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
that is keyed specifically to their
 
02:47:43.680 --> 02:47:44.870 align:start position:0%
that is keyed specifically to their
income

02:47:44.870 --> 02:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
income
 
02:47:47.830 --> 02:47:47.840 align:start position:0%
so what we were trying to ensure is that
 
02:47:49.990 --> 02:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
them opening their doors and helping our
 
02:47:52.230 --> 02:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
community by making a rental unit
 
02:47:52.240 --> 02:47:53.429 align:start position:0%
community by making a rental unit
available

02:47:53.429 --> 02:47:53.439 align:start position:0%
available
 
02:47:55.590 --> 02:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
would not hinder their ability to have
 
02:47:57.429 --> 02:47:57.439 align:start position:0%
access to these programs or to that
 
02:47:59.349 --> 02:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
abatement that they need based on their
 
02:48:02.630 --> 02:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
fixed income
 
02:48:03.830 --> 02:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:48:06.469 --> 02:48:06.479 align:start position:0%
representative alexander
 
02:48:08.790 --> 02:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chair um
 
02:48:11.030 --> 02:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative rice asked kind of a
 
02:48:12.469 --> 02:48:12.479 align:start position:0%
question that i just want to follow up
 
02:48:15.349 --> 02:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
on um this specific home share program
 
02:48:18.070 --> 02:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
is not defined in statute
 
02:48:19.830 --> 02:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
correct like the program that you're
 
02:48:22.230 --> 02:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
outlining correct so the the program
 
02:48:24.230 --> 02:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
itself is not defined what it
 
02:48:25.990 --> 02:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
facilitates which is the rental of a
 
02:48:29.190 --> 02:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
shared facility is defined the shared
 
02:48:32.950 --> 02:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:36.389 --> 02:48:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:37.910 --> 02:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes
 
02:48:39.990 --> 02:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
yes please thank you
 
02:48:43.030 --> 02:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
um so my question being is
 
02:48:43.040 --> 02:48:43.750 align:start position:0%
um so my question being is
the

02:48:43.750 --> 02:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:48:45.590 --> 02:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
situation you outlined with your spare
 
02:48:45.600 --> 02:48:46.469 align:start position:0%
situation you outlined with your spare
room

02:48:46.469 --> 02:48:46.479 align:start position:0%
room
 
02:48:48.950 --> 02:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
um would you be able to
 
02:48:51.429 --> 02:48:51.439 align:start position:0%
through this bill actually qualify for
 
02:48:53.670 --> 02:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
the tax abatement status because it's
 
02:48:54.870 --> 02:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
not technically outlined that it's
 
02:48:57.510 --> 02:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
specifically to this program
 
02:49:00.230 --> 02:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
um that's that is a very good question
 
02:49:00.240 --> 02:49:01.190 align:start position:0%
um that's that is a very good question
um

02:49:01.190 --> 02:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:05.269 --> 02:49:05.279 align:start position:0%
i don't i can't speak to that um again i
 
02:49:05.279 --> 02:49:06.070 align:start position:0%
i don't i can't speak to that um again i
think

02:49:06.070 --> 02:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:49:06.080 --> 02:49:07.110 align:start position:0%
think
how

02:49:07.110 --> 02:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
how
 
02:49:09.670 --> 02:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
how this is worded it's saying that if
 
02:49:12.790 --> 02:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
the income is coming from home share um
 
02:49:15.110 --> 02:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
i would the onus would be on me to
 
02:49:17.110 --> 02:49:17.120 align:start position:0%
defend that this was in fact some sort
 
02:49:19.510 --> 02:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
of home sharing that i was doing and so
 
02:49:21.030 --> 02:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
that is where the program would come
 
02:49:22.950 --> 02:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
into play because they could say yes
 
02:49:24.950 --> 02:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
this was facilitated through our home
 
02:49:27.510 --> 02:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
share program as opposed to me saying
 
02:49:29.269 --> 02:49:29.279 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm home sharing i just you know
 
02:49:30.870 --> 02:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
put this room up on craigslist and
 
02:49:32.630 --> 02:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
someone came in because that is a lot
 
02:49:34.389 --> 02:49:34.399 align:start position:0%
more just like subletting a room out of
 
02:49:37.910 --> 02:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:37.920 --> 02:49:38.830 align:start position:0%
 
thank

02:49:38.830 --> 02:49:38.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:49:44.550 --> 02:49:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:46.630 --> 02:49:46.640 align:start position:0%
representative alexander kind of asked
 
02:49:48.550 --> 02:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
my question it's it's along the same
 
02:49:48.560 --> 02:49:49.590 align:start position:0%
my question it's it's along the same
lines

02:49:49.590 --> 02:49:49.600 align:start position:0%
lines
 
02:49:50.469 --> 02:49:50.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:49:53.429 --> 02:49:53.439 align:start position:0%
representative oregon
 
02:49:55.269 --> 02:49:55.279 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair thank you
 
02:49:57.349 --> 02:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
very much uh
 
02:49:58.550 --> 02:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
former evidence counselor it's a
 
02:50:01.110 --> 02:50:01.120 align:start position:0%
pleasure to have you back um
 
02:50:01.120 --> 02:50:02.150 align:start position:0%
pleasure to have you back um
this

02:50:02.150 --> 02:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:50:04.150 --> 02:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
may be a dumb question but the the
 
02:50:06.230 --> 02:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
intent of this is to exclude you know
 
02:50:09.030 --> 02:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
from the net assets and so forth not
 
02:50:09.040 --> 02:50:09.830 align:start position:0%
from the net assets and so forth not
just

02:50:09.830 --> 02:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:50:09.840 --> 02:50:11.030 align:start position:0%
just
uh

02:50:11.030 --> 02:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:50:12.710 --> 02:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
there's obviously first of all the uh
 
02:50:14.389 --> 02:50:14.399 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
02:50:17.030 --> 02:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
value of the in-kind services that the
 
02:50:19.110 --> 02:50:19.120 align:start position:0%
home chair is providing for the uh i
 
02:50:20.950 --> 02:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
guess typically an elderly or disabled
 
02:50:23.590 --> 02:50:23.600 align:start position:0%
person but also to um
 
02:50:24.950 --> 02:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
exclude the
 
02:50:26.950 --> 02:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
cash rent that the uh
 
02:50:30.150 --> 02:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
home sharer is also paying to the uh
 
02:50:32.550 --> 02:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
you know their host to their landlord or
 
02:50:35.269 --> 02:50:35.279 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to call them
 
02:50:37.990 --> 02:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh correct yes and and
 
02:50:40.070 --> 02:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
yeah and and to the to the earlier point
 
02:50:41.750 --> 02:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
i mean i you know
 
02:50:44.389 --> 02:50:44.399 align:start position:0%
we would i i'm sure i don't i don't know
 
02:50:45.670 --> 02:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
i can't speak for representative
 
02:50:47.910 --> 02:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
burroughs if you all wanted to come up
 
02:50:49.670 --> 02:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
with a definition specifically of home
 
02:50:51.750 --> 02:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
sharing and amend that into the bill i
 
02:50:53.429 --> 02:50:53.439 align:start position:0%
don't see as as we would necessarily
 
02:50:55.510 --> 02:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
have an issue with it um obviously we
 
02:50:57.830 --> 02:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
would be happy i i would be happy i'm
 
02:50:59.990 --> 02:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
sure um dr jackson i don't know if she
 
02:51:01.910 --> 02:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
has joined or not um and i'm sure
 
02:51:02.950 --> 02:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs would all be
 
02:51:06.230 --> 02:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
happy to work with you on um kind of
 
02:51:07.830 --> 02:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
what that definition would look like to
 
02:51:10.070 --> 02:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
ensure that programs that are operating
 
02:51:11.990 --> 02:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
in good faith to serve their communities
 
02:51:13.510 --> 02:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
would still be able to function under
 
02:51:15.750 --> 02:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
whatever that definition is um so we're
 
02:51:16.790 --> 02:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
not i'm
 
02:51:19.190 --> 02:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
i mean so again it's not my bill anymore
 
02:51:21.590 --> 02:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
but i wouldn't be opposed to that
 
02:51:24.309 --> 02:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
definition being added
 
02:51:26.150 --> 02:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
all right thanks

my name is jim michaud i am testifying
 
02:54:07.429 --> 02:54:07.439 align:start position:0%
in my capacity as chief assessor for the
 
02:54:09.670 --> 02:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
town of hudson as a practitioner in
 
02:54:11.990 --> 02:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire assessment administration
 
02:54:13.830 --> 02:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh neither currently in favor nor
 
02:54:15.429 --> 02:54:15.439 align:start position:0%
against i'm also chair of the new
 
02:54:17.030 --> 02:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire association of assessing
 
02:54:19.190 --> 02:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
officials legislative committee but i'm
 
02:54:23.349 --> 02:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
not representing them on this either
 
02:54:25.269 --> 02:54:25.279 align:start position:0%
i guess my first question is this bill
 
02:54:26.870 --> 02:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
going to missile and county because it
 
02:54:31.510 --> 02:54:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:34.870 --> 02:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
i do not believe that it is
 
02:54:37.110 --> 02:54:37.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you mr chair
 
02:54:37.120 --> 02:54:39.190 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you mr chair
um

02:54:39.190 --> 02:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:41.030 --> 02:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
my comments are only in regards to
 
02:54:43.030 --> 02:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
sections one two and three of this bill
 
02:54:43.040 --> 02:54:44.230 align:start position:0%
sections one two and three of this bill
proposal

02:54:44.230 --> 02:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
02:54:46.550 --> 02:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
i believe that the intent is to shield
 
02:54:48.389 --> 02:54:48.399 align:start position:0%
income in a home share arrangement
 
02:54:48.399 --> 02:54:49.830 align:start position:0%
income in a home share arrangement
situation

02:54:49.830 --> 02:54:49.840 align:start position:0%
situation
 
02:54:51.750 --> 02:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
to shield that residential apartment
 
02:54:53.910 --> 02:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
bedroom rental income from being
 
02:54:55.750 --> 02:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
considered for purposes of the elderly
 
02:54:57.670 --> 02:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
disabled and deaf property tax
 
02:54:57.680 --> 02:54:58.870 align:start position:0%
disabled and deaf property tax
exemptions

02:54:58.870 --> 02:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
exemptions
 
02:55:00.550 --> 02:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
if that is the case
 
02:55:02.710 --> 02:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
the change in law is misplaced
 
02:55:04.630 --> 02:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
it seeks to bar that income from being
 
02:55:06.469 --> 02:55:06.479 align:start position:0%
considered as an asset
 
02:55:06.479 --> 02:55:07.590 align:start position:0%
considered as an asset
however

02:55:07.590 --> 02:55:07.600 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:55:09.750 --> 02:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
assessing officials are not and would
 
02:55:12.389 --> 02:55:12.399 align:start position:0%
not be counting that income as an asset
 
02:55:13.830 --> 02:55:13.840 align:start position:0%
in the first place
 
02:55:16.790 --> 02:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
as income is not an asset it's well it's
 
02:55:18.230 --> 02:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
it's income
 
02:55:20.389 --> 02:55:20.399 align:start position:0%
um the rsa that they would want to
 
02:55:21.990 --> 02:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
insert this into
 
02:55:24.469 --> 02:55:24.479 align:start position:0%
um there's three separate rsas
 
02:55:27.750 --> 02:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
for the elderly disabled and deaf
 
02:55:29.910 --> 02:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
and there's areas in those where income
 
02:55:31.830 --> 02:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
is described
 
02:55:34.309 --> 02:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
currently there's only three exclusions
 
02:55:36.790 --> 02:55:36.800 align:start position:0%
from income for purposes of all three of
 
02:55:38.630 --> 02:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
those exemptions
 
02:55:42.830 --> 02:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:42.840 --> 02:55:44.389 align:start position:0%
 
are

02:55:44.389 --> 02:55:44.399 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:55:46.070 --> 02:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
life insurance paid in the death of an
 
02:55:46.080 --> 02:55:47.429 align:start position:0%
life insurance paid in the death of an
insured

02:55:47.429 --> 02:55:47.439 align:start position:0%
insured
 
02:55:49.750 --> 02:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
number two expenses and costs incurred
 
02:55:51.510 --> 02:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
in the course of conducting a business
 
02:55:51.520 --> 02:55:52.710 align:start position:0%
in the course of conducting a business
enterprise

02:55:52.710 --> 02:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
enterprise
 
02:55:55.190 --> 02:55:55.200 align:start position:0%
and three proceeds from the sale of
 
02:55:57.750 --> 02:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
assets this would now add a fourth
 
02:55:57.760 --> 02:55:59.190 align:start position:0%
assets this would now add a fourth
exclusion

02:55:59.190 --> 02:55:59.200 align:start position:0%
exclusion
 
02:55:59.200 --> 02:56:00.150 align:start position:0%
exclusion
um

02:56:00.150 --> 02:56:00.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:56:05.110 --> 02:56:05.120 align:start position:0%
so i i think uh as it's currently worded
 
02:56:07.030 --> 02:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
i would not be excluding the income in a
 
02:56:08.710 --> 02:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
home share arrangement if this were to
 
02:56:11.269 --> 02:56:11.279 align:start position:0%
pass as it's worded
 
02:56:13.910 --> 02:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
um i do have statutory references um i
 
02:56:17.190 --> 02:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
can email those separately
 
02:56:18.389 --> 02:56:18.399 align:start position:0%
beyond that
 
02:56:23.429 --> 02:56:23.439 align:start position:0%
there's an rsa 72 colon 27-a
 
02:56:25.830 --> 02:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
and that is the statutory mechanism by
 
02:56:27.670 --> 02:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
which municipalities
 
02:56:30.630 --> 02:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
modify and adopt property tax exemptions
 
02:56:32.550 --> 02:56:32.560 align:start position:0%
and credits
 
02:56:36.630 --> 02:56:36.640 align:start position:0%
one of the areas section 4
 
02:56:36.640 --> 02:56:37.590 align:start position:0%
one of the areas section 4
says

02:56:37.590 --> 02:56:37.600 align:start position:0%
says
 
02:56:39.670 --> 02:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
an amendment to a statutory provision
 
02:56:42.150 --> 02:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
listed in paragraph one paragraph one of
 
02:56:43.990 --> 02:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
that statute deals with exemptions and
 
02:56:44.000 --> 02:56:44.950 align:start position:0%
that statute deals with exemptions and
credits

02:56:44.950 --> 02:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
credits
 
02:56:47.429 --> 02:56:47.439 align:start position:0%
an amendment to a statutory provision
 
02:56:50.150 --> 02:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
shall apply in municipality which
 
02:56:52.710 --> 02:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
previously adopted the provision only
 
02:56:55.030 --> 02:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
after the municipalities complies with
 
02:56:57.110 --> 02:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
the procedure in this section in other
 
02:56:57.120 --> 02:56:58.309 align:start position:0%
the procedure in this section in other
words

02:56:58.309 --> 02:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
words
 
02:56:59.429 --> 02:56:59.439 align:start position:0%
let's say
 
02:57:01.269 --> 02:57:01.279 align:start position:0%
this bill is modified so it's in the
 
02:57:02.870 --> 02:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
right area
 
02:57:05.429 --> 02:57:05.439 align:start position:0%
and then it's passed into law
 
02:57:07.510 --> 02:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't apply in hudson
 
02:57:10.309 --> 02:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
until we've re-adopted our elderly or
 
02:57:12.469 --> 02:57:12.479 align:start position:0%
disabled we don't have a deaf but until
 
02:57:14.389 --> 02:57:14.399 align:start position:0%
we re-adopted them
 
02:57:15.830 --> 02:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
and ancient may
 
02:57:17.750 --> 02:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
is pretty clear on this direction to
 
02:57:17.760 --> 02:57:20.389 align:start position:0%
is pretty clear on this direction to
municipalities

02:57:20.389 --> 02:57:20.399 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
02:57:20.399 --> 02:57:21.190 align:start position:0%
municipalities
so

02:57:21.190 --> 02:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:57:23.110 --> 02:57:23.120 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure that people
 
02:57:24.790 --> 02:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
understand this doesn't just apply to
 
02:57:27.349 --> 02:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
the 200 plus municipalities just because
 
02:57:28.950 --> 02:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
it's adopted
 
02:57:28.960 --> 02:57:29.750 align:start position:0%
it's adopted
um

02:57:29.750 --> 02:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:57:31.590 --> 02:57:31.600 align:start position:0%
i up another comment is i want to make
 
02:57:34.710 --> 02:57:34.720 align:start position:0%
sure the dra retains rulemaking ability
 
02:57:37.830 --> 02:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh to possibly provide some direction on
 
02:57:40.630 --> 02:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
this uh to municipalities
 
02:57:43.429 --> 02:57:43.439 align:start position:0%
it may already be in the overall rsa 72
 
02:57:46.389 --> 02:57:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:50.070 --> 02:57:50.080 align:start position:0%
i believe that is uh
 
02:57:51.510 --> 02:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
is the ex
 
02:57:53.269 --> 02:57:53.279 align:start position:0%
one other thing a definition of home
 
02:57:55.750 --> 02:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
share arrangement um that would be very
 
02:57:57.750 --> 02:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
helpful with municipalities so we can
 
02:58:00.630 --> 02:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
fairly and equitably uh and consistently
 
02:58:02.389 --> 02:58:02.399 align:start position:0%
from municipality to municipality apply
 
02:58:06.389 --> 02:58:06.399 align:start position:0%
this this change um
 
02:58:08.950 --> 02:58:08.960 align:start position:0%

it would be very helpful if he could do
 
02:58:43.030 --> 02:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
that and do it very quickly so that we
 
02:58:46.230 --> 02:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
could review that
 
02:58:48.630 --> 02:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
perhaps in time to consider any
 
02:58:53.670 --> 02:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:55.349 --> 02:58:55.359 align:start position:0%

i'm just putting together an email
 
03:54:53.110 --> 03:54:53.120 align:start position:0%
updating the afternoons lists it looks
 
03:54:55.429 --> 03:54:55.439 align:start position:0%
like there's only one entry since this
 
03:54:55.439 --> 03:54:56.630 align:start position:0%
like there's only one entry since this
morning

03:54:56.630 --> 03:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
morning
 
03:54:57.790 --> 03:54:57.800 align:start position:0%
and that's for
 
03:55:00.710 --> 03:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
hb124 so that'll pop up in your inbox in
 
03:55:13.510 --> 03:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:17.590 --> 03:55:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:20.070 --> 03:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
it's okay if i um
 
03:55:21.349 --> 03:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
i have a question on whether it's for
 
03:55:23.750 --> 03:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
the chair or the clerk or for jen but um
 
03:55:26.710 --> 03:55:26.720 align:start position:0%
about uh we got red testimony in regard
 
03:55:28.950 --> 03:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
for the prime sponsor of cacr10 but he
 
03:55:30.710 --> 03:55:30.720 align:start position:0%
sent it in uh
 
03:55:34.150 --> 03:55:34.160 align:start position:0%
an open office uh text format which um
 
03:55:36.389 --> 03:55:36.399 align:start position:0%
i can read but i think probably many of
 
03:55:37.750 --> 03:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
the people members of the community
 
03:55:39.750 --> 03:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
probably most of them don't have open
 
03:55:43.110 --> 03:55:43.120 align:start position:0%
office so like um i did send him an
 
03:55:45.110 --> 03:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
email suggesting that he save it as a
 
03:55:49.750 --> 03:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:50.950 --> 03:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
that's not we don't have to worry about
 
03:55:52.389 --> 03:55:52.399 align:start position:0%
that one until three o'clock but i
 
03:56:03.830 --> 03:56:03.840 align:start position:0%

represent ward 1 in nashua and today i
 
04:03:04.950 --> 04:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
bring you hb 124 adopting the uniform
 
04:03:08.229 --> 04:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
real property transfer on death act
 
04:03:10.150 --> 04:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
now like any bill i've ever contemplated
 
04:03:11.910 --> 04:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
for this committee i believe i had a
 
04:03:14.309 --> 04:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
very simple request when i began
 
04:03:15.830 --> 04:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
and i found out that there was a very
 
04:03:17.510 --> 04:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
good reason for it to never have been
 
04:03:19.990 --> 04:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
done before it's a really complicated
 
04:03:20.000 --> 04:03:20.950 align:start position:0%
done before it's a really complicated
issue

04:03:20.950 --> 04:03:20.960 align:start position:0%
issue
 
04:03:22.950 --> 04:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
but of course it's for a good cause all
 
04:03:22.960 --> 04:03:24.070 align:start position:0%
but of course it's for a good cause all
the

04:03:24.070 --> 04:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:03:26.070 --> 04:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
t's need to be crossed and all the eyes
 
04:03:27.590 --> 04:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
need to be dotted
 
04:03:27.600 --> 04:03:28.710 align:start position:0%
need to be dotted
um

04:03:28.710 --> 04:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:30.790 --> 04:03:30.800 align:start position:0%
last fall i received an email from a
 
04:03:32.950 --> 04:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
constituent maureen franklin who will
 
04:03:35.189 --> 04:03:35.199 align:start position:0%
probably want to speak later
 
04:03:36.870 --> 04:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
that when speaking with her attorney she
 
04:03:38.550 --> 04:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
had told
 
04:03:39.750 --> 04:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
she'd been told that new hampshire
 
04:03:41.750 --> 04:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
unlike many states had not added this
 
04:03:43.429 --> 04:03:43.439 align:start position:0%
into their laws as yet
 
04:03:45.110 --> 04:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
when i discussed this with ols
 
04:03:45.120 --> 04:03:46.309 align:start position:0%
when i discussed this with ols
researcher

04:03:46.309 --> 04:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
researcher
 
04:03:48.630 --> 04:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
director padden she mentioned that this
 
04:03:51.910 --> 04:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
had been part of a much larger attempt a
 
04:03:53.590 --> 04:03:53.600 align:start position:0%
few years ago and the bill had died
 
04:03:56.070 --> 04:03:56.080 align:start position:0%
simply due to the multiple complex
 
04:03:58.389 --> 04:03:58.399 align:start position:0%
issues that it involved so we narrowed
 
04:03:59.590 --> 04:03:59.600 align:start position:0%
it down
 
04:03:59.600 --> 04:04:00.710 align:start position:0%
it down
uh

04:04:00.710 --> 04:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:04:02.710 --> 04:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
from that much larger issue into
 
04:04:02.720 --> 04:04:04.150 align:start position:0%
from that much larger issue into
something

04:04:04.150 --> 04:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:04:06.710 --> 04:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
well at least more directed if not more
 
04:04:06.720 --> 04:04:07.750 align:start position:0%
well at least more directed if not more
simple

04:04:07.750 --> 04:04:07.760 align:start position:0%
simple
 
04:04:09.510 --> 04:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
what it means to do it means to adopt
 
04:04:11.590 --> 04:04:11.600 align:start position:0%
the uniform real property transfer on
 
04:04:12.790 --> 04:04:12.800 align:start position:0%
death act
 
04:04:14.469 --> 04:04:14.479 align:start position:0%
uh to provide a mechanism for
 
04:04:17.269 --> 04:04:17.279 align:start position:0%
non-probate transfer of land done by
 
04:04:19.110 --> 04:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
permitting owners of interest in real
 
04:04:21.670 --> 04:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
property to execute and to record a
 
04:04:23.910 --> 04:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
transfer on death deed
 
04:04:25.590 --> 04:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
so what this means for for her in
 
04:04:27.189 --> 04:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
particular is that
 
04:04:29.510 --> 04:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
not probate and setting up a trust could
 
04:04:31.429 --> 04:04:31.439 align:start position:0%
be avoided and therefore be less
 
04:04:33.349 --> 04:04:33.359 align:start position:0%
expensive and a faster method of dealing
 
04:04:35.830 --> 04:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
with a disposition of real property
 
04:04:38.630 --> 04:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
now uh the bill itself is in
 
04:04:40.550 --> 04:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
incredibly complex i'm sure this is
 
04:04:42.229 --> 04:04:42.239 align:start position:0%
something that you are
 
04:04:44.630 --> 04:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
probably quite familiar with in this
 
04:04:47.429 --> 04:04:47.439 align:start position:0%
committee uh complex bills and the
 
04:04:49.429 --> 04:04:49.439 align:start position:0%
language that's absolutely necessary to
 
04:04:50.710 --> 04:04:50.720 align:start position:0%
make it clear
 
04:04:53.670 --> 04:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
but that is all i have uh but i'd be
 
04:04:55.510 --> 04:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
willing to answer any questions anyone
 
04:04:57.840 --> 04:04:57.850 align:start position:0%
else might have
 
04:04:57.850 --> 04:05:04.469 align:start position:0%
else might have
[Applause]

04:05:04.469 --> 04:05:04.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:11.349 --> 04:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:12.710 --> 04:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
should we wait for the chair or shall i
 
04:05:14.070 --> 04:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
just identify
 
04:05:15.910 --> 04:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
mr chair are you having a technical
 
04:05:17.510 --> 04:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
problems again could you raise your hand
 
04:05:18.870 --> 04:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
if you are
 
04:05:21.510 --> 04:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
yes i i am oops
 
04:05:24.870 --> 04:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:30.150 --> 04:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:32.790 --> 04:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
fading in and out
 
04:05:35.189 --> 04:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
i'm having technical problems
 
04:05:37.110 --> 04:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
so perhaps representative representative
 
04:05:37.120 --> 04:05:38.790 align:start position:0%
so perhaps representative representative
mclaren

04:05:38.790 --> 04:05:38.800 align:start position:0%
mclaren
 
04:05:40.550 --> 04:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
04:05:42.790 --> 04:05:42.800 align:start position:0%
i'll i'll take over for now then mr
 
04:05:44.950 --> 04:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
chair until you get yourself sorted out

your hand when you think you're ready to
 
04:05:50.870 --> 04:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
take back over
 
04:05:51.910 --> 04:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
04:05:53.510 --> 04:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
i'll open up i'll open up the
 
04:06:00.950 --> 04:06:00.960 align:start position:0%

uh thank you mr chair and and thank you

representative for taking my question
 
04:06:07.990 --> 04:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
in order uh
 
04:06:09.910 --> 04:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
that i don't have to go through a line
 
04:06:12.870 --> 04:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
by line which i have really no interest
 
04:06:14.070 --> 04:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
in doing
 
04:06:15.990 --> 04:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
do you can you tell us
 
04:06:19.189 --> 04:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
whether your proposed bill
 
04:06:21.830 --> 04:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh varies in any way
 
04:06:24.469 --> 04:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
from the uniform real property transfer
 
04:06:27.830 --> 04:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
on death act as approved by the
 
04:06:30.790 --> 04:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
uniform law commission is it
 
04:06:33.990 --> 04:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
exactly the same or are there changes
 
04:06:36.710 --> 04:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
from what i understand from
 
04:06:39.269 --> 04:06:39.279 align:start position:0%
director patton that is exactly where
 
04:06:41.510 --> 04:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
she got this information from line by
 
04:06:41.520 --> 04:06:43.030 align:start position:0%
she got this information from line by
line

04:06:43.030 --> 04:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
line
 
04:06:48.309 --> 04:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:48.319 --> 04:06:49.910 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:06:49.910 --> 04:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:06:52.469 --> 04:06:52.479 align:start position:0%
paul who did you say approve that
 
04:06:55.349 --> 04:06:55.359 align:start position:0%
there's something uh am i still on
 
04:06:57.670 --> 04:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
there's something called the uniform uh
 
04:06:57.680 --> 04:06:58.469 align:start position:0%
there's something called the uniform uh
uh

04:06:58.469 --> 04:06:58.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:06:59.910 --> 04:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
law commission
 
04:07:02.150 --> 04:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire has representatives
 
04:07:03.750 --> 04:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
they have representatives from a lot of
 
04:07:06.070 --> 04:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
states and they try to put together
 
04:07:08.469 --> 04:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
uniform legislation applicable to all
 
04:07:11.189 --> 04:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
states but they would have to be adopted
 
04:07:13.510 --> 04:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
by each individual state
 
04:07:16.550 --> 04:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
so these are it's model legislation
 
04:07:19.110 --> 04:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
and uh my understanding is this
 
04:07:21.030 --> 04:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
particular model legislation has been
 
04:07:23.510 --> 04:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
adopted by about half the states
 
04:07:28.630 --> 04:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:30.550 --> 04:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
representative macbeth
 
04:07:33.349 --> 04:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
04:07:37.670 --> 04:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
is is this a taxable transfer
 
04:07:39.990 --> 04:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
all the transfer is
 
04:07:49.590 --> 04:07:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:51.830 --> 04:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
i do not i do not see tax listed at all
 
04:07:58.389 --> 04:07:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:00.309 --> 04:08:00.319 align:start position:0%

couple of questions
 
04:08:07.510 --> 04:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh unfortunately as a lawyer i guess i
 
04:08:09.670 --> 04:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
have to go through word by word
 
04:08:09.680 --> 04:08:10.469 align:start position:0%
have to go through word by word
uh

04:08:10.469 --> 04:08:10.479 align:start position:0%

a contrary provision the question is
 
04:08:39.510 --> 04:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:42.309 --> 04:08:42.319 align:start position:0%
i think this would go to court don't you

i think this would go to court don't you
yes

and has the dra taken a position as to
 
04:09:05.110 --> 04:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
whether or not one of these deeds would
 
04:09:06.790 --> 04:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
be subject to the real estate transfer
 
04:09:06.800 --> 04:09:08.870 align:start position:0%

04:09:21.590 --> 04:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
04:09:23.269 --> 04:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
from what i understand the federal debt
 
04:09:27.349 --> 04:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
tax is um properties over um 11.2
 
04:09:29.750 --> 04:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
million in value are subject to a
 
04:09:31.429 --> 04:09:31.439 align:start position:0%
federal debt tax would this affect that
 
04:09:33.189 --> 04:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
at all on the federal like coming from
 
04:09:36.309 --> 04:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:39.030 --> 04:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
since probate is avoided
 
04:09:40.309 --> 04:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
and the
 
04:09:42.870 --> 04:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
transfer on death is
 
04:09:44.870 --> 04:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
clearly to be executed
 
04:09:46.229 --> 04:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
on death
 
04:09:50.710 --> 04:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:52.870 --> 04:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i'm not being a lawyer i'm
 
04:09:57.830 --> 04:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:59.670 --> 04:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
representative alexander do you have a
 
04:09:59.680 --> 04:10:01.830 align:start position:0%
representative alexander do you have a
follow-up

04:10:01.830 --> 04:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:10:04.309 --> 04:10:04.319 align:start position:0%
representative silver
 
04:10:06.309 --> 04:10:06.319 align:start position:0%
this is what's called a transfer with
 
04:10:08.309 --> 04:10:08.319 align:start position:0%
retained life interest
 
04:10:10.710 --> 04:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
it does not get the property value out
 
04:10:13.110 --> 04:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
of the taxable estate no matter what the
 
04:10:15.670 --> 04:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
title shows it's still under federal
 
04:10:19.429 --> 04:10:19.439 align:start position:0%
estate tax law uh part of gross estate
 
04:10:20.870 --> 04:10:20.880 align:start position:0%

hearing me
 
04:11:28.389 --> 04:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
um i'm a widowed senior citizen
 
04:11:30.150 --> 04:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
um with no children
 
04:11:32.150 --> 04:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
i live in nashua
 
04:11:35.269 --> 04:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
i bought my home in 2009
 
04:11:38.150 --> 04:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
previously in another state
 
04:11:41.110 --> 04:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
um i was pulling together my documents
 
04:11:41.120 --> 04:11:42.950 align:start position:0%
um i was pulling together my documents
for

04:11:42.950 --> 04:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:11:44.469 --> 04:11:44.479 align:start position:0%
when i died
 
04:11:47.990 --> 04:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
um and went to three different attorneys
 
04:11:49.910 --> 04:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
and found that the documents that i
 
04:11:49.920 --> 04:11:51.189 align:start position:0%
and found that the documents that i
needed

04:11:51.189 --> 04:11:51.199 align:start position:0%
needed
 
04:11:53.429 --> 04:11:53.439 align:start position:0%
would cost me about thirty five hundred
 
04:11:53.439 --> 04:11:55.110 align:start position:0%
would cost me about thirty five hundred
dollars

04:11:55.110 --> 04:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:11:57.670 --> 04:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
i'm only on social security
 
04:11:59.590 --> 04:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
i make well under thirty thousand
 
04:12:01.110 --> 04:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
dollars a year
 
04:12:03.750 --> 04:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
my house does not approach 11 million
 
04:12:03.760 --> 04:12:04.790 align:start position:0%
my house does not approach 11 million
dollars

04:12:04.790 --> 04:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:12:08.710 --> 04:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
it's probably worth about 250 000
 
04:12:11.590 --> 04:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
the reality is that i cannot nor do i
 
04:12:13.189 --> 04:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
really need
 
04:12:15.590 --> 04:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
a trust
 
04:12:15.600 --> 04:12:18.389 align:start position:0%
a trust
um

04:12:18.389 --> 04:12:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:18.399 --> 04:12:19.590 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:12:19.590 --> 04:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:12:21.990 --> 04:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
i looked into this because having lived
 
04:12:23.910 --> 04:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
in other states we did have a transfer
 
04:12:25.830 --> 04:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
on death
 
04:12:28.150 --> 04:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
um law
 
04:12:30.630 --> 04:12:30.640 align:start position:0%
my understanding is there were 38 states
 
04:12:34.389 --> 04:12:34.399 align:start position:0%
that now have this type of legislation
 
04:12:34.399 --> 04:12:35.910 align:start position:0%
that now have this type of legislation
and

04:12:35.910 --> 04:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:12:38.550 --> 04:12:38.560 align:start position:0%
what i'm what i'm trying to do
 
04:12:42.550 --> 04:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
is pass my house along when i pass
 
04:12:45.269 --> 04:12:45.279 align:start position:0%
i don't want extended relatives to go
 
04:12:47.030 --> 04:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
through probate
 
04:12:48.710 --> 04:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
i know that
 
04:12:50.790 --> 04:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
it should make it simpler
 
04:12:53.189 --> 04:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
but sometimes it doesn't
 
04:12:55.189 --> 04:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
and it's not clear to me
 
04:12:57.670 --> 04:12:57.680 align:start position:0%
why i should have to buy
 
04:13:00.790 --> 04:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
pay for a probate pay for a trust
 
04:13:00.800 --> 04:13:01.990 align:start position:0%
pay for a probate pay for a trust
um

04:13:01.990 --> 04:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:05.510 --> 04:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
when i have nothing except my house
 
04:13:07.990 --> 04:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
and i really i do understand if you've
 
04:13:10.389 --> 04:13:10.399 align:start position:0%
got 11.9 million dollars
 
04:13:13.110 --> 04:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
yes maybe your property is is subject to
 
04:13:15.110 --> 04:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
a lot of different taxes
 
04:13:15.120 --> 04:13:15.910 align:start position:0%
a lot of different taxes
but

04:13:15.910 --> 04:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:13:17.830 --> 04:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
i've been a school teacher my whole my
 
04:13:19.110 --> 04:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
whole life
 
04:13:19.120 --> 04:13:20.149 align:start position:0%
whole life
um

04:13:20.149 --> 04:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:22.790 --> 04:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
and basically i can't understand and i
 
04:13:24.550 --> 04:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
do know attorneys need to make money so
 
04:13:28.870 --> 04:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
anybody that's an attorney no no um
 
04:13:31.269 --> 04:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
no insult to you at all
 
04:13:31.279 --> 04:13:32.070 align:start position:0%
no insult to you at all
but

04:13:32.070 --> 04:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:13:33.990 --> 04:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
i can't understand why i can't just pass
 
04:13:35.429 --> 04:13:35.439 align:start position:0%
my house along without going through
 
04:13:37.349 --> 04:13:37.359 align:start position:0%
this expensive
 
04:13:37.359 --> 04:13:39.110 align:start position:0%
this expensive
process

04:13:39.110 --> 04:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:13:41.750 --> 04:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
so i look to you and i ask i obviously
 
04:13:42.870 --> 04:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
04:13:44.389 --> 04:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
all of the laws
 
04:13:46.550 --> 04:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
my understanding from my tax attorney
 
04:13:49.269 --> 04:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
who's not an intern who's not a probate
 
04:13:49.279 --> 04:13:50.309 align:start position:0%
who's not an intern who's not a probate
attorney

04:13:50.309 --> 04:13:50.319 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
04:13:52.870 --> 04:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
is that there's no ramifications in
 
04:13:54.710 --> 04:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
terms of my level
 
04:13:56.309 --> 04:13:56.319 align:start position:0%
of income
 
04:13:59.189 --> 04:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
for property tax or estate tax
 
04:14:01.429 --> 04:14:01.439 align:start position:0%
so i guess that's all i have to say i
 
04:14:05.110 --> 04:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
ask you please to support this
 
04:14:06.790 --> 04:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
and that's it new hampshire is live free
 
04:14:08.870 --> 04:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
or die so i don't know why we have to
 
04:14:10.389 --> 04:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
have a trust here
 
04:14:11.990 --> 04:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and you all have a
 
04:14:14.070 --> 04:14:14.080 align:start position:0%

04:16:43.670 --> 04:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
hoping that i will hear today as to
 
04:16:46.309 --> 04:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
whether or not that may be available
 
04:16:48.550 --> 04:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
if it is that we'll schedule hearings
 
04:16:50.870 --> 04:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
that day
 
04:16:52.630 --> 04:16:52.640 align:start position:0%
and we'll have
 
04:16:57.429 --> 04:16:57.439 align:start position:0%
a hearing on the 23rd tuesday the 23rd
 
04:16:59.830 --> 04:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
as a regular hearing day
 
04:17:02.070 --> 04:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:17:04.630 --> 04:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
we expect to be in session on the 24th
 
04:17:06.309 --> 04:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
and 25th
 
04:17:08.710 --> 04:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
so there'd be one hearing that week
 
04:17:10.309 --> 04:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
and then with the following weeks if
 
04:17:12.710 --> 04:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
we're able to have two hearing days a
 
04:17:14.950 --> 04:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
week we'll do that until we can get
 
04:17:40.710 --> 04:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:43.030 --> 04:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
on the 16th we will have an executive
 
04:17:44.550 --> 04:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
session and as i said in my email
 
04:17:46.070 --> 04:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
yesterday if you plan to bring
 
04:17:47.990 --> 04:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
amendments you should have them prepared
 
04:17:49.590 --> 04:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
in advance and circulate them to the
 
04:17:49.600 --> 04:17:51.189 align:start position:0%
in advance and circulate them to the
committee

04:17:51.189 --> 04:17:51.199 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:17:53.269 --> 04:17:53.279 align:start position:0%
so that you'll be we'll be prepared to
 
04:17:55.990 --> 04:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
discuss them on that afternoon
 
04:17:58.229 --> 04:17:58.239 align:start position:0%
and we'll get we need to get out our
 
04:18:01.269 --> 04:18:01.279 align:start position:0%
five early bills that day
 
04:18:04.070 --> 04:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
one of which we've already addressed
 
04:18:06.870 --> 04:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
which was the bill with regard to the
 
04:18:09.349 --> 04:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
retirement benefits for judges
 
04:18:11.349 --> 04:18:11.359 align:start position:0%
we retained that bill but there are four
 
04:18:13.030 --> 04:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
others that we need to get out that day
 
04:18:14.389 --> 04:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
and we'll get done
 
04:18:23.189 --> 04:18:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:23.199 --> 04:18:34.950 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:18:34.950 --> 04:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:36.870 --> 04:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
and then i'd plan to schedule an
 
04:18:38.630 --> 04:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
04:18:39.830 --> 04:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
we'd have two
 
04:18:42.309 --> 04:18:42.319 align:start position:0%
two days of hearings and then
 
04:18:44.389 --> 04:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
and then on the next hearing day have an
 
04:18:46.710 --> 04:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
afternoon for executive session so that
 
04:18:49.910 --> 04:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
we can try to keep up and get out our
 
04:19:16.790 --> 04:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:19.030 --> 04:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
and next week we do have
 
04:19:20.309 --> 04:19:20.319 align:start position:0%
all of the
 
04:19:23.269 --> 04:19:23.279 align:start position:0%
abortion reproductive rights related
 
04:19:23.279 --> 04:19:25.510 align:start position:0%
abortion reproductive rights related
bills

04:19:25.510 --> 04:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
bills
 
04:19:28.550 --> 04:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
and i put them together
 
04:19:31.990 --> 04:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
with the two days so that we can uh
 
04:19:33.750 --> 04:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
address them
 
04:19:35.269 --> 04:19:35.279 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:19:37.030 --> 04:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
early in the session two of them are
 
04:19:39.750 --> 04:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
early bills anyway but it seems that
 
04:19:41.590 --> 04:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
they all involve the same subject matter
 
04:19:43.830 --> 04:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
and we should take care of them
 
04:19:53.189 --> 04:19:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:54.790 --> 04:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
there are two
 
04:19:57.990 --> 04:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
there the 6 22 and 625 the two early
 
04:20:00.790 --> 04:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
bills deal with the same subject matter
 
04:20:03.750 --> 04:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
really and that's with regard to
 
04:20:05.269 --> 04:20:05.279 align:start position:0%
a time frame
 
04:20:07.750 --> 04:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
after which it would be
 
04:20:09.590 --> 04:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
abortion will be prohibited so i've
 
04:20:12.149 --> 04:20:12.159 align:start position:0%
scheduled the hearings on those uh
 
04:20:12.159 --> 04:20:14.389 align:start position:0%
scheduled the hearings on those uh
contemporaneously

04:20:14.389 --> 04:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
contemporaneously
 
04:20:14.399 --> 04:20:15.910 align:start position:0%
contemporaneously
and

04:20:15.910 --> 04:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:20:18.389 --> 04:20:18.399 align:start position:0%
and that's so because i'm sure
 
04:20:20.070 --> 04:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
the same people would speak on both
 
04:20:20.080 --> 04:20:21.510 align:start position:0%
the same people would speak on both
bills

04:20:21.510 --> 04:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
bills
 
04:20:24.389 --> 04:20:24.399 align:start position:0%
dealing with the same subject matter so
 
04:20:27.030 --> 04:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
we will hear those in the morning
 
04:20:29.590 --> 04:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
on next tuesday
 
04:20:32.149 --> 04:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
and then a separate bill
 
04:20:34.469 --> 04:20:34.479 align:start position:0%
i think it's the bill with regard to the
 
04:20:38.389 --> 04:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:41.030 --> 04:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
centers and we'll deal that with that in
 
04:20:42.469 --> 04:20:42.479 align:start position:0%
the afternoon
 
04:20:44.070 --> 04:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
and then the next day there are two
 
04:20:45.990 --> 04:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
bills again we'll be heard
 
04:20:48.389 --> 04:20:48.399 align:start position:0%
contemporaneously on the 10th
 
04:20:50.309 --> 04:20:50.319 align:start position:0%
and i scheduled them together because
 
04:20:52.229 --> 04:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
they both deal with the same issue and
 
04:20:55.990 --> 04:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
that is public funding uh for abortion
 
04:20:59.110 --> 04:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
and so again we'd have the same speakers
 
04:21:01.269 --> 04:21:01.279 align:start position:0%
i think on both bills so i hear both
 
04:21:03.830 --> 04:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
bills together
 
04:21:05.030 --> 04:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
and then the
 
04:21:06.710 --> 04:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
sixth abortion goal here in the
 
04:21:06.720 --> 04:21:45.990 align:start position:0%
sixth abortion goal here in the
afternoon

04:21:45.990 --> 04:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:47.429 --> 04:21:47.439 align:start position:0%
i have to say i've been very pleased
 
04:21:49.990 --> 04:21:50.000 align:start position:0%

04:21:51.830 --> 04:21:51.840 align:start position:0%

04:22:43.030 --> 04:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
that representative alexander
 
04:22:46.309 --> 04:22:46.319 align:start position:0%

there though representing me
 
04:22:55.189 --> 04:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
representative alexander but i'm not
 
04:22:59.269 --> 04:22:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:01.510 --> 04:23:01.520 align:start position:0%

04:23:22.630 --> 04:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
well my understanding is that we can
 
04:23:24.309 --> 04:23:24.319 align:start position:0%
start the hearing
 
04:23:27.269 --> 04:23:27.279 align:start position:0%

only a couple of people that are doing
 
04:24:41.670 --> 04:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
this work with the
 
04:24:45.110 --> 04:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
200 plus towns that need to have it done

[Laughter]

04:26:37.429 --> 04:26:37.439 align:start position:0%

helpful to us
 
04:26:46.960 --> 04:26:48.070 align:start position:0%
helpful to us
okay

04:26:48.070 --> 04:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:26:50.070 --> 04:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
well this um
 
04:26:52.870 --> 04:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
proposed change would
 
04:26:54.389 --> 04:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
buy time
 
04:26:54.399 --> 04:26:55.429 align:start position:0%
buy time
for

04:26:55.429 --> 04:26:55.439 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:26:57.990 --> 04:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
both the top tax collectors many of whom
 
04:27:00.149 --> 04:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
are also town clerks
 
04:27:00.159 --> 04:27:01.349 align:start position:0%
are also town clerks
and

04:27:01.349 --> 04:27:01.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:27:01.359 --> 04:27:02.870 align:start position:0%
and
overwhelmed

04:27:02.870 --> 04:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed
 
04:27:04.550 --> 04:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
with duties
 
04:27:06.790 --> 04:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:27:08.950 --> 04:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
04:27:11.189 --> 04:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
the biggest problem if these letters
 
04:27:13.990 --> 04:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
don't get postmarked on time
 
04:27:16.790 --> 04:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
then the town loses their ability
 
04:27:20.630 --> 04:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
to go forward with further collection of
 
04:27:22.469 --> 04:27:22.479 align:start position:0%
the unpaid
 
04:27:24.710 --> 04:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
tax levy
 
04:27:26.870 --> 04:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
the property cannot go to deed if the
 
04:27:29.110 --> 04:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
letters did not get mailed out in time
 
04:27:31.750 --> 04:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
two years before that
 
04:27:33.510 --> 04:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
so that's the bottom line
 
04:27:43.510 --> 04:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:45.750 --> 04:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
that concludes
 
04:27:45.760 --> 04:27:50.070 align:start position:0%
that concludes
okay

04:27:50.070 --> 04:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:50.080 --> 04:27:51.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:27:51.110 --> 04:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:27:55.349 --> 04:27:55.359 align:start position:0%

perfecting

04:29:34.389 --> 04:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
perfecting
 
04:29:36.790 --> 04:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
the inherent tax lien which exists on
 
04:29:38.950 --> 04:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
all properties um
 
04:29:41.510 --> 04:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
april first of every year to ensure that
 
04:29:44.070 --> 04:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities interest as and position
 
04:29:46.950 --> 04:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
as a secured first priority lien holder
 
04:29:49.750 --> 04:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
is of course very important and as jane
 
04:29:51.590 --> 04:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
said if this process
 
04:29:54.070 --> 04:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
um statutory process is not followed
 
04:29:56.309 --> 04:29:56.319 align:start position:0%
precisely and correctly or if a deadline
 
04:29:58.550 --> 04:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
is missed then the municipality loses
 
04:30:01.670 --> 04:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
its ability to acquire a valid tax deed
 
04:30:03.429 --> 04:30:03.439 align:start position:0%
for the properties
 
04:30:05.670 --> 04:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
two years later if there are any
 
04:30:05.680 --> 04:30:07.110 align:start position:0%
two years later if there are any
unredeemed

04:30:07.110 --> 04:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
unredeemed
 
04:30:09.269 --> 04:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
taxes remaining
 
04:30:09.279 --> 04:30:09.990 align:start position:0%
taxes remaining
so

04:30:09.990 --> 04:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:30:12.790 --> 04:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
again we respectfully urge the committee
 
04:30:16.070 --> 04:30:16.080 align:start position:0%

question
um

04:30:32.389 --> 04:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:35.030 --> 04:30:35.040 align:start position:0%

04:30:37.429 --> 04:30:37.439 align:start position:0%
provides some flexibility for the town
 
04:30:37.439 --> 04:30:38.550 align:start position:0%
provides some flexibility for the town
clerks

04:30:38.550 --> 04:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
clerks
 
04:30:41.349 --> 04:30:41.359 align:start position:0%
um and tax collectors to provide notice
 
04:30:43.349 --> 04:30:43.359 align:start position:0%
um to the citizen
 
04:30:45.750 --> 04:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
is there a companion piece of
 
04:30:47.590 --> 04:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
law that we need to
 
04:30:51.269 --> 04:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
also um push the 60 days that the
 
04:30:53.750 --> 04:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
citizens themselves that like maybe that
 
04:30:57.030 --> 04:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
the um you know the the fees or interest
 
04:30:59.670 --> 04:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
on this lien or whatever or or their
 
04:31:01.910 --> 04:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
taxes do doesn't start you know that
 
04:31:04.630 --> 04:31:04.640 align:start position:0%
they also have that extra
 
04:31:05.910 --> 04:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
month or
 
04:31:09.670 --> 04:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
15 days to to um you know start when the
 
04:31:11.990 --> 04:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
fees start that they wouldn't start
 
04:31:14.149 --> 04:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
until notice
 
04:31:15.429 --> 04:31:15.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question that's
 
04:31:17.590 --> 04:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
actually a really great great question
 
04:31:20.870 --> 04:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
um so the way the statute works is the
 
04:31:23.349 --> 04:31:23.359 align:start position:0%
tax collectors are required to provide
 
04:31:26.630 --> 04:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
30 days certified return receipt notice
 
04:31:28.950 --> 04:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
to the property owners
 
04:31:31.830 --> 04:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
that's what starts the entire process
 
04:31:33.910 --> 04:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
and and prior to that they have to
 
04:31:36.630 --> 04:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
provide delinquency notices
 
04:31:39.990 --> 04:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
after the second or the final tax uh
 
04:31:42.550 --> 04:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
bill is issued so the final tax bill
 
04:31:45.110 --> 04:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
gets issued a delinquency notice is
 
04:31:48.229 --> 04:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
required to be sent to all property tax
 
04:31:50.309 --> 04:31:50.319 align:start position:0%
payers that still have remaining taxes
 
04:31:50.319 --> 04:31:51.110 align:start position:0%
payers that still have remaining taxes
due

04:31:51.110 --> 04:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
due
 
04:31:54.070 --> 04:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
and then um in preparation for
 
04:31:56.790 --> 04:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
perfecting the tax lien the certified
 
04:31:58.950 --> 04:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
return receipt lien notice is required
 
04:32:01.590 --> 04:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
to be sent to the property owners 30
 
04:32:03.910 --> 04:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
days in advance of executing the tax
 
04:32:03.920 --> 04:32:04.950 align:start position:0%
days in advance of executing the tax
lien

04:32:04.950 --> 04:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
lien
 
04:32:07.110 --> 04:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
following the execution of the tax lien
 
04:32:09.670 --> 04:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
that's where the 45 days comes in so
 
04:32:11.510 --> 04:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
once the tax lien is executed that
 
04:32:14.389 --> 04:32:14.399 align:start position:0%
search must begin and and the there's a
 
04:32:16.710 --> 04:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
45 day period
 
04:32:19.429 --> 04:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
to conduct that search get the notices
 
04:32:23.670 --> 04:32:23.680 align:start position:0%
ready and then the mortgages are noticed
 
04:32:25.349 --> 04:32:25.359 align:start position:0%
following that being successfully
 
04:32:25.359 --> 04:32:28.070 align:start position:0%
following that being successfully
completed

04:32:28.070 --> 04:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:29.590 --> 04:32:29.600 align:start position:0%

opposition
 
04:33:14.869 --> 04:33:14.879 align:start position:0%
mr chair would it be in order to have an
 
04:33:18.310 --> 04:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
executive session on this bill right now
 
04:33:20.551 --> 04:33:20.561 align:start position:0%
is there anyone on the committee who
 
04:33:22.551 --> 04:33:22.561 align:start position:0%
would object
 
04:33:22.561 --> 04:33:23.510 align:start position:0%
would object
to

04:33:23.510 --> 04:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:33:25.990 --> 04:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
having an executive session on this bill
 
04:33:30.629 --> 04:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:33.750 --> 04:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
i don't see anyone who would object
 
04:33:33.760 --> 04:33:35.189 align:start position:0%
i don't see anyone who would object
then

04:33:35.189 --> 04:33:35.199 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:33:38.390 --> 04:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:39.750 --> 04:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
i was
 
04:33:41.670 --> 04:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
looking at procedures that i might be
 
04:33:43.349 --> 04:33:43.359 align:start position:0%
familiar with the town in terms of
 
04:33:45.510 --> 04:33:45.520 align:start position:0%
taking a roll call to go into executive
 
04:33:47.510 --> 04:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
session but i understand that that isn't
 
04:33:49.830 --> 04:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
necessary to do so
 
04:33:52.470 --> 04:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
and that we can because we have noticed
 
04:33:52.480 --> 04:33:53.590 align:start position:0%
and that we can because we have noticed
it

04:33:53.590 --> 04:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:33:57.029 --> 04:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
go into executive session by declaration
 
04:34:00.150 --> 04:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
and so i'm going to indicate that we
 
04:34:00.160 --> 04:34:01.109 align:start position:0%
and so i'm going to indicate that we
are

04:34:01.109 --> 04:34:01.119 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:34:03.990 --> 04:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
now in executive session
 
04:34:04.000 --> 04:34:05.590 align:start position:0%
now in executive session
and

04:34:05.590 --> 04:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:34:07.189 --> 04:34:07.199 align:start position:0%

heard reasons why um it just gives more
 
04:34:37.830 --> 04:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
flexibility to the towns and i think we
 
04:34:41.670 --> 04:34:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:47.029 --> 04:34:47.039 align:start position:0%

04:36:51.600 --> 04:36:52.789 align:start position:0%
is it possible for the clerk to be given
um

04:36:52.789 --> 04:36:52.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:55.189 --> 04:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
the old-fashioned paper
 
04:36:56.789 --> 04:36:56.799 align:start position:0%
roll call sheets
 
04:37:00.551 --> 04:37:00.561 align:start position:0%
so that he could fill that out easily
 
04:37:02.949 --> 04:37:02.959 align:start position:0%
and then subsequently
 
04:37:05.910 --> 04:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
send it along to go into the
 
04:37:09.990 --> 04:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:12.551 --> 04:37:12.561 align:start position:0%
so let me answer that
 
04:37:15.750 --> 04:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
am i on so yes i i don't really think
 
04:37:18.310 --> 04:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
that's necessary what's necessary is for
 
04:37:20.709 --> 04:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
me to correct this file or
 
04:37:23.590 --> 04:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
and help it's to know ahead of time so
 
04:37:25.109 --> 04:37:25.119 align:start position:0%
i've already made
 
04:37:27.029 --> 04:37:27.039 align:start position:0%
like for today i made files for the
 
04:37:29.349 --> 04:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
public hearing and i made files for the
 
04:37:31.029 --> 04:37:31.039 align:start position:0%
executive session but i did not make
 
04:37:33.349 --> 04:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
roll call sheets
 
04:37:35.510 --> 04:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
right and it still takes
 
04:37:37.109 --> 04:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
a little bit of time to manipulate the
 
04:37:39.269 --> 04:37:39.279 align:start position:0%

04:41:37.030 --> 04:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:38.708 --> 04:41:38.718 align:start position:0%
do we have to vote on this again after
 
04:41:40.550 --> 04:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
another roll call for this
 
04:41:40.560 --> 04:41:41.350 align:start position:0%
another roll call for this
um

04:41:41.350 --> 04:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:43.590 --> 04:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
mr chair i don't think so i think you
 
04:41:45.270 --> 04:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
could have said
 
04:41:47.990 --> 04:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
if there is no objection
 
04:41:51.110 --> 04:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
we can put this on the consent calendar
 
04:41:52.550 --> 04:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:41:56.390 --> 04:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
that would fulfill our um
 
04:41:56.400 --> 04:41:58.868 align:start position:0%
that would fulfill our um
obligations

04:41:58.868 --> 04:41:58.878 align:start position:0%
obligations
 
04:42:01.430 --> 04:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
any one person objects it doesn't go on
 
04:42:03.750 --> 04:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
consent okay
 
04:42:05.350 --> 04:42:05.360 align:start position:0%
well no
 
04:42:07.350 --> 04:42:07.360 align:start position:0%
before before you regard that now that
 
04:42:08.550 --> 04:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be right you can put it on
 
04:42:10.230 --> 04:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
consent with more than one
 
04:42:12.070 --> 04:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
more than just a couple but you'd have
 
04:42:14.708 --> 04:42:14.718 align:start position:0%
to do a roll call to make that decision
 
04:42:16.788 --> 04:42:16.798 align:start position:0%
that is true but if there is no
 
04:42:18.868 --> 04:42:18.878 align:start position:0%
objection agreed
 
04:42:21.750 --> 04:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
then there is no need for the roll call
 
04:42:23.190 --> 04:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
04:42:28.470 --> 04:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:33.030 --> 04:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
so that's why the chair would say um
 
04:42:36.550 --> 04:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
you know if it is no objection this will
 
04:42:37.830 --> 04:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
go on
 
04:42:40.628 --> 04:42:40.638 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar and that leaves the
 
04:42:43.590 --> 04:42:43.600 align:start position:0%
rest of us free to say no no no no
 
04:42:46.150 --> 04:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
but i haven't heard any objections
 
04:42:47.990 --> 04:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
without objection
 
04:42:50.470 --> 04:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
house bill 126 will be placed on the
 
04:42:52.708 --> 04:42:52.718 align:start position:0%
consent calendar
 
04:42:56.550 --> 04:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
now is your time to object if you wanted
 
04:42:58.550 --> 04:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
hearing none
 
04:43:01.110 --> 04:43:01.120 align:start position:0%
hearing none it will be placed
 
04:43:03.350 --> 04:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
on the consent calendar
 
04:43:05.670 --> 04:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
um mr chair just a uh
 
04:43:07.270 --> 04:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
procedural question
 
04:43:09.430 --> 04:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
um i still i would have to write a
 
04:43:11.510 --> 04:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
committee report on this correct yes
 
04:43:13.110 --> 04:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
where would i submit that
 
04:43:14.948 --> 04:43:14.958 align:start position:0%
yes you will have to do a committee
 
04:43:14.958 --> 04:43:16.830 align:start position:0%
yes you will have to do a committee
report

04:43:16.830 --> 04:43:16.840 align:start position:0%
report
 
04:43:19.830 --> 04:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:43:19.840 --> 04:43:22.470 align:start position:0%
and uh
and

04:43:22.470 --> 04:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:22.480 --> 04:43:23.350 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:43:23.350 --> 04:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:43:24.868 --> 04:43:24.878 align:start position:0%
you send it to the chat i think you
 
04:43:26.708 --> 04:43:26.718 align:start position:0%
would send it to the chair as we did
 
04:43:28.390 --> 04:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
before because the chair
 
04:43:31.350 --> 04:43:31.360 align:start position:0%
would have to um agree
 
04:43:33.670 --> 04:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
with what you say and then the chair can
 
04:43:38.470 --> 04:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
send it to the appropriate staff people
 
04:43:40.310 --> 04:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
right and i i can't do what
 
04:43:43.190 --> 04:43:43.200 align:start position:0%
representative smith did last year and
 
04:43:44.948 --> 04:43:44.958 align:start position:0%
that say you you have to submit it
 
04:43:46.480 --> 04:43:46.490 align:start position:0%
before you leave the room
 
04:43:46.490 --> 04:43:48.470 align:start position:0%
before you leave the room
[Laughter]

04:43:48.470 --> 04:43:48.480 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:43:50.230 --> 04:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
you can too if you just stay you could
 
04:43:53.590 --> 04:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
try we're gonna close the room
 
04:43:53.600 --> 04:43:56.470 align:start position:0%
try we're gonna close the room
um

04:43:56.470 --> 04:43:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:58.470 --> 04:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
but yes uh
 
04:44:02.070 --> 04:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
and i guess if you could get that to me
 
04:44:03.510 --> 04:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
by the end of the week that would be
 
04:44:03.520 --> 04:44:04.628 align:start position:0%
by the end of the week that would be
great

04:44:04.628 --> 04:44:04.638 align:start position:0%
great
 
04:44:06.628 --> 04:44:06.638 align:start position:0%
i will do that thank you mr chair
 
04:44:09.350 --> 04:44:09.360 align:start position:0%
is there a specific form that we need to
 
04:44:11.030 --> 04:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
do to use
 
04:44:11.040 --> 04:44:11.830 align:start position:0%
do to use
and

04:44:11.830 --> 04:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:44:13.030 --> 04:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
if so
 
04:44:15.750 --> 04:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
where is that available
 
04:44:18.230 --> 04:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
or the committee reports
 
04:44:22.550 --> 04:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:24.390 --> 04:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
i don't know if she's on the call
 
04:44:27.270 --> 04:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
oh yes i do see
 
04:44:27.280 --> 04:44:28.550 align:start position:0%
oh yes i do see
so here

04:44:28.550 --> 04:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
so here
 
04:44:31.030 --> 04:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
when when i would send in a committee
 
04:44:31.040 --> 04:44:32.230 align:start position:0%
when when i would send in a committee
report

04:44:32.230 --> 04:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
report
 
04:44:34.150 --> 04:44:34.160 align:start position:0%
um because you know i didn't have it
 
04:44:35.910 --> 04:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
done by the end of the day you just you
 
04:44:38.310 --> 04:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
just have to send it in and and i think
 
04:44:41.270 --> 04:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
the committee assistant can and um do
 
04:44:44.310 --> 04:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
the rest you just kind of put on it you
 
04:44:44.320 --> 04:44:45.510 align:start position:0%
the rest you just kind of put on it you
know

04:44:45.510 --> 04:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:44:48.070 --> 04:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
otp and and all that but there's no
 
04:44:49.750 --> 04:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
specific form
 
04:44:49.760 --> 04:44:50.628 align:start position:0%
specific form
but

04:44:50.628 --> 04:44:50.638 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:44:52.788 --> 04:44:52.798 align:start position:0%
jen can tell us
 
04:44:54.948 --> 04:44:54.958 align:start position:0%
where to send and i don't think we have
 
04:44:56.390 --> 04:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
the um
 
04:44:58.868 --> 04:44:58.878 align:start position:0%
the committee assistance that we have
 
04:45:01.190 --> 04:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
we usually have right but he should he
 
04:45:02.948 --> 04:45:02.958 align:start position:0%
should know who our committee assistant
 
04:45:04.550 --> 04:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
is i mean i know who mine is for
 
04:45:07.270 --> 04:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
children and family right so
 
04:45:10.788 --> 04:45:10.798 align:start position:0%
yeah it's rebecca
 
04:45:15.350 --> 04:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:18.708 --> 04:45:18.718 align:start position:0%
but if you send a report to me i'll
 
04:45:20.390 --> 04:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
i'll look it over and then i'll get it
 
04:45:25.350 --> 04:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:28.708 --> 04:45:28.718 align:start position:0%
okay is there any uh uh representative
 
04:45:33.990 --> 04:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:35.830 --> 04:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
or representative macbeth
 
04:45:41.030 --> 04:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:41.040 --> 04:45:43.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:45:43.270 --> 04:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:44.788 --> 04:45:44.798 align:start position:0%
is there anything else we
 
04:45:46.628 --> 04:45:46.638 align:start position:0%
anything else we want to address during
 
04:45:50.628 --> 04:45:50.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:54.948 --> 04:45:54.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:57.830 --> 04:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
mr chairman yep
 
04:45:59.030 --> 04:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
would it be
 
04:46:03.270 --> 04:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
possible to discuss um 395 about the
 
04:46:08.070 --> 04:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:11.030 --> 04:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
3.95 that was the home share bill
 
04:46:11.040 --> 04:46:11.990 align:start position:0%
3.95 that was the home share bill
correct

04:46:11.990 --> 04:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:46:12.000 --> 04:46:13.510 align:start position:0%
correct
yep

04:46:13.510 --> 04:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
yep
 
04:46:16.788 --> 04:46:16.798 align:start position:0%
i just really felt that um this bill
 
04:46:19.590 --> 04:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
needed a lot of work i i like the
 
04:46:21.830 --> 04:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
concept of it and whatnot but i i think
 
04:46:24.070 --> 04:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
that it needs some more work so i'd like
 
04:46:26.230 --> 04:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
it if we could retain it and work on it
 
04:46:30.788 --> 04:46:30.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:33.350 --> 04:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh do you want to make that emotion i
 
04:46:34.788 --> 04:46:34.798 align:start position:0%
certainly do
 
04:46:37.510 --> 04:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
are we still are we still in executive
 
04:46:39.910 --> 04:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
session we are our chair
 
04:46:42.230 --> 04:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
we are
 
04:46:43.990 --> 04:46:44.000 align:start position:0%
now you're killing me
 
04:46:47.590 --> 04:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:47.600 --> 04:46:48.788 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:46:48.788 --> 04:46:48.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:46:51.110 --> 04:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh is there a uh is there a second to
 
04:46:54.390 --> 04:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
the motion first of all
 
04:46:57.350 --> 04:46:57.360 align:start position:0%
representative lorenzo has seconded it
 
04:46:57.360 --> 04:46:58.788 align:start position:0%
representative lorenzo has seconded it
and

04:46:58.788 --> 04:46:58.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:47:04.390 --> 04:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
is that what bill was that 395 3.95
 
04:47:06.708 --> 04:47:06.718 align:start position:0%
in discussion
 
04:47:10.390 --> 04:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:10.400 --> 04:47:11.750 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:47:11.750 --> 04:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:47:14.310 --> 04:47:14.320 align:start position:0%
well i mean like i said
 
04:47:17.750 --> 04:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
there i i think this this bill needs
 
04:47:20.070 --> 04:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
kind of a lot of work so i'd like to see
 
04:47:21.590 --> 04:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
if we can
 
04:47:21.600 --> 04:47:22.628 align:start position:0%
if we can
um

04:47:22.628 --> 04:47:22.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:24.948 --> 04:47:24.958 align:start position:0%
work on it because i i i understand the
 
04:47:26.788 --> 04:47:26.798 align:start position:0%
need of the north country needing this
 
04:47:28.070 --> 04:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
but um
 
04:47:30.230 --> 04:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
i think that we we need to work on it a
 
04:47:31.750 --> 04:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
little more
 
04:47:31.760 --> 04:47:33.110 align:start position:0%
little more
okay

04:47:33.110 --> 04:47:33.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:47:35.510 --> 04:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative sylvia
 
04:47:37.750 --> 04:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh yes i think this bill has a little
 
04:47:39.510 --> 04:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
bit more than a little work to do on it
 
04:47:42.310 --> 04:47:42.320 align:start position:0%
and i think it would be better to itl
 
04:47:45.190 --> 04:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
and if it's retained i will
 
04:47:50.470 --> 04:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:52.788 --> 04:47:52.798 align:start position:0%
i understand
 
04:47:52.798 --> 04:47:54.390 align:start position:0%
i understand
and

04:47:54.390 --> 04:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:47:56.070 --> 04:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh representative langley
 
04:47:59.190 --> 04:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
did you have your hand up um yes i did
 
04:48:00.628 --> 04:48:00.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
04:48:03.190 --> 04:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
um i i would agree um with
 
04:48:05.510 --> 04:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
representatives rice's comments i think
 
04:48:07.110 --> 04:48:07.120 align:start position:0%
the bill needs more clarity and
 
04:48:08.470 --> 04:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
certainly um
 
04:48:10.470 --> 04:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
more specific definitions i thought it
 
04:48:12.868 --> 04:48:12.878 align:start position:0%
was really vague although i love the
 
04:48:15.510 --> 04:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
concept and i think it has lots of
 
04:48:18.070 --> 04:48:18.080 align:start position:0%
potential i think the cl the lack of
 
04:48:19.910 --> 04:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
clarity would cause lots of problems
 
04:48:21.590 --> 04:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
eventually particularly for other
 
04:48:23.750 --> 04:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
regions if they tried to implement it
 
04:48:27.030 --> 04:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:28.310 --> 04:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
it um
 
04:48:30.550 --> 04:48:30.560 align:start position:0%
you know i just said i i thought that
 
04:48:32.150 --> 04:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh it it
 
04:48:35.590 --> 04:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
it's a concept that has value but
 
04:48:37.270 --> 04:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
i think the questions that were raised
 
04:48:39.190 --> 04:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
as to whether it was in the appropriate
 
04:48:39.200 --> 04:48:40.390 align:start position:0%
as to whether it was in the appropriate
statute

04:48:40.390 --> 04:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:48:42.868 --> 04:48:42.878 align:start position:0%
and the lack of definition
 
04:48:42.878 --> 04:48:43.990 align:start position:0%
and the lack of definition
really

04:48:43.990 --> 04:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:48:46.310 --> 04:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
made it something i think is going to
 
04:48:48.230 --> 04:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
require some work
 
04:48:52.310 --> 04:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:53.990 --> 04:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
other comments
 
04:48:56.470 --> 04:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
yeah uh representative horrigan
 
04:48:59.110 --> 04:48:59.120 align:start position:0%
um i have a procedural question and uh
 
04:49:00.070 --> 04:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
if we
 
04:49:03.030 --> 04:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
retain it does that prevent um
 
04:49:05.190 --> 04:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
the sponsors or some other alternative
 
04:49:07.110 --> 04:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
sponsors from
 
04:49:08.788 --> 04:49:08.798 align:start position:0%
um putting together a build during the
 
04:49:11.990 --> 04:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
next filing period this fall and um
 
04:49:14.150 --> 04:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
and or do they or just retain bill the
 
04:49:15.510 --> 04:49:15.520 align:start position:0%
only vehicle they would have in the
 
04:49:21.430 --> 04:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:24.390 --> 04:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
i believe as long as we don't itl it
 
04:49:30.470 --> 04:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:33.110 --> 04:49:33.120 align:start position:0%
representative green
 
04:49:35.350 --> 04:49:35.360 align:start position:0%
what stuck on my mind was the testimony
 
04:49:37.430 --> 04:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
of one of the folks saying that
 
04:49:39.270 --> 04:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
if the committee wants to define home
 
04:49:43.030 --> 04:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
share i'm not opposed to it that to me
 
04:49:44.628 --> 04:49:44.638 align:start position:0%
you know that
 
04:49:46.310 --> 04:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
was enough for me to
 
04:49:54.070 --> 04:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:55.590 --> 04:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
any other
 
04:49:59.590 --> 04:49:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:01.590 --> 04:50:01.600 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
04:50:03.350 --> 04:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
in some respects i agree with
 
04:50:05.670 --> 04:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
representative sylvia it's this bill
 
04:50:07.670 --> 04:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
require is going to require a lot more
 
04:50:09.990 --> 04:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
than tinkering around the edges and some
 
04:50:11.830 --> 04:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
definitional changes
 
04:50:14.150 --> 04:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh it seemed to me that the premise of
 
04:50:15.350 --> 04:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:50:17.110 --> 04:50:17.120 align:start position:0%
was that
 
04:50:17.120 --> 04:50:18.470 align:start position:0%
was that
some

04:50:18.470 --> 04:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
some
 
04:50:20.708 --> 04:50:20.718 align:start position:0%
some organization
 
04:50:22.868 --> 04:50:22.878 align:start position:0%
was going to um
 
04:50:27.350 --> 04:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
supervise monitor and otherwise
 
04:50:27.360 --> 04:50:28.390 align:start position:0%
supervise monitor and otherwise
filter

04:50:28.390 --> 04:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
filter
 
04:50:29.990 --> 04:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
the process
 
04:50:33.110 --> 04:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
none of that's in the bill and so i
 
04:50:35.350 --> 04:50:35.360 align:start position:0%
think if the bill is going to be
 
04:50:35.360 --> 04:50:36.628 align:start position:0%
think if the bill is going to be
retained

04:50:36.628 --> 04:50:36.638 align:start position:0%
retained
 
04:50:39.830 --> 04:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh it's going to take uh massive surgery
 
04:50:45.350 --> 04:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:45.360 --> 04:50:47.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:50:47.990 --> 04:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:49.830 --> 04:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
any other comments
 
04:50:52.070 --> 04:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
representative lorenzo thank you mr
 
04:50:54.708 --> 04:50:54.718 align:start position:0%
clear i agree with what representative
 
04:50:57.990 --> 04:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
birch just said that the bill does need
 
04:51:00.868 --> 04:51:00.878 align:start position:0%
a lot of work and i think one of my main
 
04:51:03.750 --> 04:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
concerns is around life safety issues
 
04:51:03.760 --> 04:51:04.550 align:start position:0%
concerns is around life safety issues
and

04:51:04.550 --> 04:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:51:06.550 --> 04:51:06.560 align:start position:0%
because we're talking about vulnerable
 
04:51:09.110 --> 04:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
individuals um
 
04:51:11.750 --> 04:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
in a home who could be taken advantage
 
04:51:15.030 --> 04:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
of i also worry about fire code building
 
04:51:17.910 --> 04:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
codes um emergency situations
 
04:51:17.920 --> 04:51:18.788 align:start position:0%
codes um emergency situations
so

04:51:18.788 --> 04:51:18.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:51:21.030 --> 04:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
and i hate to add and add more
 
04:51:23.030 --> 04:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
regulations but um
 
04:51:24.868 --> 04:51:24.878 align:start position:0%
i think that lives could be at stake
 
04:51:27.190 --> 04:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
here if this isn't isn't done correctly
 
04:51:31.350 --> 04:51:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:33.190 --> 04:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
can i just ask representative lorenzo
 
04:51:36.868 --> 04:51:36.878 align:start position:0%
does that mean you support the motion or
 
04:51:39.510 --> 04:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
support would support a motion to
 
04:51:44.708 --> 04:51:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:47.350 --> 04:51:47.360 align:start position:0%
i would support emotion to retain it
 
04:51:51.350 --> 04:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:57.190 --> 04:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:59.030 --> 04:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
are you ready
 
04:52:01.830 --> 04:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
yes representative smith uh thank you
 
04:52:03.350 --> 04:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
very much um
 
04:52:07.270 --> 04:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:11.350 --> 04:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
if one has prejudices and biases
 
04:52:11.360 --> 04:52:12.310 align:start position:0%
if one has prejudices and biases
it's

04:52:12.310 --> 04:52:12.320 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:52:14.550 --> 04:52:14.560 align:start position:0%
important to always
 
04:52:16.868 --> 04:52:16.878 align:start position:0%
communicate those so people know that
 
04:52:22.150 --> 04:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:24.470 --> 04:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm not necessarily referring to
 
04:52:27.590 --> 04:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
this bill but i'm referring to the ease
 
04:52:30.310 --> 04:52:30.320 align:start position:0%
with which we might agree to retain
 
04:52:30.320 --> 04:52:31.670 align:start position:0%
with which we might agree to retain
bills

04:52:31.670 --> 04:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
bills
 
04:52:31.680 --> 04:52:33.350 align:start position:0%
bills
um

04:52:33.350 --> 04:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:36.550 --> 04:52:36.560 align:start position:0%
if a bill needs an incredible amount of
 
04:52:36.560 --> 04:52:37.430 align:start position:0%
if a bill needs an incredible amount of
work

04:52:37.430 --> 04:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:52:40.470 --> 04:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
it is not really the committee's
 
04:52:40.480 --> 04:52:43.350 align:start position:0%
it is not really the committee's
responsibility

04:52:43.350 --> 04:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
04:52:43.360 --> 04:52:44.470 align:start position:0%
responsibility
and

04:52:44.470 --> 04:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:52:46.110 --> 04:52:46.120 align:start position:0%
but it becomes the committee's
 
04:52:49.030 --> 04:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
responsibility if we retain and every
 
04:52:49.040 --> 04:52:49.830 align:start position:0%
responsibility if we retain and every
bill

04:52:49.830 --> 04:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:52:52.150 --> 04:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
that you vote to retain means you are
 
04:52:54.150 --> 04:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
going to have to spend time in the
 
04:52:56.708 --> 04:52:56.718 align:start position:0%
summer and the fall
 
04:53:01.190 --> 04:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:02.788 --> 04:53:02.798 align:start position:0%
we're not
 
04:53:04.470 --> 04:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
we're not using
 
04:53:06.310 --> 04:53:06.320 align:start position:0%
retention in a way that it should be
 
04:53:09.590 --> 04:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
used so i would just urge people
 
04:53:11.510 --> 04:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
as they vote
 
04:53:13.110 --> 04:53:13.120 align:start position:0%
to be sure
 
04:53:16.070 --> 04:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
that it is a bill that they believe
 
04:53:17.590 --> 04:53:17.600 align:start position:0%
is worth
 
04:53:19.750 --> 04:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
improving and working on and they are
 
04:53:22.150 --> 04:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
willing to put the time in
 
04:53:25.270 --> 04:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
um just putting off
 
04:53:26.550 --> 04:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
a decision
 
04:53:28.788 --> 04:53:28.798 align:start position:0%
is not a good reason
 
04:53:31.750 --> 04:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
if the motion stands to
 
04:53:35.590 --> 04:53:35.600 align:start position:0%
retain i would vote to retain the bill
 
04:53:39.350 --> 04:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
but i just wanted to um
 
04:53:41.350 --> 04:53:41.360 align:start position:0%
make that point
 
04:53:42.708 --> 04:53:42.718 align:start position:0%
the worst thing
 
04:53:44.470 --> 04:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
that could happen to us as a committee
 
04:53:47.670 --> 04:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
is to suddenly find that we have a very
 
04:53:49.590 --> 04:53:49.600 align:start position:0%
long list of bills that have to be
 
04:53:51.910 --> 04:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
worked on during the summer and fall
 
04:53:55.430 --> 04:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:57.830 --> 04:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
well i guess that's the question i'd ask
 
04:53:59.590 --> 04:53:59.600 align:start position:0%
and uh you know
 
04:54:01.270 --> 04:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
representative sylvia sort of mentioned
 
04:54:03.190 --> 04:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
it and said
 
04:54:05.510 --> 04:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
i really don't want to work on this i
 
04:54:07.750 --> 04:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to be put onto a committee is
 
04:54:09.430 --> 04:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
there anybody
 
04:54:12.150 --> 04:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
on our committee who wants to be put on
 
04:54:18.708 --> 04:54:18.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:20.948 --> 04:54:20.958 align:start position:0%
and and and maybe that's the answer to
 
04:54:22.788 --> 04:54:22.798 align:start position:0%
the question you know representative
 
04:54:24.868 --> 04:54:24.878 align:start position:0%
langley did you have your hand i would
 
04:54:27.350 --> 04:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
i will yes yes i would
 
04:54:27.360 --> 04:54:28.390 align:start position:0%
i will yes yes i would
okay

04:54:28.390 --> 04:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:54:31.190 --> 04:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
i think it's worthy of it i i you know i
 
04:54:32.708 --> 04:54:32.718 align:start position:0%
mean we may not
 
04:54:35.750 --> 04:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
come out with with something we can we
 
04:54:37.430 --> 04:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
can do we may find that it's too
 
04:54:39.270 --> 04:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
difficult but i think it deserves more
 
04:54:41.190 --> 04:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
than a half hours worth of time in our
 
04:54:43.350 --> 04:54:43.360 align:start position:0%
committee today
 
04:54:45.430 --> 04:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
to come by that this is a problem
 
04:54:47.190 --> 04:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
they're having in the north country and
 
04:54:48.390 --> 04:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
i think we should at least try to
 
04:54:50.470 --> 04:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
address it
 
04:54:52.310 --> 04:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:54:52.320 --> 04:54:53.110 align:start position:0%
thank you
uh

04:54:53.110 --> 04:54:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:54:54.948 --> 04:54:54.958 align:start position:0%
representative wilper did you have a
 
04:54:57.670 --> 04:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
comment a question well i do because um
 
04:54:59.350 --> 04:54:59.360 align:start position:0%
i agree with pretty much everything that
 
04:55:01.910 --> 04:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
has been said thus far
 
04:55:03.910 --> 04:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
so i think i personally think this is an
 
04:55:05.430 --> 04:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
excellent idea and it's something that's
 
04:55:07.830 --> 04:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
needed not just in the north country
 
04:55:10.070 --> 04:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
but across our state
 
04:55:10.080 --> 04:55:11.110 align:start position:0%
but across our state
so

04:55:11.110 --> 04:55:11.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:55:14.550 --> 04:55:14.560 align:start position:0%
it's worthy of a lot of work
 
04:55:15.510 --> 04:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
but i
 
04:55:17.270 --> 04:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
am don't want to spend
 
04:55:19.830 --> 04:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
so first of all i have no the more i
 
04:55:21.590 --> 04:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
heard today the more work i think it
 
04:55:21.600 --> 04:55:22.948 align:start position:0%
heard today the more work i think it
needs

04:55:22.948 --> 04:55:22.958 align:start position:0%
needs
 
04:55:24.230 --> 04:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
we don't know where it wants to go in
 
04:55:26.708 --> 04:55:26.718 align:start position:0%
the statutes we don't even know who the
 
04:55:29.110 --> 04:55:29.120 align:start position:0%
the real stakeholders are the whole idea
 
04:55:30.788 --> 04:55:30.798 align:start position:0%
of agreeing on some kind of an
 
04:55:32.868 --> 04:55:32.878 align:start position:0%
organization or whatever some kind of an
 
04:55:35.910 --> 04:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
administrative portion of this
 
04:55:38.788 --> 04:55:38.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:41.510 --> 04:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
it needs to be done
 
04:55:42.948 --> 04:55:42.958 align:start position:0%
but if
 
04:55:44.788 --> 04:55:44.798 align:start position:0%
that work can get done and the new bill
 
04:55:46.868 --> 04:55:46.878 align:start position:0%
introduced next year well
 
04:55:48.550 --> 04:55:48.560 align:start position:0%
they act people actually think they can
 
04:55:49.750 --> 04:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
get it done
 
04:55:52.070 --> 04:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
between now and
 
04:55:53.590 --> 04:55:53.600 align:start position:0%
because we have to report this back for
 
04:55:57.430 --> 04:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:59.350 --> 04:55:59.360 align:start position:0%
if we i don't know
 
04:56:01.270 --> 04:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
i don't i think it's too much for us to
 
04:56:04.310 --> 04:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
do as a retained bill
 
04:56:05.590 --> 04:56:05.600 align:start position:0%
i think uh
 
04:56:09.430 --> 04:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:11.990 --> 04:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i was um just
 
04:56:13.510 --> 04:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
thinking about that all the housing
 
04:56:15.030 --> 04:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
issues that we're hearing about and that
 
04:56:17.110 --> 04:56:17.120 align:start position:0%
we know we have around the state and
 
04:56:18.788 --> 04:56:18.798 align:start position:0%
there aren't there aren't going to be a
 
04:56:21.590 --> 04:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
lot of simple fixes i think
 
04:56:24.230 --> 04:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
for that situation across the state so i
 
04:56:26.150 --> 04:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
think that's why i'm willing to invest
 
04:56:28.470 --> 04:56:28.480 align:start position:0%
some time in just to see if this is a
 
04:56:31.430 --> 04:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
possible um one possible solution
 
04:56:31.440 --> 04:56:33.270 align:start position:0%
possible um one possible solution
there

04:56:33.270 --> 04:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:56:35.110 --> 04:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
representative silver
 
04:56:37.030 --> 04:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh
 
04:56:39.590 --> 04:56:39.600 align:start position:0%
i think that the role
 
04:56:42.310 --> 04:56:42.320 align:start position:0%
for revising this to get it into
 
04:56:43.990 --> 04:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
acceptable form
 
04:56:46.310 --> 04:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
rightfully belongs to the sponsors not
 
04:56:48.150 --> 04:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
to the committee
 
04:56:51.430 --> 04:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
so my view is that i would vote against
 
04:56:55.350 --> 04:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
retaining the bill and i would vote itl
 
04:56:56.390 --> 04:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:56:56.400 --> 04:56:57.590 align:start position:0%
thank you
and

04:56:57.590 --> 04:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:56:57.600 --> 04:56:58.708 align:start position:0%
and
uh

04:56:58.708 --> 04:56:58.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:57:00.550 --> 04:57:00.560 align:start position:0%
representative horrigan
 
04:57:02.708 --> 04:57:02.718 align:start position:0%
um yes
 
04:57:06.070 --> 04:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
first of all as for the itl
 
04:57:08.628 --> 04:57:08.638 align:start position:0%
as for the itl if if we
 
04:57:10.788 --> 04:57:10.798 align:start position:0%
if if we go with the itl and if the full
 
04:57:12.788 --> 04:57:12.798 align:start position:0%
house agrees with it then um the
 
04:57:14.708 --> 04:57:14.718 align:start position:0%
sponsors would not be able to introduce
 
04:57:17.110 --> 04:57:17.120 align:start position:0%
a bill in the house uh your next filing
 
04:57:19.670 --> 04:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
period unless it uh less was tabled on
 
04:57:21.350 --> 04:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
the floor but that's uh that's beyond
 
04:57:24.230 --> 04:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
the purview of this committee um
 
04:57:26.070 --> 04:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
even though we have the speaker pro tem
 
04:57:27.270 --> 04:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
sitting on the committee but that's a
 
04:57:29.270 --> 04:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
separate role that she has so that you
 
04:57:31.110 --> 04:57:31.120 align:start position:0%
know if we retain the bill some of the
 
04:57:32.788 --> 04:57:32.798 align:start position:0%
sponsors could come in the process we
 
04:57:35.270 --> 04:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
probably will be retaining a lot more
 
04:57:37.110 --> 04:57:37.120 align:start position:0%
bills um
 
04:57:38.868 --> 04:57:38.878 align:start position:0%
this year probably every committee will
 
04:57:41.750 --> 04:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
be although um
 
04:57:43.670 --> 04:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
retaining this one today may be
 
04:57:47.110 --> 04:57:47.120 align:start position:0%
premature and uh and and unnecessary
 
04:57:48.310 --> 04:57:48.320 align:start position:0%
since we've seen
 
04:57:49.670 --> 04:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
we seem to have
 
04:57:51.510 --> 04:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
agreed this bill is like pretty far from
 
04:57:53.430 --> 04:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
anything that we can actually pass so
 
04:57:53.440 --> 04:57:54.230 align:start position:0%
anything that we can actually pass so
but

04:57:54.230 --> 04:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:57:54.240 --> 04:57:55.590 align:start position:0%
but
um

04:57:55.590 --> 04:57:55.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:57.830 --> 04:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
that's just uh
 
04:58:01.270 --> 04:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
i i'm i'm not actually not 100 decided
 
04:58:03.030 --> 04:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
on what i want to do with it i don't
 
04:58:04.708 --> 04:58:04.718 align:start position:0%
really don't feel comfortable retaining
 
04:58:04.718 --> 04:58:05.670 align:start position:0%
really don't feel comfortable retaining
this

04:58:05.670 --> 04:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:58:07.510 --> 04:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
retaining this one but i don't really
 
04:58:11.670 --> 04:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:13.590 --> 04:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
representative rice
 
04:58:15.590 --> 04:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you so i i just kind of have a
 
04:58:17.590 --> 04:58:17.600 align:start position:0%
question and i should probably know the
 
04:58:19.430 --> 04:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
answer to this but i don't because i i
 
04:58:21.590 --> 04:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
almost feel like this bill is
 
04:58:24.788 --> 04:58:24.798 align:start position:0%
would be better as two separate bills
 
04:58:24.798 --> 04:58:25.590 align:start position:0%
would be better as two separate bills
so

04:58:25.590 --> 04:58:25.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:58:25.600 --> 04:58:26.868 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:58:26.868 --> 04:58:26.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:29.190 --> 04:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
if we idled it
 
04:58:32.708 --> 04:58:32.718 align:start position:0%
if they brought back two separate bills
 
04:58:33.750 --> 04:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:58:37.030 --> 04:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
fall would they be able to do that
 
04:58:39.270 --> 04:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
i just they could they do that
 
04:58:42.868 --> 04:58:42.878 align:start position:0%
representative smith
 
04:58:45.430 --> 04:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
oh sorry representative gordon
 
04:58:47.590 --> 04:58:47.600 align:start position:0%
that's okay
 
04:58:47.600 --> 04:58:49.270 align:start position:0%
that's okay
sorry

04:58:49.270 --> 04:58:49.280 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
04:58:52.070 --> 04:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:53.910 --> 04:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
i can't i can't hear representative
 
04:58:57.350 --> 04:58:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:59.670 --> 04:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
representative gordon knows that i
 
04:59:01.910 --> 04:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
worship at his
 
04:59:03.910 --> 04:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
chairman's feet so
 
04:59:06.470 --> 04:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
he wouldn't take offense
 
04:59:09.190 --> 04:59:09.200 align:start position:0%
of you asking me a question
 
04:59:09.200 --> 04:59:10.788 align:start position:0%
of you asking me a question
couldn't

04:59:10.788 --> 04:59:10.798 align:start position:0%
couldn't
 
04:59:13.830 --> 04:59:13.840 align:start position:0%
i think that's fair to say
 
04:59:16.310 --> 04:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
in no way would i want to be chair today
 
04:59:16.320 --> 04:59:21.350 align:start position:0%
in no way would i want to be chair today
so

04:59:21.350 --> 04:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:23.510 --> 04:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
so but are you going to answer them
 
04:59:25.830 --> 04:59:25.840 align:start position:0%
so kim yeah i think you're right this
 
04:59:27.990 --> 04:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
was two bills last year
 
04:59:29.350 --> 04:59:29.360 align:start position:0%
and they bring of course that was a
 
04:59:31.270 --> 04:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
different session
 
04:59:33.750 --> 04:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
right right but so but right so that's
 
04:59:36.948 --> 04:59:36.958 align:start position:0%
that's my question is if we itl this
 
04:59:39.190 --> 04:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
could the sponsors then divide this into
 
04:59:42.470 --> 04:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
two and bring each bill back separately
 
04:59:43.910 --> 04:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
for the next
 
04:59:43.920 --> 04:59:45.350 align:start position:0%
for the next
session

04:59:45.350 --> 04:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
session
 
04:59:47.190 --> 04:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
do you know what i mean for the the next
 
04:59:48.470 --> 04:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
i do
 
04:59:49.910 --> 04:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
time around
 
04:59:52.788 --> 04:59:52.798 align:start position:0%
and when i get it
 
04:59:57.190 --> 04:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
if they itl if we itl the bill
 
05:00:01.430 --> 05:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
they cannot bring the same bill back for
 
05:00:04.070 --> 05:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
the second year of the session
 
05:00:07.830 --> 05:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
but they could bring back
 
05:00:11.990 --> 05:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
different bills on the same
 
05:00:13.750 --> 05:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
subject general
 
05:00:16.070 --> 05:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
ti in the same church but not the same
 
05:00:16.080 --> 05:00:19.590 align:start position:0%
ti in the same church but not the same
pew

05:00:19.590 --> 05:00:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:21.750 --> 05:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
so i think then perhaps i would like to
 
05:00:24.470 --> 05:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
withdraw my motion
 
05:00:28.150 --> 05:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:29.750 --> 05:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
about you would you would draw your
 
05:00:29.760 --> 05:00:30.628 align:start position:0%
about you would you would draw your
second

05:00:30.628 --> 05:00:30.638 align:start position:0%
second
 
05:00:34.868 --> 05:00:34.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:40.150 --> 05:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:42.708 --> 05:00:42.718 align:start position:0%
so that means uh
 
05:00:44.708 --> 05:00:44.718 align:start position:0%
motion having been withdrawn and the
 
05:00:46.868 --> 05:00:46.878 align:start position:0%
second having been withdrawn we're back
 
05:00:49.190 --> 05:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
to go do you want to act on the bill at
 
05:00:51.270 --> 05:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
all i guess is the question i'm going to
 
05:00:53.270 --> 05:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
move itl
 
05:00:53.280 --> 05:00:55.190 align:start position:0%
move itl
second

05:00:55.190 --> 05:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
second
 
05:00:58.708 --> 05:00:58.718 align:start position:0%
who was that that seconded silver
 
05:01:00.230 --> 05:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
representative silver seconded the
 
05:01:00.240 --> 05:01:01.510 align:start position:0%
representative silver seconded the
motion

05:01:01.510 --> 05:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
motion
 
05:01:03.990 --> 05:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
moved by representative rice
 
05:01:12.150 --> 05:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:14.550 --> 05:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
don't see any
 
05:01:16.390 --> 05:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
representative simpson
 
05:01:18.310 --> 05:01:18.320 align:start position:0%
can i ask a clarifying another
 
05:01:21.590 --> 05:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
clarifying question um
 
05:01:24.310 --> 05:01:24.320 align:start position:0%
if it's all right
 
05:01:27.030 --> 05:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
i was wondering if they bring the either
 
05:01:28.390 --> 05:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
this please
 
05:01:30.310 --> 05:01:30.320 align:start position:0%
thank you if they bring this bill back
 
05:01:32.230 --> 05:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
as one bill or two bills if they bring
 
05:01:35.270 --> 05:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
it under um as was suggested by someone
 
05:01:36.868 --> 05:01:36.878 align:start position:0%
i think that they bring it under a
 
05:01:38.868 --> 05:01:38.878 align:start position:0%
different statute
 
05:01:41.430 --> 05:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
does that count as a different bill like
 
05:01:43.270 --> 05:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
they do all the work and it comes under
 
05:01:45.030 --> 05:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
a different statute that might also
 
05:01:47.110 --> 05:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
count as a different
 
05:01:49.510 --> 05:01:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh attempt right
 
05:01:52.550 --> 05:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:54.070 --> 05:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
you know frankly
 
05:01:56.150 --> 05:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
the question is who's going to object to
 
05:01:56.160 --> 05:01:56.948 align:start position:0%
the question is who's going to object to
it

05:01:56.948 --> 05:01:56.958 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:01:58.390 --> 05:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
if they bring it back
 
05:01:58.400 --> 05:01:59.350 align:start position:0%
if they bring it back
and

05:01:59.350 --> 05:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:02:01.350 --> 05:02:01.360 align:start position:0%
and frankly given the discussion we've
 
05:02:04.070 --> 05:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
had here today i'm not sure that anybody
 
05:02:08.788 --> 05:02:08.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:11.350 --> 05:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:13.910 --> 05:02:13.920 align:start position:0%

05:06:40.590 --> 05:06:40.600 align:start position:0%
um following up on representative rice's
 
05:06:43.270 --> 05:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic acceptance of having to
 
05:06:44.788 --> 05:06:44.798 align:start position:0%
write the report
 
05:06:47.990 --> 05:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
i wonder if she could be
 
05:06:50.150 --> 05:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
clear in the report
 
05:06:50.160 --> 05:06:51.030 align:start position:0%
clear in the report
um

05:06:51.030 --> 05:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:53.510 --> 05:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
that the committee thought
 
05:06:56.310 --> 05:06:56.320 align:start position:0%
many of the um
 
05:06:58.390 --> 05:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
issues in the bill
 
05:07:02.708 --> 05:07:02.718 align:start position:0%
were important and deserved
 
05:07:02.718 --> 05:07:05.430 align:start position:0%
were important and deserved
further

05:07:05.430 --> 05:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:08.230 --> 05:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
investigation but that the bill itself
 
05:07:10.390 --> 05:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
was not ready
 
05:07:13.270 --> 05:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
right now for us to act on i think
 
05:07:15.350 --> 05:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
that it will be important for the since
 
05:07:16.628 --> 05:07:16.638 align:start position:0%
that's true
 
05:07:18.948 --> 05:07:18.958 align:start position:0%
i think it would be important to reflect
 
05:07:21.350 --> 05:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
that in the blurb
 
05:07:22.628 --> 05:07:22.638 align:start position:0%
no you're not supposed to call it a
 
05:07:23.910 --> 05:07:23.920 align:start position:0%
blurb anymore what are you supposed to
 
05:07:27.190 --> 05:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
call it now report report report report
 
05:07:28.310 --> 05:07:28.320 align:start position:0%

05:07:28.320 --> 05:07:29.430 align:start position:0%

um
 
05:07:31.910 --> 05:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
i think it would be helpful to them as
 
05:07:36.390 --> 05:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
they go about drafting another version
 
05:07:38.470 --> 05:07:38.480 align:start position:0%
so it's just a suggestion
 
05:07:39.430 --> 05:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:07:41.270 --> 05:07:41.280 align:start position:0%

uh mr chair i agree with representative
 
05:07:48.310 --> 05:07:48.320 align:start position:0%
smith and i think we just have different
 
05:07:49.830 --> 05:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
ways of getting the same solution we all
 
05:07:51.750 --> 05:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
understand it's a um it's a problem it
 
05:07:53.110 --> 05:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
should be a priority we just think it
 
05:07:55.270 --> 05:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
should i thought it should happen um
 
05:07:57.510 --> 05:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
this year not next year so um i'm not
 
05:07:59.670 --> 05:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
writing a report
 
05:08:01.590 --> 05:08:01.600 align:start position:0%

05:08:28.390 --> 05:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:28.400 --> 05:08:29.910 align:start position:0%
 
object

05:08:29.910 --> 05:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
object
 
05:08:31.590 --> 05:08:31.600 align:start position:0%

if that's the case then without a i'm
 
05:08:39.190 --> 05:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
not sure i can do it without objection i
 
05:08:41.350 --> 05:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
guess we'd have to vote if we have
 
05:08:43.990 --> 05:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
yeah you'd have to do without objection
 
05:08:45.830 --> 05:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
yeah and as long as they don't object
 
05:08:47.990 --> 05:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
you can go ahead and have it on the on
 
05:08:50.150 --> 05:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
the consent calendar as long as the
 
05:08:51.510 --> 05:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
three that voted against it or even
 
05:08:54.150 --> 05:08:54.160 align:start position:0%
someone that did as long as they
 
05:08:56.830 --> 05:08:56.840 align:start position:0%
are okay with it going on consent
 
05:08:56.840 --> 05:08:58.788 align:start position:0%

then without objection i'll
uh

05:09:01.910 --> 05:09:01.920 align:start position:0%

05:11:42.390 --> 05:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:11:44.070 --> 05:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh you may have noticed that i noted my
 
05:11:46.788 --> 05:11:46.798 align:start position:0%
position as neutral however the mortgage
 
05:11:48.788 --> 05:11:48.798 align:start position:0%
bankers and brokers association fully
 
05:11:51.910 --> 05:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
support the intent of the legislation
 
05:11:55.190 --> 05:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
to provide a little background in 2020
 
05:11:57.110 --> 05:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
the mortgage bankers and brokers asked
 
05:11:58.868 --> 05:11:58.878 align:start position:0%
senator kavanaugh to introduce
 
05:12:01.590 --> 05:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
legislation to establish a commission to
 
05:12:03.430 --> 05:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
study the implementation
 
05:12:05.910 --> 05:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
of remote online notarization in new
 
05:12:05.920 --> 05:12:07.350 align:start position:0%
of remote online notarization in new
hampshire

05:12:07.350 --> 05:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
05:12:10.550 --> 05:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
as 22 states have begun to modify their
 
05:12:13.190 --> 05:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
notary laws to move in this direction we
 
05:12:14.470 --> 05:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
felt the time was right for new
 
05:12:16.948 --> 05:12:16.958 align:start position:0%
hampshire to explore joining them
 
05:12:18.628 --> 05:12:18.638 align:start position:0%
well that legislation did pass the
 
05:12:20.310 --> 05:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
senate unanimously
 
05:12:22.070 --> 05:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
due to covid
 
05:12:24.230 --> 05:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
the bill wasn't unable to be heard in
 
05:12:26.470 --> 05:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
the house and therefore
 
05:12:29.270 --> 05:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
was laid on the table and didn't pass
 
05:12:31.590 --> 05:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
and i think we can all agree that
 
05:12:33.430 --> 05:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
the timing couldn't have been worse
 
05:12:35.990 --> 05:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
because we really needed remote online
 
05:12:39.510 --> 05:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
notarization during this crisis
 
05:12:41.670 --> 05:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
governor sununu did issue an executive
 
05:12:44.550 --> 05:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
order number 11 to allow for a form of
 
05:12:46.788 --> 05:12:46.798 align:start position:0%
remote online notarization
 
05:12:48.788 --> 05:12:48.798 align:start position:0%
which has been helpful to businesses and
 
05:12:51.270 --> 05:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
residents during these challenging times
 
05:12:53.110 --> 05:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
governor sununu has indicated some of
 
05:12:55.910 --> 05:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
his priorities for the session would be
 
05:12:57.830 --> 05:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
addressing executive orders that could
 
05:12:59.670 --> 05:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
be put into statute
 
05:13:01.990 --> 05:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
as a result a group of stakeholders who
 
05:13:03.430 --> 05:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
otherwise would have been on the
 
05:13:05.830 --> 05:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
commission had met over the summer and
 
05:13:08.230 --> 05:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
fall to draft a more robust remote
 
05:13:10.550 --> 05:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
online notarization law with the input
 
05:13:12.868 --> 05:13:12.878 align:start position:0%
of all the stakeholders involved that
 
05:13:14.550 --> 05:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
language was provided to senator
 
05:13:16.628 --> 05:13:16.638 align:start position:0%
cavanaugh to be introduced in the senate
 
05:13:18.310 --> 05:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
where it has currently been placed into
 
05:13:20.390 --> 05:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
an omnibus bill that has yet to be
 
05:13:22.070 --> 05:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
scheduled and the language is not yet
 
05:13:22.080 --> 05:13:23.510 align:start position:0%
scheduled and the language is not yet
available

05:13:23.510 --> 05:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
available
 
05:13:25.350 --> 05:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
i will note that representative
 
05:13:28.550 --> 05:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
danielson is was a co-sponsor of the lsr
 
05:13:30.788 --> 05:13:30.798 align:start position:0%
from senator kavanaugh and senator
 
05:13:32.948 --> 05:13:32.958 align:start position:0%
carson will be this prime sponsor of the
 
05:13:36.310 --> 05:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:38.550 --> 05:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
house bill 287 is
 
05:13:41.190 --> 05:13:41.200 align:start position:0%
not an early bill and so my
 
05:13:43.590 --> 05:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
request is that the committee hold this
 
05:13:46.310 --> 05:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
bill until such time as the senate has
 
05:13:48.070 --> 05:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
acted on the version that the
 
05:13:49.910 --> 05:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
stakeholders agreed to
 
05:13:51.830 --> 05:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
and hopefully that will make its way
 
05:13:54.628 --> 05:13:54.638 align:start position:0%
over to you um if that's not the case
 
05:13:56.708 --> 05:13:56.718 align:start position:0%
then my request would be to retain the
 
05:13:59.110 --> 05:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
bill or i can provide the language when
 
05:14:01.190 --> 05:14:01.200 align:start position:0%
it's available from the office of
 
05:14:02.868 --> 05:14:02.878 align:start position:0%
legislative services
 
05:14:04.550 --> 05:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
and provide that to you to be brought
 
05:14:06.470 --> 05:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
forward as an amendment
 
05:14:08.310 --> 05:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
i did want to note that the stakeholders
 
05:14:10.150 --> 05:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
who did participate in the drafting of
 
05:14:11.830 --> 05:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
the senate language were the new
 
05:14:13.510 --> 05:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire bankers association the new
 
05:14:15.350 --> 05:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire credit union league the new
 
05:14:17.510 --> 05:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire realtors the registers of
 
05:14:20.708 --> 05:14:20.718 align:start position:0%
deeds several title companies as well as
 
05:14:22.470 --> 05:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state offered their
 
05:14:22.480 --> 05:14:24.550 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state offered their
input

05:14:24.550 --> 05:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
input
 
05:14:25.990 --> 05:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
i thought it may be helpful to provide
 
05:14:27.350 --> 05:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
the committee with some background on
 
05:14:29.030 --> 05:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
what's happening relative to remote
 
05:14:31.190 --> 05:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
online notarization
 
05:14:32.470 --> 05:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
05:14:34.230 --> 05:14:34.240 align:start position:0%
however carol willoughby from first
 
05:14:35.670 --> 05:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
american title
 
05:14:37.590 --> 05:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
she was very instrumental in helping to
 
05:14:39.430 --> 05:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
draft the language as she has worked on
 
05:14:41.990 --> 05:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
this legislation in other states
 
05:14:43.750 --> 05:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
and i don't believe she has signed up to
 
05:14:45.750 --> 05:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
speak however she is available in the
 
05:14:47.990 --> 05:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
zoom waiting room if anyone has any
 
05:14:49.830 --> 05:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
technical questions or questions on
 
05:14:52.628 --> 05:14:52.638 align:start position:0%
remote notarization i would uh defer to
 
05:14:55.110 --> 05:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
her given her expertise and knowledge in
 
05:14:58.708 --> 05:14:58.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:01.990 --> 05:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
yeah any questions for mr praise song
 
05:15:02.000 --> 05:15:03.110 align:start position:0%
yeah any questions for mr praise song
yes

05:15:03.110 --> 05:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:15:04.550 --> 05:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
representative silber
 
05:15:07.590 --> 05:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
the question i have is since i
 
05:15:09.350 --> 05:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
formerly lived and practiced law in
 
05:15:11.030 --> 05:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
florida for many years before i was able
 
05:15:12.708 --> 05:15:12.718 align:start position:0%
to escape
 
05:15:15.990 --> 05:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
florida has a similar statute but they
 
05:15:18.868 --> 05:15:18.878 align:start position:0%
also have a statutory short form of
 
05:15:21.350 --> 05:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
acknowledgement that specifically
 
05:15:23.750 --> 05:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
indicates whether the notarization is
 
05:15:26.708 --> 05:15:26.718 align:start position:0%
taking place in person or remotely is
 
05:15:30.070 --> 05:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
there any plan to have a companion
 
05:15:32.788 --> 05:15:32.798 align:start position:0%
proposal to adopt something like that
 
05:15:34.230 --> 05:15:34.240 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire
 
05:15:35.750 --> 05:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative i certainly
 
05:15:37.750 --> 05:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question again you know i
 
05:15:39.350 --> 05:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
think you know carol willoughby would
 
05:15:40.788 --> 05:15:40.798 align:start position:0%
certainly be someone that she may be
 
05:15:43.030 --> 05:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
more familiar with the florida law that
 
05:15:44.708 --> 05:15:44.718 align:start position:0%
you're referencing and may be able to
 
05:15:49.430 --> 05:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:54.628 --> 05:15:54.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:56.708 --> 05:15:56.718 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you mr pricelow
 
05:16:00.070 --> 05:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
for taking my question first of all if
 
05:16:02.788 --> 05:16:02.798 align:start position:0%
what you presented is in written form
 
05:16:04.470 --> 05:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
can you submit that
 
05:16:06.628 --> 05:16:06.638 align:start position:0%
so that we can have make reference to it
 
05:16:09.030 --> 05:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
when we think about the bill
 
05:16:11.270 --> 05:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
and absolutely
 
05:16:13.270 --> 05:16:13.280 align:start position:0%

thank you that's appreciated
um

05:16:17.670 --> 05:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
stepping back a bit
 
05:16:17.680 --> 05:16:19.270 align:start position:0%
stepping back a bit
uh

05:16:19.270 --> 05:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:16:21.430 --> 05:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
what in this day and age
 
05:16:24.868 --> 05:16:24.878 align:start position:0%
in the 21st century what's the value
 
05:16:28.070 --> 05:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
of notarization in the first place
 
05:16:30.390 --> 05:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh in the olden days
 
05:16:32.948 --> 05:16:32.958 align:start position:0%
somebody came in and you knew who the
 
05:16:35.430 --> 05:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
person was and you could say yeah that
 
05:16:37.350 --> 05:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
was john smith who came in and signed
 
05:16:39.430 --> 05:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
that document and i can testify to that
 
05:16:39.440 --> 05:16:40.470 align:start position:0%
that document and i can testify to that
later

05:16:40.470 --> 05:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
later
 
05:16:42.868 --> 05:16:42.878 align:start position:0%
um we're moving more and more remote
 
05:16:44.550 --> 05:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
from that concept
 
05:16:46.948 --> 05:16:46.958 align:start position:0%
is there a reason to do notarization
 
05:16:46.958 --> 05:16:48.390 align:start position:0%
is there a reason to do notarization
anymore

05:16:48.390 --> 05:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
05:16:51.190 --> 05:16:51.200 align:start position:0%
i you know that's a great question and i
 
05:16:52.390 --> 05:16:52.400 align:start position:0%
it's a very
 
05:16:55.190 --> 05:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
broad idea and concept that i don't know
 
05:16:58.390 --> 05:16:58.400 align:start position:0%
if i'm prepared to speak to the overall
 
05:17:01.350 --> 05:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
benefits or downsides to notarizations
 
05:17:04.788 --> 05:17:04.798 align:start position:0%
in general um however we felt that you
 
05:17:06.868 --> 05:17:06.878 align:start position:0%
know given many states are moving into a
 
05:17:08.788 --> 05:17:08.798 align:start position:0%
more modern age of moving to a remote
 
05:17:10.550 --> 05:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
notarization we would at least take that
 
05:17:13.430 --> 05:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
step first
 
05:17:16.230 --> 05:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:17.510 --> 05:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:17:17.520 --> 05:17:18.390 align:start position:0%
thank you
and

05:17:18.390 --> 05:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:17:23.590 --> 05:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
other questions for mr prasal yes
 
05:17:26.868 --> 05:17:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:26.878 --> 05:17:28.628 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:17:28.628 --> 05:17:28.638 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:17:30.948 --> 05:17:30.958 align:start position:0%
representative representative macbeth
 
05:17:34.390 --> 05:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
i i would comment to and to um
 
05:17:37.110 --> 05:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
i think that um there are a lot more
 
05:17:39.510 --> 05:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
reasons um that we would be
 
05:17:39.520 --> 05:17:40.470 align:start position:0%
reasons um that we would be
uh

05:17:40.470 --> 05:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:17:42.470 --> 05:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
not just notarizing but a testing to
 
05:17:44.788 --> 05:17:44.798 align:start position:0%
someone's it's not just identifying a
 
05:17:47.110 --> 05:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
person it's a testing to documents it's
 
05:17:50.470 --> 05:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
attesting to the oath of someone the you
 
05:17:53.590 --> 05:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
know so there are broad reasons for
 
05:17:56.788 --> 05:17:56.798 align:start position:0%
um notorious acts and i think that this
 
05:17:58.868 --> 05:17:58.878 align:start position:0%
bill covers a lot more than just
 
05:18:02.150 --> 05:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
identifying yeah it's tom smith so um i
 
05:18:03.910 --> 05:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate the proponents of the bill
 
05:18:06.070 --> 05:18:06.080 align:start position:0%

representatives um silver's question
 
05:19:02.080 --> 05:19:03.030 align:start position:0%
representatives um silver's question
first

05:19:03.030 --> 05:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
first
 
05:19:05.350 --> 05:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
yes the new hampshire draft legislation
 
05:19:07.190 --> 05:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
that the stakeholders have put forward
 
05:19:08.470 --> 05:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
which um
 
05:19:10.628 --> 05:19:10.638 align:start position:0%
mr prasad has discussed
 
05:19:12.708 --> 05:19:12.718 align:start position:0%
does account for the notion of someone
 
05:19:14.948 --> 05:19:14.958 align:start position:0%
who lives out of state or is out of
 
05:19:16.310 --> 05:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
country so
 
05:19:18.230 --> 05:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh individuals who are living in other
 
05:19:20.070 --> 05:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
parts of the world even you know
 
05:19:21.590 --> 05:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
depending on the law of that
 
05:19:23.350 --> 05:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction so yes
 
05:19:24.948 --> 05:19:24.958 align:start position:0%
even though you're
 
05:19:26.550 --> 05:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
saved from florida
 
05:19:30.070 --> 05:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
um we can we could use that law to work
 
05:19:32.390 --> 05:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
with you remotely in that respect
 
05:19:33.670 --> 05:19:33.680 align:start position:0%
and to
 
05:19:36.150 --> 05:19:36.160 align:start position:0%

question um i concur
 
05:19:41.110 --> 05:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
with represent representative mcphee in
 
05:19:43.110 --> 05:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
that there is um
 
05:19:45.030 --> 05:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
a very broad
 
05:19:47.110 --> 05:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh role of the note of the notary
 
05:19:49.030 --> 05:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
they're both gonna confirm the person's
 
05:19:49.040 --> 05:19:50.150 align:start position:0%
they're both gonna confirm the person's
identity

05:19:50.150 --> 05:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
identity
 
05:19:52.070 --> 05:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
they have an important role in assessing
 
05:19:54.708 --> 05:19:54.718 align:start position:0%
capacity to undertake the
 
05:19:56.948 --> 05:19:56.958 align:start position:0%
outcome that they are taking
 
05:19:58.310 --> 05:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
they have
 
05:20:02.070 --> 05:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
a broad and responsibility to certify
 
05:20:05.190 --> 05:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
that the signers acknowledgement
 
05:20:08.948 --> 05:20:08.958 align:start position:0%
is given freely and voluntarily
 
05:20:11.910 --> 05:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
um and and then alternatively
 
05:20:14.070 --> 05:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
um as you can probably tell i'm from the
 
05:20:16.150 --> 05:20:16.160 align:start position:0%
title's insurance industry and the
 
05:20:19.830 --> 05:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
material act underlies really the
 
05:20:19.840 --> 05:20:21.030 align:start position:0%
material act underlies really the
um

05:20:21.030 --> 05:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:21.040 --> 05:20:24.230 align:start position:0%

05:20:24.230 --> 05:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:26.948 --> 05:20:26.958 align:start position:0%
the um our land records you know of the
 
05:20:29.190 --> 05:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
the uh ability for our land records to
 
05:20:30.708 --> 05:20:30.718 align:start position:0%
stand as they are
 
05:20:30.718 --> 05:20:31.990 align:start position:0%
stand as they are
trusted

05:20:31.990 --> 05:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
trusted
 
05:20:35.830 --> 05:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
and um to not be overturned
 
05:20:37.750 --> 05:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
the proposed legislation has a lot of
 
05:20:39.670 --> 05:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
protections in it
 
05:20:47.990 --> 05:20:48.000 align:start position:0%

good afternoon mr chairman and members
 
05:57:10.868 --> 05:57:10.878 align:start position:0%
of the committee i'm john lewicki i
 
05:57:13.670 --> 05:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
represent hillsborough district 26.
 
05:57:14.868 --> 05:57:14.878 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to
 
05:57:18.230 --> 05:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:19.830 --> 05:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
over the past hundred or so years there
 
05:57:21.430 --> 05:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
has been a revolution in the state and
 
05:57:23.190 --> 05:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
federation it hasn't been the sort of
 
05:57:24.948 --> 05:57:24.958 align:start position:0%
revolution that involves pitchforks and
 
05:57:26.708 --> 05:57:26.718 align:start position:0%
guns it's more like a revolution of
 
05:57:28.788 --> 05:57:28.798 align:start position:0%
boiled frogs
 
05:57:30.708 --> 05:57:30.718 align:start position:0%
when our constitutions were enacted in
 
05:57:34.070 --> 05:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
1784 and 1789 we changed the world by
 
05:57:35.670 --> 05:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
creating constitutional republics
 
05:57:38.230 --> 05:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
responsible to the people of the states
 
05:57:40.070 --> 05:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
however we kept one relic of the british
 
05:57:41.990 --> 05:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
government the legal system
 
05:57:43.750 --> 05:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
since at the time it was perceived to be
 
05:57:45.110 --> 05:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
fair and honest there seemed to be
 
05:57:47.190 --> 05:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
little reason to change
 
05:57:49.030 --> 05:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
the fatal flaw in our constitution is
 
05:57:50.868 --> 05:57:50.878 align:start position:0%
that we allowed the courts to overturn
 
05:57:52.708 --> 05:57:52.718 align:start position:0%
constitution and statute by setting
 
05:57:52.718 --> 05:57:53.910 align:start position:0%
constitution and statute by setting
precedence

05:57:53.910 --> 05:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
precedence
 
05:57:55.990 --> 05:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
as a result our constitution is now
 
05:57:57.510 --> 05:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
littered with amendments overturning
 
05:57:59.030 --> 05:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
wrong precedents
 
05:58:00.788 --> 05:58:00.798 align:start position:0%
here in the legislature we frequently
 
05:58:02.948 --> 05:58:02.958 align:start position:0%
see bills the only purpose of which is
 
05:58:05.270 --> 05:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
to restore a previous plainly written
 
05:58:05.280 --> 05:58:06.788 align:start position:0%
to restore a previous plainly written
statute

05:58:06.788 --> 05:58:06.798 align:start position:0%
statute
 
05:58:07.990 --> 05:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
when the courts found that they could
 
05:58:09.510 --> 05:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
make law by setting precedence we
 
05:58:11.350 --> 05:58:11.360 align:start position:0%
started down a slippery slope
 
05:58:12.948 --> 05:58:12.958 align:start position:0%
in many cases the courts were encouraged
 
05:58:14.310 --> 05:58:14.320 align:start position:0%
by parties who were unable to get what
 
05:58:16.470 --> 05:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
they wanted from elected government
 
05:58:18.070 --> 05:58:18.080 align:start position:0%
presently it has become common for
 
05:58:19.670 --> 05:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
people to make end runs around elected
 
05:58:21.270 --> 05:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
government by persuading the courts to
 
05:58:24.070 --> 05:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
become activists for them
 
05:58:26.070 --> 05:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
it is appropriate in case like this to
 
05:58:27.430 --> 05:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
return to the philosophers who
 
05:58:28.788 --> 05:58:28.798 align:start position:0%
established our constitutional
 
05:58:28.798 --> 05:58:29.750 align:start position:0%
established our constitutional
government

05:58:29.750 --> 05:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
government
 
05:58:31.270 --> 05:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
thomas paine and the rights of man
 
05:58:32.948 --> 05:58:32.958 align:start position:0%
foresaw that a government by president
 
05:58:34.948 --> 05:58:34.958 align:start position:0%
would devolve to what we have today
 
05:58:36.948 --> 05:58:36.958 align:start position:0%
the complete quotations and testimony i
 
05:58:38.948 --> 05:58:38.958 align:start position:0%
emailed to the committee
 
05:58:40.470 --> 05:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
there is a natural tendency for
 
05:58:42.150 --> 05:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
institutions and the people in them to
 
05:58:43.830 --> 05:58:43.840 align:start position:0%
take on power beyond those granted to
 
05:58:45.190 --> 05:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
them by the people
 
05:58:47.030 --> 05:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
when that occurs it's always at the
 
05:58:49.510 --> 05:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
expense of the people's freedom
 
05:58:50.788 --> 05:58:50.798 align:start position:0%
we're here today to talk about a
 
05:58:52.470 --> 05:58:52.480 align:start position:0%
provision that addresses the
 
05:58:54.548 --> 05:58:54.558 align:start position:0%
relationship between statutory law and
 
05:58:56.948 --> 05:58:56.958 align:start position:0%
precedence established by courts
 
05:58:58.708 --> 05:58:58.718 align:start position:0%
a for instance may be better than
 
05:59:01.030 --> 05:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
another form of explanation a few years
 
05:59:03.110 --> 05:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
ago we passed a statute to make alimony
 
05:59:04.948 --> 05:59:04.958 align:start position:0%
uniform throughout the state
 
05:59:06.548 --> 05:59:06.558 align:start position:0%
previously independent of the discretion
 
05:59:09.110 --> 05:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
of the courts presently a lower court
 
05:59:11.030 --> 05:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
might diverge from the statute
 
05:59:12.948 --> 05:59:12.958 align:start position:0%
one of the involved parties might then
 
05:59:15.030 --> 05:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
appeal to the state supreme court
 
05:59:16.788 --> 05:59:16.798 align:start position:0%
if the supreme court fails to act the
 
05:59:18.470 --> 05:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
lower court has then set a precedent
 
05:59:21.350 --> 05:59:21.360 align:start position:0%
which effectively replaces the statute
 
05:59:23.350 --> 05:59:23.360 align:start position:0%
a party affected by the president has no
 
05:59:25.430 --> 05:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
further ability to appeal
 
05:59:27.990 --> 05:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
this cacr if approved by the people
 
05:59:29.830 --> 05:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
would allow appeal of a precedent
 
05:59:31.670 --> 05:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
concerning a statute to be appealed to
 
05:59:33.030 --> 05:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
the general court
 
05:59:34.948 --> 05:59:34.958 align:start position:0%
the general court by simple majority of
 
05:59:36.868 --> 05:59:36.878 align:start position:0%
both houses could effectively remain the
 
05:59:38.390 --> 05:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
decision back to the courts in effect
 
05:59:40.390 --> 05:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
saying you got it wrong the statute
 
05:59:41.750 --> 05:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
means what it says
 
05:59:43.190 --> 05:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
this would be a much better solution
 
05:59:45.270 --> 05:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
than to essentially reiterate the law in
 
05:59:47.190 --> 05:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
a new statute which would then have to
 
05:59:48.788 --> 05:59:48.798 align:start position:0%
be signed by the governor
 
05:59:50.390 --> 05:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
so this since this would only be a
 
05:59:52.310 --> 05:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
reaffirmation of an existing statute
 
05:59:53.670 --> 05:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
there's no reason for the government to
 
05:59:55.270 --> 05:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
be involved
 
05:59:57.190 --> 05:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
the basic principle behind this is the
 
05:59:58.788 --> 05:59:58.798 align:start position:0%
laws belong to the legislature they
 
06:00:00.470 --> 06:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
don't belong to the courts
 
06:00:02.948 --> 06:00:02.958 align:start position:0%
this cacr would restore out to our state
 
06:00:04.310 --> 06:00:04.320 align:start position:0%
the concept that the people should
 
06:00:05.590 --> 06:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
govern themselves through their
 
06:00:07.750 --> 06:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional elected government it
 
06:00:09.510 --> 06:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
would end government by appointed courts
 
06:00:11.990 --> 06:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
and statutory matters
 
06:00:13.670 --> 06:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
there's an inherent conflict between
 
06:00:15.830 --> 06:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
self-government and law by precedent
 
06:00:17.270 --> 06:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
that the fatal flaw which needs to be
 
06:00:19.030 --> 06:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
addressed in the people's constitution
 
06:00:20.708 --> 06:00:20.718 align:start position:0%
ruled by precedent means the dead may
 
06:00:22.390 --> 06:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
ruin the living
 
06:00:23.990 --> 06:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
all of us here whether we call ourselves
 
06:00:26.070 --> 06:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
a republic or a democracy and regardless
 
06:00:27.830 --> 06:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
of what party labor we wear believe in
 
06:00:29.430 --> 06:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
government of the people by the people's
 
06:00:31.990 --> 06:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
represented elected representatives
 
06:00:33.910 --> 06:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
i encourage you to send the cacr to the
 
06:00:36.390 --> 06:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
full legislature with a recommendation
 
06:00:37.830 --> 06:00:37.840 align:start position:0%
of ought to pass
 
06:00:40.390 --> 06:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
that's all i have thank you
 
06:00:42.470 --> 06:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and are
 
06:00:44.628 --> 06:00:44.638 align:start position:0%
there questions for
 
06:00:51.030 --> 06:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:53.350 --> 06:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
i don't see any questions
 
06:00:55.670 --> 06:00:55.680 align:start position:0%

i don't have anyone else who signed up

testimony um by email
um

06:01:39.670 --> 06:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:01:41.110 --> 06:01:41.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
06:01:43.590 --> 06:01:43.600 align:start position:0%
about this thank you for your service to
 
06:01:45.430 --> 06:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
our state in the middle of a pandemic
 
06:01:48.470 --> 06:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
and today in the middle of a snowstorm
 
06:01:51.190 --> 06:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
i'm a retired lawyer and i'm a retired
 
06:01:51.200 --> 06:01:51.990 align:start position:0%
i'm a retired lawyer and i'm a retired
court

06:01:51.990 --> 06:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
court
 
06:01:54.868 --> 06:01:54.878 align:start position:0%
volunteer mediator and i'm
 
06:01:57.030 --> 06:01:57.040 align:start position:0%
speaking in opposition to
 
06:01:59.190 --> 06:01:59.200 align:start position:0%
um this proposed amendment to the
 
06:02:02.230 --> 06:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
constitution today um and
 
06:02:06.150 --> 06:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh i will try to be as brief as i can um
 
06:02:07.830 --> 06:02:07.840 align:start position:0%
you have had a long day and i realize
 
06:02:11.270 --> 06:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
that um our this constitutional movement
 
06:02:12.868 --> 06:02:12.878 align:start position:0%
would disrupt
 
06:02:16.070 --> 06:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
um and damage the the system of checks
 
06:02:18.628 --> 06:02:18.638 align:start position:0%
and balances and separation of powers
 
06:02:18.638 --> 06:02:19.590 align:start position:0%
and balances and separation of powers
that

06:02:19.590 --> 06:02:19.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:02:21.830 --> 06:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
is the core framework of both our state
 
06:02:24.310 --> 06:02:24.320 align:start position:0%
and our federal constitutions
 
06:02:26.230 --> 06:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
and the other thing it would do
 
06:02:27.830 --> 06:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
is that it would turn you all the
 
06:02:31.350 --> 06:02:31.360 align:start position:0%
legislature into an appeals court um
 
06:02:34.628 --> 06:02:34.638 align:start position:0%
anyone who was unhappy with a decision
 
06:02:36.150 --> 06:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
in their divorce case their business
 
06:02:38.390 --> 06:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
dispute their boundary dispute could
 
06:02:39.750 --> 06:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
hire a lobbyist and come to the
 
06:02:42.070 --> 06:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
legislature and say i want to i want to
 
06:02:44.390 --> 06:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
get the legislature to overturn this
 
06:02:46.628 --> 06:02:46.638 align:start position:0%
court decision i don't like um
 
06:02:46.638 --> 06:02:47.590 align:start position:0%
court decision i don't like um
there's

06:02:47.590 --> 06:02:47.600 align:start position:0%
there's
 
06:02:49.510 --> 06:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
in this amendment as it's proposed
 
06:02:51.750 --> 06:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
there's no limit on that so essentially
 
06:02:54.708 --> 06:02:54.718 align:start position:0%
this amendment would turn you all into
 
06:02:57.750 --> 06:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
the ultra appeals court um
 
06:02:59.670 --> 06:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
and that would mean
 
06:03:02.948 --> 06:03:02.958 align:start position:0%
in in practicality that people who
 
06:03:05.590 --> 06:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
had enough money to hire a lobbyist and
 
06:03:08.628 --> 06:03:08.638 align:start position:0%
pursue their case in the legislature
 
06:03:10.070 --> 06:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
after they've lost it in the court
 
06:03:10.080 --> 06:03:11.270 align:start position:0%
after they've lost it in the court
system

06:03:11.270 --> 06:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
system
 
06:03:13.270 --> 06:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
might be able to do that it would be one
 
06:03:16.868 --> 06:03:16.878 align:start position:0%
more barrier for ordinary people
 
06:03:16.878 --> 06:03:17.910 align:start position:0%
more barrier for ordinary people
who

06:03:17.910 --> 06:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
who
 
06:03:20.390 --> 06:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
have participated in an individual case
 
06:03:21.990 --> 06:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
in the court system
 
06:03:25.350 --> 06:03:25.360 align:start position:0%
um and then there's been a decision that
 
06:03:29.110 --> 06:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
both parties have to live with um in our
 
06:03:30.628 --> 06:03:30.638 align:start position:0%
in our system
 
06:03:33.670 --> 06:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
you the legislature create policy you
 
06:03:36.868 --> 06:03:36.878 align:start position:0%
set the rules for daily life in our
 
06:03:39.750 --> 06:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
in our state you also have complex
 
06:03:42.628 --> 06:03:42.638 align:start position:0%
decisions to make about budgets
 
06:03:44.948 --> 06:03:44.958 align:start position:0%
you are not set up to
 
06:03:48.150 --> 06:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
adjudicate individual disputes between
 
06:03:50.310 --> 06:03:50.320 align:start position:0%
individuals and corporations and state
 
06:03:53.990 --> 06:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
agencies that's what the judiciary does
 
06:03:56.470 --> 06:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
and it's inevitable that the three
 
06:03:58.390 --> 06:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
branches of government have tension from
 
06:04:00.390 --> 06:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
time to time you are separate you are
 
06:04:03.590 --> 06:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
independent but your roles overlap and
 
06:04:06.150 --> 06:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
part of the beauty of our system is that
 
06:04:08.070 --> 06:04:08.080 align:start position:0%
creative tension
 
06:04:09.510 --> 06:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
but this
 
06:04:11.670 --> 06:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
this proposal would obliterate
 
06:04:13.030 --> 06:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
that creative tension it would
 
06:04:15.910 --> 06:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
essentially usurp the role of the courts
 
06:04:18.230 --> 06:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
and put you in the legislature in the
 
06:04:21.430 --> 06:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
role of a super appeals court it doesn't
 
06:04:23.110 --> 06:04:23.120 align:start position:0%
make sense from a legislative point of
 
06:04:25.590 --> 06:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
view doesn't make sense in terms of
 
06:04:27.350 --> 06:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
fairness and finality in the legal
 
06:04:27.360 --> 06:04:29.030 align:start position:0%
fairness and finality in the legal
system

06:04:29.030 --> 06:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
system
 
06:04:30.708 --> 06:04:30.718 align:start position:0%
and you have plenty of other things to
 
06:04:34.150 --> 06:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
do and you also have remedies if you're
 
06:04:37.030 --> 06:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
unhappy with it with how a statute has
 
06:04:38.788 --> 06:04:38.798 align:start position:0%
been interpreted you can amend the
 
06:04:41.350 --> 06:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
statute you can repeal the statute
 
06:04:43.110 --> 06:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
um so
 
06:04:45.590 --> 06:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
you you can do what you need to do in
 
06:04:47.590 --> 06:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
your policy-making way
 
06:04:49.350 --> 06:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
to deal with statutes that you don't
 
06:04:51.110 --> 06:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
think are
 
06:04:53.350 --> 06:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
interpreted correctly
 
06:04:55.110 --> 06:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
but you certainly don't want to turn
 
06:04:57.750 --> 06:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
yourself into an appeals court
 
06:05:02.868 --> 06:05:02.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:04.310 --> 06:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
representative rice did you have a
 
06:05:04.320 --> 06:05:06.070 align:start position:0%
representative rice did you have a
question

06:05:06.070 --> 06:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:05:07.510 --> 06:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
06:05:09.190 --> 06:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony and thanks
 
06:05:11.110 --> 06:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
06:05:14.390 --> 06:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
so um i guess my question is because i
 
06:05:16.548 --> 06:05:16.558 align:start position:0%
um sit on children and family law also
 
06:05:18.310 --> 06:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
and i hear a lot
 
06:05:20.548 --> 06:05:20.558 align:start position:0%
about judicial discretion and how
 
06:05:23.430 --> 06:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
they're not following policy
 
06:05:25.190 --> 06:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
but they're using their judicial
 
06:05:29.030 --> 06:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
discretion and i i almost feel like um
 
06:05:31.910 --> 06:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
this cacr is in an attempt to
 
06:05:34.070 --> 06:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
sway that from happening
 
06:05:36.868 --> 06:05:36.878 align:start position:0%
um what is your take on judicial
 
06:05:36.878 --> 06:05:38.628 align:start position:0%
um what is your take on judicial
discretion

06:05:38.628 --> 06:05:38.638 align:start position:0%
discretion
 
06:05:41.990 --> 06:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
well one of the things about that is
 
06:05:45.270 --> 06:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
is a limitation of what you can do um is
 
06:05:45.280 --> 06:05:46.230 align:start position:0%
is a limitation of what you can do um is
that

06:05:46.230 --> 06:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:05:49.030 --> 06:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
you can't possibly and anticipate when
 
06:05:51.590 --> 06:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
you're writing laws every particular
 
06:05:53.350 --> 06:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
fact situation
 
06:05:55.830 --> 06:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
that may arose in a dispute between two
 
06:05:58.628 --> 06:05:58.638 align:start position:0%
parties you can create a for instance a
 
06:06:00.788 --> 06:06:00.798 align:start position:0%
very lengthy law on alimony and child
 
06:06:03.750 --> 06:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
support but you can't necessarily
 
06:06:03.760 --> 06:06:05.110 align:start position:0%
support but you can't necessarily
anticipate

06:06:05.110 --> 06:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
anticipate
 
06:06:07.430 --> 06:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
every single potential way that those
 
06:06:09.430 --> 06:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
issues are going to arise
 
06:06:11.990 --> 06:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
so you set out the rules and then
 
06:06:14.390 --> 06:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
somebody has to interpret those rules as
 
06:06:15.670 --> 06:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
best they can
 
06:06:18.230 --> 06:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
based on the facts in front of them and
 
06:06:18.240 --> 06:06:19.750 align:start position:0%
based on the facts in front of them and
so

06:06:19.750 --> 06:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:06:22.390 --> 06:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
judges do not have discretion to ignore
 
06:06:24.948 --> 06:06:24.958 align:start position:0%
the law what they have is the ability to
 
06:06:26.708 --> 06:06:26.718 align:start position:0%
fill in the gaps
 
06:06:26.718 --> 06:06:27.670 align:start position:0%
fill in the gaps
when

06:06:27.670 --> 06:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
when
 
06:06:29.830 --> 06:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
something isn't crystal clear from the
 
06:06:31.430 --> 06:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
law um
 
06:06:31.440 --> 06:06:32.548 align:start position:0%
law um
and

06:06:32.548 --> 06:06:32.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:06:34.868 --> 06:06:34.878 align:start position:0%
that doesn't happen all that often the
 
06:06:38.230 --> 06:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
you know in most areas what the statute
 
06:06:40.470 --> 06:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
says is pretty clear and people
 
06:06:41.750 --> 06:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
06:06:44.150 --> 06:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
it's only in the unusual circumstances
 
06:06:47.190 --> 06:06:47.200 align:start position:0%
where there's some ambiguity or doubt
 
06:06:49.430 --> 06:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
and that's a perfect that's another
 
06:06:51.910 --> 06:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
perfect opportunity for you all as
 
06:06:55.190 --> 06:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
policy makers to resolve that issue by
 
06:06:55.200 --> 06:06:56.150 align:start position:0%
policy makers to resolve that issue by
further

06:06:56.150 --> 06:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
further
 
06:06:58.948 --> 06:06:58.958 align:start position:0%
writing the law to remove that ambiguity
 
06:06:58.958 --> 06:06:59.750 align:start position:0%
writing the law to remove that ambiguity
um

06:06:59.750 --> 06:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:07:02.230 --> 06:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
so some discretion and ambiguity is
 
06:07:05.190 --> 06:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
inevitable when
 
06:07:06.948 --> 06:07:06.958 align:start position:0%
judges are hearing
 
06:07:08.948 --> 06:07:08.958 align:start position:0%
cases about individual facts and
 
06:07:12.150 --> 06:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
individual stories and circumstances
 
06:07:14.708 --> 06:07:14.718 align:start position:0%
but you always have the ability to
 
06:07:17.430 --> 06:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
change the law as these things arise to
 
06:07:20.230 --> 06:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
fix it and to make it closer to
 
06:07:22.150 --> 06:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
what you all think the best policy
 
06:07:28.788 --> 06:07:28.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:29.990 --> 06:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
you all said
 
06:07:32.548 --> 06:07:32.558 align:start position:0%
right yes thank you representative
 
06:07:32.558 --> 06:07:40.230 align:start position:0%
right yes thank you representative
oregon

06:07:40.230 --> 06:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:43.110 --> 06:07:43.120 align:start position:0%
you're muted representative oregon
 
06:07:44.470 --> 06:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
oh you're not missing much but thank you
 
06:07:45.910 --> 06:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
very much mr chair thank you very much
 
06:07:48.310 --> 06:07:48.320 align:start position:0%
mr tobin um
 
06:07:50.230 --> 06:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
06:07:52.070 --> 06:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
the thing with this bill is as i read it
 
06:07:54.948 --> 06:07:54.958 align:start position:0%
says any decision of a state court so we
 
06:07:57.670 --> 06:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't if this cacr be being part of
 
06:07:58.948 --> 06:07:58.958 align:start position:0%
the constitution it sounds like we
 
06:08:00.628 --> 06:08:00.638 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even have to wait for the
 
06:08:02.948 --> 06:08:02.958 align:start position:0%
supreme court to weigh in we could
 
06:08:04.948 --> 06:08:04.958 align:start position:0%
um we could jump in even before the
 
06:08:06.470 --> 06:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
supreme court
 
06:08:08.230 --> 06:08:08.240 align:start position:0%
yes that's what it usually does which is
 
06:08:10.150 --> 06:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
pretty much the same thing given to the
 
06:08:10.160 --> 06:08:11.990 align:start position:0%
pretty much the same thing given to the
legislature

06:08:11.990 --> 06:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
06:08:13.510 --> 06:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
yes that's another way that this would
 
06:08:15.990 --> 06:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
disrupt the legal system um
 
06:08:17.430 --> 06:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
it would really be
 
06:08:17.440 --> 06:08:18.310 align:start position:0%
it would really be
uh

06:08:18.310 --> 06:08:18.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:08:21.350 --> 06:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
an end run around the legal system um
 
06:08:22.948 --> 06:08:22.958 align:start position:0%
and it could happen at any time and
 
06:08:24.230 --> 06:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
06:08:25.830 --> 06:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
there's no um
 
06:08:28.708 --> 06:08:28.718 align:start position:0%
filter either there's nothing to say
 
06:08:31.190 --> 06:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
there's nothing to help you
 
06:08:34.470 --> 06:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
screen cases that are without merit or
 
06:08:37.110 --> 06:08:37.120 align:start position:0%
screen cases that really involve
 
06:08:39.350 --> 06:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
fact disputes that
 
06:08:41.510 --> 06:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
that you don't have the ability to rule
 
06:08:41.520 --> 06:08:43.270 align:start position:0%
that you don't have the ability to rule
on

06:08:43.270 --> 06:08:43.280 align:start position:0%
on
 
06:08:45.510 --> 06:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
what you are there for is to talk about
 
06:08:48.948 --> 06:08:48.958 align:start position:0%
policy but not to be fact-finders and
 
06:08:51.270 --> 06:08:51.280 align:start position:0%
hear testimony and decide who's telling
 
06:08:54.150 --> 06:08:54.160 align:start position:0%
the truth you all are policy makers
 
06:08:57.110 --> 06:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
and this this amendment would put you
 
06:09:00.628 --> 06:09:00.638 align:start position:0%
uh it smack into the business of
 
06:09:02.548 --> 06:09:02.558 align:start position:0%
adjudicating facts and deciding who's
 
06:09:04.548 --> 06:09:04.558 align:start position:0%
telling the truth um
 
06:09:06.470 --> 06:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
it would really you become
 
06:09:08.948 --> 06:09:08.958 align:start position:0%
very much full-time judges and again
 
06:09:10.390 --> 06:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
without any structure
 
06:09:12.868 --> 06:09:12.878 align:start position:0%
without any of any process of how you
 
06:09:14.788 --> 06:09:14.798 align:start position:0%
fit into the legal system
 
06:09:18.070 --> 06:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:22.070 --> 06:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:25.590 --> 06:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
any other questions for mr tobin
 
06:09:25.600 --> 06:09:26.788 align:start position:0%
any other questions for mr tobin
yes

06:09:26.788 --> 06:09:26.798 align:start position:0%
yes
 
06:09:28.548 --> 06:09:28.558 align:start position:0%
representative silber
 
06:09:30.548 --> 06:09:30.558 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair thank you mr tobin
 
06:09:33.190 --> 06:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
for taking my question sure
 
06:09:35.910 --> 06:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
am i correct in that there are two types
 
06:09:38.390 --> 06:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
of decisions that this seems to address
 
06:09:40.470 --> 06:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
in just that one sentence their
 
06:09:42.628 --> 06:09:42.638 align:start position:0%
decisions of a court interpreting
 
06:09:42.638 --> 06:09:43.830 align:start position:0%
decisions of a court interpreting
statutes

06:09:43.830 --> 06:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
06:09:45.510 --> 06:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
and their decisions of the core of a
 
06:09:46.868 --> 06:09:46.878 align:start position:0%
court interpreting the state
 
06:09:46.878 --> 06:09:49.270 align:start position:0%
court interpreting the state
constitution

06:09:49.270 --> 06:09:49.280 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
06:09:51.110 --> 06:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
those there are some
 
06:09:53.750 --> 06:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
court cases that interpret both but by
 
06:09:55.350 --> 06:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
far by far
 
06:09:57.830 --> 06:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
the much more frequent one is is courts
 
06:10:00.470 --> 06:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
interpreting a statute okay follow-up
 
06:10:03.270 --> 06:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
may i follow up sure the follow-up is
 
06:10:05.350 --> 06:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
then don't we already in the general
 
06:10:07.430 --> 06:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
court if we're not happy with an
 
06:10:10.788 --> 06:10:10.798 align:start position:0%
interpretation by a of a statute by the
 
06:10:10.798 --> 06:10:11.990 align:start position:0%
interpretation by a of a statute by the
court

06:10:11.990 --> 06:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
court
 
06:10:14.708 --> 06:10:14.718 align:start position:0%
don't we already have the the power in
 
06:10:17.590 --> 06:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
the general court to adopt a new statute
 
06:10:21.350 --> 06:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
that overturns that decision absolutely
 
06:10:23.270 --> 06:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
you can rewrite the statute and it
 
06:10:24.788 --> 06:10:24.798 align:start position:0%
happens all the time
 
06:10:27.350 --> 06:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
final question final follow-up
 
06:10:27.360 --> 06:10:28.070 align:start position:0%
final question final follow-up
if

06:10:28.070 --> 06:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
if
 
06:10:30.708 --> 06:10:30.718 align:start position:0%
if we're if we're not happy with an
 
06:10:34.070 --> 06:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the state constitution
 
06:10:36.548 --> 06:10:36.558 align:start position:0%
by the supreme court
 
06:10:36.558 --> 06:10:37.430 align:start position:0%
by the supreme court
who

06:10:37.430 --> 06:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
who
 
06:10:40.310 --> 06:10:40.320 align:start position:0%
in our system is supposed to say what
 
06:10:42.548 --> 06:10:42.558 align:start position:0%
the constitution means if not the state
 
06:10:45.110 --> 06:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
supreme court
 
06:10:46.628 --> 06:10:46.638 align:start position:0%
under our system
 
06:10:48.470 --> 06:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
the supreme court is the final
 
06:10:50.788 --> 06:10:50.798 align:start position:0%
interpreter of the constitution and
 
06:10:53.270 --> 06:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
that's new hampshire's system and in the
 
06:10:56.230 --> 06:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
federal system but you all have the
 
06:10:58.310 --> 06:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
ability to initiate an amendment to a
 
06:11:00.948 --> 06:11:00.958 align:start position:0%
constitution if you don't like a ruling
 
06:11:04.628 --> 06:11:04.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:07.190 --> 06:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
06:11:07.200 --> 06:11:09.750 align:start position:0%
any other questions
comments

06:11:09.750 --> 06:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:10.868 --> 06:11:10.878 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
06:11:15.510 --> 06:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:18.150 --> 06:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
and i don't see anyone else with their
 
06:11:20.948 --> 06:11:20.958 align:start position:0%

seeing none uh i would note that on the
 
06:11:32.948 --> 06:11:32.958 align:start position:0%
list of people who
 
06:11:35.830 --> 06:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
expressed an opinion there were
 
06:11:39.270 --> 06:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
27 people who expressed an opinion in
 
06:11:39.280 --> 06:11:40.708 align:start position:0%
27 people who expressed an opinion in
opposition

06:11:40.708 --> 06:11:40.718 align:start position:0%
opposition
 
06:11:40.718 --> 06:11:41.590 align:start position:0%
opposition
and

06:11:41.590 --> 06:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:11:42.708 --> 06:11:42.718 align:start position:0%
one who
 
06:11:45.990 --> 06:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
submitted an opinion and support
 
06:11:48.548 --> 06:11:48.558 align:start position:0%
and with that i'll close the hearing on
 
06:11:48.558 --> 06:11:52.548 align:start position:0%
and with that i'll close the hearing on
cacr10

06:11:52.548 --> 06:11:52.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:54.548 --> 06:11:54.558 align:start position:0%
and is there any other business before
 
06:11:58.708 --> 06:11:58.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:59.910 --> 06:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
if not
 
06:12:01.670 --> 06:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
then we will
 
06:12:07.030 --> 06:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:08.868 --> 06:12:08.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr share would it be
 
06:12:13.270 --> 06:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate to accept this bill today
 
06:12:13.280 --> 06:12:14.548 align:start position:0%
appropriate to accept this bill today
um

06:12:14.548 --> 06:12:14.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:12:15.670 --> 06:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
if there's
 
06:12:17.670 --> 06:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
if no one objects to that we would go
 
06:12:19.590 --> 06:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
into executive session
 
06:12:19.600 --> 06:12:20.548 align:start position:0%
into executive session
okay

06:12:20.548 --> 06:12:20.558 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:12:22.310 --> 06:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:12:24.230 --> 06:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
would you like to would you like to do
 
06:12:24.240 --> 06:12:25.110 align:start position:0%
would you like to would you like to do
that

06:12:25.110 --> 06:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:12:26.868 --> 06:12:26.878 align:start position:0%
yes i would
 
06:12:28.868 --> 06:12:28.878 align:start position:0%
does anybody have an objection to go
 
06:12:30.788 --> 06:12:30.798 align:start position:0%
into executive session to address this
 
06:12:30.798 --> 06:12:33.110 align:start position:0%
into executive session to address this
bill

06:12:33.110 --> 06:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:35.990 --> 06:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
i see no objection so i will indicate
 
06:12:37.990 --> 06:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
that the committee is now
 
06:12:40.788 --> 06:12:40.798 align:start position:0%
in executive session
 
06:12:43.350 --> 06:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
and representative lorenzo
 
06:12:44.948 --> 06:12:44.958 align:start position:0%
as a follow-up to that do you want to
 
06:12:46.548 --> 06:12:46.558 align:start position:0%
make a motion
 
06:12:48.788 --> 06:12:48.798 align:start position:0%
yes i'd like to make a motion of
 
06:12:52.150 --> 06:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
an expedient to legislate
 
06:12:54.868 --> 06:12:54.878 align:start position:0%
is there a second to that second second
 
06:12:59.350 --> 06:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:05.270 --> 06:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:07.190 --> 06:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh representative horgan i see your is
 
06:13:09.190 --> 06:13:09.200 align:start position:0%
that your hand up did you want to speak
 
06:13:12.788 --> 06:13:12.798 align:start position:0%
oh sure yes well my first point is um
 
06:13:14.470 --> 06:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
any cacr
 
06:13:15.990 --> 06:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
even though i actually have my name and
 
06:13:18.390 --> 06:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
a co-sponsor of one which is not in your
 
06:13:19.830 --> 06:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
art committee but
 
06:13:22.948 --> 06:13:22.958 align:start position:0%
doing naca cr right now is
 
06:13:22.958 --> 06:13:24.070 align:start position:0%
doing naca cr right now is
extremely

06:13:24.070 --> 06:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
extremely
 
06:13:26.470 --> 06:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
premature partially uh partially
 
06:13:29.190 --> 06:13:29.200 align:start position:0%
factored like we're not operating 100
 
06:13:31.750 --> 06:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh efficiency because of the pandemic
 
06:13:32.868 --> 06:13:32.878 align:start position:0%
and all the new things we're doing but
 
06:13:34.548 --> 06:13:34.558 align:start position:0%
also like the voters cannot vote on this
 
06:13:37.110 --> 06:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
until november 20
 
06:13:39.830 --> 06:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
2022 so certainly if we wanted to pass
 
06:13:41.910 --> 06:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
this or if we wanted to pass with
 
06:13:44.070 --> 06:13:44.080 align:start position:0%
changes there'd be really no points in
 
06:13:44.080 --> 06:13:45.430 align:start position:0%
changes there'd be really no points in
uh

06:13:45.430 --> 06:13:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:13:47.430 --> 06:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
doing that sending to the floor now we
 
06:13:47.440 --> 06:13:48.868 align:start position:0%
doing that sending to the floor now we
would

06:13:48.868 --> 06:13:48.878 align:start position:0%
would
 
06:13:50.708 --> 06:13:50.718 align:start position:0%
don't lose anything by waiting till next
 
06:13:54.070 --> 06:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
year but this particular one it's a uh
 
06:13:56.390 --> 06:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
it's a uh poorly thought out idea and
 
06:14:00.150 --> 06:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
it's a basically a bad idea i i was uh
 
06:14:01.830 --> 06:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
revenue birch would probably tease me
 
06:14:03.350 --> 06:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
for reading in person but i would
 
06:14:04.788 --> 06:14:04.798 align:start position:0%
remember the petitions and rejects
 
06:14:04.798 --> 06:14:05.830 align:start position:0%
remember the petitions and rejects
committee

06:14:05.830 --> 06:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
committee
 
06:14:09.190 --> 06:14:09.200 align:start position:0%
back in 2011 to 2012 would try to do
 
06:14:10.948 --> 06:14:10.958 align:start position:0%
this and
 
06:14:11.830 --> 06:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
aside from the fact that
 
06:14:13.350 --> 06:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
constitutionally we weren't allowed to
 
06:14:13.360 --> 06:14:14.390 align:start position:0%
constitutionally we weren't allowed to
overturn

06:14:14.390 --> 06:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
overturn
 
06:14:16.548 --> 06:14:16.558 align:start position:0%
state courts um
 
06:14:18.150 --> 06:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
a house committee just really doesn't
 
06:14:20.548 --> 06:14:20.558 align:start position:0%
have the resources that a that a court
 
06:14:22.788 --> 06:14:22.798 align:start position:0%
does you know they like the uh supreme
 
06:14:25.030 --> 06:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
court usually does what they return to
 
06:14:27.190 --> 06:14:27.200 align:start position:0%
the legislature so there's only
 
06:14:29.750 --> 06:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
five justices they've got a whole uh
 
06:14:32.548 --> 06:14:32.558 align:start position:0%
they've got a fairly large staff of
 
06:14:34.390 --> 06:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
professionals who do nothing but uh you
 
06:14:34.400 --> 06:14:35.190 align:start position:0%
professionals who do nothing but uh you
know

06:14:35.190 --> 06:14:35.200 align:start position:0%
know
 
06:14:36.868 --> 06:14:36.878 align:start position:0%
help them research the interpretation of
 
06:14:38.628 --> 06:14:38.638 align:start position:0%
state statutes in the constitution
 
06:14:40.230 --> 06:14:40.240 align:start position:0%
whereas like the
 
06:14:42.070 --> 06:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
committee on fictitious and redress had
 
06:14:42.080 --> 06:14:44.390 align:start position:0%
committee on fictitious and redress had
basically

06:14:44.390 --> 06:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
basically
 
06:14:46.230 --> 06:14:46.240 align:start position:0%
no staff at all so it was kind of
 
06:14:47.990 --> 06:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
haphazard i mean probably if this did
 
06:14:50.310 --> 06:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
pass we would probably put more of a
 
06:14:51.670 --> 06:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
structure in place for dealing with
 
06:14:53.350 --> 06:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
these resolutions when we get them but
 
06:14:56.310 --> 06:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
it was a you know we were
 
06:14:57.350 --> 06:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
might be a little bit better on the
 
06:14:59.030 --> 06:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
senate side where you know they have
 
06:15:00.948 --> 06:15:00.958 align:start position:0%
desks and they have you know
 
06:15:02.868 --> 06:15:02.878 align:start position:0%
staff people assigned to each senator
 
06:15:04.070 --> 06:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
but for us
 
06:15:05.990 --> 06:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
for the 400 of us it would be i think
 
06:15:07.430 --> 06:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
it'd be pretty much
 
06:15:09.670 --> 06:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
possible for us to come to an informed
 
06:15:11.350 --> 06:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
decision on
 
06:15:12.948 --> 06:15:12.958 align:start position:0%
the types of issues that the state
 
06:15:14.390 --> 06:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
supreme court deals with when they're
 
06:15:16.230 --> 06:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
feeling things or that they're better i
 
06:15:17.510 --> 06:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
suppose we could even get some things
 
06:15:18.868 --> 06:15:18.878 align:start position:0%
that would otherwise go to the federal
 
06:15:21.990 --> 06:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
appeals courts i just think uh
 
06:15:23.590 --> 06:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
i just think this is a
 
06:15:25.990 --> 06:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
totally totally impractical like totally
 
06:15:27.910 --> 06:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
impractical idea that is necessary given
 
06:15:28.948 --> 06:15:28.958 align:start position:0%
the way we're
 
06:15:30.788 --> 06:15:30.798 align:start position:0%
this institution the house is structured
 
06:15:32.548 --> 06:15:32.558 align:start position:0%
right now would be really very very
 
06:15:34.628 --> 06:15:34.638 align:start position:0%
difficult for us to reinvent ourselves
 
06:15:35.830 --> 06:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
in a way
 
06:15:37.510 --> 06:15:37.520 align:start position:0%
that would we would be able to deal with
 
06:15:39.750 --> 06:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
these issues effectively even if we had
 
06:15:41.910 --> 06:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
the constitutional power to do so on the
 
06:15:43.430 --> 06:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
unit was a good idea to give us a
 
06:15:44.948 --> 06:15:44.958 align:start position:0%
constitutional power and that's
 
06:15:44.958 --> 06:15:47.190 align:start position:0%
constitutional power and that's
certainly

06:15:47.190 --> 06:15:47.200 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
06:15:48.708 --> 06:15:48.718 align:start position:0%
one of the main reasons why it's a bad
 
06:15:51.110 --> 06:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
idea they give us a constitutional power
 
06:15:52.788 --> 06:15:52.798 align:start position:0%
of course is because
 
06:15:54.628 --> 06:15:54.638 align:start position:0%
this would be by simple majority and the
 
06:15:56.708 --> 06:15:56.718 align:start position:0%
majority flips back and forth from party
 
06:15:59.110 --> 06:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
to party and there's you know the
 
06:16:01.110 --> 06:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
parties has its own you know
 
06:16:02.470 --> 06:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh it
 
06:16:05.270 --> 06:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
has his own uh groups within their
 
06:16:07.990 --> 06:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
within the party so like this would uh
 
06:16:09.910 --> 06:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
this would like overturn a lot of
 
06:16:11.830 --> 06:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
decisions that right now are
 
06:16:13.590 --> 06:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
you know starry to stysis established
 
06:16:14.948 --> 06:16:14.958 align:start position:0%
law we hear a lot about the importance
 
06:16:16.708 --> 06:16:16.718 align:start position:0%
of you know at least accepting
 
06:16:18.310 --> 06:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
certain decisions
 
06:16:20.070 --> 06:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
as established law even if we're not
 
06:16:20.080 --> 06:16:21.590 align:start position:0%
as established law even if we're not
necessarily

06:16:21.590 --> 06:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
06:16:23.990 --> 06:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
crazy about them so this would this
 
06:16:26.390 --> 06:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
would politicize you know every issue
 
06:16:27.430 --> 06:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
and then a lot of these things would
 
06:16:29.750 --> 06:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
just keep changing every every few years
 
06:16:31.430 --> 06:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
as the you know the makeup of the
 
06:16:33.910 --> 06:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
legislature changed so uh
 
06:16:35.670 --> 06:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
i gave about a million reasons why this
 
06:16:37.670 --> 06:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
is a bad idea we probably only needed
 
06:16:40.788 --> 06:16:40.798 align:start position:0%
one but that's uh
 
06:16:42.310 --> 06:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
anyway that that's what i have to say
 
06:16:44.708 --> 06:16:44.718 align:start position:0%
about this so thank you
 
06:16:47.750 --> 06:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
and representing sylvia
 
06:16:49.910 --> 06:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i wouldn't be
 
06:16:52.948 --> 06:16:52.958 align:start position:0%
so dismissive of this idea
 
06:16:54.230 --> 06:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
while i
 
06:16:54.240 --> 06:16:55.590 align:start position:0%
while i
uh

06:16:55.590 --> 06:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:17:00.548 --> 06:17:00.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:03.190 --> 06:17:03.200 align:start position:0%
perfect i think there's certainly merit
 
06:17:04.708 --> 06:17:04.718 align:start position:0%
to discussing
 
06:17:06.868 --> 06:17:06.878 align:start position:0%
such an issue um
 
06:17:08.708 --> 06:17:08.718 align:start position:0%
as far as the supreme court being the
 
06:17:10.948 --> 06:17:10.958 align:start position:0%
ultimate authority i disagree i think
 
06:17:12.708 --> 06:17:12.718 align:start position:0%
the people of the state are the ultimate
 
06:17:12.718 --> 06:17:14.470 align:start position:0%
the people of the state are the ultimate
authority

06:17:14.470 --> 06:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
authority
 
06:17:17.430 --> 06:17:17.440 align:start position:0%
um and certainly the legislature
 
06:17:19.830 --> 06:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
if they see bad decisions representative
 
06:17:19.840 --> 06:17:20.628 align:start position:0%
if they see bad decisions representative
rice

06:17:20.628 --> 06:17:20.638 align:start position:0%
rice
 
06:17:20.638 --> 06:17:21.990 align:start position:0%
rice
uh

06:17:21.990 --> 06:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:17:24.788 --> 06:17:24.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:32.628 --> 06:17:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:35.430 --> 06:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
i don't see representatives so sylvia
 
06:17:37.270 --> 06:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
but he was still talking
 
06:17:40.070 --> 06:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:41.190 --> 06:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
there he is
 
06:17:43.510 --> 06:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
i'm here did i go away or was it the
 
06:17:45.590 --> 06:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
chairman that went away i don't know
 
06:17:47.750 --> 06:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure but representative sylvia
 
06:17:50.070 --> 06:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
was still talking i'm sorry
 
06:17:51.590 --> 06:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
it's all right
 
06:17:54.390 --> 06:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
so i was saying that uh i believe it's
 
06:17:56.070 --> 06:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
the the people that have the ultimate
 
06:17:57.510 --> 06:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
authority in the state
 
06:18:00.390 --> 06:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
furthermore bad decisions uh made by the
 
06:18:03.030 --> 06:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
court we also have uh
 
06:18:05.590 --> 06:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
impeachment possibilities for a
 
06:18:05.600 --> 06:18:07.110 align:start position:0%
impeachment possibilities for a
bad

06:18:07.110 --> 06:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
bad
 
06:18:09.190 --> 06:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
judge or perhaps a whole court if
 
06:18:11.190 --> 06:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
they're terribly wrong
 
06:18:14.390 --> 06:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
i don't think this is a horrible idea
 
06:18:17.750 --> 06:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
i think that we also have the ability to
 
06:18:17.760 --> 06:18:19.990 align:start position:0%
i think that we also have the ability to
um

06:18:19.990 --> 06:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:18:22.868 --> 06:18:22.878 align:start position:0%
consider things uh like i think
 
06:18:25.670 --> 06:18:25.680 align:start position:0%
claremont uh being a great example of
 
06:18:27.030 --> 06:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
bad decisions
 
06:18:30.310 --> 06:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
that just uh keep echoing throughout the
 
06:18:33.030 --> 06:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
state and our laws
 
06:18:35.190 --> 06:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
perhaps you know what was the what was
 
06:18:35.200 --> 06:18:36.070 align:start position:0%
perhaps you know what was the what was
the

06:18:36.070 --> 06:18:36.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:18:36.080 --> 06:18:37.430 align:start position:0%
the
final

06:18:37.430 --> 06:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
final
 
06:18:37.440 --> 06:18:38.868 align:start position:0%
final
uh

06:18:38.868 --> 06:18:38.878 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:18:41.670 --> 06:18:41.680 align:start position:0%
decision to that it's not final yet and
 
06:18:44.628 --> 06:18:44.638 align:start position:0%
the certainly the court cannot force
 
06:18:46.390 --> 06:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
the legislature to
 
06:18:48.310 --> 06:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
appropriate money
 
06:18:50.708 --> 06:18:50.718 align:start position:0%
and as far as a statement made along the
 
06:18:55.110 --> 06:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:56.948 --> 06:18:56.958 align:start position:0%
i think anyone that's
 
06:18:59.430 --> 06:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
spent time in them like we do know that
 
06:19:01.430 --> 06:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
there's an awful lot of ambiguity
 
06:19:03.510 --> 06:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
throughout our statutes
 
06:19:03.520 --> 06:19:04.470 align:start position:0%
throughout our statutes
so

06:19:04.470 --> 06:19:04.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:19:07.670 --> 06:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
that stuff needs to get cleaned up so
 
06:19:10.948 --> 06:19:10.958 align:start position:0%
i think this was not a bad bill
 
06:19:14.070 --> 06:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
but perhaps it's uh not entirely right
 
06:19:16.788 --> 06:19:16.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:19.350 --> 06:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
now representative rice i'm sorry
 
06:19:21.910 --> 06:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman so i
 
06:19:24.150 --> 06:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
think you know i i do think that that
 
06:19:26.948 --> 06:19:26.958 align:start position:0%
this bill is just too much but i do want
 
06:19:30.310 --> 06:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
to say that i think it came from a place
 
06:19:32.150 --> 06:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
of where the representative that
 
06:19:35.030 --> 06:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
sponsored it has seen and heard a lot
 
06:19:36.470 --> 06:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
from the people
 
06:19:40.070 --> 06:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
um regarding the court system uh
 
06:19:42.788 --> 06:19:42.798 align:start position:0%
primarily the family court system
 
06:19:46.548 --> 06:19:46.558 align:start position:0%
um and and i believe that it came from a
 
06:19:49.030 --> 06:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
good place but i i think we have to find
 
06:20:02.470 --> 06:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:03.350 --> 06:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:20:05.270 --> 06:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative silver
 
06:20:06.868 --> 06:20:06.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
06:20:06.878 --> 06:20:08.788 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
um

06:20:08.788 --> 06:20:08.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:20:10.868 --> 06:20:10.878 align:start position:0%
i agree that this came from good
 
06:20:10.878 --> 06:20:12.230 align:start position:0%
i agree that this came from good
intentions

06:20:12.230 --> 06:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
intentions
 
06:20:13.430 --> 06:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
uh we know
 
06:20:15.270 --> 06:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
that the the road to wherever is paid
 
06:20:16.788 --> 06:20:16.798 align:start position:0%
for good intentions
 
06:20:16.798 --> 06:20:18.390 align:start position:0%
for good intentions
um

06:20:18.390 --> 06:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:20:20.868 --> 06:20:20.878 align:start position:0%
my problem is that
 
06:20:23.750 --> 06:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
there's no bifurcation in the language
 
06:20:26.788 --> 06:20:26.798 align:start position:0%
of this proposal between interpretations
 
06:20:29.190 --> 06:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
of state statutes and interpretations of
 
06:20:31.270 --> 06:20:31.280 align:start position:0%
the state constitution
 
06:20:33.190 --> 06:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
interpretations of the state statute of
 
06:20:34.868 --> 06:20:34.878 align:start position:0%
a state statute if we don't agree with
 
06:20:38.070 --> 06:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
it we had a we had some bill i believe
 
06:20:39.910 --> 06:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
we discussed earlier today
 
06:20:41.990 --> 06:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
we pass a different bill we passed a
 
06:20:43.750 --> 06:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
bill changing the statute we have the
 
06:20:45.670 --> 06:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
ability already without this
 
06:20:49.190 --> 06:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment to overturn a
 
06:20:52.708 --> 06:20:52.718 align:start position:0%
court decision interpreting a statute
 
06:20:55.830 --> 06:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
we get the problem gets into
 
06:20:57.990 --> 06:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
trying to overturn a decision by the
 
06:20:59.590 --> 06:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
state supreme court interpreting the
 
06:20:59.600 --> 06:21:01.190 align:start position:0%
state supreme court interpreting the
constitution

06:21:01.190 --> 06:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
06:21:04.070 --> 06:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
that's a much more difficult issue it's
 
06:21:05.670 --> 06:21:05.680 align:start position:0%
been an issue that of course in the
 
06:21:08.310 --> 06:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
federal courts was decided very very
 
06:21:09.430 --> 06:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
long ago
 
06:21:11.590 --> 06:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
and who is the final interpreter or the
 
06:21:14.390 --> 06:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
arbiter of what the u.s constitution
 
06:21:14.400 --> 06:21:15.430 align:start position:0%
arbiter of what the u.s constitution
means

06:21:15.430 --> 06:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
means
 
06:21:18.548 --> 06:21:18.558 align:start position:0%
and the u.s supreme court said oh it's
 
06:21:18.558 --> 06:21:19.430 align:start position:0%
and the u.s supreme court said oh it's
us

06:21:19.430 --> 06:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
us
 
06:21:21.350 --> 06:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
and that's the old marbury versus
 
06:21:23.830 --> 06:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
madison case and that's been the law now
 
06:21:23.840 --> 06:21:24.708 align:start position:0%
madison case and that's been the law now
for

06:21:24.708 --> 06:21:24.718 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:21:26.788 --> 06:21:26.798 align:start position:0%
you know a couple centuries
 
06:21:26.798 --> 06:21:27.670 align:start position:0%
you know a couple centuries
so

06:21:27.670 --> 06:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:21:29.750 --> 06:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh right or wrong that's the system that
 
06:21:31.350 --> 06:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
we operate under
 
06:21:33.590 --> 06:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
the system also that we operate under in
 
06:21:36.150 --> 06:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
the state just like the federal system
 
06:21:38.628 --> 06:21:38.638 align:start position:0%
is one of a separation of powers
 
06:21:41.510 --> 06:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
we make the laws executive enforces the
 
06:21:43.750 --> 06:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
laws and the judiciary
 
06:21:45.270 --> 06:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
interprets the laws that's what it's
 
06:21:46.628 --> 06:21:46.638 align:start position:0%
supposed to be
 
06:21:49.350 --> 06:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
this would put us into a position
 
06:21:52.708 --> 06:21:52.718 align:start position:0%
of being a super judiciary on
 
06:21:55.190 --> 06:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
interpretations of a state constitution
 
06:21:57.430 --> 06:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
so i don't believe that that
 
06:22:00.150 --> 06:22:00.160 align:start position:0%
if we if we have a dis agreement with
 
06:22:02.070 --> 06:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
the state supreme court's interpretation
 
06:22:04.230 --> 06:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
of our state constitution
 
06:22:06.230 --> 06:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
we need to overcome that
 
06:22:08.070 --> 06:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
by passing a constitutional amendment i
 
06:22:09.110 --> 06:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
have let the people pass a
 
06:22:10.548 --> 06:22:10.558 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment
 
06:22:13.350 --> 06:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
that's the way to do it but we should we
 
06:22:15.270 --> 06:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
could should not have the ability by a
 
06:22:17.910 --> 06:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
simple majority vote of the general
 
06:22:20.470 --> 06:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
court to overturn a state supreme court
 
06:22:21.670 --> 06:22:21.680 align:start position:0%
decision interpreting the state
 
06:22:24.390 --> 06:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
constitution that's to me is a violation
 
06:22:26.708 --> 06:22:26.718 align:start position:0%
of the concept of separation of powers
 
06:22:28.548 --> 06:22:28.558 align:start position:0%
i'm not a big you know we've talked
 
06:22:31.270 --> 06:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
about starry decisis there's a lot of a
 
06:22:32.788 --> 06:22:32.798 align:start position:0%
lot of talk about the the effect of
 
06:22:34.548 --> 06:22:34.558 align:start position:0%
stereo decisis
 
06:22:37.030 --> 06:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
in our judicial system and there's a lot
 
06:22:40.708 --> 06:22:40.718 align:start position:0%
of criticism about story decisis
 
06:22:40.718 --> 06:22:41.670 align:start position:0%
of criticism about story decisis
it's

06:22:41.670 --> 06:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
it's
 
06:22:44.070 --> 06:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
not something that i'm a big fan of
 
06:22:45.670 --> 06:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
there are some supreme court justices
 
06:22:46.788 --> 06:22:46.798 align:start position:0%
that have written
 
06:22:49.670 --> 06:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
very critically of it if starry decisis
 
06:22:51.910 --> 06:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
was such an important
 
06:22:54.150 --> 06:22:54.160 align:start position:0%
inviolate principle
 
06:22:56.070 --> 06:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
we would still have the dred scott
 
06:22:58.548 --> 06:22:58.558 align:start position:0%
decision and we would have the separate
 
06:23:01.270 --> 06:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
but equal before the brown versus board
 
06:23:02.868 --> 06:23:02.878 align:start position:0%
of education decisions in the federal
 
06:23:06.788 --> 06:23:06.798 align:start position:0%
system so starry decisis can be overcome
 
06:23:09.830 --> 06:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
and it's not inviolate so i don't i
 
06:23:11.910 --> 06:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
don't you know have a lot of concerns
 
06:23:13.190 --> 06:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
about that but i would have a lot of
 
06:23:16.708 --> 06:23:16.718 align:start position:0%
concerns if we try to put ourselves in
 
06:23:18.788 --> 06:23:18.798 align:start position:0%
the general court in a position of
 
06:23:21.430 --> 06:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
overturning supreme court decisions
 
06:23:23.190 --> 06:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
interpreting the state constitution
 
06:23:25.430 --> 06:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:23:29.190 --> 06:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:31.750 --> 06:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
i'll be brief i just wanted to enjoy
 
06:23:33.510 --> 06:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
06:23:33.520 --> 06:23:34.310 align:start position:0%
saying that
i

06:23:34.310 --> 06:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:23:36.470 --> 06:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
agree with representative silver 100
 
06:23:36.480 --> 06:23:37.590 align:start position:0%
agree with representative silver 100
percent

06:23:37.590 --> 06:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
percent
 
06:23:39.110 --> 06:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know how often i'm going to say
 
06:23:42.230 --> 06:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
that as the weeks and months go on but
 
06:23:44.390 --> 06:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
certainly i can say that today
 
06:23:44.400 --> 06:23:46.470 align:start position:0%
certainly i can say that today
um

06:23:46.470 --> 06:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:23:48.548 --> 06:23:48.558 align:start position:0%
to a certain extent it's it's whose ox
 
06:23:51.990 --> 06:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
is being gored uh we have a uh a
 
06:23:54.788 --> 06:23:54.798 align:start position:0%
constitutional provision section uh
 
06:23:57.350 --> 06:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
article uh 2a i think
 
06:24:00.070 --> 06:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh that speaks about uh the right of
 
06:24:03.430 --> 06:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
citizens to bear arms in new hampshire
 
06:24:05.270 --> 06:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
the state constitution
 
06:24:07.830 --> 06:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
so let's say a
 
06:24:11.510 --> 06:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
a a legislative session took place
 
06:24:14.150 --> 06:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
and the legislature passed a law
 
06:24:18.310 --> 06:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
that said nobody can own any guns in new
 
06:24:21.030 --> 06:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire under state law
 
06:24:23.910 --> 06:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
um is that going to just automatically
 
06:24:27.350 --> 06:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
supersede by majority vote what the
 
06:24:29.430 --> 06:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
state constitution says
 
06:24:31.110 --> 06:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
i should think not
 
06:24:33.510 --> 06:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of the fundamental
 
06:24:33.520 --> 06:24:34.548 align:start position:0%
and that's kind of the fundamental
problem

06:24:34.548 --> 06:24:34.558 align:start position:0%
problem
 
06:24:36.548 --> 06:24:36.558 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
06:24:37.750 --> 06:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
with this
 
06:24:39.430 --> 06:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
proposed constitutional amendment we
 
06:24:42.070 --> 06:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
have a way of amending the constitution
 
06:24:44.230 --> 06:24:44.240 align:start position:0%
and this would substitute a different
 
06:24:47.110 --> 06:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
way of amending the constitution
 
06:24:50.708 --> 06:24:50.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:52.310 --> 06:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
are there any other
 
06:24:52.320 --> 06:24:53.190 align:start position:0%
are there any other
uh

06:24:53.190 --> 06:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:24:54.200 --> 06:24:54.210 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
06:24:54.210 --> 06:24:56.470 align:start position:0%
yes representative
[Music]

06:24:56.470 --> 06:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:24:59.430 --> 06:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman so i want a second
 
06:25:00.788 --> 06:25:00.798 align:start position:0%
there's a couple things here that i
 
06:25:03.430 --> 06:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
think are very worthy of consideration
 
06:25:05.830 --> 06:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
so the idea of majority vote i don't
 
06:25:08.230 --> 06:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
particularly agree that that the
 
06:25:10.310 --> 06:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
general court should be able to overturn
 
06:25:13.670 --> 06:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
any court decision by majority vote
 
06:25:15.110 --> 06:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
but i do think
 
06:25:18.150 --> 06:25:18.160 align:start position:0%
that the general court
 
06:25:20.150 --> 06:25:20.160 align:start position:0%
should be the final
 
06:25:22.708 --> 06:25:22.718 align:start position:0%
decision maker
 
06:25:24.070 --> 06:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
as already talked about we're the
 
06:25:25.990 --> 06:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
closest ones to the people
 
06:25:28.150 --> 06:25:28.160 align:start position:0%
we do make the laws
 
06:25:28.160 --> 06:25:30.070 align:start position:0%
we do make the laws
and

06:25:30.070 --> 06:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:25:32.788 --> 06:25:32.798 align:start position:0%
it was a time in our history when
 
06:25:35.110 --> 06:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
the court system was not held in the
 
06:25:39.030 --> 06:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:41.030 --> 06:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
i think that the general court should be
 
06:25:43.350 --> 06:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
maybe by two-thirds vote of both houses
 
06:25:46.390 --> 06:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
maybe by 60 percent something like that
 
06:25:48.628 --> 06:25:48.638 align:start position:0%
should be able to to overturn a supreme
 
06:25:50.868 --> 06:25:50.878 align:start position:0%
court decision and just say look we're a
 
06:25:52.788 --> 06:25:52.798 align:start position:0%
branch for government
 
06:25:54.788 --> 06:25:54.798 align:start position:0%
we have as much authority
 
06:25:57.110 --> 06:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
to interpret the constitution
 
06:25:58.868 --> 06:25:58.878 align:start position:0%
as the court does
 
06:26:00.868 --> 06:26:00.878 align:start position:0%
and we're doing that
 
06:26:02.390 --> 06:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
and the court
 
06:26:04.150 --> 06:26:04.160 align:start position:0%
should say in its own
 
06:26:04.160 --> 06:26:05.110 align:start position:0%
should say in its own
well

06:26:05.110 --> 06:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:26:07.910 --> 06:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
there are times when the court oversteps
 
06:26:09.830 --> 06:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
and we should be able to stop their
 
06:26:09.840 --> 06:26:11.270 align:start position:0%
and we should be able to stop their
overstepping

06:26:11.270 --> 06:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
overstepping
 
06:26:13.910 --> 06:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
by simply overruling them as opposed to
 
06:26:15.830 --> 06:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
just ignoring them which is what we do
 
06:26:15.840 --> 06:26:19.110 align:start position:0%
just ignoring them which is what we do
now

06:26:19.110 --> 06:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:19.120 --> 06:26:20.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:26:20.470 --> 06:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
