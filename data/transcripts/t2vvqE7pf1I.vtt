and had to get it pumped up didn't plan
 
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:16.000 align:start position:0%

00:14:41.949 --> 00:14:41.959 align:start position:0%

Deerfield is my pleasure to bring to you
 
00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:46.360 align:start position:0%
this morning uh uh
 
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
cacr uh 15 so this
 
00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:55.480 align:start position:0%
um amendment is uh an attempt I guess to
 
00:14:59.310 --> 00:14:59.320 align:start position:0%
uh to solidify New Hampshire's uh status
 
00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
as a as a beacon of of freedom and low
 
00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:05.320 align:start position:0%
taxes and and all the good things that
 
00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:08.600 align:start position:0%
Americans hold dear
 
00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:13.720 align:start position:0%
um we at uh because we know
 
00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:23.829 --> 00:15:23.839 align:start position:0%
um I'll just reach for my sheet here
 
00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
look with with a provision like this in
 
00:15:26.910 --> 00:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
place ens shrin in our constitution we
 
00:15:28.829 --> 00:15:28.839 align:start position:0%
can rest easy with the knowledge the
 
00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:31.240 align:start position:0%
granite Staters can feel conf confident
 
00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:34.120 align:start position:0%
that we will remain income and sales tax
 
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
uh free you know like to say that uh low
 
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
taxes are uh the result of low spending
 
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
but I think um uh the way things work in
 
00:15:45.189 --> 00:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
a state like New Hampshire that it's
 
00:15:47.749 --> 00:15:47.759 align:start position:0%
kind of the opposite that uh that low
 
00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
spending is the result of the restraint
 
00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:54.839 align:start position:0%
imposed by uh low taxes uh I think uh a
 
00:15:58.710 --> 00:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
former speaker said it to me uh this way
 
00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959 align:start position:0%
that we spend all the money that we have
 
00:16:03.949 --> 00:16:03.959 align:start position:0%
so we can uh uh prevent the finance
 
00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
committee down down the hall from having
 
00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
more money to spend than they than they
 
00:16:08.959 --> 00:16:10.550 align:start position:0%
more money to spend than they than they
won't

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
won't
 
00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
um so uh what I was surprised to find
 
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
out uh because when I put this in I
 
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
didn't realize that this was already
 
00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
such a uh a popular uh thing across this
 
00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:23.560 align:start position:0%
country there are actually 14 other
 
00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:27.160 align:start position:0%
states uh that have this uh uh provision
 
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
in their constitutions and there are uh
 
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
all different kinds of States there's
 
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
giant States there's very tiny States
 
00:16:33.949 --> 00:16:33.959 align:start position:0%
there's red States there's blue States
 
00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
there's High tax states there's low tax
 
00:16:38.269 --> 00:16:38.279 align:start position:0%
states and uh so while I I thought of
 
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:47.790 align:start position:0%
 
a

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:47.800 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:16:50.829 --> 00:16:50.839 align:start position:0%
anti-tax uh kind of proposal it it
 
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be that that's the case
 
00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:56.959 align:start position:0%
in the real world and uh to me this um
 
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
not so much about tax policy but it's
 
00:17:04.990 --> 00:17:05.000 align:start position:0%
about uh consent you know the
 
00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:07.079 align:start position:0%
Declaration of Independence says that
 
00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919 align:start position:0%
the just powers of government are
 
00:17:11.949 --> 00:17:11.959 align:start position:0%
derived from the consent of the
 
00:17:14.029 --> 00:17:14.039 align:start position:0%
government and I I I may
 
00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
be uh in the alone in this room in being
 
00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:22.079 align:start position:0%
able to Envision an alternate universe
 
00:17:24.029 --> 00:17:24.039 align:start position:0%
where the functions of government are
 
00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:26.799 align:start position:0%
funded on a voluntary transactional
 
00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:29.720 align:start position:0%
basis rather than by uh course of
 
00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:33.460 align:start position:0%
Taxation but in this real world
 
00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:34.789 align:start position:0%
Taxation but in this real world
[Music]

00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
um it
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh it's not a stretch to imagine that we
 
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
can increase the level of consent from a
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
simple majority to a super majority
 
00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
because we can look around this country
 
00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
and more than 25% of the states are
 
00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:53.960 align:start position:0%
already doing it that way so uh it's my
 
00:17:57.029 --> 00:17:57.039 align:start position:0%
hope that we can give this gift to the
 
00:17:59.110 --> 00:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh people of the Granite State um in
 
00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:02.360 align:start position:0%
November and allow them uh to vote on
 
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
adding this provision to the uh
 
00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
Constitution and I'll go ahead and cut
 
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
it short but I'll I'll hand in my notes
 
00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
Here uh for you to put on file if you
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
like uh I'm happy to take questions I
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%

um
[Music]

00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:35.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:18:37.870 --> 00:18:37.880 align:start position:0%
to let me
 
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:40.400 align:start position:0%

00:18:42.669 --> 00:18:42.679 align:start position:0%
point okay uh so the states include I
 
00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:43.880 align:start position:0%
don't know if this is a complete list
 
00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
but it's a Arizona Arkansas California
 
00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:48.520 align:start position:0%
Delaware Florida
 
00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:52.190 align:start position:0%
Delaware Florida
Kentucky

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
okay gotta so maybe you just you
 
00:19:01.590 --> 00:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
I'll pass it okay yes representative
 
00:19:03.549 --> 00:19:03.559 align:start position:0%
shamberg thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question on
 
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
line 24 of this bill page
 
00:19:12.669 --> 00:19:12.679 align:start position:0%
one says the Senate uh House of
 
00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:14.039 align:start position:0%
Representative Senate shall be required
 
00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
to pass a new tax if a two-thirds vote
 
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:20.440 align:start position:0%
is needed what if the state has an
 
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
emergency that requires Bond and tax
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
action to resolve the emergency would
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
this law negate action by the
 
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.470 align:start position:0%
this law negate action by the
legislature

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:29.480 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:32.440 align:start position:0%
uh from acting well I think in an
 
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
emergency situation you'd have no
 
00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
problem getting a two-thirds vote of the
 
00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
legislature so there are other states
 
00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
that um require uh tax increases to
 
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
actually go to the ballot uh for the
 
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
people to vote on and and I think that
 
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
that's even that's a step too far like
 
00:19:50.590 --> 00:19:50.600 align:start position:0%
as much as I'm in favor of the consent
 
00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
of the government I think you gotta you
 
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
got to allow the government to to
 
00:19:56.909 --> 00:19:56.919 align:start position:0%
operate and and I think uh I think this
 
00:19:59.710 --> 00:19:59.720 align:start position:0%
is a happy uh medium thank you follow up
 
00:20:02.909 --> 00:20:02.919 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman follow up uh on the second
 
00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
page lines uh starting with line five or
 
00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:08.120 align:start position:0%
start with line
 
00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
four it talks
 
00:20:13.710 --> 00:20:13.720 align:start position:0%
about uh the
 
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
revenue is
 
00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
there a priority order of distribution
 
00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:21.320 align:start position:0%
of State funds if we couldn't get the
 
00:20:25.510 --> 00:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
2third vote for this emergency
 
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
or I do believe that's uh up to the
 
00:20:30.909 --> 00:20:30.919 align:start position:0%
finance committee to decide how the
 
00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
no I will withdraw my
 
00:20:37.470 --> 00:20:37.480 align:start position:0%
answer thank you representative
 
00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:41.320 align:start position:0%
ery yeah to follow up on that we have a
 
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
provision that says that bonded funds
 
00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
will be paid period they're the first
 
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
priority which then goes over to the
 
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:54.200 align:start position:0%
finance committee if I'm not or fiscal
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
committee if I'm not mistaken to shift
 
00:20:59.549 --> 00:20:59.559 align:start position:0%
funds around in in order to meet this
 
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
obligation meet this obligation or tell
 
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
somebody that they're not going to go to
 
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
work next week um and if a crisis
 
00:21:10.909 --> 00:21:10.919 align:start position:0%
arrives the question then becomes if
 
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
change well I think you would be the one
 
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
that I would ask that question to it
 
00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:19.270 align:start position:0%
that I would ask that question to it
sounds

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
sounds
 
00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:22.950 align:start position:0%
sounds
[Laughter]

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:25.480 align:start position:0%
like uh representative
 
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
fellows so this is another question
 
00:21:31.149 --> 00:21:31.159 align:start position:0%
about the bonds so a bond means that the
 
00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
state borrowed a large amount of money
 
00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:37.400 align:start position:0%
for an extended period of time and
 
00:21:40.029 --> 00:21:40.039 align:start position:0%
making payments on that Bond or like a
 
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
mortgage making the interest payments
 
00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
so what I'm concerned about what the
 
00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
consequences are if you don't um make
 
00:21:54.190 --> 00:21:54.200 align:start position:0%
your bond payments for sure your rating
 
00:21:57.230 --> 00:21:57.240 align:start position:0%
is going to go down but um I think that
 
00:22:01.269 --> 00:22:01.279 align:start position:0%
that is really a big problem to say that
 
00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
we need a 2third vote to make bond
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
payments which are normally just
 
00:22:09.149 --> 00:22:09.159 align:start position:0%
something that's included in the
 
00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
budget well I I think your concern is
 
00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
valid and I share your concern I'm
 
00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:15.640 align:start position:0%
pretty sure that um over two-thirds of
 
00:22:17.029 --> 00:22:17.039 align:start position:0%
your colleagues would share that concern
 
00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
too so I'm not sure that this would be
 
00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:21.559 align:start position:0%
an impediment again the U you know 14
 
00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:26.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
so yes repres
 
00:22:31.789 --> 00:22:31.799 align:start position:0%
PL uh There's no distinction about size
 
00:22:34.430 --> 00:22:34.440 align:start position:0%
of tax or fee so this would apply to a
 
00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
$2 increase on a say a motor vehicle fee
 
00:22:40.470 --> 00:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
or something like that I do believe that
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
it would and uh the lower the fee the
 
00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
easier it'll be to get two-thirds to
 
00:22:48.909 --> 00:22:48.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:51.269 --> 00:22:51.279 align:start position:0%
it uh represent
 
00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
Jo thank you um I'm wondering if you
 
00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
have inquired of the state treasurer or
 
00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
the bond rating agencies or the major
 
00:23:08.830 --> 00:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
sources of bonds as to the effect of a
 
00:23:13.070 --> 00:23:13.080 align:start position:0%
requirement like this on uh the price
 
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
the effective price that the state will
 
00:23:20.029 --> 00:23:20.039 align:start position:0%
have to pay for um raising money uh
 
00:23:20.039 --> 00:23:21.950 align:start position:0%
have to pay for um raising money uh
through

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
bonding uh no I have not I I like that
 
00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
question and I will look into that
 
00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
representative Aly yeah I've still got a
 
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
question here or a comment in a question
 
00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:41.080 align:start position:0%
on the fiscal committee does may
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
eventually on on agree or not but it is
 
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
the governor that decides in cases of
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
major emergencies who is going to get
 
00:23:54.789 --> 00:23:54.799 align:start position:0%
what and who is going to have nothing
 
00:24:00.669 --> 00:24:00.679 align:start position:0%
and um that that is has been the fact in
 
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
our government at least as long as I've
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
been here which is almost 30 years now
 
00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
um is that a would you believe would you
 
00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:11.240 align:start position:0%
would you believe that that uh this
 
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
actually puts a huge amount of power
 
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
into the hands of the governor when we
 
00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:16.720 align:start position:0%
get to emergency and we've just been
 
00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:19.149 align:start position:0%
get to emergency and we've just been
through

00:24:19.149 --> 00:24:19.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:22.520 align:start position:0%
one I I would believe and I do uh share
 
00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
your concern about the emergency powers
 
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
of the executive branch and uh whichever
 
00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:28.710 align:start position:0%
of the executive branch and uh whichever
part

00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
part
 
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
right could I have a follow sure follow
 
00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:35.960 align:start position:0%
yes the other um uh problem that I see
 
00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
with this um and I wonder if you have
 
00:24:41.789 --> 00:24:41.799 align:start position:0%
considered the fact that we have been
 
00:24:46.269 --> 00:24:46.279 align:start position:0%
dumping um needs and costs onto the
 
00:24:49.149 --> 00:24:49.159 align:start position:0%
towns and the property tax by removing
 
00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
taxes for some time now and that this
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
would would uh
 
00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.630 align:start position:0%
would would uh
allow

00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
allow
 
00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:03.000 align:start position:0%
towns and cities to have and counties to
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
have to to raise their property taxes in
 
00:25:09.269 --> 00:25:09.279 align:start position:0%
order to replace
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
Services yeah I I I get the concern but
 
00:25:16.789 --> 00:25:16.799 align:start position:0%
I've what I have observed is that the
 
00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:19.480 align:start position:0%
more uh money we send to the towns and
 
00:25:21.389 --> 00:25:21.399 align:start position:0%
the cities it doesn't seem to prevent
 
00:25:23.909 --> 00:25:23.919 align:start position:0%
them from continuing to raise their
 
00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
taxes and um I know that um
 
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't expect a town to uh treat the
 
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
state's money um the same as they treat
 
00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
their own just the same as I don't
 
00:25:39.950 --> 00:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
expect that the state treats Federal
 
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
money uh the same as their own so I I I
 
00:25:47.669 --> 00:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
don't I don't see the property tax
 
00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:50.360 align:start position:0%
connection as uh
 
00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:52.630 align:start position:0%
connection as uh
being

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
being
 
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
um a concern here representative
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
spillsbury thank you Mr chairman uh
 
00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
would you be satisfied If the percentage
 
00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:07.240 align:start position:0%
was 35th 60% instead of two3 yeah I
 
00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
think any movement uh toward greater
 
00:26:13.029 --> 00:26:13.039 align:start position:0%
consent is good I mean I'd be happier
 
00:26:18.029 --> 00:26:18.039 align:start position:0%
with 80% but um you know 2/3 is um is a
 
00:26:22.269 --> 00:26:22.279 align:start position:0%
number that we see in other states so I
 
00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
I think that's it gives people a a sense
 
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
of of comfort that you know it's not
 
00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
it's not an outrageous number and it's
 
00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:32.909 align:start position:0%
it's not an outrageous number and it's
not

00:26:32.909 --> 00:26:32.919 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
uh yeah it was interesting to me as
 
00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
you're going through your list one of
 
00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:40.360 align:start position:0%
the States you mentioned was California
 
00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
and high tech State and yet they I think
 
00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
they're on this list correct right I
 
00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:48.200 align:start position:0%
gotta tell you I I I was shocked from
 
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
going from when I when I when I put this
 
00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
in what I my preconceptions were to uh
 
00:26:54.029 --> 00:26:54.039 align:start position:0%
you know what actually exists in the in
 
00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
the real world was yeah kind kind of
 
00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
kind of different yeah I wouldn't have
 
00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:00.799 align:start position:0%
ECT of that representative fellows um I
 
00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
know that on the local level um there
 
00:27:06.389 --> 00:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
are tax
 
00:27:08.389 --> 00:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
caps which is a little different than
 
00:27:10.669 --> 00:27:10.679 align:start position:0%
this but they're tax caps but they allow
 
00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:13.720 align:start position:0%
their caps like to not exceed the rate
 
00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:17.240 align:start position:0%
of inflation so I'm wondering if any of
 
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
these states that have this provision
 
00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
and you're saying they have it in their
 
00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
constitution their state constitution do
 
00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:28.120 align:start position:0%
do they have any except
 
00:27:30.909 --> 00:27:30.919 align:start position:0%
for inflation so I think the tax rates
 
00:27:34.269 --> 00:27:34.279 align:start position:0%
are not the problem it's more the fees I
 
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
mean we had a bill on camping fees you
 
00:27:40.029 --> 00:27:40.039 align:start position:0%
know do we have to have a that hadn't
 
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
been increased in many years I mean it
 
00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
just seems kind
 
00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
of no but I I don't imagine that You'
 
00:27:50.029 --> 00:27:50.039 align:start position:0%
need to have that in the Constitution
 
00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
right you could you could uh when you
 
00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
create your fee you could build into it
 
00:28:00.509 --> 00:28:00.519 align:start position:0%
a um esal alation that could be uh so
 
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
you vote on at one time and then it
 
00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
continues to escalate over time right
 
00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
follow up so are you saying like when we
 
00:28:12.149 --> 00:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
have fees in the rsas camping fees that
 
00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
there should be some provision in that
 
00:28:17.789 --> 00:28:17.799 align:start position:0%
statute that said says allowed to in
 
00:28:19.509 --> 00:28:19.519 align:start position:0%
can't allowed to
 
00:28:22.669 --> 00:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
increase by the rate of inflation yeah I
 
00:28:24.669 --> 00:28:24.679 align:start position:0%
I'm saying you could if if that's what
 
00:28:26.509 --> 00:28:26.519 align:start position:0%
and then how would how would because
 
00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional is going to overrule
 
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
anything that's in the RSA right but if
 
00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
you if so you got a fee and you say it's
 
00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
a dollar this year and it increases by
 
00:28:38.830 --> 00:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
50% 50 cents per year you vote on it
 
00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
with a two-thirds vote then it's
 
00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:43.880 align:start position:0%
just it's kind of on autopilot at that
 
00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:47.190 align:start position:0%
just it's kind of on autopilot at that
point

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:50.389 --> 00:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
right yeah it's interesting you bring up
 
00:28:53.149 --> 00:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
the towns in their tax caps because uh
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
something we see is that um the the
 
00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
towns just ignore the tax caps and they
 
00:29:00.909 --> 00:29:00.919 align:start position:0%
do whatever they want and uh uh same way
 
00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:02.840 align:start position:0%
uh in the state of Washington they don't
 
00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:04.600 align:start position:0%
have a constitutional provision but they
 
00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:07.720 align:start position:0%
have had six separate ballot initiatives
 
00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
to impose a two-thirds requirement on
 
00:29:12.669 --> 00:29:12.679 align:start position:0%
their legislature and they just ignore
 
00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
it it's like it doesn't
 
00:29:17.269 --> 00:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
exist so that that's why that's why it
 
00:29:19.230 --> 00:29:19.240 align:start position:0%
needs to go in the Constitution and not
 
00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
just be because we can't
 
00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:23.590 align:start position:0%
just be because we can't
impose

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
impose
 
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
U uh a requirement ourselves on a future
 
00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:29.269 align:start position:0%
U uh a requirement ourselves on a future
legislature

00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative elberger thank you Mr
 
00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:33.880 align:start position:0%
chairman and I have questions in two
 
00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:35.640 align:start position:0%
areas if I may
 
00:29:39.070 --> 00:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
okay uh we have a couple of lawsuits
 
00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
that have been uh successfully argued in
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
lower court now are being appealed by
 
00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
the state regarding funding for public
 
00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:50.360 align:start position:0%
education if
 
00:29:54.909 --> 00:29:54.919 align:start position:0%
the uh lawsuit prevails at a higher
 
00:29:57.990 --> 00:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
level how will
 
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
how would you
 
00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
foresee uh raising the funds necessary
 
00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.590 align:start position:0%
foresee uh raising the funds necessary
to

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
support uh public education at the
 
00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:11.909 align:start position:0%
support uh public education at the
required

00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:11.919 align:start position:0%
required
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
level right uh I again if if we're
 
00:30:17.630 --> 00:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
talking about an issue that is that
 
00:30:19.509 --> 00:30:19.519 align:start position:0%
important I I don't see that it would be
 
00:30:22.269 --> 00:30:22.279 align:start position:0%
a problem to overcome the two-thirds
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
requirement okay and second
 
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
question in the light of um wanting
 
00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal uh responsibility and
 
00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
transparency would you also agree that
 
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
any tax cuts or eliminations would have
 
00:30:43.269 --> 00:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
to be approved by 2third of the bar of
 
00:30:43.279 --> 00:30:44.549 align:start position:0%
to be approved by 2third of the bar of
the

00:30:44.549 --> 00:30:44.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
bodies well no I mean um if you wanted
 
00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:49.640 align:start position:0%
to have the mirror image of the
 
00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:51.320 align:start position:0%
two-thirds requirement it should really
 
00:30:53.669 --> 00:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
only take onethird um
 
00:30:57.629 --> 00:30:57.639 align:start position:0%
to uh cut or eliminate ATT tax right
 
00:30:59.029 --> 00:30:59.039 align:start position:0%
because the idea
 
00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:02.440 align:start position:0%
is consent but but I I I do think you do
 
00:31:04.669 --> 00:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
need a little bit you know of
 
00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:07.240 align:start position:0%
of resistance in the in the downward
 
00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
Direction so I I think you know 50% to
 
00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:13.480 align:start position:0%
uh to decrease the taxes is not not a
 
00:31:16.990 --> 00:31:17.000 align:start position:0%
horrible place to be you have a question
 
00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
yes repres
 
00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you on when we passed the
 
00:31:27.669 --> 00:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
original education funding money it took
 
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
us 8
 
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
hours without a break locked in and we
 
00:31:36.509 --> 00:31:36.519 align:start position:0%
went back and forth and back and forth
 
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
and we just barely passed it if I
 
00:31:41.070 --> 00:31:41.080 align:start position:0%
remember correctly there is no way we
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
could have gotten
 
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
2/3 and that would you believe
 
00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
that I I would believe onethird is not a
 
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
majority in a democracy 2third is a very
 
00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:01.000 align:start position:0%
large de a majority in our elections
 
00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
half is just barely getting you
 
00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
there um is that a question that's a
 
00:32:10.789 --> 00:32:10.799 align:start position:0%
that's a yeah uh but I think in in
 
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
elections of Representatives that's a a
 
00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:14.799 align:start position:0%
different kind of a story and you uh if
 
00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:16.360 align:start position:0%
you needed two-thirds to elect a
 
00:32:18.149 --> 00:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
representative you would end up in a
 
00:32:19.509 --> 00:32:19.519 align:start position:0%
situation where you didn't have a
 
00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
representative but I think when we're
 
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
talking about uh the act of taking a
 
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
portion of someone's property or income
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
that I think a very high level of
 
00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
consent should be required for
 
00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:34.559 align:start position:0%
that that's why I put this
 
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
in anybody else yes representative ORS
 
00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
my question a followup on rep um
 
00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:47.960 align:start position:0%
alberger question about what about tax
 
00:32:51.269 --> 00:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
reduction so and your opinion over the
 
00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
years as we have reduced taxes has it
 
00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:56.440 align:start position:0%
increased revenue does it remain the
 
00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:57.629 align:start position:0%
increased revenue does it remain the
same

00:32:57.629 --> 00:32:57.639 align:start position:0%
same
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
do we do we lose Revenue to a point
 
00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
where it becomes a
 
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
problem I I I think our observation uh
 
00:33:08.549 --> 00:33:08.559 align:start position:0%
up to this point is that it uh revenues
 
00:33:11.629 --> 00:33:11.639 align:start position:0%
have increased over time okay and so is
 
00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
there some way you could provide
 
00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
followup thank you uh would you be able
 
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
to provide us with proof of that do we
 
00:33:22.149 --> 00:33:22.159 align:start position:0%
have that I mean I like the theory but
 
00:33:23.549 --> 00:33:23.559 align:start position:0%
do we have proof of that in New
 
00:33:26.389 --> 00:33:26.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is my question uh if if you
 
00:33:28.909 --> 00:33:28.919 align:start position:0%
would like me to go do that homework I
 
00:33:31.789 --> 00:33:31.799 align:start position:0%
can do that but um I'm pretty sure you
 
00:33:34.389 --> 00:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
you know the answer Yeah well yeah say I
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
I would not but I mean maybe Dr or
 
00:33:40.629 --> 00:33:40.639 align:start position:0%
somebody could show us that so uh
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
followup one more followup okay so if if
 
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative alberger question about
 
00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:49.720 align:start position:0%
you know what would it take to reduce
 
00:33:51.909 --> 00:33:51.919 align:start position:0%
taxes I think we could agree that at
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
least a 50% plus one vote might be
 
00:33:58.149 --> 00:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
enough to reduce
 
00:34:02.669 --> 00:34:02.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:04.669 --> 00:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
you all
 
00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
right thank you very much thank
 
00:34:12.030 --> 00:34:12.040 align:start position:0%

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
Prosperity good morning Mr chairman
 
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
members of the committee thank you for
 
00:34:27.869 --> 00:34:27.879 align:start position:0%
the opportunity speak here today for the
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
record my name is Greg Moore I am a
 
00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:31.480 align:start position:0%
regional director with Americans for
 
00:34:35.069 --> 00:34:35.079 align:start position:0%
Prosperity uh cacr 15 as you see it is
 
00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
not a particularly novel piece of
 
00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
legislation uh veteran members of this
 
00:34:41.669 --> 00:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
committee have seen this on many
 
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
occasions uh I see represent really
 
00:34:46.750 --> 00:34:46.760 align:start position:0%
waving at me because he's he himself has
 
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
brought this legislation on several
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
occasions including in 2011 which was my
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
first experience with this type of
 
00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
amendment uh which is when it passed the
 
00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
house of represent resentatives a little
 
00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
bit of History then is that 2011 it it
 
00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
really only included uh in its first
 
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
iteration the parts on page one as well
 
00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:09.160 align:start position:0%
as uh the voter guide components it came
 
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
out of this committee uh oop pass didn't
 
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
didn't get a majority I mean it got a
 
00:35:15.829 --> 00:35:15.839 align:start position:0%
majority but didn't achieve the required
 
00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:17.800 align:start position:0%
uh three- fifth majority in the house
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
came back to this committee had this the
 
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
the second component which is at the to
 
00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
the top of page two uh which was
 
00:35:25.589 --> 00:35:25.599 align:start position:0%
language that was provided by the state
 
00:35:28.109 --> 00:35:28.119 align:start position:0%
treasurer to order to ensure that the
 
00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
state's Bonds were protected in order to
 
00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:31.640 align:start position:0%
protect the State's bond rating because
 
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
otherwise without that uh provision they
 
00:35:36.270 --> 00:35:36.280 align:start position:0%
felt as though it would be represent a
 
00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
threat to uh the State's bond rating so
 
00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:41.800 align:start position:0%
that was added uh at the behest of
 
00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:43.880 align:start position:0%
several several members who had that
 
00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
concern raised by the state treasurer uh
 
00:35:50.109 --> 00:35:50.119 align:start position:0%
we believe this is important legislation
 
00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:52.960 align:start position:0%
to send a signal to the to the uh rest
 
00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
of the the region and the country that
 
00:35:56.190 --> 00:35:56.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is going to remain a low
 
00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
tax Beacon
 
00:36:00.270 --> 00:36:00.280 align:start position:0%
uh Provisions like this uh there was a a
 
00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:04.040 align:start position:0%
study by the uh the Journal of public uh
 
00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:06.520 align:start position:0%
economists that found that low tax
 
00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:08.440 align:start position:0%
states to P pass Super majority
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
Provisions does have the effect of
 
00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
ensuring low taxes going forward uh on
 
00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
the other hand uh Provisions like this
 
00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:18.200 align:start position:0%
also exist in in such notorious low tax
 
00:36:20.589 --> 00:36:20.599 align:start position:0%
states as Rhode Island California and
 
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
Hawaii uh where obviously the the the
 
00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:25.400 align:start position:0%
provision is not necessarily limiting
 
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
their ability to to uh raise taxes as
 
00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:30.079 align:start position:0%
needed I would say that I would say that
 
00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:31.599 align:start position:0%
this is this is important legislation to
 
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:34.079 align:start position:0%
send that clear signal uh across across
 
00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
the region across a country that New
 
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is going to remain a low tax
 
00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:40.280 align:start position:0%
state and ultimately uh we will uh
 
00:36:42.589 --> 00:36:42.599 align:start position:0%
produce positive results for our economy
 
00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:44.440 align:start position:0%
and economic growth going forward
 
00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
because as as particularly as employers
 
00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
understand that there's going to be that
 
00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:50.920 align:start position:0%
level of tax certainty they become even
 
00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
more inclined to want to come to a state
 
00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
like that further enhancing our economic
 
00:36:57.309 --> 00:36:57.319 align:start position:0%
growth over the long Arc of it uh so
 
00:36:58.589 --> 00:36:58.599 align:start position:0%
with that I'd be happy to take any
 
00:37:00.349 --> 00:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
questions uh talk about my experience
 
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
this is probably so working for the
 
00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:04.760 align:start position:0%
house I had a chance to go through this
 
00:37:06.309 --> 00:37:06.319 align:start position:0%
once and I've been to this committee
 
00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
probably two or three times since then
 
00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
in the intervening 11 years since I left
 
00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
the House of Representatives so I'd be
 
00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:13.960 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you
 
00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
representative fellows thank you
 
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
um representative Osborne told us that
 
00:37:22.589 --> 00:37:22.599 align:start position:0%
there are I think he said 14 states that
 
00:37:25.069 --> 00:37:25.079 align:start position:0%
have this in their constitution but a
 
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
lot of them just ignored can you explain
 
00:37:32.790 --> 00:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
the part about how they ignore it uh so
 
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
I think he referenced specifically the
 
00:37:35.589 --> 00:37:35.599 align:start position:0%
state of Washington the state of
 
00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:37.720 align:start position:0%
Washington has
 
00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
put you know we're we are not a a ballot
 
00:37:42.270 --> 00:37:42.280 align:start position:0%
referendum question the only thing that
 
00:37:44.109 --> 00:37:44.119 align:start position:0%
goes on the ballot for us our
 
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendments we don't have
 
00:37:48.309 --> 00:37:48.319 align:start position:0%
like state of Massachusetts which
 
00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
actually can can pass laws via ballot
 
00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:54.680 align:start position:0%
referenda uh the state of Washington has
 
00:37:56.309 --> 00:37:56.319 align:start position:0%
that same provision like Massachusetts
 
00:37:58.309 --> 00:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
and may have passed what amounts to
 
00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:00.760 align:start position:0%
state laws via ballot referendum six
 
00:38:04.109 --> 00:38:04.119 align:start position:0%
times now as you know no legislature or
 
00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:07.640 align:start position:0%
in this case the public can uh do
 
00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
anything that can compel a future
 
00:38:10.390 --> 00:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
legislature to anything so while that
 
00:38:12.349 --> 00:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
law goes on the books a future
 
00:38:14.950 --> 00:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
legislature comes along ignores the law
 
00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:17.720 align:start position:0%
and then turns around and passes uh
 
00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:19.960 align:start position:0%
passes a tax increase regardless of the
 
00:38:21.069 --> 00:38:21.079 align:start position:0%
fact that there was something on the
 
00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
books saying that it would require super
 
00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:23.720 align:start position:0%
majority and they don't they do it
 
00:38:25.829 --> 00:38:25.839 align:start position:0%
without a super majority because as you
 
00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:28.640 align:start position:0%
know uh representative you can put a put
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
a provision and say uh regardless of RSA
 
00:38:33.990 --> 00:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
whatever this or notwithstanding any any
 
00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:35.560 align:start position:0%
other provision of law to the contrary
 
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
you can do this uh and he is right there
 
00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:39.800 align:start position:0%
are 14 states that have these Provisions
 
00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
specifically within their constitution
 
00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
and then there are two others uh the
 
00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
states of Colorado and uh the state of
 
00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
Missouri that actually require tax
 
00:38:52.109 --> 00:38:52.119 align:start position:0%
increases to go on the ballot uh so
 
00:38:54.990 --> 00:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
really there's 16 states that that have
 
00:38:57.069 --> 00:38:57.079 align:start position:0%
somewhat similar provisions like this
 
00:38:59.829 --> 00:38:59.839 align:start position:0%
that that uh create this sort of uh
 
00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:01.640 align:start position:0%
increased bar Beyond just a simple
 
00:39:03.990 --> 00:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
majority in in the legislature I'm sorry
 
00:39:06.670 --> 00:39:06.680 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question followup
 
00:39:11.589 --> 00:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
um partly but so I'm starting to see
 
00:39:15.069 --> 00:39:15.079 align:start position:0%
some differentiation here so I totally
 
00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
understand we ignore we ignore rsay all
 
00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:20.440 align:start position:0%
the time but that's not the same as
 
00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
ignoring something that's in the
 
00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:25.109 align:start position:0%
ignoring something that's in the
Constitution

00:39:25.109 --> 00:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
so how many states actually have this in
 
00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
their con state constitution so what did
 
00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
do they have exactly these words uh
 
00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
there are varying levels uh excuse me
 
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
anywhere between 3- fifths and 34s so
 
00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
2/3 is sort of like in the middle
 
00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
between the two in the constitution in
 
00:39:51.069 --> 00:39:51.079 align:start position:0%
the Constitution uh I I do have an
 
00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
example for you uh relative to a state
 
00:39:56.109 --> 00:39:56.119 align:start position:0%
that that uh ignored what was in their
 
00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
con Constitution the state of Oregon had
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
a provision like this in in their
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
constitution but then there was a ruling
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
a judicial ruling that found that base
 
00:40:09.309 --> 00:40:09.319 align:start position:0%
broadening activities were did were not
 
00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
included so in other words so in other
 
00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
words which I think most of us agreed
 
00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
that if you broaden a base of attacks
 
00:40:18.670 --> 00:40:18.680 align:start position:0%
that would be a tax increase but the
 
00:40:20.829 --> 00:40:20.839 align:start position:0%
state of Oregon uh had went through a
 
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
judicial ruling where their Supreme
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
Court actually indicated that they could
 
00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:27.400 align:start position:0%
do Bas broadening with without
 
00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:29.480 align:start position:0%
implicating the uh super majority so
 
00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
that's another example of a state that
 
00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:33.480 align:start position:0%
basically found a shortcut around the
 
00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:44.920 align:start position:0%
elberger thank you Mr chairman when you
 
00:40:46.589 --> 00:40:46.599 align:start position:0%
talk about low tax state are you
 
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
including property taxes in that uh
 
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
decision if you include property taxes
 
00:40:54.589 --> 00:40:54.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is still a low tax state
 
00:40:57.069 --> 00:40:57.079 align:start position:0%
so the answer is yes uh
 
00:41:00.309 --> 00:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
that that we have um relatively High
 
00:41:03.109 --> 00:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
property taxes uh compared to other
 
00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
states does not actually change the fact
 
00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:06.760 align:start position:0%
that including state and local tax
 
00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:08.200 align:start position:0%
burden New Hampshire is still one of the
 
00:41:10.309 --> 00:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
lowest tax burdens in the nation and
 
00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:11.800 align:start position:0%
there are other states the states that
 
00:41:14.109 --> 00:41:14.119 align:start position:0%
are higher than us on property tax
 
00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
states like Illinois and States like New
 
00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:19.000 align:start position:0%
Jersey obviously have a full array of
 
00:41:21.190 --> 00:41:21.200 align:start position:0%
other taxes that we
 
00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:23.720 align:start position:0%
don't followup
 
00:41:26.309 --> 00:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
followup I'm going to use this as a
 
00:41:30.109 --> 00:41:30.119 align:start position:0%
would you believe uh the New York Times
 
00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:32.200 align:start position:0%
every Sunday in its real estate
 
00:41:34.829 --> 00:41:34.839 align:start position:0%
section uh looks at different property
 
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
country um in last June I happened to be
 
00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
in New York and picked up a copy they
 
00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:46.640 align:start position:0%
were comparing $400,000 properties in
 
00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:48.680 align:start position:0%
three different parts of the country
 
00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
Denver Washington DC and some community
 
00:41:53.589 --> 00:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and I apologize I don't
 
00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
remember which it was the would you
 
00:41:58.670 --> 00:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
believe believe that the property taxes
 
00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
in Denver and Washington were $4,000 a
 
00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:05.480 align:start position:0%
year and $6,000 a year while the
 
00:42:07.109 --> 00:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
property in New
 
00:42:07.119 --> 00:42:08.670 align:start position:0%
property in New
Hampshire

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:08.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
was 140 no I'm sorry
 
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
$40,000 for the
 
00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
year and I apologize for the fact that I
 
00:42:18.589 --> 00:42:18.599 align:start position:0%
have this big speaker in my face that's
 
00:42:20.109 --> 00:42:20.119 align:start position:0%
I can't actually look at you when I'm
 
00:42:22.829 --> 00:42:22.839 align:start position:0%
talking to you uh sure I I would believe
 
00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:25.640 align:start position:0%
that uh I would I would say that that uh
 
00:42:28.309 --> 00:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
one of the things that that uh it's
 
00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:30.680 align:start position:0%
important to consider is that in a state
 
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
where property taxes uh make up a
 
00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
significant portion of the overall State
 
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
and uh state state and local tax burden
 
00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:41.720 align:start position:0%
is that there can be wide variations
 
00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
within communities and so there are high
 
00:42:46.910 --> 00:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
tax High relatively High tax communities
 
00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:49.480 align:start position:0%
and and relatively low tax communities I
 
00:42:51.069 --> 00:42:51.079 align:start position:0%
think what that gives much like the
 
00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:52.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity for people to vote with
 
00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:55.640 align:start position:0%
their feet among states is people can
 
00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
vote with their feet among communities
 
00:43:01.109 --> 00:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
as well um follow up follow up and and a
 
00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
correction I apologize it's a big
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
correction it's $14,000 not 40 that
 
00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:13.710 --> 00:43:13.720 align:start position:0%
um would you believe I know let's let's
 
00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:18.040 align:start position:0%
play games here that while New Hampshire
 
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
is among the top 10 states in terms of
 
00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
public support for public education
 
00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
depending on which research you look at
 
00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
we are either next to last or dead last
 
00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of State support for public
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
you representative shamberg thank you Mr
 
00:43:43.069 --> 00:43:43.079 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mr Moore for taking
 
00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
this question concerning on page two
 
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
lines one through uh 7 about the
 
00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
appropriation for payment of Interest
 
00:43:55.950 --> 00:43:55.960 align:start position:0%
first of all this is for it wouldn't be
 
00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
for for
 
00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
any it is based on the present Bond
 
00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
issues that have been issued correct
 
00:44:03.630 --> 00:44:03.640 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
00:44:07.069 --> 00:44:07.079 align:start position:0%
past past
 
00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:10.040 align:start position:0%
wording so this language is
 
00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
substantially similar to language that
 
00:44:14.309 --> 00:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
was added in 2011 to the to the
 
00:44:16.549 --> 00:44:16.559 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment and maybe
 
00:44:18.150 --> 00:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
represent y can correct me I think it
 
00:44:21.470 --> 00:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
was cicr 10 I think it was I don't know
 
00:44:24.270 --> 00:44:24.280 align:start position:0%
it's you know a while back um and this
 
00:44:25.630 --> 00:44:25.640 align:start position:0%
was a language that was provided
 
00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
specific speically by the state
 
00:44:28.549 --> 00:44:28.559 align:start position:0%
treasurer so the state treasurer
 
00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:30.440 align:start position:0%
actually actually drafted this language
 
00:44:32.750 --> 00:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
and and and offered it to this committee
 
00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:34.520 align:start position:0%
that that added it in to the legislation
 
00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
and I think I could go back to check
 
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
that the language but I'm pretty sure
 
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
that this is word for verbatim word for
 
00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
word what the state treasure offered to
 
00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
to this committee okay follow up Mr
 
00:44:47.109 --> 00:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
chairman follow up well the second part
 
00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
of this is from line four through line
 
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
five it talks about the the state
 
00:44:55.390 --> 00:44:55.400 align:start position:0%
treasurer being able to uh set apart
 
00:44:58.270 --> 00:44:58.280 align:start position:0%
from the first general fund revenues
 
00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
thereafter received a sum sufficient to
 
00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
pay such interest or installments of
 
00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
principles if the legislature does
 
00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
not by a 2third
 
00:45:15.549 --> 00:45:15.559 align:start position:0%
vote approve any more bonds or approve
 
00:45:18.109 --> 00:45:18.119 align:start position:0%
any payment that would cover the bond
 
00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
issues the state treasur takes
 
00:45:24.549 --> 00:45:24.559 align:start position:0%
over would this not create havoc on the
 
00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
budget of the state for those that are
 
00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:30.440 align:start position:0%
all Downstream if the treasur is making
 
00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:32.680 align:start position:0%
the the decision to pull this money
 
00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:33.710 align:start position:0%
the the decision to pull this money
without

00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:33.720 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:45:35.349 --> 00:45:35.359 align:start position:0%
consultation uh
 
00:45:38.309 --> 00:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
or with the legislature yeah you can
 
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
tell the state treasurer wrote this
 
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
provision huh yes uh no I I I I I
 
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
understand um I think that's why why
 
00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:49.640 align:start position:0%
they wanted it in the constitution is
 
00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:52.880 align:start position:0%
because because the um the state
 
00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
treasury it would be constitutionally
 
00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
directed to do that as as opposed and
 
00:45:58.390 --> 00:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
and the legislature would then therefore
 
00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:00.440 align:start position:0%
have to work around the fact that the
 
00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
that the treasurer's hands were tied and
 
00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:05.960 align:start position:0%
uh and and again I this this shows why
 
00:46:08.549 --> 00:46:08.559 align:start position:0%
but but but I also I'm also cognizant of
 
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
the fact that that any state treasurer
 
00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:13.720 align:start position:0%
understands that they are elected by the
 
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
legislature so I think that I think that
 
00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
you're going to get a fair degree of
 
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:20.200 align:start position:0%
consultation throughout this process as
 
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
a result of it but but to your to your
 
00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
broader Point yes the treasur is
 
00:46:26.589 --> 00:46:26.599 align:start position:0%
directed to do that um first and
 
00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
foremost and then and then the
 
00:46:30.309 --> 00:46:30.319 align:start position:0%
legislature is going to have to adjust
 
00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
to what the treasurer would do based
 
00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:39.640 align:start position:0%
responsibilities all right seeing no
 
00:46:43.030 --> 00:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
you and that is it for the pink cards I
 
00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.910 align:start position:0%
you and that is it for the pink cards I
have

00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
um all right I will close the public
 
00:46:58.549 --> 00:46:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:07.720 align:start position:0%
1116 thank
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
you and representative Sweeny will
 
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
introduce the
 
00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:20.109 align:start position:0%
introduce the
bill

00:47:20.109 --> 00:47:20.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
than thank thank you Mr chairman members
 
00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
of the Ways and Means Committee um I
 
00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
think when we think about the reasons
 
00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
people send us to conquer uh this bill
 
00:47:32.670 --> 00:47:32.680 align:start position:0%
isn't one of them uh this is a very uh
 
00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
housekeeping bill that house election
 
00:47:36.309 --> 00:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
law committee had amended the original
 
00:47:38.069 --> 00:47:38.079 align:start position:0%
bill I will say that the copy of the
 
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
bill that's over there is the originally
 
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
introduced version there was an
 
00:47:44.309 --> 00:47:44.319 align:start position:0%
amendment in election law that was
 
00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:46.280 align:start position:0%
unanimously supported and then it was
 
00:47:48.069 --> 00:47:48.079 align:start position:0%
unanimously supported on the the house
 
00:47:50.670 --> 00:47:50.680 align:start position:0%
floor uh the current bill as amended
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
after house election law simply removes
 
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
the $2 fee for state repres
 
00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
representative candidates um that was
 
00:47:59.109 --> 00:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
the policy that the house election law
 
00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:01.880 align:start position:0%
committee uh decided to and since it
 
00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
does technically affect revenue streams
 
00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
uh for the
 
00:48:08.470 --> 00:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh that's why it's before
 
00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
you here today uh for house Ways and
 
00:48:13.150 --> 00:48:13.160 align:start position:0%
Means again it's just removing the $2
 
00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:14.720 align:start position:0%
filing fee for state representative
 
00:48:17.069 --> 00:48:17.079 align:start position:0%
candidates to get on the ballot um I
 
00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
think speaking for one of the larger
 
00:48:21.549 --> 00:48:21.559 align:start position:0%
towns that will be impacted by this uh
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
fee I I would you know if there's upset
 
00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:27.200 align:start position:0%
at Town Hall I'll gladly pay the $36
 
00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
that they typically anticipate every two
 
00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
years uh for this fee um but I'm happy
 
00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
to take any questions about how the
 
00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:35.960 align:start position:0%
election law committee got to that point
 
00:48:38.589 --> 00:48:38.599 align:start position:0%
uh with just eliminating the $2 fee uh
 
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
but that really is uh you know I think
 
00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:41.800 align:start position:0%
less than
 
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
$10,000 of uh is is generous uh for this
 
00:48:47.829 --> 00:48:47.839 align:start position:0%
bill's Revenue impact when it's just
 
00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
every two-year fee so thank you any
 
00:48:55.150 --> 00:48:55.160 align:start position:0%
questions yes represent elberger thank
 
00:48:58.190 --> 00:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman just curious I assume
 
00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
that this uh set of fees and the
 
00:49:05.349 --> 00:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
increases would not be required to get
 
00:49:07.829 --> 00:49:07.839 align:start position:0%
two-thirds approval no and so and the
 
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
bill was amended in election law so
 
00:49:13.069 --> 00:49:13.079 align:start position:0%
there's no fee increases in the bill it
 
00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
this is the older version of the bill as
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
I stated the current legislation just
 
00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
eliminates the $2 fee for state
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
representatives nothing else happens
 
00:49:22.319 --> 00:49:23.870 align:start position:0%
representatives nothing else happens
thank

00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
you and it just representative it's not
 
00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
yeah it's just state representative all
 
00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
right so even actually a town of Sal
 
00:49:33.630 --> 00:49:33.640 align:start position:0%
would be $18 yeah right 9 time 2 so it's
 
00:49:36.030 --> 00:49:36.040 align:start position:0%
yeah pretty
 
00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
minor uh anyone
 
00:49:40.750 --> 00:49:40.760 align:start position:0%
else all right seeing none thank you all
 
00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:49.390 --> 00:49:49.400 align:start position:0%
good all right um I will close the
 
00:49:52.829 --> 00:49:52.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:58.390 --> 00:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
hp16 okay thank you Mr chairman yes U
 
00:50:01.390 --> 00:50:01.400 align:start position:0%
could we ask that the amended version be
 
00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
circulated for the full
 
00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:06.079 align:start position:0%
committee the
 
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
amended the amended version of what HB
 
00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:11.640 align:start position:0%
the version as amended by election law
 
00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:13.240 align:start position:0%
and adopted on the house floor is the
 
00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
one that we actually need to consider
 
00:50:17.230 --> 00:50:17.240 align:start position:0%
and so when we meet for executive
 
00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:19.480 align:start position:0%
session I'd like to have seen that okay
 
00:50:22.349 --> 00:50:22.359 align:start position:0%
so what do so we have I think this is
 
00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:24.440 align:start position:0%
amended the one we have
 
00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:30.030 align:start position:0%
amended the one we have
back

00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:32.330 align:start position:0%
yeah we do have the amended
 
00:50:32.330 --> 00:50:37.430 align:start position:0%
yeah we do have the amended
[Music]

00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:43.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
versionary yes um what representative
 
00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
Sweeney was saying was that basically on
 
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
page one that lines 11 through 15 are
 
00:50:58.670 --> 00:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
not present
 
00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:00.190 align:start position:0%
not present
anymore

00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:00.200 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
00:51:10.990 --> 00:51:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
lines yes to clarify on the table all
 
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:16.680 align:start position:0%

the fiscal note okay the wrong version
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%

bit so I've
 
00:54:54.079 --> 00:54:55.870 align:start position:0%

Monday 1492 thank you um so 1492 will be
 
00:55:15.589 --> 00:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
the first one on Tuesday at 10
 
00:55:19.589 --> 00:55:19.599 align:start position:0%
o'clock um so right now the well what
 
00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
I've submitted and what will come out of
 
00:55:24.109 --> 00:55:24.119 align:start position:0%
the calendar is eight Bills starting at
 
00:55:26.589 --> 00:55:26.599 align:start position:0%
10 o'clock for a work session on Monday
 
00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
the 5th Tuesday the 6th there'll be six
 
00:55:33.789 --> 00:55:33.799 align:start position:0%
bills in a work session followed by
 
00:55:36.029 --> 00:55:36.039 align:start position:0%
that's at 10 and then a one o00 start to
 
00:55:38.789 --> 00:55:38.799 align:start position:0%
an exec session of all those bills of
 
00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:40.280 align:start position:0%
Monday and Tuesday now I know I don't
 
00:55:42.109 --> 00:55:42.119 align:start position:0%
know that we can get through all those
 
00:55:44.670 --> 00:55:44.680 align:start position:0%
but the the way it works is I'm allowed
 
00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
to list all these so in case it goes
 
00:55:49.549 --> 00:55:49.559 align:start position:0%
fast we don't want to run out um the
 
00:55:53.029 --> 00:55:53.039 align:start position:0%
more we can get done the better um so
 
00:55:55.309 --> 00:55:55.319 align:start position:0%
when you see the calendar don't get
 
00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
frighten they we're going to be here
 
00:55:58.510 --> 00:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
till midnight because we'll we'll cut it
 
00:56:00.910 --> 00:56:00.920 align:start position:0%
we'll be cutting it off
 
00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
um so do you if you know those Bill
 
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
numbers already can you just make a copy
 
00:56:11.029 --> 00:56:11.039 align:start position:0%
of that so we'll know the calendar won't
 
00:56:12.589 --> 00:56:12.599 align:start position:0%
come out until
 
00:56:14.829 --> 00:56:14.839 align:start position:0%
Friday um it comes out an email on
 
00:56:14.839 --> 00:56:16.510 align:start position:0%
Friday um it comes out an email on
Thursday

00:56:16.510 --> 00:56:16.520 align:start position:0%
Thursday
 
00:56:20.789 --> 00:56:20.799 align:start position:0%
night um well it's
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
um yeah I have an e well um I have an
 
00:56:25.789 --> 00:56:25.799 align:start position:0%
email that I could forward
 
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
yeah okay Mr chairman yeah I believe the
 
00:56:32.750 --> 00:56:32.760 align:start position:0%
bills for Monday will be the ones that
 
00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
we had hearings on on the 9th and
 
00:56:38.589 --> 00:56:38.599 align:start position:0%
16th and the bills for Tuesday are then
 
00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
the bills we had hearings on for the
 
00:56:41.829 --> 00:56:41.839 align:start position:0%
17th so if you just look at those
 
00:56:44.270 --> 00:56:44.280 align:start position:0%
agendas you'll see the list that's a
 
00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:46.280 align:start position:0%
good point if you still have the public
 
00:56:49.549 --> 00:56:49.559 align:start position:0%
hearing uh so we our first public
 
00:56:51.589 --> 00:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
hearing so we had public hearings on the
 
00:56:54.349 --> 00:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
9th and the 16th those are the first two
 
00:56:56.950 --> 00:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
public hearings we
 
00:57:00.549 --> 00:57:00.559 align:start position:0%
had all those bills will be in the work
 
00:57:05.789 --> 00:57:05.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
1492 Mr chairman I can still phot an
 
00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
email later yes I I get Torn
 
00:57:17.109 --> 00:57:17.119 align:start position:0%
Between the the efforts that you're
 
00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
making to be respectful of Outsiders
 
00:57:22.589 --> 00:57:22.599 align:start position:0%
time with regard to scheduling bills
 
00:57:25.109 --> 00:57:25.119 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm wondering though since there
 
00:57:28.270 --> 00:57:28.280 align:start position:0%
has been so much variation in how long
 
00:57:31.470 --> 00:57:31.480 align:start position:0%
some of our hearings are whether it
 
00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:34.640 align:start position:0%
might make sense to consider scheduling
 
00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
all of the hearings at the same time so
 
00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:40.200 align:start position:0%
that we aren't left with chunks of time
 
00:57:41.589 --> 00:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
waiting until the next bill that we're
 
00:57:44.670 --> 00:57:44.680 align:start position:0%
supposed to hear okay so um the public
 
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
hearings have to have a an absolute time
 
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
for example the next public hearings at
 
00:57:52.789 --> 00:57:52.799 align:start position:0%
uh HB 1054 starts at 10:30 I cannot
 
00:57:54.069 --> 00:57:54.079 align:start position:0%
start it earlier it has to start at
 
00:57:57.549 --> 00:57:57.559 align:start position:0%
10:30 but once we start doing work so at
 
00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
the end of the day
 
00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
today we'll be done with all the public
 
00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
hearings of the bills in Ways and Means
 
00:58:07.029 --> 00:58:07.039 align:start position:0%
starting Monday we'll start doing work
 
00:58:09.390 --> 00:58:09.400 align:start position:0%
sessions the work sessions all I have to
 
00:58:11.549 --> 00:58:11.559 align:start position:0%
do is start with an initial time it'll
 
00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
say 10 o'clock there'll be a whole list
 
00:58:15.349 --> 00:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
of bills if we finish one we just go to
 
00:58:18.270 --> 00:58:18.280 align:start position:0%
the next one we don't have to yeah and
 
00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
and because when you see it it's a long
 
00:58:23.230 --> 00:58:23.240 align:start position:0%
list we'll just automatically break for
 
00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
long we're not going to get all this
 
00:58:25.549 --> 00:58:25.559 align:start position:0%
done in the morning morning so we'll
 
00:58:27.630 --> 00:58:27.640 align:start position:0%
break for lunch you know at the
 
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate time whether it's 12:00 or
 
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
12:30 depending on how we're progressing
 
00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
um we'll have lunch and then we'll
 
00:58:38.430 --> 00:58:38.440 align:start position:0%
continue yes represent Omi uh two two
 
00:58:43.069 --> 00:58:43.079 align:start position:0%
questions uh one on if you're you're
 
00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
normally I think going to go in the
 
00:58:46.990 --> 00:58:47.000 align:start position:0%
order that the bills are listed I'm
 
00:58:48.349 --> 00:58:48.359 align:start position:0%
going to go I've decided to go in the
 
00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
order of the bills as we've done the
 
00:58:52.910 --> 00:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
public hearings yeah um and that way the
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
nice thing about that is they get
 
00:58:58.109 --> 00:58:58.119 align:start position:0%
grouped in some sort of fashion as well
 
00:58:59.589 --> 00:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
originally I was thinking about trying
 
00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
to do the easier ones first then I said
 
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:02.720 align:start position:0%
well it's
 
00:59:04.750 --> 00:59:04.760 align:start position:0%
just that doesn't make any sense because
 
00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
if we hit a hard one where we need
 
00:59:08.109 --> 00:59:08.119 align:start position:0%
another work session or need more
 
00:59:10.190 --> 00:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
information then we know in advance
 
00:59:12.109 --> 00:59:12.119 align:start position:0%
instead of waiting pushing it off too
 
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
far so you aren't attempting to to exec
 
00:59:19.470 --> 00:59:19.480 align:start position:0%
all of the bills next week and leave us
 
00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:20.390 align:start position:0%
all of the bills next week and leave us
with

00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:59:23.430 --> 00:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
nothing oh no no because next week we
 
00:59:25.829 --> 00:59:25.839 align:start position:0%
we're going to have work sessions on oh
 
00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
I see you're saying because I don't need
 
00:59:28.789 --> 00:59:28.799 align:start position:0%
a work I'm trying to do a work session
 
00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
on every single bill yeah um and some of
 
00:59:34.230 --> 00:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
them might be as simple as we don't have
 
00:59:35.950 --> 00:59:35.960 align:start position:0%
any questions I open the work session we
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
talk for one two minutes and I close the
 
00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
work session and move on to the next
 
00:59:44.750 --> 00:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
one but there there will be occasions
 
00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
when somebody uh a sponsor will look at
 
00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
it on Friday and say I want to be there
 
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
but I've got a
 
00:59:58.910 --> 00:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
conflict and try to call you up maybe
 
01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:03.240 align:start position:0%
and see if he could be moved to a
 
01:00:05.349 --> 01:00:05.359 align:start position:0%
different yeah I mean I can skip you
 
01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:07.480 align:start position:0%
know if it makes sense I can skip over
 
01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
that one and schedule it the following
 
01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
week so
 
01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
okay so we're also we're going we're not
 
01:00:18.750 --> 01:00:18.760 align:start position:0%
going to try and exact every bill on
 
01:00:21.309 --> 01:00:21.319 align:start position:0%
Tuesday afternoon I mean two I'm going
 
01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
to list um so there's bills on Monday
 
01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
work sessions there's six work sessions
 
01:00:30.789 --> 01:00:30.799 align:start position:0%
on Tuesday that's 14 I then listed all
 
01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
14 for an exec session I don't think we
 
01:00:36.789 --> 01:00:36.799 align:start position:0%
can will make it through all 14 although
 
01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
some of them may be um we just it
 
01:00:42.029 --> 01:00:42.039 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense to exec it so we just
 
01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
skip over it and so this long list just
 
01:00:50.270 --> 01:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:54.270 --> 01:00:54.280 align:start position:0%
all thank you and we will not be excting
 
01:00:56.309 --> 01:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
any Monday
 
01:01:18.069 --> 01:01:18.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:18.079 --> 01:01:21.109 align:start position:0%

01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
12 12 it's usually 1 hour so it's 12:15
 
01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:27.720 align:start position:0%
I don't know why it takes
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:53.440 --> 01:06:29.870 align:start position:0%
 
drive

01:06:29.870 --> 01:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:32.109 --> 01:06:32.119 align:start position:0%
all right in an effort to stay on track
 
01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
we'll get
 
01:06:38.269 --> 01:06:38.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:38.279 --> 01:06:40.029 align:start position:0%
 
10:31

01:06:40.029 --> 01:06:40.039 align:start position:0%
10:31
 
01:06:43.269 --> 01:06:43.279 align:start position:0%

alisandra Murray and I represent Ward 9
in

01:07:19.230 --> 01:07:19.240 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:07:21.670 --> 01:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
Manchester um last year when the house
 
01:07:23.950 --> 01:07:23.960 align:start position:0%
passed our state budget we included non
 
01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:26.920 align:start position:0%
colling funding for a new border uh
 
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
northern border Alliance program this
 
01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
provision was originally removed by the
 
01:07:33.630 --> 01:07:33.640 align:start position:0%
majority of Representatives when the
 
01:07:35.269 --> 01:07:35.279 align:start position:0%
bill passed through the house but was
 
01:07:37.390 --> 01:07:37.400 align:start position:0%
added back in um when it went to the
 
01:07:39.549 --> 01:07:39.559 align:start position:0%
other side of the wall the northern
 
01:07:42.589 --> 01:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
border Alliance provides grants to law
 
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies for the purpose of
 
01:07:46.670 --> 01:07:46.680 align:start position:0%
reducing potential legal activity within
 
01:07:49.990 --> 01:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
25 miles of the Canadian border the bill
 
01:07:51.549 --> 01:07:51.559 align:start position:0%
before you now does something very
 
01:07:54.190 --> 01:07:54.200 align:start position:0%
simple it changes the current non-aps in
 
01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
function of this fund so that in the
 
01:07:57.829 --> 01:07:57.839 align:start position:0%
future this program would be funded
 
01:07:59.910 --> 01:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
through the typical budget appropriation
 
01:08:02.349 --> 01:08:02.359 align:start position:0%
process this change is necessary for a
 
01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
couple reasons one being that the
 
01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
legislature was clearly divided on this
 
01:08:08.430 --> 01:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
funding when it was originally passed
 
01:08:09.950 --> 01:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
the second is that the need for the
 
01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
funding was tied to a lack of federal
 
01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
funds and the federal funding we
 
01:08:15.069 --> 01:08:15.079 align:start position:0%
received can fluctuate year to year and
 
01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:16.799 align:start position:0%
the legislature should be able to adjust
 
01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
the appropriation as those circumstances
 
01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:21.640 align:start position:0%
change and thirdly there's little to no
 
01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
publicly available data to indicate any
 
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
kind of crisis at the border of New
 
01:08:27.669 --> 01:08:27.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Canada and the US Customs
 
01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
and Border Protection already has a
 
01:08:32.349 --> 01:08:32.359 align:start position:0%
strong presence there um so that's my
 
01:08:33.630 --> 01:08:33.640 align:start position:0%
introduction I'm happy to answer any
 
01:08:35.110 --> 01:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
questions but also there are some folks
 
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
here who are better versed on this
 
01:08:39.309 --> 01:08:39.319 align:start position:0%
subject thank you do we have a question
 
01:08:42.349 --> 01:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
yes represent El me yeah just um a
 
01:08:44.269 --> 01:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
matter of fact you might be able to tell
 
01:08:47.510 --> 01:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
us it says in close proximity now to the
 
01:08:51.550 --> 01:08:51.560 align:start position:0%
Canadian border um the border patrol
 
01:08:54.669 --> 01:08:54.679 align:start position:0%
used to go come down 100 miles to
 
01:08:57.229 --> 01:08:57.239 align:start position:0%
Lebanon and I'm just wondering where did
 
01:09:00.269 --> 01:09:00.279 align:start position:0%
you get 25 miles from well this is in
 
01:09:03.269 --> 01:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
regards to the um program that's funding
 
01:09:04.829 --> 01:09:04.839 align:start position:0%
our local police and that's only
 
01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
applicable to within 25 miles the US
 
01:09:08.590 --> 01:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
Customs and Border Patrol does Patrol
 
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
within the 100 miles of that's in law
 
01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:12.470 align:start position:0%
within the 100 miles of that's in law
somewhere

01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
01:09:16.510 --> 01:09:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
you no other questions okay oh you have
 
01:09:23.470 --> 01:09:23.480 align:start position:0%
a question represent yeah I'm just I I
 
01:09:25.149 --> 01:09:25.159 align:start position:0%
can't remember I'm not sure can you tell
 
01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:27.480 align:start position:0%
me where the money comes from is this a
 
01:09:31.390 --> 01:09:31.400 align:start position:0%
state appropriation or federal money or
 
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
both it's state money from my knowledge
 
01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you yes
 
01:09:41.669 --> 01:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
represent well if it's Federal
 
01:09:45.309 --> 01:09:45.319 align:start position:0%
money it's state state money okay that
 
01:09:49.309 --> 01:09:49.319 align:start position:0%
uh that do changes my question okay if
 
01:09:52.349 --> 01:09:52.359 align:start position:0%
it's state money and it becomes non-aps
 
01:09:54.149 --> 01:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
that would mean that there would
 
01:09:56.310 --> 01:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
essentially be an increase each year in
 
01:09:58.750 --> 01:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
in the budget because or budget
 
01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
expenditures because instead of having a
 
01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
pool of resources here and then just
 
01:10:06.390 --> 01:10:06.400 align:start position:0%
fill in what it else is necessary to
 
01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
bring up the expense costs to the level
 
01:10:17.070 --> 01:10:17.080 align:start position:0%
needed we would be funding the entire
 
01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:21.080 align:start position:0%
thing over again is that correct I'm I'm
 
01:10:22.510 --> 01:10:22.520 align:start position:0%
not sure I understand are you saying
 
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
that if there's like residual ual funds
 
01:10:27.189 --> 01:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
from year to year that we wouldn't we
 
01:10:30.990 --> 01:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:33.970 --> 01:10:33.980 align:start position:0%
explain yeah currently it's
 
01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:35.550 align:start position:0%
explain yeah currently it's
[Music]

01:10:35.550 --> 01:10:35.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:10:39.149 --> 01:10:39.159 align:start position:0%
non-aps you're changing it to lapsing so
 
01:10:40.270 --> 01:10:40.280 align:start position:0%
if it's
 
01:10:43.149 --> 01:10:43.159 align:start position:0%
lapsing the money the the third year
 
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
into the operation the money would go
 
01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
back to the general fund mhm and then
 
01:10:51.990 --> 01:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
the entire program would have to be
 
01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
refunded from zero
 
01:10:57.669 --> 01:10:57.679 align:start position:0%
each year instead of being able to draw
 
01:11:02.350 --> 01:11:02.360 align:start position:0%
on a reserve of un unexpended funds so
 
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
there would be a gap of time where there
 
01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
was no funds available is that correct I
 
01:11:09.550 --> 01:11:09.560 align:start position:0%
see what you're saying I mean I think
 
01:11:12.430 --> 01:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
that the Gap I don't know that the Gap
 
01:11:14.189 --> 01:11:14.199 align:start position:0%
would exist because it would align with
 
01:11:18.430 --> 01:11:18.440 align:start position:0%
our budgetary process um and if you know
 
01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
the money is lapsing back into the
 
01:11:21.870 --> 01:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
general funds anyway the money is still
 
01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:28.990 --> 01:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Aly uh yeah uh
 
01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
would would you believe that being on
 
01:11:34.430 --> 01:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds I know having looked
 
01:11:39.310 --> 01:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
into this uh that uh they uh that all of
 
01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
the funds that are funded this way on if
 
01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
the if necessary move to negative
 
01:11:49.310 --> 01:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
positions in the treasury and are paid
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
for once the budget is
 
01:11:54.570 --> 01:11:54.580 align:start position:0%
finished I would believe
 
01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:58.070 align:start position:0%
finished I would believe
[Laughter]

01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:12:01.470 --> 01:12:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
questions I guess I I have just a
 
01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
general question you said there's no
 
01:12:08.629 --> 01:12:08.639 align:start position:0%
problem at the northern border um from
 
01:12:10.990 --> 01:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
what I've read the number of uh
 
01:12:12.590 --> 01:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
potential illegal Crossings have
 
01:12:16.149 --> 01:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
increased three-fold over the past year
 
01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
um at least three-fold um so the there's
 
01:12:21.629 --> 01:12:21.639 align:start position:0%
OB and we know at the southern border we
 
01:12:24.030 --> 01:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
have a huge um
 
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh issue down there so I mean shouldn't
 
01:12:31.030 --> 01:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
I gu I guess my concern or my question
 
01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
is where does you're saying there's no
 
01:12:36.590 --> 01:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
no concern but we're seeing changes
 
01:12:39.390 --> 01:12:39.400 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we be ready to respond in a
 
01:12:43.510 --> 01:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
way where we don't have to um rely on a
 
01:12:46.350 --> 01:12:46.360 align:start position:0%
budgeting process every year um thank
 
01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair for your question um I I
 
01:12:50.990 --> 01:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
would say that the publicly available
 
01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
data relating to Crossings of the
 
01:12:55.510 --> 01:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
Canadian border is largely not New
 
01:12:58.110 --> 01:12:58.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire specific and there has been no
 
01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
data made available to the public um
 
01:13:02.270 --> 01:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
even with multiple right to know
 
01:13:04.510 --> 01:13:04.520 align:start position:0%
requests for this data on the amount of
 
01:13:06.550 --> 01:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
Crossings on specifically the New
 
01:13:08.030 --> 01:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Canadian border which is a
 
01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
very small part of the actual Canadian
 
01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
border um so this isn't really a New
 
01:13:15.790 --> 01:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire problem that we should be our
 
01:13:17.669 --> 01:13:17.679 align:start position:0%
T taxpayers should be taking the burden
 
01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
of this is Vermont's issue this is
 
01:13:23.550 --> 01:13:23.560 align:start position:0%
Maine's issue it's not our issue and I
 
01:13:26.830 --> 01:13:26.840 align:start position:0%
think that um as I said before um part
 
01:13:28.590 --> 01:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
of the reasoning for this uh funding
 
01:13:31.070 --> 01:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
originally was uh cited to be a lack of
 
01:13:33.310 --> 01:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
federal funds and that's going to change
 
01:13:34.990 --> 01:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
from year to year and I think that we
 
01:13:37.070 --> 01:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
should be able to adjust the amount that
 
01:13:40.270 --> 01:13:40.280 align:start position:0%
we put into this program year toe based
 
01:13:43.070 --> 01:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
on those changes or you know by by
 
01:13:46.030 --> 01:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
annually thank you yes representative
 
01:13:48.030 --> 01:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
ORS thank you Mr chair and thanks for
 
01:13:50.229 --> 01:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question so as somebody
 
01:13:53.870 --> 01:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
already said I believe the border
 
01:13:57.030 --> 01:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
crossings last year alone exceeded 10
 
01:14:00.430 --> 01:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
years of border crossings and recently
 
01:14:04.870 --> 01:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
we had a mass murderer found in Rye and
 
01:14:07.390 --> 01:14:07.400 align:start position:0%
knowing that the last group I believe
 
01:14:08.910 --> 01:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
that was caught coming over the Border
 
01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
were Mexicans you don't see a problem on
 
01:14:14.189 --> 01:14:14.199 align:start position:0%
our border from people south of our
 
01:14:16.590 --> 01:14:16.600 align:start position:0%
country um again I would say that that
 
01:14:18.870 --> 01:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
data regarding the 300% increase is not
 
01:14:21.350 --> 01:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire specific data and it's not
 
01:14:23.390 --> 01:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
about specifically crossings from can
 
01:14:25.590 --> 01:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
Canada into New Hampshire so it
 
01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be our funding going to solve
 
01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
other states problems and I would say
 
01:14:32.550 --> 01:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
that um in those situations that you
 
01:14:34.350 --> 01:14:34.360 align:start position:0%
named the border patrol did their job
 
01:14:36.590 --> 01:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
because those people were apprehended um
 
01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
without this program in
 
01:14:43.030 --> 01:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
existence follow up so I didn't mention
 
01:14:45.430 --> 01:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
anything about a 300% increase I said
 
01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
over the years we've exceeded 10 years
 
01:14:52.830 --> 01:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
growth however it is our problem if we
 
01:14:56.070 --> 01:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
have me Mexicans Brazilians whoever
 
01:14:57.750 --> 01:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter who they are coming over
 
01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
our border why why is our border why is
 
01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
it Vermont's problem and Maine's problem
 
01:15:05.229 --> 01:15:05.239 align:start position:0%
but not our problem if we have these
 
01:15:07.870 --> 01:15:07.880 align:start position:0%
people including a mass murder coming
 
01:15:11.390 --> 01:15:11.400 align:start position:0%
into our country I mean it's I don't
 
01:15:14.110 --> 01:15:14.120 align:start position:0%
understand your position I'm not aware
 
01:15:17.070 --> 01:15:17.080 align:start position:0%
of any other program we fund to deal
 
01:15:19.149 --> 01:15:19.159 align:start position:0%
with problems that happen in other
 
01:15:22.629 --> 01:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
states it's it's not another followup
 
01:15:23.830 --> 01:15:23.840 align:start position:0%
it's not a
 
01:15:25.470 --> 01:15:25.480 align:start position:0%
a different State's it's our problem
 
01:15:28.229 --> 01:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
they're coming over our
 
01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
border we'll um we can discuss this in a
 
01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
work session thank you um did you have a
 
01:15:35.149 --> 01:15:35.159 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
ellerie uh yes um what two three weeks
 
01:15:43.270 --> 01:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
ago the national Hospitality Association
 
01:15:45.189 --> 01:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
put on a program right here in conquer
 
01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
regarding uh human trafficking and its
 
01:15:51.310 --> 01:15:51.320 align:start position:0%
effect um are you aware that during that
 
01:15:53.350 --> 01:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
presentation they indicated that the
 
01:15:55.149 --> 01:15:55.159 align:start position:0%
number of people coming across the New
 
01:15:56.750 --> 01:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire border engaged in human
 
01:15:59.310 --> 01:15:59.320 align:start position:0%
trafficking had increased something like
 
01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
threefold and the number of arrests had
 
01:16:04.709 --> 01:16:04.719 align:start position:0%
decreased due to lack of
 
01:16:06.990 --> 01:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement are you aware of that
 
01:16:08.550 --> 01:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
information from the national
 
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
Hospitality Association I was not pres
 
01:16:13.030 --> 01:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
at that event so I wasn't aware of that
 
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
information thank
 
01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
you represent fellows uh thank you uh
 
01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
this is technical so I'm not sure if you
 
01:16:23.310 --> 01:16:23.320 align:start position:0%
know the answer to it I'm wondering if
 
01:16:27.270 --> 01:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
if this is is this a dedicated fund now
 
01:16:30.750 --> 01:16:30.760 align:start position:0%
is if it's a dedicated fund then and
 
01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to essentially move it to be
 
01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
pretty much the same as like any any
 
01:16:39.390 --> 01:16:39.400 align:start position:0%
regular Fund in the budget if it needs
 
01:16:43.149 --> 01:16:43.159 align:start position:0%
to be in a different place in the
 
01:16:45.870 --> 01:16:45.880 align:start position:0%
rsas I'm not 100% sure but I believe it
 
01:16:48.990 --> 01:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
is a dedicated fund maybe I'm sure
 
01:16:50.629 --> 01:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
somebody else will probably know the
 
01:16:52.629 --> 01:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
answer to that thank you I mean the
 
01:16:55.229 --> 01:16:55.239 align:start position:0%
thing we do know is it's non-lps at the
 
01:16:55.239 --> 01:16:57.510 align:start position:0%
thing we do know is it's non-lps at the
present

01:16:57.510 --> 01:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
present
 
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
time does that mean it's in would well
 
01:17:04.669 --> 01:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
my question do we need to move it
 
01:17:07.510 --> 01:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
because it's non-aps or is the r can it
 
01:17:09.550 --> 01:17:09.560 align:start position:0%
be in the same
 
01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:20.350 --> 01:17:20.360 align:start position:0%
that the the dedicated funds are spread
 
01:17:23.310 --> 01:17:23.320 align:start position:0%
all over the rsas they only appear
 
01:17:24.910 --> 01:17:24.920 align:start position:0%
together in
 
01:17:28.189 --> 01:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
612 and I don't know whether this one is
 
01:17:31.070 --> 01:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
612 or not we haven't done safety for a
 
01:17:33.310 --> 01:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
while all right all right thank you
 
01:17:35.229 --> 01:17:35.239 align:start position:0%

hearing from any state local or County
 
01:17:49.310 --> 01:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
officials today on this bill um I don't
 
01:17:51.390 --> 01:17:51.400 align:start position:0%
know I have uh three pin cards here
 
01:17:54.910 --> 01:17:54.920 align:start position:0%
we'll see um
 
01:17:57.990 --> 01:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:00.590 --> 01:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
have if we need to we can hear you know
 
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
during a work session as well represent
 
01:18:07.550 --> 01:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
Aly yes uh did you know that Senator
 
01:18:10.830 --> 01:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
Shaheen has asked for the information
 
01:18:12.910 --> 01:18:12.920 align:start position:0%
the breakdown of the information it's
 
01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:13.790 align:start position:0%
the breakdown of the information it's
New

01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
New
 
01:18:18.990 --> 01:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
York Vermont New Hampshire Maine on and
 
01:18:21.510 --> 01:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
it's all in one group and she has asked
 
01:18:24.669 --> 01:18:24.679 align:start position:0%
for it I think five times now and has
 
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
never gotten an answer so I doubt very
 
01:18:30.270 --> 01:18:30.280 align:start position:0%
much that New Hampshire Hospitality was
 
01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
using anything except the state the
 
01:18:38.270 --> 01:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
national the four state statistic is
 
01:18:40.189 --> 01:18:40.199 align:start position:0%

01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
today I sent you an email from our group
 
01:19:56.790 --> 01:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
The New Hampshire immigrants rights
 
01:19:59.669 --> 01:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
Network um early evening uh yesterday
 
01:20:02.229 --> 01:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
that that uh explains in detail some of
 
01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
the questions folks have had um and and
 
01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:07.480 align:start position:0%
we support
 
01:20:10.910 --> 01:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
uh uh changing the funding from non-aps
 
01:20:13.510 --> 01:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
to an evidencebased
 
01:20:16.870 --> 01:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
um program that goes through the um
 
01:20:20.590 --> 01:20:20.600 align:start position:0%
normal budgetary process um it's our
 
01:20:23.550 --> 01:20:23.560 align:start position:0%
opinion that this this uh program the
 
01:20:27.149 --> 01:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
um border Alliance is not based on any
 
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
um data that would support the
 
01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
expenditure of $1.4 million on a yearly
 
01:20:34.390 --> 01:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
basis we've communicated with the
 
01:20:36.149 --> 01:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety about this and had
 
01:20:38.790 --> 01:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
had very productive conversations about
 
01:20:42.510 --> 01:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
their plans but we still feel that um
 
01:20:46.550 --> 01:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
there's uh no real basis for this as as
 
01:20:48.910 --> 01:20:48.920 align:start position:0%
um representative Murray said this our
 
01:20:52.310 --> 01:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
border is 53 miles we're part of a um a
 
01:20:54.470 --> 01:20:54.480 align:start position:0%
sector called the Swanton sector and
 
01:20:57.550 --> 01:20:57.560 align:start position:0%
it's true that in Vermont and um New
 
01:20:59.189 --> 01:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
York State the part of New York state
 
01:21:02.189 --> 01:21:02.199 align:start position:0%
that is um uh part of the Swan sector
 
01:21:05.310 --> 01:21:05.320 align:start position:0%
there have been great increases um we've
 
01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
had a difficulty getting any data about
 
01:21:11.310 --> 01:21:11.320 align:start position:0%
the actual Crossings into to New
 
01:21:12.830 --> 01:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but one of our other
 
01:21:16.430 --> 01:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
colleagues today has just gotten um the
 
01:21:19.350 --> 01:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
actual data and and and he will also uh
 
01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
be testifying I believe he's put in a
 
01:21:24.669 --> 01:21:24.679 align:start position:0%
card now uh be on that from the um
 
01:21:28.910 --> 01:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
ACLU um so the other thing is that there
 
01:21:32.310 --> 01:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
are uh there's a a strong presence of
 
01:21:35.350 --> 01:21:35.360 align:start position:0%
federal border enforcement agents um in
 
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
the North country and the other uh
 
01:21:40.950 --> 01:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
factor that we really wanted the the
 
01:21:43.709 --> 01:21:43.719 align:start position:0%
committee to know is that New Hampshire
 
01:21:47.229 --> 01:21:47.239 align:start position:0%
already receives federal funds for many
 
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
aspects of of security and
 
01:21:52.669 --> 01:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
anti-terrorism and border security
 
01:21:55.030 --> 01:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
through the stone garden program New
 
01:21:56.910 --> 01:21:56.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's been receiving operation
 
01:22:00.030 --> 01:22:00.040 align:start position:0%
stone garden federal funds um for over
 
01:22:03.910 --> 01:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
10 years um at Le at least since uh
 
01:22:07.669 --> 01:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
2011 and uh the last funding Grant uh
 
01:22:07.679 --> 01:22:08.830 align:start position:0%
2011 and uh the last funding Grant uh
was

01:22:08.830 --> 01:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:22:12.990 --> 01:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
$200,000 those are based on applications
 
01:22:15.709 --> 01:22:15.719 align:start position:0%
where you have to establish why you need
 
01:22:18.390 --> 01:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
the money um and so those are
 
01:22:20.470 --> 01:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
evidence-based and that's what the the
 
01:22:22.350 --> 01:22:22.360 align:start position:0%
feds decided to give New Hampshire to
 
01:22:24.669 --> 01:22:24.679 align:start position:0%
work with the federal agents at the
 
01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
border to help secure the Border but
 
01:22:29.189 --> 01:22:29.199 align:start position:0%
fundamentally we believe that this is a
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
federal issue that the federal programs
 
01:22:34.510 --> 01:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
are staffed and are uh supported and I
 
01:22:36.830 --> 01:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
think that's uh really what our message
 
01:22:39.470 --> 01:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
is today and Grace uh will add some
 
01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:40.830 align:start position:0%
is today and Grace uh will add some
other

01:22:40.830 --> 01:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:22:43.709 --> 01:22:43.719 align:start position:0%
details so thank you to the committee um
 
01:22:45.669 --> 01:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to add was in addition to
 
01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
being a part of um as of this Coalition
 
01:22:52.270 --> 01:22:52.280 align:start position:0%
um that is focused on um really putting
 
01:22:54.910 --> 01:22:54.920 align:start position:0%
some guard rails on on this on this
 
01:22:57.709 --> 01:22:57.719 align:start position:0%
particular program our organization has
 
01:22:59.870 --> 01:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
also worked very closely during the
 
01:23:01.790 --> 01:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
budget cycle as part of what we call the
 
01:23:03.870 --> 01:23:03.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire people's budget campaign
 
01:23:06.189 --> 01:23:06.199 align:start position:0%
in order to ensure that public dollars
 
01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
are going into programs that are most
 
01:23:10.790 --> 01:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
needed for New Hampshire people and so
 
01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
last year when this um when this line
 
01:23:16.070 --> 01:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
item was included in the budget um we
 
01:23:17.870 --> 01:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
were very disheartened because again as
 
01:23:19.270 --> 01:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
my colleague has said there was very
 
01:23:21.189 --> 01:23:21.199 align:start position:0%
little data to support it and instead
 
01:23:23.189 --> 01:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of rhetoric
 
01:23:26.390 --> 01:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
um that really was uh focused on
 
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
immigrant communities and really this
 
01:23:31.070 --> 01:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
idea that immigrant communities are
 
01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
harmful are others are sort of these
 
01:23:35.149 --> 01:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
alien species that are coming to invade
 
01:23:37.470 --> 01:23:37.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and with the lack of data
 
01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
what we were seeing was an increase in
 
01:23:42.629 --> 01:23:42.639 align:start position:0%
dis in the sense of not belonging of
 
01:23:44.950 --> 01:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
discomfort um and really pitting New
 
01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire communities against one
 
01:23:48.870 --> 01:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
another and so as our Coalition has been
 
01:23:50.750 --> 01:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
able to do we have been able to visit
 
01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
the North Country to speak to directly
 
01:23:54.350 --> 01:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
with North Country residents to
 
01:23:56.070 --> 01:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
understand more deeply what is actually
 
01:23:58.390 --> 01:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
needed for folks who are living um in
 
01:24:00.430 --> 01:24:00.440 align:start position:0%
the topmost half of our state and what
 
01:24:02.709 --> 01:24:02.719 align:start position:0%
was clear is that people needed access
 
01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
to broadband they needed more in
 
01:24:07.550 --> 01:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
Investments and resources into mental
 
01:24:09.910 --> 01:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
health and Recovery treatment services
 
01:24:12.510 --> 01:24:12.520 align:start position:0%
and instead what our legislature decided
 
01:24:15.270 --> 01:24:15.280 align:start position:0%
to do was to increase the fund to put
 
01:24:17.629 --> 01:24:17.639 align:start position:0%
funding towards a program that was not
 
01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
asked for that was based on faulty data
 
01:24:22.149 --> 01:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
and that was not being responsive to
 
01:24:23.830 --> 01:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
what New Hampshire communities are were
 
01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
asking for and are actually in need of
 
01:24:28.030 --> 01:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
and so there have been there were
 
01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
wonderful things that were passed in the
 
01:24:31.910 --> 01:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
last year's budget that we were very
 
01:24:33.870 --> 01:24:33.880 align:start position:0%
proud to see and that would certainly do
 
01:24:35.830 --> 01:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
a do a lot and go a long way into
 
01:24:37.950 --> 01:24:37.960 align:start position:0%
helping um New Hampshire communities in
 
01:24:40.510 --> 01:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
order to live and Thrive and work and go
 
01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
to school here in ways that build up
 
01:24:45.189 --> 01:24:45.199 align:start position:0%
their lives and so there is very what we
 
01:24:46.669 --> 01:24:46.679 align:start position:0%
have seen in the work that we've done is
 
01:24:48.590 --> 01:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
that there are no there are very few if
 
01:24:51.070 --> 01:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
any other programs that are both
 
01:24:53.390 --> 01:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
initially started in funded without any
 
01:24:55.990 --> 01:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
sort of guardrail um any sort of uh
 
01:25:00.590 --> 01:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
expectation to assess the um the the uh
 
01:25:03.350 --> 01:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
how well the program is running before
 
01:25:06.270 --> 01:25:06.280 align:start position:0%
simply just automatically renewing those
 
01:25:08.910 --> 01:25:08.920 align:start position:0%
funds every year and so this legislation
 
01:25:12.629 --> 01:25:12.639 align:start position:0%
is an attempt to put some clear um
 
01:25:14.629 --> 01:25:14.639 align:start position:0%
parameters around is this program
 
01:25:16.189 --> 01:25:16.199 align:start position:0%
working because we know it wasn't needed
 
01:25:18.310 --> 01:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
in the first place so is this program
 
01:25:20.030 --> 01:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
even needed and I think it's really
 
01:25:22.669 --> 01:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
important in order for this for this
 
01:25:25.229 --> 01:25:25.239 align:start position:0%
legislature to be good stewards of New
 
01:25:27.550 --> 01:25:27.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Public money of taxpayer
 
01:25:30.590 --> 01:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
dollars to ensure that we are putting
 
01:25:33.189 --> 01:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
into place uh true parameters that says
 
01:25:35.109 --> 01:25:35.119 align:start position:0%
okay if we are going to allocate this
 
01:25:37.550 --> 01:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
much money we are going to do so in a
 
01:25:39.709 --> 01:25:39.719 align:start position:0%
way that does not automatically renew it
 
01:25:41.550 --> 01:25:41.560 align:start position:0%
and we know already that it is clear
 
01:25:43.830 --> 01:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
that this money could be used elsewhere
 
01:25:45.270 --> 01:25:45.280 align:start position:0%
where people really truly need it
 
01:25:47.950 --> 01:25:47.960 align:start position:0%
especially our North Country
 
01:25:50.310 --> 01:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
residents happy to take
 
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:59.550 --> 01:25:59.560 align:start position:0%
PL this country is built from immigrants
 
01:26:02.270 --> 01:26:02.280 align:start position:0%
my grandparents came over but they came
 
01:26:05.109 --> 01:26:05.119 align:start position:0%
over following law you see no difference
 
01:26:07.030 --> 01:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
between people coming over following law
 
01:26:09.189 --> 01:26:09.199 align:start position:0%
and just coming over with with without
 
01:26:14.310 --> 01:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
any uh any any uh any process of law so
 
01:26:16.310 --> 01:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
what I want to say I'm also an immigrant
 
01:26:18.350 --> 01:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
representative I came here as a toddler
 
01:26:21.550 --> 01:26:21.560 align:start position:0%
on a plane and so I to your point also
 
01:26:23.830 --> 01:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
came in under what is considered like
 
01:26:26.270 --> 01:26:26.280 align:start position:0%
what I got into line right but as an
 
01:26:27.870 --> 01:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
advocate for immigration what I have
 
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
seen over and over and over again and
 
01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
have directly experience myself because
 
01:26:33.950 --> 01:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
even though I came here technically
 
01:26:36.510 --> 01:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
legally I became undocumented and lived
 
01:26:38.709 --> 01:26:38.719 align:start position:0%
undocumented for many many years not
 
01:26:41.870 --> 01:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
because I did anything wrong not because
 
01:26:44.350 --> 01:26:44.360 align:start position:0%
I somehow flouted the law but because
 
01:26:48.270 --> 01:26:48.280 align:start position:0%
there was no process for me to actually
 
01:26:50.629 --> 01:26:50.639 align:start position:0%
naturalize and so that is the case for
 
01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
too many people for those those of us
 
01:26:54.590 --> 01:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
who are immersed in the immigration
 
01:26:57.109 --> 01:26:57.119 align:start position:0%
system we know too well that there are
 
01:26:59.550 --> 01:26:59.560 align:start position:0%
deep fault lines in our system there are
 
01:27:02.709 --> 01:27:02.719 align:start position:0%
deep gaps that need to be um that need
 
01:27:05.070 --> 01:27:05.080 align:start position:0%
to be addressed and the fact is that
 
01:27:07.149 --> 01:27:07.159 align:start position:0%
people are coming here in part because
 
01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
they are looking for Safety and Security
 
01:27:12.149 --> 01:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
and is our responsibility as a leader as
 
01:27:14.270 --> 01:27:14.280 align:start position:0%
a global leader to create a system that
 
01:27:15.870 --> 01:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
actually allows people to come here
 
01:27:18.430 --> 01:27:18.440 align:start position:0%
legally but what we have is a system
 
01:27:20.109 --> 01:27:20.119 align:start position:0%
that does not do that and instead
 
01:27:22.390 --> 01:27:22.400 align:start position:0%
penalizes and punishes people for
 
01:27:26.350 --> 01:27:26.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:30.510 --> 01:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
Security may I just also refocus us on
 
01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
this particular issue which is funding
 
01:27:34.950 --> 01:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
for a program for which there is no
 
01:27:37.470 --> 01:27:37.480 align:start position:0%
evidence it's needed and to ask the
 
01:27:40.229 --> 01:27:40.239 align:start position:0%
legislature to just require if this
 
01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:42.719 align:start position:0%
program is supportable that we should
 
01:27:47.590 --> 01:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
use State taxpayer money for immigration
 
01:27:51.510 --> 01:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
type um issues that it be supported by
 
01:27:54.030 --> 01:27:54.040 align:start position:0%
evidence so that's what this is about
 
01:27:55.669 --> 01:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
and not the larger discussion about
 
01:27:58.109 --> 01:27:58.119 align:start position:0%
immigration policy and so well said
 
01:28:01.310 --> 01:28:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:05.149 --> 01:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
you all right thank you seeing no other
 
01:28:07.070 --> 01:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
questions thank
 
01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:09.750 align:start position:0%
questions thank
you

01:28:09.750 --> 01:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:11.350 align:start position:0%
you
me

01:28:11.350 --> 01:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:29.790 align:start position:0%
 
Binet

01:28:29.790 --> 01:28:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:31.030 --> 01:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee I'm
 
01:28:37.910 --> 01:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:40.270 --> 01:28:40.280 align:start position:0%
here uh so my name is yel bisonet I'm
 
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
the legal director at the ACLU um of New
 
01:28:46.030 --> 01:28:46.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and uh we are in support of
 
01:28:48.229 --> 01:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
this bill because we think this program
 
01:28:51.629 --> 01:28:51.639 align:start position:0%
is unsupported and unnecessary and I
 
01:28:51.639 --> 01:28:52.750 align:start position:0%
is unsupported and unnecessary and I
think

01:28:52.750 --> 01:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:28:54.390 --> 01:28:54.400 align:start position:0%
my general message to this committee
 
01:28:56.709 --> 01:28:56.719 align:start position:0%
today is regardless of where you stand
 
01:28:59.270 --> 01:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
on immigration or the Border I would
 
01:29:01.149 --> 01:29:01.159 align:start position:0%
just like you to think from a fiscal
 
01:29:04.510 --> 01:29:04.520 align:start position:0%
perspective is this uh juice worth the
 
01:29:07.350 --> 01:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
squeeze so to speak is this actually a
 
01:29:10.070 --> 01:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
worthwhile use of what is a significant
 
01:29:13.109 --> 01:29:13.119 align:start position:0%
amount of money $1.4 million may not
 
01:29:14.750 --> 01:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
seem like that in the grand scheme of
 
01:29:15.990 --> 01:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
things when you look at the overall
 
01:29:17.430 --> 01:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
state budget but when you think about
 
01:29:20.109 --> 01:29:20.119 align:start position:0%
what this state could do with $1.4
 
01:29:22.270 --> 01:29:22.280 align:start position:0%
million whether it's funding teachers
 
01:29:23.790 --> 01:29:23.800 align:start position:0%
whether it's funding Broadband whether
 
01:29:27.149 --> 01:29:27.159 align:start position:0%
it's funding affordable housing I would
 
01:29:29.950 --> 01:29:29.960 align:start position:0%
submit that there is so many better ways
 
01:29:32.189 --> 01:29:32.199 align:start position:0%
to use this money and that's because I
 
01:29:34.830 --> 01:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
don't think there is any data to support
 
01:29:36.990 --> 01:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
that this is necessary and in fact I
 
01:29:39.709 --> 01:29:39.719 align:start position:0%
think the data now shows that this is
 
01:29:43.470 --> 01:29:43.480 align:start position:0%
completely unnecessary why do I say that
 
01:29:46.390 --> 01:29:46.400 align:start position:0%
um ever since this program was put
 
01:29:50.830 --> 01:29:50.840 align:start position:0%
forward um by by various um individuals
 
01:29:52.790 --> 01:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
you know we've been trying to get data
 
01:29:55.390 --> 01:29:55.400 align:start position:0%
right you know is this a New Hampshire
 
01:29:57.390 --> 01:29:57.400 align:start position:0%
issue um because the data that we had
 
01:29:59.990 --> 01:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
been given throughout is that you know
 
01:30:01.709 --> 01:30:01.719 align:start position:0%
SWAT and sector there are issues there
 
01:30:03.229 --> 01:30:03.239 align:start position:0%
are significant increases in
 
01:30:05.510 --> 01:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
apprehensions and encounters within the
 
01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
sector may be true but that SWAT and
 
01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
sector is a big territory that doesn't
 
01:30:13.189 --> 01:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
just include New Hampshire which is 58
 
01:30:16.629 --> 01:30:16.639 align:start position:0%
miles but it in total spans over 250
 
01:30:19.709 --> 01:30:19.719 align:start position:0%
miles so the bulk of that territory
 
01:30:22.229 --> 01:30:22.239 align:start position:0%
excuse me actually principally includes
 
01:30:24.750 --> 01:30:24.760 align:start position:0%
New York and Vermont so I think getting
 
01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
granular here is actually like really
 
01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
important you know are these
 
01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
apprehensions occurring through channels
 
01:30:33.790 --> 01:30:33.800 align:start position:0%
principally that exist in new uh New
 
01:30:36.830 --> 01:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
York or Vermont or is this actually a
 
01:30:39.510 --> 01:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire problem and we tried to
 
01:30:41.390 --> 01:30:41.400 align:start position:0%
get that data we could not get that data
 
01:30:43.669 --> 01:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
from the state because the state did not
 
01:30:45.470 --> 01:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
have it even though they were advancing
 
01:30:48.870 --> 01:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
a need for this proposal then we asked
 
01:30:50.270 --> 01:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
border patrol you know all right you
 
01:30:52.390 --> 01:30:52.400 align:start position:0%
have the data right can you you provided
 
01:30:54.229 --> 01:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
because we want to know whether this is
 
01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:55.960 align:start position:0%
a good use of resources because we're
 
01:30:57.870 --> 01:30:57.880 align:start position:0%
all trying to be good stewards right of
 
01:31:00.790 --> 01:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
our taxpayers money and border patrol
 
01:31:02.950 --> 01:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
would not produce it um we filed the
 
01:31:05.109 --> 01:31:05.119 align:start position:0%
lawsuit seeking that information where
 
01:31:08.590 --> 01:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
we were asking for disaggregated M uh
 
01:31:10.229 --> 01:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
apprehension data so you you're giving
 
01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
us SWAT and sector data that's great but
 
01:31:13.990 --> 01:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
we think it's important that it's broken
 
01:31:15.430 --> 01:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
down so we can all figure out whether
 
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
this is really an issue here that's
 
01:31:20.229 --> 01:31:20.239 align:start position:0%
worth worthwhile use of funds um I have
 
01:31:21.830 --> 01:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
like breaking news for the committee
 
01:31:23.510 --> 01:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
because I literally just got that data
 
01:31:27.550 --> 01:31:27.560 align:start position:0%
this morning and um wanted to uh present
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
it to the committee um because we have
 
01:31:33.070 --> 01:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
resolved that foyil lawsuit we had asked
 
01:31:35.109 --> 01:31:35.119 align:start position:0%
that the data be produced by the end of
 
01:31:38.590 --> 01:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
January um and uh they agreed to do that
 
01:31:40.510 --> 01:31:40.520 align:start position:0%
and it was produced this morning and the
 
01:31:42.510 --> 01:31:42.520 align:start position:0%
reason why I wanted it to be produced by
 
01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
the end of this month is so we could
 
01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
provide this information to this
 
01:31:47.629 --> 01:31:47.639 align:start position:0%
committee so this committee could assess
 
01:31:50.629 --> 01:31:50.639 align:start position:0%
independently for itself whether this is
 
01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
a good investment or not so I want to
 
01:31:55.109 --> 01:31:55.119 align:start position:0%
tell you what the data
 
01:31:59.550 --> 01:31:59.560 align:start position:0%
says for um a 15-month
 
01:32:02.870 --> 01:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
period And this is
 
01:32:06.910 --> 01:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
between I'm sorry could we ask this day
 
01:32:11.390 --> 01:32:11.400 align:start position:0%
to be provided in the original sorts yes
 
01:32:13.790 --> 01:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
I I I actually plan on doing that I
 
01:32:15.550 --> 01:32:15.560 align:start position:0%
haven't had an opportunity yet to write
 
01:32:17.430 --> 01:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
it up for the committee uh we received
 
01:32:20.709 --> 01:32:20.719 align:start position:0%
an email from uh Council uh for border
 
01:32:22.149 --> 01:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
patrol and I'm going to convey that
 
01:32:23.870 --> 01:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
directly to the committee with along
 
01:32:25.510 --> 01:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
with some written testimony from the
 
01:32:27.990 --> 01:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
ACLU uh hopefully by the end of
 
01:32:31.189 --> 01:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
today um so the data that was received
 
01:32:34.830 --> 01:32:34.840 align:start position:0%
is that from October 2022 to December
 
01:32:38.790 --> 01:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
2023 uh there were uh 21 apprehensions
 
01:32:42.790 --> 01:32:42.800 align:start position:0%
and encounters um th that 21 figure
 
01:32:46.149 --> 01:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
actually principally uh concern 16 of
 
01:32:49.910 --> 01:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
those 21 actually only implicated uh two
 
01:32:51.590 --> 01:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
kind of separate incidents that occurred
 
01:32:54.750 --> 01:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
Ur in January uh I'm sorry uh June and
 
01:32:58.109 --> 01:32:58.119 align:start position:0%
September 2023 so we have 21
 
01:33:00.950 --> 01:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
apprehensions for this 15 month window
 
01:33:02.830 --> 01:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
let's break that down even further so
 
01:33:05.790 --> 01:33:05.800 align:start position:0%
when this program was promulgated back
 
01:33:08.830 --> 01:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
in early 2023 you know they were there
 
01:33:11.229 --> 01:33:11.239 align:start position:0%
was um advocacy done to say this is
 
01:33:12.830 --> 01:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
necessary because Swan and sector
 
01:33:15.709 --> 01:33:15.719 align:start position:0%
increases have have been Monumental
 
01:33:18.430 --> 01:33:18.440 align:start position:0%
during that time and that might be true
 
01:33:20.229 --> 01:33:20.239 align:start position:0%
but during that same four-month time
 
01:33:22.550 --> 01:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
frame there was only one apprehension in
 
01:33:25.189 --> 01:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so this was a New York
 
01:33:28.109 --> 01:33:28.119 align:start position:0%
Vermont issue it was never a New
 
01:33:30.629 --> 01:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire issue based on the data that
 
01:33:34.109 --> 01:33:34.119 align:start position:0%
has been produced also border patrol
 
01:33:36.629 --> 01:33:36.639 align:start position:0%
advocated back in January 2023 that
 
01:33:37.669 --> 01:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
there were
 
01:33:40.470 --> 01:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
367 SWAT and sector apprehensions in
 
01:33:43.109 --> 01:33:43.119 align:start position:0%
January 2023 which they which was
 
01:33:44.990 --> 01:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
asserted by them to be a significant
 
01:33:46.990 --> 01:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
increase again January there was only
 
01:33:50.109 --> 01:33:50.119 align:start position:0%
one in New Hampshire which represents.
 
01:33:53.790 --> 01:33:53.800 align:start position:0%
27% of the apprehension so I I just you
 
01:33:57.229 --> 01:33:57.239 align:start position:0%
know want to be uh and also I would
 
01:33:59.910 --> 01:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
submit to that from October 2022 to
 
01:34:01.709 --> 01:34:01.719 align:start position:0%
December 22 there were also no
 
01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
apprehensions in New Hampshire which was
 
01:34:05.310 --> 01:34:05.320 align:start position:0%
another three-month window that was
 
01:34:09.189 --> 01:34:09.199 align:start position:0%
being um uh ad asserted that there was a
 
01:34:11.550 --> 01:34:11.560 align:start position:0%
significant increase uh in swat and
 
01:34:13.030 --> 01:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
sector apprehension so I think all of
 
01:34:15.870 --> 01:34:15.880 align:start position:0%
this really demonstrates that this is
 
01:34:20.390 --> 01:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
not a New Hampshire issue um and and I
 
01:34:22.109 --> 01:34:22.119 align:start position:0%
just think this is not a good use of
 
01:34:24.830 --> 01:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
funds now that we have this particular
 
01:34:27.229 --> 01:34:27.239 align:start position:0%
information so I I would really just ask
 
01:34:29.669 --> 01:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
the committee to just evaluate whether
 
01:34:31.910 --> 01:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
really this makes sense in light of this
 
01:34:33.709 --> 01:34:33.719 align:start position:0%
data the the apprehensions that have
 
01:34:35.950 --> 01:34:35.960 align:start position:0%
occurred those two incidents in 2023
 
01:34:37.830 --> 01:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
those were done by border patrol not
 
01:34:40.030 --> 01:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
local officials I think again is
 
01:34:42.149 --> 01:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
evidence that border patrol is there I
 
01:34:43.390 --> 01:34:43.400 align:start position:0%
think if folks who've traveled around
 
01:34:44.830 --> 01:34:44.840 align:start position:0%
the North Country know that border
 
01:34:46.950 --> 01:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
patrol is there um and that there isn't
 
01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:49.360 align:start position:0%
really a need for this sub substantial
 
01:34:52.030 --> 01:34:52.040 align:start position:0%
amount of funds I would also as well
 
01:34:53.430 --> 01:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
with respect to stone garden that there
 
01:34:57.310 --> 01:34:57.320 align:start position:0%
is already a federal funded program um
 
01:35:00.270 --> 01:35:00.280 align:start position:0%
for uh increased law enforcement um in
 
01:35:02.990 --> 01:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
the North Country um for when you look
 
01:35:05.830 --> 01:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
at uh the state has received
 
01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
$180,000 for fiscal year 2022 also
 
01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
$200,000 for fiscal year uh
 
01:35:15.709 --> 01:35:15.719 align:start position:0%
2023 uh I am also of the understanding
 
01:35:17.149 --> 01:35:17.159 align:start position:0%
that for fiscal year
 
01:35:19.550 --> 01:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
2022 of the
 
01:35:23.189 --> 01:35:23.199 align:start position:0%
$180,000 um that was received $54,000
 
01:35:24.990 --> 01:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
actually went unspent by the state
 
01:35:26.350 --> 01:35:26.360 align:start position:0%
police so if they're not spending all
 
01:35:28.310 --> 01:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
their money under that program I think
 
01:35:29.950 --> 01:35:29.960 align:start position:0%
that does raise some concern as to
 
01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not this separate program
 
01:35:35.470 --> 01:35:35.480 align:start position:0%
using State taxpayer dollars is even
 
01:35:37.590 --> 01:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
necessary so I think that concludes my
 
01:35:39.950 --> 01:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
my testimony um and and I just think the
 
01:35:41.350 --> 01:35:41.360 align:start position:0%
data doesn't support this and I would
 
01:35:43.790 --> 01:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
ask that the committee um a vote odd to
 
01:35:45.910 --> 01:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
pass on this
 
01:35:48.189 --> 01:35:48.199 align:start position:0%
legislation okay thank you um one
 
01:35:49.990 --> 01:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
question I have on your PIN card is you
 
01:35:52.510 --> 01:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
checked off that you opposed the Bill oh
 
01:35:55.109 --> 01:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
I I support it uh that is a mistake on
 
01:35:56.830 --> 01:35:56.840 align:start position:0%
my part my apologies and thank you for
 
01:35:56.840 --> 01:35:59.030 align:start position:0%
my part my apologies and thank you for
that

01:35:59.030 --> 01:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:01.390 --> 01:36:01.400 align:start position:0%
clarification I oppose the program I
 
01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
support the
 
01:36:04.229 --> 01:36:04.239 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you thank you though I
 
01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate that all right I just made
 
01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
that change card um questions yes
 
01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
represent fellows yes could you just
 
01:36:14.270 --> 01:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
explain to me you know what what the
 
01:36:17.709 --> 01:36:17.719 align:start position:0%
definition of like an apprehension which
 
01:36:19.350 --> 01:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
that one I think I kind of understand
 
01:36:24.629 --> 01:36:24.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:26.109 --> 01:36:26.119 align:start position:0%
yeah I you
 
01:36:28.830 --> 01:36:28.840 align:start position:0%
know I think most of the data that we've
 
01:36:31.709 --> 01:36:31.719 align:start position:0%
received probably are arrests or
 
01:36:31.719 --> 01:36:33.350 align:start position:0%
received probably are arrests or
apprehensions

01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
apprehensions
 
01:36:35.629 --> 01:36:35.639 align:start position:0%
um you know I I would have to kind of
 
01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
look actually at the border of Patrol
 
01:36:38.510 --> 01:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
definition of encounters I'm happy to
 
01:36:40.149 --> 01:36:40.159 align:start position:0%
provide that to the committee uh if that
 
01:36:41.390 --> 01:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
would be helpful to the extent that
 
01:36:43.350 --> 01:36:43.360 align:start position:0%
there's a um there's you know a
 
01:36:44.950 --> 01:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
distinction there um I don't have that
 
01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
definition off the top of my head and I
 
01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
apologize but I'll provide that to the
 
01:36:49.870 --> 01:36:49.880 align:start position:0%
committee thank
 
01:36:53.149 --> 01:36:53.159 align:start position:0%
you thank you represent Erie thank you
 
01:36:54.830 --> 01:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
01:36:58.109 --> 01:36:58.119 align:start position:0%
question thank you um one of the things
 
01:37:00.550 --> 01:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
that has been obvious in the in the
 
01:37:03.669 --> 01:37:03.679 align:start position:0%
public point or from public perception
 
01:37:05.470 --> 01:37:05.480 align:start position:0%
sure and having visited the southern
 
01:37:08.070 --> 01:37:08.080 align:start position:0%
border I've seen it in
 
01:37:12.430 --> 01:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
detail um is that when there's a gap
 
01:37:15.870 --> 01:37:15.880 align:start position:0%
someplace the Gap gets filled and used
 
01:37:18.550 --> 01:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
as a point of entry illegal
 
01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
entry um if
 
01:37:24.510 --> 01:37:24.520 align:start position:0%
instead of a concerted effort across the
 
01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
northern border where there has been
 
01:37:32.669 --> 01:37:32.679 align:start position:0%
admittedly an increase in entries
 
01:37:37.229 --> 01:37:37.239 align:start position:0%
including human trafficking including um
 
01:37:39.709 --> 01:37:39.719 align:start position:0%
just plain immigration
 
01:37:44.950 --> 01:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
issues would it not be reasonable to
 
01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
perceive that if an area in Vermont in
 
01:37:51.950 --> 01:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
New York is blocked off off and then the
 
01:37:54.709 --> 01:37:54.719 align:start position:0%
area in Maine is blocked
 
01:37:57.270 --> 01:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
off that the weak point would then
 
01:37:59.669 --> 01:37:59.679 align:start position:0%
become the funnel and taking into
 
01:38:01.270 --> 01:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
consideration the increase in human
 
01:38:03.709 --> 01:38:03.719 align:start position:0%
trafficking and the fact that 93 is
 
01:38:06.830 --> 01:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
considered to be a human traffi Corridor
 
01:38:09.790 --> 01:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
and has been for a long time uh I
 
01:38:11.990 --> 01:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
remember that from my testimony and or
 
01:38:16.350 --> 01:38:16.360 align:start position:0%
from testimony by uh um both the uh uh
 
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
DEA and the border patrol when I was
 
01:38:21.830 --> 01:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
sitting in uh criminal justice MH 20
 
01:38:26.189 --> 01:38:26.199 align:start position:0%
years ago y would that not be
 
01:38:28.070 --> 01:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
accurate I don't think it would be
 
01:38:29.870 --> 01:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable and I just want to explain
 
01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
why I don't all the border is not it's
 
01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
not a one-sized fits-all all border
 
01:38:38.669 --> 01:38:38.679 align:start position:0%
territory is not uh the same um and I
 
01:38:39.910 --> 01:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
think when you look at the southern
 
01:38:41.109 --> 01:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
border and you look at the northern
 
01:38:43.109 --> 01:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
border there are probably I would submit
 
01:38:45.990 --> 01:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
very good reasons in fact why the 58
 
01:38:48.709 --> 01:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
miles of uh of New Hampshire Canadian
 
01:38:51.270 --> 01:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
border are less trafficked and that's
 
01:38:53.589 --> 01:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
because it is unlike certain portions of
 
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
the New York Vermont border incredibly
 
01:38:58.870 --> 01:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
inhospitable for that those types of
 
01:39:01.229 --> 01:39:01.239 align:start position:0%
Crossings I would submit that that is
 
01:39:02.910 --> 01:39:02.920 align:start position:0%
probably one of the reasons why this is
 
01:39:05.870 --> 01:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
less of a New Hampshire problem uh and
 
01:39:07.390 --> 01:39:07.400 align:start position:0%
you know may be an issue for some of the
 
01:39:10.109 --> 01:39:10.119 align:start position:0%
other states in the swan sector but it's
 
01:39:11.790 --> 01:39:11.800 align:start position:0%
not necessarily an issue here I think
 
01:39:14.229 --> 01:39:14.239 align:start position:0%
that's my response number one but also
 
01:39:15.990 --> 01:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
and I think that's born out by the data
 
01:39:19.149 --> 01:39:19.159 align:start position:0%
number two border patrol covers that
 
01:39:20.830 --> 01:39:20.840 align:start position:0%
territory um and I don't think there's
 
01:39:23.189 --> 01:39:23.199 align:start position:0%
any evidence to think that they you know
 
01:39:26.229 --> 01:39:26.239 align:start position:0%
have um you know uh have failed in their
 
01:39:27.990 --> 01:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
duties and in fact the apprehensions
 
01:39:29.830 --> 01:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
that we have are apprehensions Again by
 
01:39:32.589 --> 01:39:32.599 align:start position:0%
border patrol so uh to me this is all
 
01:39:34.990 --> 01:39:35.000 align:start position:0%
just a numbers situation is there an
 
01:39:37.790 --> 01:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
actual problem in New Hampshire and I
 
01:39:39.790 --> 01:39:39.800 align:start position:0%
just don't see it I think there have
 
01:39:41.790 --> 01:39:41.800 align:start position:0%
been a lot of assumptions made based on
 
01:39:43.550 --> 01:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
other portions of the swaton sector but
 
01:39:46.310 --> 01:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
there are real reasons to think that you
 
01:39:48.109 --> 01:39:48.119 align:start position:0%
know this is different because portions
 
01:39:50.070 --> 01:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
of the Border are different for various
 
01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:55.669 align:start position:0%
of the Border are different for various
reasons

01:39:55.669 --> 01:39:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:57.589 --> 01:39:57.599 align:start position:0%
yes represent
 
01:39:59.709 --> 01:39:59.719 align:start position:0%
Bolton so I think the most compelling
 
01:40:01.589 --> 01:40:01.599 align:start position:0%
thing that oh thank you Mr chair U the
 
01:40:03.109 --> 01:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
most compelling thing that um I think
 
01:40:07.149 --> 01:40:07.159 align:start position:0%
you indicated was 54,000 of the 180,000
 
01:40:10.109 --> 01:40:10.119 align:start position:0%
of the stone garden funds were returned
 
01:40:12.950 --> 01:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
and unspent and I'm just wondering if it
 
01:40:15.550 --> 01:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
hits if those funds are pretty much uh
 
01:40:20.149 --> 01:40:20.159 align:start position:0%
targeted the same enforcement or but the
 
01:40:22.310 --> 01:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
funds that were looking at go through
 
01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:23.669 align:start position:0%
funds that were looking at go through
State

01:40:23.669 --> 01:40:23.679 align:start position:0%
State
 
01:40:26.070 --> 01:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
Police that's a really great point right
 
01:40:27.589 --> 01:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
because I think the program this is a
 
01:40:29.070 --> 01:40:29.080 align:start position:0%
state program that I think is kind of
 
01:40:30.550 --> 01:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
designed to do some of the same same
 
01:40:32.550 --> 01:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
things right that that the federal stone
 
01:40:34.589 --> 01:40:34.599 align:start position:0%
garden program has done the federal
 
01:40:37.229 --> 01:40:37.239 align:start position:0%
stone garden program is a a grant making
 
01:40:39.109 --> 01:40:39.119 align:start position:0%
program with federal funds this is a
 
01:40:41.750 --> 01:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
state Grant making program I think a lot
 
01:40:43.229 --> 01:40:43.239 align:start position:0%
of the recipients are going to be some
 
01:40:44.750 --> 01:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
of the same police departments and I
 
01:40:47.470 --> 01:40:47.480 align:start position:0%
think at least for fiscal year 2022 when
 
01:40:50.750 --> 01:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
you had 30% of the funds unspent you
 
01:40:53.189 --> 01:40:53.199 align:start position:0%
know why do we need more funds from the
 
01:40:55.830 --> 01:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
state um State taxpayers that's my
 
01:40:57.910 --> 01:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
perspective thank
 
01:41:01.790 --> 01:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
you anybody else seeing none thank you
 
01:41:09.070 --> 01:41:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:12.390 --> 01:41:12.400 align:start position:0%
chairman next I have uh
 
01:41:18.910 --> 01:41:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:21.510 --> 01:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
Cardona thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:41:23.149 --> 01:41:23.159 align:start position:0%
committee for hearing my testimony I'm
 
01:41:25.030 --> 01:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
not an expert on the issue I just simply
 
01:41:26.830 --> 01:41:26.840 align:start position:0%
come here as a resident of lonia New
 
01:41:28.750 --> 01:41:28.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I also happen to serve on the
 
01:41:30.390 --> 01:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
indigenous commission here for the State
 
01:41:32.510 --> 01:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire I do not have an
 
01:41:34.229 --> 01:41:34.239 align:start position:0%
official statement from them as we
 
01:41:36.589 --> 01:41:36.599 align:start position:0%
didn't have enough time to meet before
 
01:41:38.149 --> 01:41:38.159 align:start position:0%
you guys were hearing this committee but
 
01:41:40.550 --> 01:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to hear at least
 
01:41:42.750 --> 01:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
from one indigenous person the take on
 
01:41:45.470 --> 01:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
this the state is in dire need for other
 
01:41:47.510 --> 01:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
programs to be fully funded especially
 
01:41:49.270 --> 01:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
like public education where it actually
 
01:41:51.629 --> 01:41:51.639 align:start position:0%
serves our communities and the fact that
 
01:41:53.669 --> 01:41:53.679 align:start position:0%
we're sitting here on whether we want to
 
01:41:56.189 --> 01:41:56.199 align:start position:0%
keep funding programs that don't need
 
01:41:58.270 --> 01:41:58.280 align:start position:0%
the money at the northern border where
 
01:41:59.910 --> 01:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
there is data that backs it up that
 
01:42:01.550 --> 01:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
shows that there is not an issue here in
 
01:42:03.990 --> 01:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire where where
 
01:42:06.990 --> 01:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
we're focusing on a problem if there is
 
01:42:10.109 --> 01:42:10.119 align:start position:0%
any that should be federally um I
 
01:42:11.390 --> 01:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
believe that there are many of you here
 
01:42:13.310 --> 01:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
on this committee that are actually
 
01:42:15.390 --> 01:42:15.400 align:start position:0%
really good people that do understand
 
01:42:17.229 --> 01:42:17.239 align:start position:0%
this issue it's a humanitarian crisis
 
01:42:19.510 --> 01:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
happening in this country not an illegal
 
01:42:22.550 --> 01:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
immigration issue so I hope that um you
 
01:42:24.310 --> 01:42:24.320 align:start position:0%
will put these funds towards the
 
01:42:25.910 --> 01:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
programs that really desperately needed
 
01:42:27.910 --> 01:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
in this state we have a housing crisis
 
01:42:30.149 --> 01:42:30.159 align:start position:0%
in this state we have many issues I live
 
01:42:32.709 --> 01:42:32.719 align:start position:0%
in lonia we have 400 homeless people in
 
01:42:36.430 --> 01:42:36.440 align:start position:0%
our city and part of that was motivated
 
01:42:39.430 --> 01:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
by the fact that Co and what happened to
 
01:42:41.550 --> 01:42:41.560 align:start position:0%
the shelter program that got put in
 
01:42:44.430 --> 01:42:44.440 align:start position:0%
lonia so let's focus on putting those
 
01:42:46.390 --> 01:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
money towards those programs to solve
 
01:42:48.030 --> 01:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
those issues in our community not on
 
01:42:50.990 --> 01:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
further dividing our communities and I I
 
01:42:53.030 --> 01:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
do want to say immigrants are not our
 
01:42:55.270 --> 01:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
problem um I'm originally my family's
 
01:42:57.669 --> 01:42:57.679 align:start position:0%
originally from many parts of the world
 
01:42:59.910 --> 01:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
and I am very proud that I'm an American
 
01:43:01.790 --> 01:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
that I have served my country I was in
 
01:43:03.629 --> 01:43:03.639 align:start position:0%
americor for many years so I would hope
 
01:43:05.149 --> 01:43:05.159 align:start position:0%
that this committee will continue to
 
01:43:06.990 --> 01:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
talk about immigrants in a respectful
 
01:43:08.910 --> 01:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
Manner and what they have contributed
 
01:43:11.030 --> 01:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
whether they came from Ireland Italy
 
01:43:13.550 --> 01:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
Mexico Brazil or whatever country you
 
01:43:15.390 --> 01:43:15.400 align:start position:0%
came from or your families came from
 
01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:17.629 align:start position:0%
came from or your families came from
thank

01:43:17.629 --> 01:43:17.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:23.310 --> 01:43:23.320 align:start position:0%
you question um no questions okay um I
 
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
have no more pin cards is there anyone
 
01:43:27.430 --> 01:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
else who would like to testify on this
 
01:43:28.830 --> 01:43:28.840 align:start position:0%
on this
 
01:43:33.510 --> 01:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
Bill yes if not if not could I ask one
 
01:43:36.510 --> 01:43:36.520 align:start position:0%
question to the sponsor quick
 
01:43:38.830 --> 01:43:38.840 align:start position:0%
one um sure is there anyone else who
 
01:43:41.709 --> 01:43:41.719 align:start position:0%
wants to testify on this
 
01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:50.229 --> 01:43:50.239 align:start position:0%
sure thank you president Murray on there
 
01:43:55.790 --> 01:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
is no no 612 number for this program
 
01:43:57.950 --> 01:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
okay which means it doesn't undergo the
 
01:44:00.629 --> 01:44:00.639 align:start position:0%
regular fiveyear oversight that all the
 
01:44:04.030 --> 01:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
other dedicated funds do and I wonder if
 
01:44:07.750 --> 01:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
you would object to appending um putting
 
01:44:09.870 --> 01:44:09.880 align:start position:0%
it in
 
01:44:12.870 --> 01:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
612 um what would what difference would
 
01:44:16.109 --> 01:44:16.119 align:start position:0%
that make with the legislation on it
 
01:44:19.750 --> 01:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
only makes the difference that um it
 
01:44:22.390 --> 01:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
will be recogn ized as a dedicated fund
 
01:44:25.070 --> 01:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
of the State of New Hampshire and looked
 
01:44:27.709 --> 01:44:27.719 align:start position:0%
at every 5 years by a committee that's
 
01:44:31.510 --> 01:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
trying to see is is this overspending or
 
01:44:33.550 --> 01:44:33.560 align:start position:0%
under spending what it's
 
01:44:37.390 --> 01:44:37.400 align:start position:0%
got is the main criteria prefer the bill
 
01:44:40.270 --> 01:44:40.280 align:start position:0%
in its form now but if that's the um
 
01:44:41.750 --> 01:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
action the committee chooses to take I
 
01:44:45.390 --> 01:44:45.400 align:start position:0%
would support that okay thanks represent
 
01:44:47.830 --> 01:44:47.840 align:start position:0%
fellows um Mr chair I see there's
 
01:44:51.149 --> 01:44:51.159 align:start position:0%
somebody from the state police here
 
01:44:54.070 --> 01:44:54.080 align:start position:0%

um this is RSA 21- p
 
01:45:01.750 --> 01:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
colon7 and I'm wondering if we still
 
01:45:05.070 --> 01:45:05.080 align:start position:0%
have 21
 
01:45:09.910 --> 01:45:09.920 align:start position:0%

interdiction program does does that
 
01:45:19.470 --> 01:45:19.480 align:start position:0%

okay

01:45:46.229 --> 01:45:46.239 align:start position:0%

captain with the state police and uh
 
01:45:56.070 --> 01:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
State Police takes no position on this
 
01:45:58.070 --> 01:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
bill so strictly to answer your question
 
01:46:00.669 --> 01:46:00.679 align:start position:0%
representative um it does appear that 21
 
01:46:05.430 --> 01:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
p68 is still a law in effect and
 
01:46:08.310 --> 01:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
followup do follow do you know if it it
 
01:46:10.790 --> 01:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
it has a report do you know anything
 
01:46:13.870 --> 01:46:13.880 align:start position:0%
about the budget the report or
 
01:46:17.030 --> 01:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
anything I I know hate to spring it on
 
01:46:19.390 --> 01:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
you like that
 
01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:33.629 align:start position:0%

01:46:40.149 --> 01:46:40.159 align:start position:0%
material focus and so I can't answer

that question for you ma'am it would it
 
01:46:43.430 --> 01:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
would appear on the law that that is

still a requirement but um I've not been
 
01:46:48.589 --> 01:46:48.599 align:start position:0%

representative Joe Sweeny from
 
01:48:47.189 --> 01:48:47.199 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 25 the town of Salem um I I
 
01:48:50.709 --> 01:48:50.719 align:start position:0%
rarely uh think when I file istion or
 
01:48:52.870 --> 01:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
when I have a an idea that I I would
 
01:48:55.310 --> 01:48:55.320 align:start position:0%
consider it a great idea um however I
 
01:48:57.950 --> 01:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
was validated when I filed this with OSS
 
01:49:00.030 --> 01:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
that it was a great idea as a
 
01:49:01.830 --> 01:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
representative rord from your committee
 
01:49:04.149 --> 01:49:04.159 align:start position:0%
was concurrently filing very similar
 
01:49:06.350 --> 01:49:06.360 align:start position:0%
legislation uh that then merged into
 
01:49:08.390 --> 01:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
this bill uh for the child care tax
 
01:49:11.950 --> 01:49:11.960 align:start position:0%
credit um now there were some uh issues
 
01:49:14.229 --> 01:49:14.239 align:start position:0%
on my end and with OS in getting the
 
01:49:17.950 --> 01:49:17.960 align:start position:0%
bill drafted as as we saw fit um and I
 
01:49:19.270 --> 01:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
think you as the committee will be able
 
01:49:20.510 --> 01:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
to work on it and there are some
 
01:49:23.430 --> 01:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
suggested changes in the uh post fiscal
 
01:49:25.470 --> 01:49:25.480 align:start position:0%
note about the bill and changes that can
 
01:49:27.470 --> 01:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
be made uh to strengthen the bill and
 
01:49:28.709 --> 01:49:28.719 align:start position:0%
make it a little bit stronger on the
 
01:49:31.109 --> 01:49:31.119 align:start position:0%
policy points um to which I think
 
01:49:32.870 --> 01:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
members of your committee are are in
 
01:49:35.430 --> 01:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
tuned with need to be made uh but the
 
01:49:36.990 --> 01:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
impotence behind this bill and
 
01:49:38.910 --> 01:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
establishing a child care tax credit in
 
01:49:40.310 --> 01:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is very simple we're
 
01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
obviously uh in an era where child care
 
01:49:44.790 --> 01:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
expenses are making it harder for our
 
01:49:47.510 --> 01:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
state to attract and retrain uh young
 
01:49:49.589 --> 01:49:49.599 align:start position:0%
families uh to encourage young families
 
01:49:51.629 --> 01:49:51.639 align:start position:0%
to stay in New Hampshire to have their
 
01:49:54.589 --> 01:49:54.599 align:start position:0%
children in the state um and so we also
 
01:49:56.350 --> 01:49:56.360 align:start position:0%
have a limited number of options from
 
01:49:59.030 --> 01:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
the state level as to what we can do uh
 
01:50:01.070 --> 01:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
in order to facilitate a better market
 
01:50:02.750 --> 01:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
for child care facilities in the state
 
01:50:04.589 --> 01:50:04.599 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire we have a a special
 
01:50:05.830 --> 01:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
committee on child care that's been
 
01:50:07.470 --> 01:50:07.480 align:start position:0%
looking at recommendations over the last
 
01:50:10.070 --> 01:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
year and I commend their efforts uh for
 
01:50:11.629 --> 01:50:11.639 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire in
 
01:50:13.910 --> 01:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
identifying the small incremental ways
 
01:50:15.189 --> 01:50:15.199 align:start position:0%
in which we can make things better and
 
01:50:17.149 --> 01:50:17.159 align:start position:0%
this childcare tax credit has not been
 
01:50:18.550 --> 01:50:18.560 align:start position:0%
discussed with with the child care
 
01:50:20.430 --> 01:50:20.440 align:start position:0%
committee yet uh but I think it's a
 
01:50:22.629 --> 01:50:22.639 align:start position:0%
small incremental way in which we can
 
01:50:24.270 --> 01:50:24.280 align:start position:0%
make the child care situation in New
 
01:50:25.830 --> 01:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a little bit better
 
01:50:27.990 --> 01:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
essentially by targeting uh for
 
01:50:31.030 --> 01:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
employers with eligible employees their
 
01:50:32.950 --> 01:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
ability to write off from their state
 
01:50:35.790 --> 01:50:35.800 align:start position:0%
business taxes incur child care expenses
 
01:50:38.189 --> 01:50:38.199 align:start position:0%
up to a certain limit uh in order to
 
01:50:40.270 --> 01:50:40.280 align:start position:0%
help retain their their young workers to
 
01:50:42.910 --> 01:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
encourage those young workers to pursue
 
01:50:45.350 --> 01:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
having a family uh with the cost of
 
01:50:47.310 --> 01:50:47.320 align:start position:0%
child care not being a factor in them
 
01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
not um not starting their family and
 
01:50:53.390 --> 01:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
staying in the state of New Hampshire um
 
01:50:55.109 --> 01:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
I think we can all agree that the the
 
01:50:57.470 --> 01:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
best benefit the best social program is
 
01:50:59.430 --> 01:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
a good job uh and that's not something
 
01:51:00.830 --> 01:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
that the state can really get in the way
 
01:51:03.069 --> 01:51:03.079 align:start position:0%
of of mandating certain benefits or
 
01:51:04.870 --> 01:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
whatnot but this is just an opportunity
 
01:51:07.709 --> 01:51:07.719 align:start position:0%
and incentive for existing employers to
 
01:51:10.350 --> 01:51:10.360 align:start position:0%
begin offering uh assistance and in
 
01:51:12.870 --> 01:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
child care expenses to their employees U
 
01:51:14.510 --> 01:51:14.520 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take questions on the bill
 
01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
there are other experts uh on here uh
 
01:51:19.350 --> 01:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
behind me I believe uh and obviously I
 
01:51:20.709 --> 01:51:20.719 align:start position:0%
just really do want to give a shout out
 
01:51:22.510 --> 01:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
to he's not testifying in the bill but
 
01:51:24.629 --> 01:51:24.639 align:start position:0%
representative Rochford is the the real
 
01:51:26.990 --> 01:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
impedence behind most of the real policy
 
01:51:28.189 --> 01:51:28.199 align:start position:0%
in the bill mine was just the
 
01:51:30.350 --> 01:51:30.360 align:start position:0%
overarching concept of of allowing
 
01:51:32.229 --> 01:51:32.239 align:start position:0%
employers to write off child care
 
01:51:35.350 --> 01:51:35.360 align:start position:0%
expenses okay great thank you questions
 
01:51:38.310 --> 01:51:38.320 align:start position:0%
for representative Sweeny represent elme
 
01:51:41.430 --> 01:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
thank you um I would not consider this
 
01:51:45.589 --> 01:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
small on a tax credit removes money from
 
01:51:47.830 --> 01:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
the jurisdiction of the finance
 
01:51:53.669 --> 01:51:53.679 align:start position:0%
committee and um on can balloon into an
 
01:51:57.069 --> 01:51:57.079 align:start position:0%
incredible amount of money or can end up
 
01:52:00.229 --> 01:52:00.239 align:start position:0%
not being used by anybody and it is very
 
01:52:04.750 --> 01:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
difficult to tell ahead um you have
 
01:52:07.790 --> 01:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
capped the first part of this at $10
 
01:52:11.669 --> 01:52:11.679 align:start position:0%
million a year our business profits tax
 
01:52:14.990 --> 01:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
is showing signs of decreasing at this
 
01:52:18.350 --> 01:52:18.360 align:start position:0%
point every other state is showing uh
 
01:52:20.830 --> 01:52:20.840 align:start position:0%
showing Revenue decreases as the federal
 
01:52:26.910 --> 01:52:26.920 align:start position:0%
stimulus ends um and your second part uh
 
01:52:28.870 --> 01:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
the expenditures for maternity or
 
01:52:33.430 --> 01:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
paternity leave have no has no cap
 
01:52:38.310 --> 01:52:38.320 align:start position:0%
whatsoever and is and they are incapable
 
01:52:41.709 --> 01:52:41.719 align:start position:0%
of estimating it in the fiscal
 
01:52:45.270 --> 01:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
note so
 
01:52:49.310 --> 01:52:49.320 align:start position:0%
um do you have you thought about what
 
01:52:52.030 --> 01:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
this might doe to housing funding or
 
01:52:56.430 --> 01:52:56.440 align:start position:0%
this might doe to to the funding that
 
01:52:59.750 --> 01:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
goes on in the state budget on a routine
 
01:53:03.589 --> 01:53:03.599 align:start position:0%
matter that um in Health and Human
 
01:53:06.709 --> 01:53:06.719 align:start position:0%
Services or in other sectors that will
 
01:53:10.750 --> 01:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
have to be cut if this does ballone so I
 
01:53:12.030 --> 01:53:12.040 align:start position:0%
think based off I appreciate the
 
01:53:13.550 --> 01:53:13.560 align:start position:0%
question I think based off of where the
 
01:53:15.910 --> 01:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
current surpluses are lining up uh this
 
01:53:17.229 --> 01:53:17.239 align:start position:0%
is not going to create a hole in the New
 
01:53:19.109 --> 01:53:19.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire budget a a $10 million cap in
 
01:53:20.589 --> 01:53:20.599 align:start position:0%
the first instance
 
01:53:22.629 --> 01:53:22.639 align:start position:0%
uh will just incentivize businesses and
 
01:53:24.149 --> 01:53:24.159 align:start position:0%
employers to be able to retain their
 
01:53:26.790 --> 01:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
employees which has a value into the
 
01:53:28.550 --> 01:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
economy that we can't quantify with
 
01:53:31.109 --> 01:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
state tax dollars and revenues uh the
 
01:53:33.790 --> 01:53:33.800 align:start position:0%
second part about allowing uh employers
 
01:53:36.790 --> 01:53:36.800 align:start position:0%
to expand uh if needed the maternity and
 
01:53:39.030 --> 01:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
paternity leave that's currently offered
 
01:53:40.550 --> 01:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
to their employees and then be able to
 
01:53:42.430 --> 01:53:42.440 align:start position:0%
write off those additional expenses to
 
01:53:45.109 --> 01:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
their tax cuts I think is just a smart
 
01:53:47.589 --> 01:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
pro- family policy uh that we're lacking
 
01:53:48.910 --> 01:53:48.920 align:start position:0%
in the state and that we can really move
 
01:53:51.109 --> 01:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
the ball forward for young families and
 
01:53:52.870 --> 01:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
our Employers in order to retain the
 
01:53:54.750 --> 01:53:54.760 align:start position:0%
workforce that they need to be
 
01:53:56.470 --> 01:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
successful so that our economy can
 
01:53:59.390 --> 01:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
continue to grow without losing uh
 
01:54:01.390 --> 01:54:01.400 align:start position:0%
knowledge and talent to other states
 
01:54:03.390 --> 01:54:03.400 align:start position:0%
with with more reasonable uh and
 
01:54:08.709 --> 01:54:08.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:13.030 --> 01:54:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:15.390 --> 01:54:15.400 align:start position:0%
Ames I'm wondering about the scope of
 
01:54:18.669 --> 01:54:18.679 align:start position:0%
this bill and um this tax credit would
 
01:54:22.709 --> 01:54:22.719 align:start position:0%
apply as I read it only to employees of
 
01:54:26.069 --> 01:54:26.079 align:start position:0%
businesses that pay uh significant
 
01:54:30.270 --> 01:54:30.280 align:start position:0%
enough um business profits tax to be
 
01:54:32.750 --> 01:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
able to take and
 
01:54:37.109 --> 01:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
use uh for the purposes described here
 
01:54:41.390 --> 01:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
um this tax credit so that if I
 
01:54:42.910 --> 01:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
understand this correctly and that's my
 
01:54:47.229 --> 01:54:47.239 align:start position:0%
question to you um this leaves out of
 
01:54:51.709 --> 01:54:51.719 align:start position:0%
this uh support for child care all the
 
01:54:55.149 --> 01:54:55.159 align:start position:0%
employees of all the businesses that are
 
01:54:58.229 --> 01:54:58.239 align:start position:0%
not uh able to take advantage of this
 
01:55:01.589 --> 01:55:01.599 align:start position:0%
business profits tax tax
 
01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
credit well I I so if I'm understanding
 
01:55:07.629 --> 01:55:07.639 align:start position:0%
your your dilemma correctly it sounds as
 
01:55:09.750 --> 01:55:09.760 align:start position:0%
if we're just not taxing small
 
01:55:11.030 --> 01:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
businesses enough that they would be
 
01:55:12.629 --> 01:55:12.639 align:start position:0%
able to write off their expenses no
 
01:55:15.669 --> 01:55:15.679 align:start position:0%
there's not it no if if a business is
 
01:55:18.069 --> 01:55:18.079 align:start position:0%
not large enough to produce the sorts of
 
01:55:19.910 --> 01:55:19.920 align:start position:0%
revenues in which we're taxing them at a
 
01:55:21.830 --> 01:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
rate in which writing off their child
 
01:55:23.069 --> 01:55:23.079 align:start position:0%
care expenses that they're providing
 
01:55:25.470 --> 01:55:25.480 align:start position:0%
makes sense to them then we're already
 
01:55:27.950 --> 01:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
not taxing that we and there's another
 
01:55:29.229 --> 01:55:29.239 align:start position:0%
bill that we can cut those business
 
01:55:31.589 --> 01:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
taxes further if we want to release that
 
01:55:34.030 --> 01:55:34.040 align:start position:0%
burden on those small businesses uh but
 
01:55:35.830 --> 01:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is just providing a vehicle
 
01:55:37.750 --> 01:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
for employers to provide child care
 
01:55:39.870 --> 01:55:39.880 align:start position:0%
services and pay for those expenses to
 
01:55:41.589 --> 01:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
their employees that are existing
 
01:55:43.430 --> 01:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
there's no limitation in the bill for
 
01:55:46.510 --> 01:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
how large or how small a taxpayer a
 
01:55:48.629 --> 01:55:48.639 align:start position:0%
taxpaying entity has to be to apply for
 
01:55:51.350 --> 01:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
this tax credit uh but the Dilemma
 
01:55:54.069 --> 01:55:54.079 align:start position:0%
you're citing is just a sense of reality
 
01:55:55.990 --> 01:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
that we have small businesses in the
 
01:55:58.510 --> 01:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
state that aren't paying a high share of
 
01:56:00.270 --> 01:56:00.280 align:start position:0%
taxes because we've cut taxes and we can
 
01:56:01.870 --> 01:56:01.880 align:start position:0%
continue to provide Relief by cutting
 
01:56:05.870 --> 01:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
taxes as well uh this this is simply one
 
01:56:09.030 --> 01:56:09.040 align:start position:0%
piece in a in a long big puzzle to
 
01:56:10.950 --> 01:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
provide relief to Granite Staters and to
 
01:56:13.550 --> 01:56:13.560 align:start position:0%
make uh employers incentivized to
 
01:56:15.510 --> 01:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
provide child care if they're able to do
 
01:56:17.470 --> 01:56:17.480 align:start position:0%
so this isn't a mandate this is an
 
01:56:22.350 --> 01:56:22.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:24.149 --> 01:56:24.159 align:start position:0%
representative fellows and then
 
01:56:24.159 --> 01:56:26.830 align:start position:0%
representative fellows and then
representative

01:56:26.830 --> 01:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:30.270 --> 01:56:30.280 align:start position:0%
ellerie do businesses get any kind of
 
01:56:33.189 --> 01:56:33.199 align:start position:0%
federal um tax
 
01:56:37.550 --> 01:56:37.560 align:start position:0%
credit or child care for that they
 
01:56:41.310 --> 01:56:41.320 align:start position:0%
provide I I do not believe so just
 
01:56:44.830 --> 01:56:44.840 align:start position:0%
follow up um some places might provide
 
01:56:48.069 --> 01:56:48.079 align:start position:0%
child care on site would that that would
 
01:56:50.589 --> 01:56:50.599 align:start position:0%
be just an expenditure for the business
 
01:56:52.790 --> 01:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
correct and I think under this bill if
 
01:56:54.470 --> 01:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
it's a if they're providing obviously
 
01:56:55.950 --> 01:56:55.960 align:start position:0%
they would be providing a licensed child
 
01:56:58.229 --> 01:56:58.239 align:start position:0%
care facility on site uh they would be
 
01:57:00.229 --> 01:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
allowed to take those expenses and write
 
01:57:03.270 --> 01:57:03.280 align:start position:0%
off it from their their bet or BPT but
 
01:57:06.709 --> 01:57:06.719 align:start position:0%
not a tax credit no they could get a tax
 
01:57:09.310 --> 01:57:09.320 align:start position:0%
credit for that expenditure if the
 
01:57:11.069 --> 01:57:11.079 align:start position:0%
business is incurring an expense for the
 
01:57:12.870 --> 01:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
Deliverance of child care through I'm
 
01:57:15.550 --> 01:57:15.560 align:start position:0%
talking about Federal Federal Federal
 
01:57:18.709 --> 01:57:18.719 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of I'm saying in this bill
 
01:57:20.350 --> 01:57:20.360 align:start position:0%
the proposal for the state is that they
 
01:57:21.830 --> 01:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
would be able to write off those
 
01:57:24.390 --> 01:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
incurred child care expenses from their
 
01:57:28.270 --> 01:57:28.280 align:start position:0%
state taxes as a credit as opposed to it
 
01:57:31.750 --> 01:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
as a tax credit yes as a OPP but so if
 
01:57:34.149 --> 01:57:34.159 align:start position:0%
we didn't have tax credit they it they
 
01:57:36.030 --> 01:57:36.040 align:start position:0%
can right now they can write it off as
 
01:57:38.390 --> 01:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
an expenditure
 
01:57:42.030 --> 01:57:42.040 align:start position:0%
correct from from their federal taxes
 
01:57:45.709 --> 01:57:45.719 align:start position:0%
and it would lower their sure or stake
 
01:57:47.750 --> 01:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
sorry from from the expenditure side of
 
01:57:49.390 --> 01:57:49.400 align:start position:0%
things yes they could write it off as an
 
01:57:51.350 --> 01:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
expenditure but this is specifically to
 
01:57:53.830 --> 01:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
incentivize child care expenses going
 
01:57:55.550 --> 01:57:55.560 align:start position:0%
forward thank
 
01:57:58.229 --> 01:57:58.239 align:start position:0%
you um representative allary followed by
 
01:57:58.239 --> 01:58:01.149 align:start position:0%
you um representative allary followed by
representative

01:58:01.149 --> 01:58:01.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:07.470 --> 01:58:07.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:10.350 --> 01:58:10.360 align:start position:0%
um the the question that was asked by
 
01:58:12.870 --> 01:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
representative Fells was regarding an
 
01:58:16.229 --> 01:58:16.239 align:start position:0%
expenditure right now if an industry
 
01:58:20.270 --> 01:58:20.280 align:start position:0%
let's take a huge one um with a couple
 
01:58:22.510 --> 01:58:22.520 align:start position:0%
thousand employees offers
 
01:58:26.470 --> 01:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
daycare um or Child Care on on campus
 
01:58:28.310 --> 01:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
that's not a business
 
01:58:31.109 --> 01:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
expense therefore that's just done out
 
01:58:34.069 --> 01:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
of the largess of the the
 
01:58:37.109 --> 01:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
business to attract employees and some
 
01:58:39.669 --> 01:58:39.679 align:start position:0%
do offer that
 
01:58:43.470 --> 01:58:43.480 align:start position:0%
currently however if this bill were to
 
01:58:46.030 --> 01:58:46.040 align:start position:0%
pass then they could it take up to at
 
01:58:46.040 --> 01:58:47.750 align:start position:0%
pass then they could it take up to at
least

01:58:47.750 --> 01:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
least
 
01:58:51.950 --> 01:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
$100,000 for that expense so a smaller
 
01:58:53.830 --> 01:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
company in New
 
01:58:56.069 --> 01:58:56.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire could offer
 
01:58:59.510 --> 01:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
daycare and could cover the cost of one
 
01:59:00.669 --> 01:59:00.679 align:start position:0%
or two
 
01:59:02.709 --> 01:59:02.719 align:start position:0%
employees under that
 
01:59:05.270 --> 01:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
$100,000 so do you see this bill is
 
01:59:07.910 --> 01:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
benefiting the largest
 
01:59:10.629 --> 01:59:10.639 align:start position:0%
employer collectively in the state that
 
01:59:13.510 --> 01:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
is the small business benefiting more
 
01:59:17.030 --> 01:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
than the large business and that's the
 
01:59:19.669 --> 01:59:19.679 align:start position:0%
first question and a followup Mr chair
 
01:59:21.790 --> 01:59:21.800 align:start position:0%
no I I appreciate the question and as
 
01:59:23.510 --> 01:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
the bill pertains I think you're right I
 
01:59:25.109 --> 01:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
think this benefits any business that
 
01:59:26.950 --> 01:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
pursues the tax credit with an
 
01:59:29.709 --> 01:59:29.719 align:start position:0%
individual cap of $100,000 and a total
 
01:59:32.229 --> 01:59:32.239 align:start position:0%
program cap of $10 million it's going to
 
01:59:34.629 --> 01:59:34.639 align:start position:0%
be a lot a lot of businesses filling up
 
01:59:36.870 --> 01:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
that $10 million
 
01:59:39.870 --> 01:59:39.880 align:start position:0%
cap and follow up yeah the followup on
 
01:59:41.790 --> 01:59:41.800 align:start position:0%
that is where did this $10 million cap
 
01:59:44.189 --> 01:59:44.199 align:start position:0%
come from does it is it going to be that
 
01:59:46.830 --> 01:59:46.840 align:start position:0%
way does it need to be that high uh
 
01:59:49.069 --> 01:59:49.079 align:start position:0%
what's the justification for that number
 
01:59:51.589 --> 01:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
yeah the uh and I think uh that was part
 
01:59:54.310 --> 01:59:54.320 align:start position:0%
of Representative roer's original draft
 
01:59:56.310 --> 01:59:56.320 align:start position:0%
of it um I don't want to speak for him
 
01:59:57.870 --> 01:59:57.880 align:start position:0%
on that provision but I think it's a
 
02:00:00.149 --> 02:00:00.159 align:start position:0%
it's a good starting point for where we
 
02:00:01.790 --> 02:00:01.800 align:start position:0%
can go with the program to see where the
 
02:00:03.510 --> 02:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
need is and where the justification is
 
02:00:04.589 --> 02:00:04.599 align:start position:0%
because right now obviously we don't
 
02:00:07.149 --> 02:00:07.159 align:start position:0%
really have a good sense of of what the
 
02:00:10.069 --> 02:00:10.079 align:start position:0%
need out there is one further followup
 
02:00:13.109 --> 02:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
sure would there be
 
02:00:17.870 --> 02:00:17.880 align:start position:0%
any positive effect to something of this
 
02:00:22.270 --> 02:00:22.280 align:start position:0%
taking place If instead of uh a tax Gap
 
02:00:26.790 --> 02:00:26.800 align:start position:0%
this could be um allowed as a business
 
02:00:29.990 --> 02:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
expense uh for New Hampshire
 
02:00:32.109 --> 02:00:32.119 align:start position:0%
taxation I wouldn't be opposed to that
 
02:00:33.629 --> 02:00:33.639 align:start position:0%
strategy either and I think as as the
 
02:00:35.030 --> 02:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means Committee you already
 
02:00:36.750 --> 02:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
have to make changes to the bill based
 
02:00:39.069 --> 02:00:39.079 align:start position:0%
on the department notes um and I think
 
02:00:40.790 --> 02:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
that's a great for for your discussions
 
02:00:42.629 --> 02:00:42.639 align:start position:0%
in executive session to
 
02:00:44.990 --> 02:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
pursue thank you thank you Mr chair
 
02:00:47.430 --> 02:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative PL did you
 
02:00:50.430 --> 02:00:50.440 align:start position:0%
have a question maybe there's a bit of a
 
02:00:53.390 --> 02:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
question left after represent Val's
 
02:00:56.109 --> 02:00:56.119 align:start position:0%
colloquy is there in a business expense
 
02:00:58.669 --> 02:00:58.679 align:start position:0%
now that they could uh count as an
 
02:01:04.109 --> 02:01:04.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:06.550 --> 02:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
now any other
 
02:01:08.950 --> 02:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
questions representative shamber thank
 
02:01:11.390 --> 02:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you representative
 
02:01:14.990 --> 02:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
uh following up on represent of
 
02:01:17.870 --> 02:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
's question about the 10 million going
 
02:01:20.109 --> 02:01:20.119 align:start position:0%
back to line d page
 
02:01:23.830 --> 02:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
112 uh shall not exceed 100,000 for any
 
02:01:26.709 --> 02:01:26.719 align:start position:0%
tax taxpayer in a taxable year uh where
 
02:01:29.270 --> 02:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
do that number come from that that is
 
02:01:31.950 --> 02:01:31.960 align:start position:0%
just based off of ensuring that it's not
 
02:01:34.629 --> 02:01:34.639 align:start position:0%
just large corporations in the state
 
02:01:37.550 --> 02:01:37.560 align:start position:0%
taking the full $10 million cap so it's
 
02:01:39.430 --> 02:01:39.440 align:start position:0%
kind of related to the $10 million cap
 
02:01:41.189 --> 02:01:41.199 align:start position:0%
that you wouldn't want one employer to
 
02:01:43.470 --> 02:01:43.480 align:start position:0%
take a significant amount of the of the
 
02:01:46.189 --> 02:01:46.199 align:start position:0%
overall cap so limiting it to up to
 
02:01:50.069 --> 02:01:50.079 align:start position:0%
$100,000 per taxpayer per
 
02:01:52.470 --> 02:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
year so it's really just proportional to
 
02:01:54.750 --> 02:01:54.760 align:start position:0%
the 10 million follow
 
02:02:01.189 --> 02:02:01.199 align:start position:0%
up uh is there a priority list is
 
02:02:05.030 --> 02:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
there items that a a company would have
 
02:02:07.030 --> 02:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
to or business would have
 
02:02:09.310 --> 02:02:09.320 align:start position:0%
to make other
 
02:02:11.189 --> 02:02:11.199 align:start position:0%
than do they have to have a certain
 
02:02:12.990 --> 02:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
number of employees or do they have to
 
02:02:16.629 --> 02:02:16.639 align:start position:0%
have it's just an open an open open to
 
02:02:21.870 --> 02:02:21.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:21.880 --> 02:02:23.310 align:start position:0%
 
all

02:02:23.310 --> 02:02:23.320 align:start position:0%
all
 
02:02:26.430 --> 02:02:26.440 align:start position:0%
right seeing no more questions thank you
 
02:02:28.069 --> 02:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
right thank
 
02:02:35.350 --> 02:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:37.990 --> 02:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
Barry thank you um my name is
 
02:02:39.589 --> 02:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
representative Ross Barry I represent
 
02:02:42.430 --> 02:02:42.440 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 39 Manchester South End board
 
02:02:44.750 --> 02:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
689 I'm the chair of the special
 
02:02:47.950 --> 02:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
committee on childcare um we are tasked
 
02:02:50.149 --> 02:02:50.159 align:start position:0%
with finding solutions to increase
 
02:02:51.990 --> 02:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
access affordability and maintaining
 
02:02:53.149 --> 02:02:53.159 align:start position:0%
quality childcare in state of New
 
02:02:55.629 --> 02:02:55.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um so I'm here to kind of talk
 
02:02:57.550 --> 02:02:57.560 align:start position:0%
about support for this bill maybe some
 
02:02:59.390 --> 02:02:59.400 align:start position:0%
things that I think the committee should
 
02:03:02.830 --> 02:03:02.840 align:start position:0%
take a look at um and um maybe some
 
02:03:05.229 --> 02:03:05.239 align:start position:0%
propos changes so the first question I
 
02:03:07.350 --> 02:03:07.360 align:start position:0%
would have about the bill I I love the
 
02:03:08.750 --> 02:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
bill and concept let me start off with I
 
02:03:10.149 --> 02:03:10.159 align:start position:0%
support the bill I support the bill and
 
02:03:12.310 --> 02:03:12.320 align:start position:0%
concept um I want to kind of answer a
 
02:03:14.350 --> 02:03:14.360 align:start position:0%
couple of questions to representative
 
02:03:17.669 --> 02:03:17.679 align:start position:0%
aly's Point um we're talking about
 
02:03:21.069 --> 02:03:21.079 align:start position:0%
people who qualify for the state
 
02:03:23.790 --> 02:03:23.800 align:start position:0%
scholarship um so we're not talking
 
02:03:26.350 --> 02:03:26.360 align:start position:0%
about every child going into child care
 
02:03:28.390 --> 02:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the select few that
 
02:03:29.709 --> 02:03:29.719 align:start position:0%
are on the state scholarship in my
 
02:03:31.430 --> 02:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
Center that I own it's about one out of
 
02:03:33.229 --> 02:03:33.239 align:start position:0%
every six children um those numbers
 
02:03:35.310 --> 02:03:35.320 align:start position:0%
obviously will vary Center to Center um
 
02:03:37.709 --> 02:03:37.719 align:start position:0%
Community to community um the way the
 
02:03:39.870 --> 02:03:39.880 align:start position:0%
state scholarship works is the state
 
02:03:43.189 --> 02:03:43.199 align:start position:0%
covers the state covers a portion of the
 
02:03:45.470 --> 02:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
cost based on the survey that they do
 
02:03:47.709 --> 02:03:47.719 align:start position:0%
every 3 years based on the median in the
 
02:03:50.589 --> 02:03:50.599 align:start position:0%
median cost for that child's age group
 
02:03:51.790 --> 02:03:51.800 align:start position:0%
um and then they have a little spread
 
02:03:53.310 --> 02:03:53.320 align:start position:0%
they have a little grid that they use
 
02:03:57.870 --> 02:03:57.880 align:start position:0%
based on the Family's income um and ju
 
02:03:59.629 --> 02:03:59.639 align:start position:0%
opposed against federal poverty level
 
02:04:02.470 --> 02:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
and the state produces a cost share um
 
02:04:04.750 --> 02:04:04.760 align:start position:0%
value for the parents right so if you're
 
02:04:06.669 --> 02:04:06.679 align:start position:0%
on the state scholarship you don't get
 
02:04:08.709 --> 02:04:08.719 align:start position:0%
to go to child care centers for free I
 
02:04:10.870 --> 02:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
don't believe anybody does I think some
 
02:04:13.149 --> 02:04:13.159 align:start position:0%
I think they pay little like $5
 
02:04:15.310 --> 02:04:15.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes um the more income they make
 
02:04:17.589 --> 02:04:17.599 align:start position:0%
the more they have to pay um so you're
 
02:04:20.350 --> 02:04:20.360 align:start position:0%
not talking about a like massive swath
 
02:04:23.030 --> 02:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
of like covering $300 a week per child
 
02:04:25.189 --> 02:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
across the board uh per employer you're
 
02:04:27.430 --> 02:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
talking about what I I I assume this is
 
02:04:29.069 --> 02:04:29.079 align:start position:0%
doing is I assume it's covering the cost
 
02:04:31.229 --> 02:04:31.239 align:start position:0%
share part which is the parents part um
 
02:04:32.990 --> 02:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
so you're talking about covering a much
 
02:04:36.189 --> 02:04:36.199 align:start position:0%
smaller portion of the tuition um so
 
02:04:37.750 --> 02:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
that would include their cost share and
 
02:04:40.270 --> 02:04:40.280 align:start position:0%
then any overage that the child care
 
02:04:42.870 --> 02:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
center charges higher than the state
 
02:04:44.709 --> 02:04:44.719 align:start position:0%
median income uh the higher than the
 
02:04:47.390 --> 02:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
state median price for the scholarship
 
02:04:50.310 --> 02:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
so I what a exactly that fiscal impact
 
02:04:54.629 --> 02:04:54.639 align:start position:0%
is I'm not sure um I would I would have
 
02:04:56.790 --> 02:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
trouble envisioning a world in which it
 
02:04:58.830 --> 02:04:58.840 align:start position:0%
got to $10 million um I wouldn't say
 
02:05:00.910 --> 02:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
it's not possible um but I want once
 
02:05:01.830 --> 02:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
again you're talking about people who
 
02:05:02.990 --> 02:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
are currently
 
02:05:06.229 --> 02:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
250% um poverty level and below and then
 
02:05:07.790 --> 02:05:07.800 align:start position:0%
I assume you're talking about their cost
 
02:05:10.229 --> 02:05:10.239 align:start position:0%
share which is an even smaller portion
 
02:05:13.270 --> 02:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
of their actual tuition um so ways that
 
02:05:15.270 --> 02:05:15.280 align:start position:0%
this might be beneficial obviously
 
02:05:17.229 --> 02:05:17.239 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with workingclass people
 
02:05:19.629 --> 02:05:19.639 align:start position:0%
at this income rate um you're talking
 
02:05:22.790 --> 02:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
about relieving them you know anywhere
 
02:05:26.750 --> 02:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
between $5 and up to like $120 a week um
 
02:05:29.470 --> 02:05:29.480 align:start position:0%
off of somebody who's a 250% lower
 
02:05:31.830 --> 02:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
federal poverty standard
 
02:05:35.229 --> 02:05:35.239 align:start position:0%
um I wouldn't Envision like you know bae
 
02:05:36.910 --> 02:05:36.920 align:start position:0%
or a company such as that which has high
 
02:05:39.709 --> 02:05:39.719 align:start position:0%
salaries um taking advantage of this uh
 
02:05:41.750 --> 02:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
I would Envision this being more used
 
02:05:44.510 --> 02:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
for you know uh Dunkin Donuts workers or
 
02:05:46.910 --> 02:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
other kind of entry-level workers um lot
 
02:05:49.189 --> 02:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
of single mothers in those situations
 
02:05:51.870 --> 02:05:51.880 align:start position:0%
um taking that cost share load off of
 
02:05:54.470 --> 02:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
them um that's the part of it that I
 
02:05:57.390 --> 02:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to speak to I'm happy to answer
 
02:05:59.350 --> 02:05:59.360 align:start position:0%
any questions about it the one thing I
 
02:06:01.629 --> 02:06:01.639 align:start position:0%
did want to point out is in the law in
 
02:06:04.990 --> 02:06:05.000 align:start position:0%
the way it's written it says eligible um
 
02:06:07.390 --> 02:06:07.400 align:start position:0%
so I I'm not aware of anybody who's
 
02:06:09.870 --> 02:06:09.880 align:start position:0%
eligible who doesn't go on it um but in
 
02:06:11.229 --> 02:06:11.239 align:start position:0%
theory you could have somebody who is
 
02:06:13.310 --> 02:06:13.320 align:start position:0%
not eligible and not on it and then
 
02:06:15.629 --> 02:06:15.639 align:start position:0%
obviously I I guess this would cover the
 
02:06:18.270 --> 02:06:18.280 align:start position:0%
entire cause of the tuition um so I'll
 
02:06:20.149 --> 02:06:20.159 align:start position:0%
try answer any questions I know that was
 
02:06:22.589 --> 02:06:22.599 align:start position:0%
a lot um really quickly um but I'll try
 
02:06:25.310 --> 02:06:25.320 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions I can thank you
 
02:06:28.270 --> 02:06:28.280 align:start position:0%
representative PL yes it this is
 
02:06:29.990 --> 02:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
introduced to our committee it's now our
 
02:06:32.350 --> 02:06:32.360 align:start position:0%
bill to make amendments to Y but if you
 
02:06:34.870 --> 02:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
have help on what amendments to make
 
02:06:36.629 --> 02:06:36.639 align:start position:0%
that would be great yeah so the first
 
02:06:40.629 --> 02:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
thing I would do is um on line 11 um I
 
02:06:45.229 --> 02:06:45.239 align:start position:0%
would detach the um qualifications on
 
02:06:47.430 --> 02:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
income level um I would just say if they
 
02:06:49.589 --> 02:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
qualify for the scholarship the
 
02:06:51.350 --> 02:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
scholarship does change um we just
 
02:06:54.390 --> 02:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
expanded it uh in the last budget um so
 
02:06:56.149 --> 02:06:56.159 align:start position:0%
that would give the the language more
 
02:06:58.589 --> 02:06:58.599 align:start position:0%
flexibility going forward I would also
 
02:07:01.390 --> 02:07:01.400 align:start position:0%
clarify that it goes to the cost share
 
02:07:03.149 --> 02:07:03.159 align:start position:0%
um which is what I believe the intention
 
02:07:06.149 --> 02:07:06.159 align:start position:0%
is um because otherwise you would be
 
02:07:08.149 --> 02:07:08.159 align:start position:0%
effectively Subs like you might be
 
02:07:11.069 --> 02:07:11.079 align:start position:0%
subsidizing the fund um which we did
 
02:07:13.189 --> 02:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
hear testimony about how we wanted
 
02:07:15.430 --> 02:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
businesses to take more of a larger role
 
02:07:18.109 --> 02:07:18.119 align:start position:0%
um in the cost of childcare um so
 
02:07:19.229 --> 02:07:19.239 align:start position:0%
there's something set for that but I
 
02:07:20.470 --> 02:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
think the committee need makes makes to
 
02:07:22.510 --> 02:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
make a decision um I believe the
 
02:07:24.910 --> 02:07:24.920 align:start position:0%
intention is to cover the cost share um
 
02:07:27.310 --> 02:07:27.320 align:start position:0%
but you could make an argument as to why
 
02:07:29.990 --> 02:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
it should be first this and then the
 
02:07:32.310 --> 02:07:32.320 align:start position:0%
scholarship uh which would make the
 
02:07:34.629 --> 02:07:34.639 align:start position:0%
actual fund of the scholarship healthier
 
02:07:36.270 --> 02:07:36.280 align:start position:0%
um and other opportunities for expansion
 
02:07:37.790 --> 02:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
if that's the way the legislator wanted
 
02:07:37.800 --> 02:07:39.030 align:start position:0%
if that's the way the legislator wanted
to

02:07:39.030 --> 02:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:07:42.589 --> 02:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
go represent Aly thank you uh I'm
 
02:07:46.030 --> 02:07:46.040 align:start position:0%
totally lost what I have never heard of
 
02:07:50.390 --> 02:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
the State Child Care scholarship program
 
02:07:52.589 --> 02:07:52.599 align:start position:0%
yep um so State schol the state
 
02:07:56.350 --> 02:07:56.360 align:start position:0%
scholarship program is ferally funded um
 
02:07:59.510 --> 02:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
and it it covers exactly kind of what
 
02:08:03.030 --> 02:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
the uh the very last page in the
 
02:08:06.069 --> 02:08:06.079 align:start position:0%
methodology um talk about it it's page
 
02:08:09.470 --> 02:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
four um they talk about it it's the the
 
02:08:11.669 --> 02:08:11.679 align:start position:0%
feds give us a certain amount of money
 
02:08:15.109 --> 02:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
um in a partnership where the state
 
02:08:19.709 --> 02:08:19.719 align:start position:0%
gives covers the tuition for um uh
 
02:08:21.910 --> 02:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
lowincome families so we just made some
 
02:08:24.229 --> 02:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
changes to the scholarship um the first
 
02:08:25.669 --> 02:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
thing that got changed we used to have
 
02:08:28.109 --> 02:08:28.119 align:start position:0%
an attendance base model um so basically
 
02:08:29.990 --> 02:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
the state would only pay uh when the
 
02:08:31.589 --> 02:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
child was present and the parent the
 
02:08:32.950 --> 02:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
child had a certain number of limited
 
02:08:36.510 --> 02:08:36.520 align:start position:0%
ABS absences uh providers reached out um
 
02:08:37.549 --> 02:08:37.559 align:start position:0%
and said they wanted to move to an
 
02:08:38.990 --> 02:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
attendance-based model which is what
 
02:08:40.870 --> 02:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
Most states do um so now it's
 
02:08:42.510 --> 02:08:42.520 align:start position:0%
attendance-based so that obviously
 
02:08:45.629 --> 02:08:45.639 align:start position:0%
increased um the draw from that pool of
 
02:08:49.149 --> 02:08:49.159 align:start position:0%
of funding um but that that that's money
 
02:08:52.669 --> 02:08:52.679 align:start position:0%
that we get to basically Subs subsidize
 
02:08:56.270 --> 02:08:56.280 align:start position:0%
low uh child care for lowincome families
 
02:08:59.069 --> 02:08:59.079 align:start position:0%
um the fund I I've said this before in
 
02:09:00.790 --> 02:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
committee and I believe there's only one
 
02:09:02.310 --> 02:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
instance and representative wner could
 
02:09:03.910 --> 02:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
probably correct me if I'm wrong because
 
02:09:06.149 --> 02:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
she knows way more about this than I do
 
02:09:07.310 --> 02:09:07.320 align:start position:0%
um I believe there's only one instance
 
02:09:08.870 --> 02:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
in recent memory where the fund ran out
 
02:09:10.229 --> 02:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
of money and then I believe at that
 
02:09:11.709 --> 02:09:11.719 align:start position:0%
point they create a weit list so that's
 
02:09:14.069 --> 02:09:14.079 align:start position:0%
something that I'm personally um very
 
02:09:15.270 --> 02:09:15.280 align:start position:0%
cautious of but I don't believe that
 
02:09:17.950 --> 02:09:17.960 align:start position:0%
this bill as written would impact that
 
02:09:19.589 --> 02:09:19.599 align:start position:0%
uh the only I could see it impacting
 
02:09:22.270 --> 02:09:22.280 align:start position:0%
that is if it put more people on to the
 
02:09:23.709 --> 02:09:23.719 align:start position:0%
scholarship that currently qualify that
 
02:09:25.310 --> 02:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
aren't on it but I'm not once again I
 
02:09:26.830 --> 02:09:26.840 align:start position:0%
don't believe that's a large pool of
 
02:09:30.709 --> 02:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
people um most child care centers um
 
02:09:32.430 --> 02:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
like when when when we on board at our
 
02:09:34.709 --> 02:09:34.719 align:start position:0%
Center we always ask do you qualify you
 
02:09:36.350 --> 02:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
know here's all the paperwork um and you
 
02:09:37.790 --> 02:09:37.800 align:start position:0%
can go do it because we take the state
 
02:09:39.430 --> 02:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
scholarship most I would say the
 
02:09:41.629 --> 02:09:41.639 align:start position:0%
overwhelming vast majority of childcare
 
02:09:43.990 --> 02:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
centers uh take the state scholarship um
 
02:09:45.709 --> 02:09:45.719 align:start position:0%
it's it's very simple the state always
 
02:09:47.390 --> 02:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
pays right I don't have to go and track
 
02:09:49.350 --> 02:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
down a pay from the state um but
 
02:09:51.189 --> 02:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
basically what happens is at the end of
 
02:09:54.910 --> 02:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
every week um Child Care Centers submit
 
02:09:58.109 --> 02:09:58.119 align:start position:0%
their attendance logs um for the
 
02:09:59.589 --> 02:09:59.599 align:start position:0%
individual children that are on the
 
02:10:01.790 --> 02:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
scholarship uh they submit the amount
 
02:10:05.229 --> 02:10:05.239 align:start position:0%
charged the state generates the uh
 
02:10:07.189 --> 02:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
parents cost share and then what the
 
02:10:09.030 --> 02:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
state's going to cover so what happens
 
02:10:12.270 --> 02:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
is is you Bill the parent for the C
 
02:10:14.430 --> 02:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
their cost share and the state sends you
 
02:10:17.149 --> 02:10:17.159 align:start position:0%
the rest um and it's on a sliding income
 
02:10:21.350 --> 02:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
scale um it's available online um but
 
02:10:23.350 --> 02:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
it's you know it's it's federal poverty
 
02:10:25.109 --> 02:10:25.119 align:start position:0%
level income scales so it's based on you
 
02:10:27.069 --> 02:10:27.079 align:start position:0%
know number of people in the household
 
02:10:28.430 --> 02:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
and how much money you make based on
 
02:10:28.440 --> 02:10:31.549 align:start position:0%
and how much money you make based on
gross

02:10:31.549 --> 02:10:31.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:35.629 --> 02:10:35.639 align:start position:0%
income could I follow up follow up um I
 
02:10:39.470 --> 02:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
don't understand how this has to do with
 
02:10:42.109 --> 02:10:42.119 align:start position:0%
um what I thought this bill was about
 
02:10:46.189 --> 02:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
which is on child care provided by an
 
02:10:49.950 --> 02:10:49.960 align:start position:0%
employer on site um I don't believe does
 
02:10:51.950 --> 02:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
it say onsite for big
 
02:10:54.270 --> 02:10:54.280 align:start position:0%
places because it says payments to a
 
02:10:58.629 --> 02:10:58.639 align:start position:0%
child care provider yeah um
 
02:11:00.709 --> 02:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
payments I don't I don't remember it
 
02:11:03.589 --> 02:11:03.599 align:start position:0%
saying it on site yeah it may not it it
 
02:11:05.750 --> 02:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
may not I I I if I'm wrong I don't
 
02:11:07.549 --> 02:11:07.559 align:start position:0%
believe it remember saying it on site I
 
02:11:09.830 --> 02:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
I um I don't believe the bill would be
 
02:11:10.950 --> 02:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
written in such a way because there
 
02:11:13.910 --> 02:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
aren't many employers that do that um I
 
02:11:16.030 --> 02:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
know a question was raised about how
 
02:11:18.430 --> 02:11:18.440 align:start position:0%
that would be yeah question be I mean
 
02:11:20.790 --> 02:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
it's a very highly regulated industry I
 
02:11:22.350 --> 02:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
me it's 100 over 100 pages of
 
02:11:25.830 --> 02:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
regulations um I don't see a employer
 
02:11:28.189 --> 02:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
jumping into that um unless they have to
 
02:11:29.629 --> 02:11:29.639 align:start position:0%
it' be much easier just to do actually
 
02:11:30.790 --> 02:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
kind of what I believe the intent of
 
02:11:33.430 --> 02:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
this bill is which is to subsidize at a
 
02:11:36.310 --> 02:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
um offsite
 
02:11:41.790 --> 02:11:41.800 align:start position:0%
facility but through employers that on
 
02:11:46.069 --> 02:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
use it to reduce their BP bet yeah I
 
02:11:47.790 --> 02:11:47.800 align:start position:0%
mean look it's it's you know that's
 
02:11:48.990 --> 02:11:49.000 align:start position:0%
that's kind of of your guys' world it's
 
02:11:51.030 --> 02:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
not mine um you I am a business owner
 
02:11:53.229 --> 02:11:53.239 align:start position:0%
obviously own a Childcare Center um you
 
02:11:55.709 --> 02:11:55.719 align:start position:0%
know we you know I could say in my like
 
02:11:57.990 --> 02:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
in my like I provide a grossly
 
02:12:00.790 --> 02:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
discounted rate um for my teachers right
 
02:12:01.990 --> 02:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
um and I have people that work for us
 
02:12:03.830 --> 02:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
because they want you know close to free
 
02:12:05.790 --> 02:12:05.800 align:start position:0%
childcare um so I think that there's a
 
02:12:06.990 --> 02:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
there's a question of how that would be
 
02:12:09.390 --> 02:12:09.400 align:start position:0%
handled um I'm not exactly sure how that
 
02:12:10.669 --> 02:12:10.679 align:start position:0%
would be handled but I know that that's
 
02:12:11.830 --> 02:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
a pretty common practice in the
 
02:12:14.990 --> 02:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
childcare industry um but you know I
 
02:12:17.229 --> 02:12:17.239 align:start position:0%
what I Envision this as is they are
 
02:12:18.950 --> 02:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
they're basically covering they would be
 
02:12:20.750 --> 02:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
covering to a certain extent the portion
 
02:12:22.270 --> 02:12:22.280 align:start position:0%
that the state doesn't pay and taking
 
02:12:24.189 --> 02:12:24.199 align:start position:0%
that off of the pral burden so once
 
02:12:25.990 --> 02:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
again you're not talking about the whole
 
02:12:28.350 --> 02:12:28.360 align:start position:0%
tuition in fact you're talking about um
 
02:12:30.830 --> 02:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
a very low percentage of the tuition um
 
02:12:33.430 --> 02:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
I think always less than
 
02:12:36.669 --> 02:12:36.679 align:start position:0%
50% represent shamberg thank you Mr
 
02:12:38.350 --> 02:12:38.360 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative taking
 
02:12:41.270 --> 02:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
this question on line 10 it does mention
 
02:12:43.430 --> 02:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Child Care scholarship
 
02:12:45.950 --> 02:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
program how much money how much Federal
 
02:12:47.629 --> 02:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
money does the state get for that
 
02:12:49.830 --> 02:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
program uh I want to say it's 26.8
 
02:12:54.830 --> 02:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:56.990 --> 02:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
MJ yeah it's about I think the last
 
02:12:59.430 --> 02:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
number I saw was 26.8 it's about 30
 
02:13:02.750 --> 02:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
million thank you yeah state and federal
 
02:13:04.709 --> 02:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
um but yeah it's
 
02:13:07.910 --> 02:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh followup then followup first I
 
02:13:09.750 --> 02:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
thought it was Federal now it is state
 
02:13:11.790 --> 02:13:11.800 align:start position:0%
and federal how much so well it's mostly
 
02:13:13.990 --> 02:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
it's mostly State like overwhelmingly
 
02:13:15.589 --> 02:13:15.599 align:start position:0%
majorities I mean mostly Federal excuse
 
02:13:17.390 --> 02:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
me mostly Federal I just want make sure
 
02:13:18.950 --> 02:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
I'm getting this it's it's it's fed
 
02:13:20.750 --> 02:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
money it's fed money that's sweet sweet
 
02:13:24.149 --> 02:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:26.350 --> 02:13:26.360 align:start position:0%
you representative do you have a
 
02:13:29.790 --> 02:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
question no do you know the split no not
 
02:13:32.310 --> 02:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
off the top of my head thank you sir
 
02:13:34.589 --> 02:13:34.599 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions but to my
 
02:13:36.229 --> 02:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
to my that point this bill doesn't
 
02:13:38.629 --> 02:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
really affect it right you're talking
 
02:13:41.109 --> 02:13:41.119 align:start position:0%
about the portion that it doesn't cover
 
02:13:44.109 --> 02:13:44.119 align:start position:0%
um so I not that not not not to dodge
 
02:13:45.189 --> 02:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
the question I just tell you I know the
 
02:13:46.950 --> 02:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
answer but I think the the questions
 
02:13:49.549 --> 02:13:49.559 align:start position:0%
moot because you're not talking about
 
02:13:51.069 --> 02:13:51.079 align:start position:0%
the actual scholarship you're talking
 
02:13:52.669 --> 02:13:52.679 align:start position:0%
about the portion of tuition that the
 
02:13:55.830 --> 02:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
scholarship doesn't cover which is which
 
02:13:57.270 --> 02:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
is obviously not covered by the state or
 
02:14:02.669 --> 02:14:02.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:05.790 --> 02:14:05.800 align:start position:0%
parents yes thank you Mr chairman it
 
02:14:09.990 --> 02:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it also make sense to um we're
 
02:14:10.990 --> 02:14:11.000 align:start position:0%
talking about the New Hampshire Child
 
02:14:12.790 --> 02:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
Care scholarship program and they're
 
02:14:15.549 --> 02:14:15.559 align:start position:0%
getting help and it it's been my
 
02:14:18.510 --> 02:14:18.520 align:start position:0%
experience uh as an employer
 
02:14:20.910 --> 02:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
that you know that's that's great that
 
02:14:22.270 --> 02:14:22.280 align:start position:0%
those people are getting help but it's
 
02:14:23.750 --> 02:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
actually the people that are just above
 
02:14:25.990 --> 02:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
that line that really need oh yeah
 
02:14:27.950 --> 02:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
really need the help me I've given
 
02:14:29.750 --> 02:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
raises and people come back to me and
 
02:14:31.109 --> 02:14:31.119 align:start position:0%
said I wish I hadn't got the raise
 
02:14:33.109 --> 02:14:33.119 align:start position:0%
because now I don't qualify for anything
 
02:14:35.109 --> 02:14:35.119 align:start position:0%
so wouldn't it make sense to maybe even
 
02:14:37.629 --> 02:14:37.639 align:start position:0%
increase the qualifications to to above
 
02:14:40.870 --> 02:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
that line to to as a sliding scale to
 
02:14:44.229 --> 02:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
help folks uh um get some relief yeah uh
 
02:14:46.270 --> 02:14:46.280 align:start position:0%
so um I I'll let you guys answer the
 
02:14:47.629 --> 02:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
money question on that cuz that's your
 
02:14:50.669 --> 02:14:50.679 align:start position:0%
job as a policy position um the missing
 
02:14:53.189 --> 02:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
Middle with child care is the group that
 
02:14:56.069 --> 02:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
gets hit the hardest um and I've had
 
02:14:57.629 --> 02:14:57.639 align:start position:0%
parents in tears when they've missed the
 
02:14:59.830 --> 02:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
threshold by a couple hundred dollars um
 
02:15:01.350 --> 02:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
because it's a significant drop off I
 
02:15:03.709 --> 02:15:03.719 align:start position:0%
mean the the the fund does taper right
 
02:15:05.310 --> 02:15:05.320 align:start position:0%
as you make more money the amount that
 
02:15:06.830 --> 02:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
they pay does taper off but there is a
 
02:15:09.149 --> 02:15:09.159 align:start position:0%
quite quite a cliff um and we are
 
02:15:11.510 --> 02:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
working on other things to address that
 
02:15:13.750 --> 02:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
um but there is no easy answer um child
 
02:15:15.069 --> 02:15:15.079 align:start position:0%
care you know infant care in the state
 
02:15:18.229 --> 02:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire um cost about $15,000 a
 
02:15:20.910 --> 02:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
year um because it operates on a teach a
 
02:15:24.149 --> 02:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
4 to1 teacher ratio right um Child Care
 
02:15:25.910 --> 02:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
Centers do not make any money on infant
 
02:15:28.350 --> 02:15:28.360 align:start position:0%
care um they are lost leaders um or
 
02:15:30.149 --> 02:15:30.159 align:start position:0%
break even leaders if you will inside
 
02:15:32.910 --> 02:15:32.920 align:start position:0%
the business World um but yeah that
 
02:15:34.950 --> 02:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
missing me that be a conversation you
 
02:15:36.589 --> 02:15:36.599 align:start position:0%
guys as a committee have to have because
 
02:15:38.990 --> 02:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
that would that would increase the cost
 
02:15:40.950 --> 02:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
of this um or it could increase the cost
 
02:15:42.430 --> 02:15:42.440 align:start position:0%
of this dramatically because obviously
 
02:15:44.750 --> 02:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
now you're talking about an unfunded
 
02:15:47.910 --> 02:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
part um from the from the Chalker
 
02:15:49.270 --> 02:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
scholarship so now you are talking about
 
02:15:51.470 --> 02:15:51.480 align:start position:0%
a full tuition bill um that would be
 
02:15:55.430 --> 02:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:57.229 --> 02:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
off so
 
02:16:00.629 --> 02:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
elme yes do you think
 
02:16:00.639 --> 02:16:02.149 align:start position:0%
elme yes do you think
that

02:16:02.149 --> 02:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:16:04.709 --> 02:16:04.719 align:start position:0%
on it would work
 
02:16:09.229 --> 02:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
bureaucratically if um we're basing it
 
02:16:11.510 --> 02:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
off the New Hampshire Child Care
 
02:16:15.549 --> 02:16:15.559 align:start position:0%
scholarship program but when you get
 
02:16:20.950 --> 02:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
above the level that that is your
 
02:16:24.950 --> 02:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
turning to the employers that actually
 
02:16:31.070 --> 02:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
make enough BP bet that they can uh
 
02:16:35.070 --> 02:16:35.080 align:start position:0%
use use the the
 
02:16:37.429 --> 02:16:37.439 align:start position:0%
offering so I I think the way that it
 
02:16:40.349 --> 02:16:40.359 align:start position:0%
would probably work is uh the child care
 
02:16:43.429 --> 02:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
center would probably Bill the employer
 
02:16:45.790 --> 02:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
um I believe the payments are to be made
 
02:16:48.349 --> 02:16:48.359 align:start position:0%
directly to the center um if that's I
 
02:16:52.030 --> 02:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
believe that that's in there um that's
 
02:16:53.990 --> 02:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
probably the way to do it childcare
 
02:16:55.230 --> 02:16:55.240 align:start position:0%
centers especially dealing with the
 
02:16:56.870 --> 02:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
state scholarship are already dealing
 
02:16:59.349 --> 02:16:59.359 align:start position:0%
with a split billing situation right as
 
02:17:00.870 --> 02:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
I said they're building the the state
 
02:17:02.230 --> 02:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
for one side of it and the parent for
 
02:17:05.110 --> 02:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
the other um and we do have to produce
 
02:17:06.990 --> 02:17:07.000 align:start position:0%
tax documents for parents so that they
 
02:17:09.709 --> 02:17:09.719 align:start position:0%
can do the um child care tax write off
 
02:17:11.469 --> 02:17:11.479 align:start position:0%
um they were actually all due today so I
 
02:17:12.790 --> 02:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
got a lot of inquiries about that from
 
02:17:16.429 --> 02:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
my parents um but I don't think I don't
 
02:17:18.429 --> 02:17:18.439 align:start position:0%
think it would be hard to produce that
 
02:17:20.950 --> 02:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
number to an employer from a child care
 
02:17:23.070 --> 02:17:23.080 align:start position:0%
side because it's just it's like billing
 
02:17:25.070 --> 02:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
another parent right you have parents
 
02:17:26.870 --> 02:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
you know children from split households
 
02:17:28.750 --> 02:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
right I might build dad this side and
 
02:17:31.110 --> 02:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
Mom this side and you know they have to
 
02:17:34.469 --> 02:17:34.479 align:start position:0%
they each pay their separate portions um
 
02:17:35.990 --> 02:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
I think that's how it would probably
 
02:17:40.429 --> 02:17:40.439 align:start position:0%
work um in practice um every child care
 
02:17:42.110 --> 02:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
center that accepts the state
 
02:17:44.389 --> 02:17:44.399 align:start position:0%
scholarship has a state vendor ID
 
02:17:45.870 --> 02:17:45.880 align:start position:0%
already so they're already kind of in
 
02:17:47.990 --> 02:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
the bureaucratic system um you're not
 
02:17:50.469 --> 02:17:50.479 align:start position:0%
really you know I'm definitely not for
 
02:17:52.509 --> 02:17:52.519 align:start position:0%
burdening child care um centers with
 
02:17:54.429 --> 02:17:54.439 align:start position:0%
more stuff in fact I've submitted a
 
02:17:56.429 --> 02:17:56.439 align:start position:0%
suite of bills to undo some of the stuff
 
02:17:58.589 --> 02:17:58.599 align:start position:0%
that we burden childcare centers with um
 
02:18:00.469 --> 02:18:00.479 align:start position:0%
but I would imagine childcare centers
 
02:18:02.709 --> 02:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
would would like this as another funding
 
02:18:05.270 --> 02:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
source um that's probably more reliable
 
02:18:09.950 --> 02:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:14.469 --> 02:18:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:18.509 --> 02:18:18.519 align:start position:0%
much I have a pink card for the Dr
 
02:18:41.750 --> 02:18:41.760 align:start position:0%

have so so let me begin um on on line 19
 
02:19:23.549 --> 02:19:23.559 align:start position:0%
the term research and development
 
02:19:26.150 --> 02:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
occurred is stated in the bill we
 
02:19:28.389 --> 02:19:28.399 align:start position:0%
suggest amending that language to read
 
02:19:31.389 --> 02:19:31.399 align:start position:0%
the qualified expenditures
 
02:19:34.870 --> 02:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
paid we also suggest additional language
 
02:19:37.429 --> 02:19:37.439 align:start position:0%
to be provided to clarify the types of
 
02:19:39.509 --> 02:19:39.519 align:start position:0%
expenditures that qualify for the
 
02:19:42.070 --> 02:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
maternity or paternity leave portion of
 
02:19:42.080 --> 02:19:43.030 align:start position:0%
maternity or paternity leave portion of
the

02:19:43.030 --> 02:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:19:45.910 --> 02:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
bill and we also suggest additional
 
02:19:48.910 --> 02:19:48.920 align:start position:0%
language excuse me minute um is that in
 
02:19:52.190 --> 02:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
the document you're sending around uh
 
02:19:52.200 --> 02:19:53.870 align:start position:0%
the document you're sending around uh
yes

02:19:53.870 --> 02:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:19:56.150 --> 02:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
okay um this is a fiscal note quick
 
02:19:57.550 --> 02:19:57.560 align:start position:0%
guide that we're passing around you may
 
02:19:58.590 --> 02:19:58.600 align:start position:0%
have had it
 
02:20:04.230 --> 02:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
emailed but this the okay okay
 
02:20:06.910 --> 02:20:06.920 align:start position:0%
okay so that's what we're providing here
 
02:20:10.309 --> 02:20:10.319 align:start position:0%
today yes can I just ask that you repeat
 
02:20:12.870 --> 02:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
that slowly so we absorb your points one
 
02:20:16.349 --> 02:20:16.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:19.870 --> 02:20:19.880 align:start position:0%
time absolutely so um I'll I'll just
 
02:20:23.510 --> 02:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
start again from the top so on line 19
 
02:20:26.389 --> 02:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
of the bill um where the term research
 
02:20:29.349 --> 02:20:29.359 align:start position:0%
and development occurred um that's the
 
02:20:32.110 --> 02:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
language in there we suggest amending
 
02:20:34.910 --> 02:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
that language to read qualified
 
02:20:34.920 --> 02:20:37.469 align:start position:0%
that language to read qualified
expenditures

02:20:37.469 --> 02:20:37.479 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
02:20:41.110 --> 02:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
paid we also suggest additional language
 
02:20:44.270 --> 02:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
be provided to clarify the types of
 
02:20:46.590 --> 02:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
expenditures that qualify for the
 
02:20:49.270 --> 02:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
maternity or paternity
 
02:20:52.469 --> 02:20:52.479 align:start position:0%
leave and we also suggest additional
 
02:20:56.349 --> 02:20:56.359 align:start position:0%
language in the proposed RSA
 
02:20:58.710 --> 02:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
77-a colon
 
02:21:03.510 --> 02:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
5 17 and RSA 77
 
02:21:06.550 --> 02:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
e3f to clarify that the taxpayer may
 
02:21:10.270 --> 02:21:10.280 align:start position:0%
choose to apply the child care um credit
 
02:21:13.670 --> 02:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
against the BET BBT or a combination of
 
02:21:16.389 --> 02:21:16.399 align:start position:0%
the both because it can be read that it
 
02:21:19.510 --> 02:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
can um that it could be stacked um
 
02:21:21.469 --> 02:21:21.479 align:start position:0%
that's one interpretation so just to
 
02:21:23.270 --> 02:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
make that clear that if that is the
 
02:21:26.190 --> 02:21:26.200 align:start position:0%
intent or not the intent of the
 
02:21:29.469 --> 02:21:29.479 align:start position:0%
bill we also suggest additional
 
02:21:32.270 --> 02:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
clarifying language added to section two
 
02:21:34.950 --> 02:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
of the of the bill clarifying whether
 
02:21:38.230 --> 02:21:38.240 align:start position:0%
the credit allowed is 50% of the
 
02:21:40.150 --> 02:21:40.160 align:start position:0%
expenditures from maternity aternity
 
02:21:42.990 --> 02:21:43.000 align:start position:0%
leave greater than the 12 weeks or if
 
02:21:45.190 --> 02:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
it's the full expenditures of the
 
02:21:46.910 --> 02:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
maternity paternity leave greater than
 
02:21:48.870 --> 02:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
12 12 weeks because that the way it
 
02:21:50.230 --> 02:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
reads it's like the
 
02:21:53.510 --> 02:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
50% um under the uh Paid Family Leave
 
02:21:56.510 --> 02:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
Act or the 12 weeks and we weren't sure
 
02:21:58.750 --> 02:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
if that's at 50 or
 
02:21:58.760 --> 02:22:00.910 align:start position:0%
if that's at 50 or
100%

02:22:00.910 --> 02:22:00.920 align:start position:0%
100%
 
02:22:08.630 --> 02:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:12.150 --> 02:22:12.160 align:start position:0%
no um also um this based on the uh the
 
02:22:15.670 --> 02:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
conversation that was uh had earlier on
 
02:22:18.309 --> 02:22:18.319 align:start position:0%
with the previous uh
 
02:22:20.389 --> 02:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
testimony uh I think a lot of the
 
02:22:23.550 --> 02:22:23.560 align:start position:0%
discussion was on the qualification of
 
02:22:26.270 --> 02:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
the um I guess the taxpayer or the
 
02:22:28.630 --> 02:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
employee um if there is going to be any
 
02:22:31.429 --> 02:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
changes to that uh I would say to be
 
02:22:33.950 --> 02:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
honest um we're not very familiar with
 
02:22:36.550 --> 02:22:36.560 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire childcare credit uh
 
02:22:39.950 --> 02:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
scholarship program um and if if
 
02:22:42.190 --> 02:22:42.200 align:start position:0%
everything if the qualification of the
 
02:22:45.270 --> 02:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
um the taxpayer or the um the employee
 
02:22:48.070 --> 02:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
hes on that um
 
02:22:49.790 --> 02:22:49.800 align:start position:0%
that item or that qualifying for that
 
02:22:51.590 --> 02:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
that program I think we probably would
 
02:22:53.750 --> 02:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
need more specific clarification as to
 
02:22:55.710 --> 02:22:55.720 align:start position:0%
um the specific statute or specific
 
02:22:58.910 --> 02:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
requirements that needs to be met um so
 
02:23:01.429 --> 02:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
it's clearer to to the Dr when we
 
02:23:05.830 --> 02:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:07.950 --> 02:23:07.960 align:start position:0%
program and that point you just made
 
02:23:13.990 --> 02:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:18.870 --> 02:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
okay you don't find the
 
02:23:22.030 --> 02:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
no uh we we had not focused on that
 
02:23:23.750 --> 02:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
piece when we were when we were
 
02:23:25.110 --> 02:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
preparing this fiscal no we were just
 
02:23:26.830 --> 02:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
more focused on okay can we calculate
 
02:23:30.190 --> 02:23:30.200 align:start position:0%
the numbers how does this really work um
 
02:23:32.670 --> 02:23:32.680 align:start position:0%
yeah and also I think uh on the back of
 
02:23:34.950 --> 02:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
the U at the back of the bill where
 
02:23:36.790 --> 02:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
where the fiscal no is
 
02:23:41.110 --> 02:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
attached where it mentions the um to be
 
02:23:42.750 --> 02:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
eligible for the New Hampshire childcare
 
02:23:44.150 --> 02:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
credit program Federal property
 
02:23:47.110 --> 02:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
guidelines can exceed 250% that last
 
02:23:49.389 --> 02:23:49.399 align:start position:0%
line there I believe that is added in by
 
02:23:52.790 --> 02:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
the LBA I suspect as
 
02:23:55.790 --> 02:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
much on on the uh the back of the bill
 
02:24:00.110 --> 02:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
page the last page of the bill the last
 
02:24:02.309 --> 02:24:02.319 align:start position:0%
line yeah I believe that that might have
 
02:24:06.750 --> 02:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:10.269 --> 02:24:10.279 align:start position:0%
LBA yeah representative PL I was perhaps
 
02:24:12.469 --> 02:24:12.479 align:start position:0%
a bit too lazy and in my notes I said
 
02:24:14.870 --> 02:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
please see fiscal note for other points
 
02:24:16.469 --> 02:24:16.479 align:start position:0%
but you just made a point that's not in
 
02:24:17.510 --> 02:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
the fiscal not
 
02:24:19.750 --> 02:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
would you please repeat
 
02:24:22.070 --> 02:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
it uh the point that I was making was
 
02:24:25.349 --> 02:24:25.359 align:start position:0%
just to seek additional clarification if
 
02:24:28.710 --> 02:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
um if based on the previous testimony
 
02:24:31.670 --> 02:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
that the qualification for the
 
02:24:35.670 --> 02:24:35.680 align:start position:0%
program hinges on specifically on the uh
 
02:24:37.790 --> 02:24:37.800 align:start position:0%
qualification of the New
 
02:24:42.150 --> 02:24:42.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Child Care scholarship program
 
02:24:44.950 --> 02:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
uh and whether it is the um to cover the
 
02:24:46.750 --> 02:24:46.760 align:start position:0%
cost sharing portion or not the cost
 
02:24:49.630 --> 02:24:49.640 align:start position:0%
Shar sharing portion um so that that
 
02:24:51.950 --> 02:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
that kind of clarification would be uh
 
02:25:00.590 --> 02:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:03.870 --> 02:25:03.880 align:start position:0%
program yes represent fellows thank you
 
02:25:07.790 --> 02:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
um I asked a question earlier about a
 
02:25:12.630 --> 02:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
business and under federal tax
 
02:25:16.590 --> 02:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
law uh what can they do if they want to
 
02:25:19.870 --> 02:25:19.880 align:start position:0%
offer offer like Child Care vouchers to
 
02:25:23.309 --> 02:25:23.319 align:start position:0%
employees or if they wanted to have an
 
02:25:26.429 --> 02:25:26.439 align:start position:0%
onsite Child Care
 
02:25:29.790 --> 02:25:29.800 align:start position:0%
Facility can they claim that those
 
02:25:33.830 --> 02:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
expenditures as um is are they just
 
02:25:37.230 --> 02:25:37.240 align:start position:0%
expenditures of the company or does the
 
02:25:39.309 --> 02:25:39.319 align:start position:0%
F and does the federal government have
 
02:25:41.190 --> 02:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
any tax
 
02:25:45.870 --> 02:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:45.880 --> 02:25:47.830 align:start position:0%
 
care

02:25:47.830 --> 02:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
care
 
02:25:50.230 --> 02:25:50.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um the way the New
 
02:25:52.309 --> 02:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire business taxes calculations
 
02:25:58.429 --> 02:25:58.439 align:start position:0%
start is from theal yeah so for I guess
 
02:26:00.389 --> 02:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
the short answer is we we don't know
 
02:26:01.990 --> 02:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
because the way we calculate the New
 
02:26:04.790 --> 02:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire business taxes is from line 28
 
02:26:06.670 --> 02:26:06.680 align:start position:0%
of the federal return it's before any
 
02:26:10.950 --> 02:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:13.990 --> 02:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
return so you don't you're telling me
 
02:26:17.269 --> 02:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
you don't know mhm yeah so essentially
 
02:26:19.950 --> 02:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
um the starting point for the new to
 
02:26:21.990 --> 02:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
calculate the New Hampshire side of the
 
02:26:25.830 --> 02:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
taxes is 928 before credits so if
 
02:26:27.710 --> 02:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
there's a federal Credit that's allowed
 
02:26:29.590 --> 02:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
on the federal side um that would not
 
02:26:31.429 --> 02:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
flow through to the New Hampshire return
 
02:26:32.710 --> 02:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
unless there's some kind of specific
 
02:26:36.269 --> 02:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
legislation that allows that follow up
 
02:26:39.790 --> 02:26:39.800 align:start position:0%
and if it's if they can claim it as an
 
02:26:42.030 --> 02:26:42.040 align:start position:0%
expenditure yep if it's claim as
 
02:26:43.710 --> 02:26:43.720 align:start position:0%
expenditure it would be before line 28
 
02:26:44.830 --> 02:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
and it would flow through to the New
 
02:26:47.750 --> 02:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire return and do and and do you
 
02:26:51.710 --> 02:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
know if they can claim it as an
 
02:26:55.150 --> 02:26:55.160 align:start position:0%
expenditure on the federal
 
02:26:58.070 --> 02:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
side why not yeah if it's an if it's an
 
02:27:00.950 --> 02:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
allowed deduction that's um by the
 
02:27:03.590 --> 02:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
federal by by the Internal Revenue code
 
02:27:06.030 --> 02:27:06.040 align:start position:0%
yeah it will be allowed in that sense
 
02:27:09.269 --> 02:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
and then so the New Hampshire tax laws
 
02:27:13.510 --> 02:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
piggy backs off well of the IRC of 2018
 
02:27:15.630 --> 02:27:15.640 align:start position:0%
so if that's allowed on the federal side
 
02:27:17.349 --> 02:27:17.359 align:start position:0%
we would then no that would flow through
 
02:27:19.349 --> 02:27:19.359 align:start position:0%
and there would be no adjustment for
 
02:27:21.389 --> 02:27:21.399 align:start position:0%
that deduction on the New Hampshire site
 
02:27:23.910 --> 02:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
unless there's additional legislation on
 
02:27:25.550 --> 02:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire site that changes that
 
02:27:29.309 --> 02:27:29.319 align:start position:0%
just one more followup so forget about
 
02:27:32.469 --> 02:27:32.479 align:start position:0%
child tax credits are there other kinds
 
02:27:32.479 --> 02:27:34.150 align:start position:0%
child tax credits are there other kinds
of

02:27:34.150 --> 02:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:27:34.160 --> 02:27:36.110 align:start position:0%
of
expenditures

02:27:36.110 --> 02:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
expenditures
 
02:27:39.950 --> 02:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
that um the state of New Hampshire
 
02:27:44.070 --> 02:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
allows get them to add in or to subtract
 
02:27:45.910 --> 02:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
maybe so you're you're starting out with
 
02:27:48.790 --> 02:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
that line 20 8 and then are there
 
02:27:52.030 --> 02:27:52.040 align:start position:0%
certain kinds of expenditures
 
02:27:56.190 --> 02:27:56.200 align:start position:0%
or credits that the federal government
 
02:27:59.349 --> 02:27:59.359 align:start position:0%
didn't already take take that they're
 
02:28:03.070 --> 02:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
allowed to deduct for the New Hampshire
 
02:28:05.389 --> 02:28:05.399 align:start position:0%
business tax are you talking about just
 
02:28:07.710 --> 02:28:07.720 align:start position:0%
Child Care related or just any any
 
02:28:09.150 --> 02:28:09.160 align:start position:0%
credit oh yeah there's all sorts of
 
02:28:11.230 --> 02:28:11.240 align:start position:0%
other there are there is a section in
 
02:28:14.150 --> 02:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
the uh the BPT statute for additions and
 
02:28:16.870 --> 02:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
deductions so there are additions and
 
02:28:18.990 --> 02:28:19.000 align:start position:0%
deductions as well that's on top of
 
02:28:20.990 --> 02:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
what's on the federal line
 
02:28:28.230 --> 02:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:31.030 --> 02:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
yep okay uh represent Alma you look like
 
02:28:33.630 --> 02:28:33.640 align:start position:0%
you want to ask a question I'm just
 
02:28:37.269 --> 02:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how complex it
 
02:28:40.030 --> 02:28:40.040 align:start position:0%
would be trying to put together
 
02:28:42.590 --> 02:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
microphone trying to figure out how
 
02:28:45.830 --> 02:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
complex it would be to put together New
 
02:28:47.870 --> 02:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire tax
 
02:28:54.309 --> 02:28:54.319 align:start position:0%
law and a tax credit within that on with
 
02:28:59.030 --> 02:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:02.830 --> 02:29:02.840 align:start position:0%
program on as a basis starting as a
 
02:29:07.910 --> 02:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
basis for it which is what we seem to be
 
02:29:12.309 --> 02:29:12.319 align:start position:0%
doing because one is dealing with
 
02:29:15.910 --> 02:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
families and each family is given a
 
02:29:18.469 --> 02:29:18.479 align:start position:0%
different uh level of support depending
 
02:29:22.630 --> 02:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
on how big it is and how poor it is and
 
02:29:25.750 --> 02:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
on the other is
 
02:29:33.110 --> 02:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:35.389 --> 02:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
employees yeah I can see that that would
 
02:29:37.309 --> 02:29:37.319 align:start position:0%
be complicated because um the way I
 
02:29:40.870 --> 02:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
write the bill is um it is dependent on
 
02:29:43.309 --> 02:29:43.319 align:start position:0%
the it ref it references the taxpayer
 
02:29:44.510 --> 02:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer being the business
 
02:29:46.469 --> 02:29:46.479 align:start position:0%
organization so the business organiz
 
02:29:47.790 --> 02:29:47.800 align:start position:0%
ization would have paid certain
 
02:29:50.550 --> 02:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
expenditure for uh the qualifying
 
02:29:53.910 --> 02:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
expenditure for child care and then um
 
02:29:57.710 --> 02:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
so in that sense to try to go back to
 
02:29:59.510 --> 02:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
the uh the New Hampshire childcare
 
02:30:02.590 --> 02:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
scholarship program using that as the
 
02:30:06.150 --> 02:30:06.160 align:start position:0%
qualif qualifier uh I think we need to
 
02:30:11.389 --> 02:30:11.399 align:start position:0%
fully understand um that program first
 
02:30:16.469 --> 02:30:16.479 align:start position:0%
and then um how legislation wants to
 
02:30:19.349 --> 02:30:19.359 align:start position:0%
determine that okay at which level the
 
02:30:21.309 --> 02:30:21.319 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
02:30:25.030 --> 02:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
expenditure would then meet the uh the
 
02:30:26.870 --> 02:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
requirement where this credit would then
 
02:30:28.510 --> 02:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
kick in I think that would be a
 
02:30:30.429 --> 02:30:30.439 align:start position:0%
step-by-step approach there I I think
 
02:30:32.309 --> 02:30:32.319 align:start position:0%
probably the first step is just to fully
 
02:30:35.030 --> 02:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
understand the U the New Hampshire Child
 
02:30:37.950 --> 02:30:37.960 align:start position:0%
Care scholarship program represent
 
02:30:40.510 --> 02:30:40.520 align:start position:0%
spillsbury yes thank you Mr chairman as
 
02:30:42.750 --> 02:30:42.760 align:start position:0%
so without making a prediction of how
 
02:30:46.750 --> 02:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
soon or How likely it is that the total
 
02:30:49.830 --> 02:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh credits claimed would aggregate to 10
 
02:30:54.670 --> 02:30:54.680 align:start position:0%
million just not trying to assign um
 
02:30:57.510 --> 02:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
levels of predictability but if that
 
02:30:59.950 --> 02:30:59.960 align:start position:0%
occurred it would then require the Dr to
 
02:31:02.150 --> 02:31:02.160 align:start position:0%
recalculate all the credits and impose a
 
02:31:03.990 --> 02:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
prattle limitation back on each
 
02:31:06.190 --> 02:31:06.200 align:start position:0%
individual taxpayer am I
 
02:31:08.710 --> 02:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
correct yes that would be correct so it'
 
02:31:11.150 --> 02:31:11.160 align:start position:0%
be I I think it looks something like the
 
02:31:14.510 --> 02:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
the R&amp;D credit um where there's a cap on
 
02:31:17.190 --> 02:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
on the credit so we would have to wait
 
02:31:19.269 --> 02:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
for all the applications for any
 
02:31:21.590 --> 02:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
particular tax year to come in and then
 
02:31:23.830 --> 02:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
to see if it exceeds the the $10 million
 
02:31:26.670 --> 02:31:26.680 align:start position:0%
or not um and then do the necessary
 
02:31:30.590 --> 02:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
pratic calculation yeah thank
 
02:31:35.469 --> 02:31:35.479 align:start position:0%
you all right seeing Oh represent
 
02:31:39.590 --> 02:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
Eller thank you for taking my
 
02:31:43.750 --> 02:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
questions the um you went you just
 
02:31:46.190 --> 02:31:46.200 align:start position:0%
indicated that this appears to be a kind
 
02:31:50.349 --> 02:31:50.359 align:start position:0%
of of a um a difficult or a
 
02:31:54.870 --> 02:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
administrative um complexity in meshing
 
02:31:57.389 --> 02:31:57.399 align:start position:0%
the child credit program with the
 
02:32:01.429 --> 02:32:01.439 align:start position:0%
federal program with this particular U
 
02:32:01.439 --> 02:32:04.429 align:start position:0%
federal program with this particular U
tax

02:32:04.429 --> 02:32:04.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:07.910 --> 02:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
credit in your estimation from Dr stand
 
02:32:10.830 --> 02:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
would it be more
 
02:32:14.269 --> 02:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
simpler is it more simpler simp would it
 
02:32:19.469 --> 02:32:19.479 align:start position:0%
be simpler to to just
 
02:32:25.150 --> 02:32:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:29.550 --> 02:32:29.560 align:start position:0%
deduction for the provision of to a cap
 
02:32:32.389 --> 02:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
of to an aggregate
 
02:32:35.630 --> 02:32:35.640 align:start position:0%
of um type
 
02:32:38.309 --> 02:32:38.319 align:start position:0%
legislation and then combine that with
 
02:32:42.070 --> 02:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh piggyback that on top of whatever if
 
02:32:45.230 --> 02:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
the federal government allows a business
 
02:32:47.870 --> 02:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
deduction would that make it easier for
 
02:32:49.990 --> 02:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
Dr to administer the bill there we go I
 
02:32:51.269 --> 02:32:51.279 align:start position:0%
got the
 
02:32:54.349 --> 02:32:54.359 align:start position:0%
question um just to to to backtrack on
 
02:32:55.950 --> 02:32:55.960 align:start position:0%
what I mentioned earlier first off I
 
02:32:57.790 --> 02:32:57.800 align:start position:0%
think we just need to uh in terms of the
 
02:32:59.710 --> 02:32:59.720 align:start position:0%
complexity it's just to first off we
 
02:33:01.590 --> 02:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
need need to understand the the workings
 
02:33:03.469 --> 02:33:03.479 align:start position:0%
of the uh the New Hampshire Child Care
 
02:33:06.349 --> 02:33:06.359 align:start position:0%
scholarship program and essentially what
 
02:33:09.349 --> 02:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
are their qualifications and and and the
 
02:33:13.349 --> 02:33:13.359 align:start position:0%
thresholds um and then then then applied
 
02:33:15.630 --> 02:33:15.640 align:start position:0%
this legislation as to how it would then
 
02:33:17.269 --> 02:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
carry out but then to answer your
 
02:33:19.469 --> 02:33:19.479 align:start position:0%
question um definitely yes if if it's
 
02:33:21.309 --> 02:33:21.319 align:start position:0%
just a straight up uh allowing an
 
02:33:24.349 --> 02:33:24.359 align:start position:0%
expenses deduction on the New Hampshire
 
02:33:27.469 --> 02:33:27.479 align:start position:0%
tax returns um without considering any
 
02:33:30.230 --> 02:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
other um qualifications to be met
 
02:33:33.950 --> 02:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
so unless other than uh the the taxpayer
 
02:33:36.309 --> 02:33:36.319 align:start position:0%
or the business organization having paid
 
02:33:39.990 --> 02:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
the expense uh directly to the child
 
02:33:41.990 --> 02:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
care provider like like what it stated
 
02:33:44.990 --> 02:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
in in the bill um and then or maybe up
 
02:33:47.710 --> 02:33:47.720 align:start position:0%
to a certain amount uh of uh cap on the
 
02:33:50.349 --> 02:33:50.359 align:start position:0%
expense allowed um yeah that I think
 
02:33:52.150 --> 02:33:52.160 align:start position:0%
that would be more straightforward for
 
02:33:52.160 --> 02:33:53.030 align:start position:0%
that would be more straightforward for
sure

02:33:53.030 --> 02:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:33:57.150 --> 02:33:57.160 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you I'm thinking um at this
 
02:33:59.790 --> 02:33:59.800 align:start position:0%
point maybe we should um given there's
 
02:34:02.230 --> 02:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
some question about the child care uh
 
02:34:04.469 --> 02:34:04.479 align:start position:0%
scholarship program and how that
 
02:34:06.790 --> 02:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
connects I'm wondering if we should
 
02:34:09.309 --> 02:34:09.319 align:start position:0%
defer any further questions uh to a work
 
02:34:11.670 --> 02:34:11.680 align:start position:0%
session and have you back at that at
 
02:34:15.070 --> 02:34:15.080 align:start position:0%
that time
 
02:34:15.080 --> 02:34:16.870 align:start position:0%
that time
HHS

02:34:16.870 --> 02:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
HHS
 
02:34:39.910 --> 02:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:41.990 --> 02:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
much okay was there anyone else that
 
02:34:45.070 --> 02:34:45.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to testify on HP
 
02:34:45.080 --> 02:34:47.429 align:start position:0%
wanted to testify on HP

02:35:50.309 --> 02:35:50.319 align:start position:0%
this bill is pretty
 
02:35:52.830 --> 02:35:52.840 align:start position:0%
straightforward uh it establishes a

three member study committee one Senator
 
02:35:58.269 --> 02:35:58.279 align:start position:0%
and two Representatives uh to study the

02:36:12.630 --> 02:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
year first question what is a low-income
 
02:36:15.230 --> 02:36:15.240 align:start position:0%
housing tax credit uh this is a concept
 
02:36:17.469 --> 02:36:17.479 align:start position:0%
that has been successfully implemented
 
02:36:20.030 --> 02:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
at the federal level uh and in more than
 
02:36:21.670 --> 02:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
half of the states with the goal of
 
02:36:24.590 --> 02:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
generating private investment in
 
02:36:24.600 --> 02:36:25.710 align:start position:0%
generating private investment in
affordable

02:36:25.710 --> 02:36:25.720 align:start position:0%
affordable
 
02:36:28.030 --> 02:36:28.040 align:start position:0%
housing the way it works and some
 
02:36:31.510 --> 02:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
aspects uh vary you know based on how
 
02:36:33.950 --> 02:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
each state implements it uh is that
 
02:36:36.469 --> 02:36:36.479 align:start position:0%
developers are provided a credit on
 
02:36:39.590 --> 02:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
taxes owed for investments in affordable
 
02:36:42.070 --> 02:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
housing the federal government has a
 
02:36:44.870 --> 02:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
low-income housing tax credit program uh
 
02:36:47.389 --> 02:36:47.399 align:start position:0%
which was established in 1986 under the
 
02:36:47.399 --> 02:36:48.429 align:start position:0%
which was established in 1986 under the
Reagan

Reagan
 
02:36:50.269 --> 02:36:50.279 align:start position:0%
Administration uh under the federal
 
02:36:51.910 --> 02:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
program developers are offered
 
02:36:54.469 --> 02:36:54.479 align:start position:0%
non-refundable and transferable tax
 
02:36:56.469 --> 02:36:56.479 align:start position:0%
credits to subsidize the construction
 
02:36:57.910 --> 02:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
and Rehabilitation of housing
 
02:36:59.630 --> 02:36:59.640 align:start position:0%
developments that have strict income
 
02:37:02.510 --> 02:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
limits for eligible tenants and their
 
02:37:03.870 --> 02:37:03.880 align:start position:0%
cost of
 
02:37:06.630 --> 02:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
housing since it was created the Federal
 
02:37:10.349 --> 02:37:10.359 align:start position:0%
program has subsidized over
 
02:37:13.910 --> 02:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
47,500 projects and 3.13 million housing
 
02:37:19.030 --> 02:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
units uses an average of uh $8 billion
 
02:37:21.750 --> 02:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
in forone revenue forone revenue excuse
 
02:37:24.550 --> 02:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
me uh to subsidize the costs of building
 
02:37:28.269 --> 02:37:28.279 align:start position:0%
more than 107,000 units across
 
02:37:30.950 --> 02:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
1,411 projects each
 
02:37:34.070 --> 02:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
year 28 other states have implemented
 
02:37:35.870 --> 02:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
some version of their own low-income
 
02:37:37.630 --> 02:37:37.640 align:start position:0%
housing tax credit program including
 
02:37:39.910 --> 02:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
every other state in New England the
 
02:37:41.990 --> 02:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
programs vary widely with respect to
 
02:37:44.630 --> 02:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
duration of the tax credit term and the
 
02:37:46.710 --> 02:37:46.720 align:start position:0%
share of the contribution against which
 
02:37:48.910 --> 02:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
the credits may be claimed the eligible
 
02:37:50.469 --> 02:37:50.479 align:start position:0%
activities and affordability
 
02:37:52.510 --> 02:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
requirements uh and other program
 
02:37:55.510 --> 02:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
features which is very much why uh
 
02:37:57.429 --> 02:37:57.439 align:start position:0%
calling for a study in this bill there's
 
02:37:59.070 --> 02:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
so many different ways that you can go
 
02:38:01.870 --> 02:38:01.880 align:start position:0%
about uh structuring the program some
 
02:38:03.910 --> 02:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
states separate their tax credit program
 
02:38:06.309 --> 02:38:06.319 align:start position:0%
from the federal uh low-income housing
 
02:38:08.030 --> 02:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
tax credit program While others
 
02:38:10.830 --> 02:38:10.840 align:start position:0%
piggyback on the federal tax credit and
 
02:38:12.630 --> 02:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
automatically award State credits to
 
02:38:15.550 --> 02:38:15.560 align:start position:0%
investors in the federal program uh to
 
02:38:17.590 --> 02:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
help fill gaps in development
 
02:38:20.710 --> 02:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
costs uh I don't have to tell all of you
 
02:38:22.670 --> 02:38:22.680 align:start position:0%
but here in New Hampshire uh we
 
02:38:24.670 --> 02:38:24.680 align:start position:0%
desperately need more housing especially
 
02:38:26.670 --> 02:38:26.680 align:start position:0%
affordable housing uh to ensure that our
 
02:38:28.030 --> 02:38:28.040 align:start position:0%
businesses have the workers that they
 
02:38:29.670 --> 02:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
need and seniors have a place to
 
02:38:32.349 --> 02:38:32.359 align:start position:0%
downsize and young people can afford to
 
02:38:34.550 --> 02:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
move to our state it can be challenging
 
02:38:36.349 --> 02:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
for developers to make the financial
 
02:38:38.830 --> 02:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
math uh work for Workforce housing and
 
02:38:41.110 --> 02:38:41.120 align:start position:0%
affordable housing options uh this is
 
02:38:43.550 --> 02:38:43.560 align:start position:0%
true for for-profit nonprofit and
 
02:38:45.790 --> 02:38:45.800 align:start position:0%
housing authorities developers utilize
 
02:38:48.030 --> 02:38:48.040 align:start position:0%
Iz Capital Stacks that line up all the
 
02:38:49.550 --> 02:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
various funding sources to make a
 
02:38:49.560 --> 02:38:50.429 align:start position:0%
various funding sources to make a
project

02:38:50.429 --> 02:38:50.439 align:start position:0%
project
 
02:38:53.150 --> 02:38:53.160 align:start position:0%
work and there are limited state level
 
02:38:55.590 --> 02:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
Financial tools available for affordable
 
02:38:57.070 --> 02:38:57.080 align:start position:0%
housing at a time when we desperately
 
02:38:59.309 --> 02:38:59.319 align:start position:0%
need it um you know we have the
 
02:39:01.230 --> 02:39:01.240 align:start position:0%
affordable housing fund we have invest
 
02:39:03.710 --> 02:39:03.720 align:start position:0%
NH uh these are programs that support
 
02:39:05.870 --> 02:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
affordable housing um but this is
 
02:39:08.190 --> 02:39:08.200 align:start position:0%
intentionally a broader program the
 
02:39:10.550 --> 02:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
study would determine how the tax credit
 
02:39:13.510 --> 02:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
is implemented including which agency or
 
02:39:17.429 --> 02:39:17.439 align:start position:0%
organization would award an admin Min it
 
02:39:20.190 --> 02:39:20.200 align:start position:0%
um and you know as I was sitting and
 
02:39:22.990 --> 02:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
listening to the the previous Bill uh
 
02:39:24.950 --> 02:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
which prescribes a new tax credit
 
02:39:28.870 --> 02:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
program uh House Bill 1470 would create
 
02:39:31.590 --> 02:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
space to study the issue over the summer
 
02:39:33.670 --> 02:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
uh and fall and allow for a vetted
 
02:39:35.230 --> 02:39:35.240 align:start position:0%
proposal to be ready for the legislature
 
02:39:37.550 --> 02:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
to consider uh as part of next year's
 
02:39:40.269 --> 02:39:40.279 align:start position:0%
budget cycle so I you know I would
 
02:39:43.950 --> 02:39:43.960 align:start position:0%
encourage you uh you know consider the
 
02:39:48.070 --> 02:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
bill uh but also oo uh want to encourage
 
02:39:49.429 --> 02:39:49.439 align:start position:0%
you to consider an
 
02:39:52.190 --> 02:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
amendment uh to expand the duties to
 
02:39:54.950 --> 02:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
consider other tax incentives to
 
02:39:55.990 --> 02:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
increase the production and
 
02:39:58.150 --> 02:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
affordability of housing uh and
 
02:39:59.590 --> 02:39:59.600 align:start position:0%
encourage the study committee to
 
02:40:01.269 --> 02:40:01.279 align:start position:0%
recommend proposed legislation for the
 
02:40:06.150 --> 02:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
2025 session I've got a uh a draft of of
 
02:40:07.910 --> 02:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
that proposed amendment just makes a
 
02:40:12.070 --> 02:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
minor tweak to um number three duties uh
 
02:40:13.830 --> 02:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
and I'll pass that around but you know
 
02:40:15.110 --> 02:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
this is really an opportunity for
 
02:40:17.349 --> 02:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
businesses to reduce uh their New
 
02:40:18.950 --> 02:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire tax burden by investing in
 
02:40:20.590 --> 02:40:20.600 align:start position:0%
desperately needed affordable housing
 
02:40:22.950 --> 02:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
options it's a real win-win uh for
 
02:40:25.349 --> 02:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
housing and for our businesses so happy
 
02:40:27.030 --> 02:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
to take questions but also recognize
 
02:40:28.710 --> 02:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
that uh we've got some real housing
 
02:40:32.150 --> 02:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
experts behind us okay representative PL
 
02:40:34.190 --> 02:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
yes thank you I saw that you were
 
02:40:36.230 --> 02:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
reading from prepared notes would you
 
02:40:38.349 --> 02:40:38.359 align:start position:0%
mind submitting them absolutely you were
 
02:40:40.150 --> 02:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
speaking five times fast so than I could
 
02:40:42.750 --> 02:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
type you bet okay thank you thank you
 
02:40:45.190 --> 02:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
representative representative fellows um
 
02:40:47.030 --> 02:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
yes I'm just wondering if we could see
 
02:40:51.510 --> 02:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
that Amendment um before we let you get
 
02:40:53.469 --> 02:40:53.479 align:start position:0%
out of your chair absolutely you didn't
 
02:40:55.070 --> 02:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
get out of the chair to hand that around
 
02:40:57.230 --> 02:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna do that real quick because one
 
02:41:02.190 --> 02:41:02.200 align:start position:0%
of my um concerns is the scope of it and
 
02:41:05.710 --> 02:41:05.720 align:start position:0%
and just from the basic bill it doesn't
 
02:41:10.429 --> 02:41:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:13.389 --> 02:41:13.399 align:start position:0%
well the
 
02:41:16.110 --> 02:41:16.120 align:start position:0%
notes in the notes I don't have copies
 
02:41:17.750 --> 02:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
for everybody representative but I'll
 
02:41:19.670 --> 02:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
I'll make sure you get them uh
 
02:41:21.030 --> 02:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
representative Aly followed by
 
02:41:21.040 --> 02:41:22.190 align:start position:0%
representative Aly followed by
representative

02:41:22.190 --> 02:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:41:26.990 --> 02:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
Ro yes on do you have something that
 
02:41:29.269 --> 02:41:29.279 align:start position:0%
explains or is someone else going to
 
02:41:31.150 --> 02:41:31.160 align:start position:0%
provide something that
 
02:41:35.110 --> 02:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
explains uh the federal
 
02:41:37.349 --> 02:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
program we can get you more information
 
02:41:40.190 --> 02:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
on that and why
 
02:41:42.710 --> 02:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
only two
 
02:41:45.429 --> 02:41:45.439 align:start position:0%
people well that is certainly I'll
 
02:41:46.990 --> 02:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
answer the second part of the question
 
02:41:50.190 --> 02:41:50.200 align:start position:0%
first um that is certainly up to your
 
02:41:53.150 --> 02:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
committee to decide uh what is in the
 
02:41:55.750 --> 02:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
the final package that we vote on on the
 
02:41:58.389 --> 02:41:58.399 align:start position:0%
floor so if you want to expand it um
 
02:42:00.990 --> 02:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
please feel free um just a jumping off
 
02:42:04.590 --> 02:42:04.600 align:start position:0%
point uh as for the federal liac or the
 
02:42:08.269 --> 02:42:08.279 align:start position:0%
low-income housing tax credit program um
 
02:42:10.230 --> 02:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
I think some of the issue experts may be
 
02:42:12.269 --> 02:42:12.279 align:start position:0%
able to share more about that um but we
 
02:42:13.750 --> 02:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
can also get you some additional
 
02:42:16.670 --> 02:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
information representative Al me
 
02:42:18.110 --> 02:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
uh representative Wilhelm does your
 
02:42:20.990 --> 02:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh fully replace the current
 
02:42:24.309 --> 02:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
bill uh I think in bold I don't now have
 
02:42:26.269 --> 02:42:26.279 align:start position:0%
a copy of it but I think in bold was the
 
02:42:29.550 --> 02:42:29.560 align:start position:0%
addition I see okay
 
02:42:33.950 --> 02:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
yeah uh did you have a followup or
 
02:42:37.990 --> 02:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:40.110 --> 02:42:40.120 align:start position:0%
roord okay it must be a separate
 
02:42:41.910 --> 02:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
question okay all right thank you Mr
 
02:42:43.790 --> 02:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
chairman so I
 
02:42:45.349 --> 02:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
I understand where you're getting
 
02:42:47.710 --> 02:42:47.720 align:start position:0%
getting at and um we you know the with
 
02:42:49.389 --> 02:42:49.399 align:start position:0%
the just to talk about the low-income
 
02:42:51.510 --> 02:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
housing I mean that certainly is an
 
02:42:53.389 --> 02:42:53.399 align:start position:0%
issue but also what I'm hearing a lot of
 
02:42:54.910 --> 02:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
is Workforce housing I mean it's not
 
02:42:57.429 --> 02:42:57.439 align:start position:0%
necessarily low income but there are
 
02:42:59.469 --> 02:42:59.479 align:start position:0%
people that have jobs they are making
 
02:43:02.269 --> 02:43:02.279 align:start position:0%
money they they still can't um they
 
02:43:04.309 --> 02:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
still can't find housing would you be
 
02:43:07.830 --> 02:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
willing to expand this to look at that
 
02:43:10.750 --> 02:43:10.760 align:start position:0%
those those Solutions as well thanks for
 
02:43:13.030 --> 02:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
the question representative uh certainly
 
02:43:15.630 --> 02:43:15.640 align:start position:0%
open to that um but do want to put the
 
02:43:17.510 --> 02:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
federal program front and center because
 
02:43:19.790 --> 02:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
I think depending on how a program is
 
02:43:21.950 --> 02:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
structured it may need to fit into the
 
02:43:23.790 --> 02:43:23.800 align:start position:0%
federal guidelines for low income
 
02:43:26.590 --> 02:43:26.600 align:start position:0%
housing um but certainly open to you
 
02:43:28.950 --> 02:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
know other possibilities uh to to
 
02:43:31.269 --> 02:43:31.279 align:start position:0%
address Workforce
 
02:43:33.950 --> 02:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
housing representative
 
02:43:36.070 --> 02:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
erery thank you representative for
 
02:43:37.070 --> 02:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
02:43:40.269 --> 02:43:40.279 align:start position:0%
question this may come off to hars but
 
02:43:43.750 --> 02:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
it's not meant that way um because this
 
02:43:47.269 --> 02:43:47.279 align:start position:0%
is an issue it's an an important issue
 
02:43:50.349 --> 02:43:50.359 align:start position:0%
you want to have this report done by
 
02:43:54.110 --> 02:43:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:56.950 --> 02:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
the put with any adjective in there you
 
02:44:00.309 --> 02:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
want to is this going to get done in
 
02:44:02.710 --> 02:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
that short period of time when we don't
 
02:44:05.349 --> 02:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
meet in August it's an election year
 
02:44:07.910 --> 02:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
that leaves October and November well it
 
02:44:10.830 --> 02:44:10.840 align:start position:0%
leaves October because November you got
 
02:44:12.590 --> 02:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
the election then after
 
02:44:14.710 --> 02:44:14.720 align:start position:0%
that people are going to care or they're
 
02:44:16.510 --> 02:44:16.520 align:start position:0%
not going to care here depending upon
 
02:44:18.590 --> 02:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
what happened in their own
 
02:44:22.349 --> 02:44:22.359 align:start position:0%
individual um election cycle in addition
 
02:44:23.870 --> 02:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
you have three
 
02:44:26.590 --> 02:44:26.600 align:start position:0%
people and yet you're you're going to be
 
02:44:29.190 --> 02:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
bringing in information with all the
 
02:44:32.469 --> 02:44:32.479 align:start position:0%
additions and everything else from uh it
 
02:44:33.910 --> 02:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
would seem that you would need someone
 
02:44:35.910 --> 02:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
from fiscal or Finance you would need
 
02:44:38.670 --> 02:44:38.680 align:start position:0%
someone from Health and Human Services
 
02:44:41.510 --> 02:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
um committees to be involved you need
 
02:44:43.230 --> 02:44:43.240 align:start position:0%
somebody from ways and means to be
 
02:44:46.110 --> 02:44:46.120 align:start position:0%
involved as to the effect on on on it
 
02:44:48.230 --> 02:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
seems to me that however
 
02:44:52.630 --> 02:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
well-intentioned this is it doesn't seem
 
02:44:59.269 --> 02:44:59.279 align:start position:0%
to meet a um committee
 
02:45:01.790 --> 02:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
qualification maybe a commission
 
02:45:05.110 --> 02:45:05.120 align:start position:0%
qualification with a multi-year task of
 
02:45:08.870 --> 02:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
it maybe more appropriate but it seems
 
02:45:11.590 --> 02:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:15.750 --> 02:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
it's not going to accomplish its goal
 
02:45:18.309 --> 02:45:18.319 align:start position:0%
unless there's a preconceived answer and
 
02:45:19.910 --> 02:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
that's you know
 
02:45:24.309 --> 02:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
that's conspiracy theory talking but um
 
02:45:26.830 --> 02:45:26.840 align:start position:0%
and we both know
 
02:45:29.750 --> 02:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
what so my question
 
02:45:32.309 --> 02:45:32.319 align:start position:0%
is even though this is well intentioned
 
02:45:34.670 --> 02:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
even though it addresses a topic is this
 
02:45:34.680 --> 02:45:37.910 align:start position:0%
even though it addresses a topic is this
bill

02:45:37.910 --> 02:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:39.950 --> 02:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
needed I think it's a great question
 
02:45:42.469 --> 02:45:42.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for it uh I think the timeline
 
02:45:45.469 --> 02:45:45.479 align:start position:0%
is ambitious but achievable I think you
 
02:45:48.510 --> 02:45:48.520 align:start position:0%
know to representative aly's Point um
 
02:45:50.910 --> 02:45:50.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps it needs to be a larger uh
 
02:45:53.070 --> 02:45:53.080 align:start position:0%
Committee of of Representatives and
 
02:45:55.190 --> 02:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
Senators that are uh rolling up their
 
02:45:57.230 --> 02:45:57.240 align:start position:0%
sleeves and dealing with it I mean
 
02:46:00.309 --> 02:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
question is is it needed I would argue
 
02:46:05.590 --> 02:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
yes and is it uh you know sh should we
 
02:46:07.830 --> 02:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
put it aside and say we're not going to
 
02:46:10.990 --> 02:46:11.000 align:start position:0%
start working on a plan uh or consider
 
02:46:14.309 --> 02:46:14.319 align:start position:0%
what might be possible uh versus
 
02:46:16.990 --> 02:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
actually getting started uh I would I
 
02:46:18.750 --> 02:46:18.760 align:start position:0%
would say let's get started no matter
 
02:46:22.230 --> 02:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
how big the task is repres shamber just
 
02:46:24.790 --> 02:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
a comment on representative olry you
 
02:46:27.110 --> 02:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
made the correct Point representative
 
02:46:30.070 --> 02:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
willham that it's 45 days after passage
 
02:46:31.710 --> 02:46:31.720 align:start position:0%
of this that it would start they don't
 
02:46:34.429 --> 02:46:34.439 align:start position:0%
have to wait till August September they
 
02:46:38.550 --> 02:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
can start in 1 of April if it's passed
 
02:46:39.510 --> 02:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
by the
 
02:46:42.030 --> 02:46:42.040 align:start position:0%
house well it has to get passed by the
 
02:46:44.110 --> 02:46:44.120 align:start position:0%
house over to the Senate passed by the
 
02:46:45.550 --> 02:46:45.560 align:start position:0%
Senate signed by the government Governor
 
02:46:48.910 --> 02:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
if people want to work it'll get
 
02:46:53.150 --> 02:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
done okay represent fellows um yes I'm
 
02:46:56.150 --> 02:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
wondering if you can Define what you
 
02:47:00.309 --> 02:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
mean by low what does it say low income
 
02:47:05.550 --> 02:47:05.560 align:start position:0%
low income housing um is I in in my mind
 
02:47:08.990 --> 02:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
that means subsidized housing so is that
 
02:47:11.269 --> 02:47:11.279 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about so I'm going
 
02:47:13.469 --> 02:47:13.479 align:start position:0%
to let the issue experts behind me
 
02:47:15.269 --> 02:47:15.279 align:start position:0%
address that one and also know that we
 
02:47:16.269 --> 02:47:16.279 align:start position:0%
need to get you some additional
 
02:47:17.870 --> 02:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
information on the federal program which
 
02:47:21.469 --> 02:47:21.479 align:start position:0%
I think will help to clarify okay
 
02:47:27.110 --> 02:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:30.670 --> 02:47:30.680 align:start position:0%
you next I have uh Ben
 
02:47:43.910 --> 02:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:43.920 --> 02:47:45.750 align:start position:0%
 
housing

02:47:45.750 --> 02:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
housing
 
02:47:48.389 --> 02:47:48.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and good afternoon
 
02:47:50.790 --> 02:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
committee members I'm Ben Frost I'm the
 
02:47:52.550 --> 02:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
deputy executive director and chief
 
02:47:54.429 --> 02:47:54.439 align:start position:0%
legal officer for New Hampshire housing
 
02:47:56.070 --> 02:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
we are the state's Housing Finance
 
02:48:00.110 --> 02:48:00.120 align:start position:0%
Agency and we are also the state's uh
 
02:48:02.230 --> 02:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
allocator of the federal low-income
 
02:48:03.950 --> 02:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
housing tax credit so I'm happy to
 
02:48:06.790 --> 02:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
address any program specific questions
 
02:48:09.510 --> 02:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh regarding that program um as
 
02:48:11.710 --> 02:48:11.720 align:start position:0%
representative Wilhelm indicated uh the
 
02:48:13.230 --> 02:48:13.240 align:start position:0%
the federal tax credit has been around
 
02:48:14.630 --> 02:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
for a long time as part of the corporate
 
02:48:17.269 --> 02:48:17.279 align:start position:0%
tax tax reform in 1986 made part of the
 
02:48:20.070 --> 02:48:20.080 align:start position:0%
permanent tax code in the early 9s and
 
02:48:22.830 --> 02:48:22.840 align:start position:0%
is the uh the Nations New Hampshire's
 
02:48:25.950 --> 02:48:25.960 align:start position:0%
included uh number one driver of uh the
 
02:48:28.389 --> 02:48:28.399 align:start position:0%
development of affordable housing uh it
 
02:48:30.550 --> 02:48:30.560 align:start position:0%
it is the thing that makes this stuff
 
02:48:33.630 --> 02:48:33.640 align:start position:0%
happen um and as representative wilham
 
02:48:36.070 --> 02:48:36.080 align:start position:0%
pointed out a number of other states I
 
02:48:40.190 --> 02:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
think he said 28 uh already have a state
 
02:48:42.230 --> 02:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh low-income housing tax credit another
 
02:48:44.469 --> 02:48:44.479 align:start position:0%
five are actively considering adoption
 
02:48:46.750 --> 02:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
of low-income housing tax credit uh this
 
02:48:50.349 --> 02:48:50.359 align:start position:0%
is not a a new idea it's a proven idea
 
02:48:52.630 --> 02:48:52.640 align:start position:0%
something that works and has worked for
 
02:48:52.640 --> 02:48:54.309 align:start position:0%
something that works and has worked for
decades

02:48:54.309 --> 02:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
decades
 
02:48:57.110 --> 02:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
um that the tax credit the federal tax
 
02:48:59.150 --> 02:48:59.160 align:start position:0%
credit and this is not to say that this
 
02:49:00.910 --> 02:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
is how New Hampshire's tax credit would
 
02:49:02.429 --> 02:49:02.439 align:start position:0%
work if if it were adopted by the
 
02:49:05.070 --> 02:49:05.080 align:start position:0%
legislature but the federal tax credit
 
02:49:06.990 --> 02:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
effectively is a public private
 
02:49:10.710 --> 02:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
partnership so on the state level uh a
 
02:49:12.670 --> 02:49:12.680 align:start position:0%
state agent and here in New Hampshire
 
02:49:15.670 --> 02:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
housing uh is the allocator and we put
 
02:49:18.510 --> 02:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
out um a essentially a call for
 
02:49:21.269 --> 02:49:21.279 align:start position:0%
proposals this is a competitive process
 
02:49:24.150 --> 02:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
developers present to us their proposals
 
02:49:26.910 --> 02:49:26.920 align:start position:0%
for development which have to be very
 
02:49:29.710 --> 02:49:29.720 align:start position:0%
welldeveloped uh that that that is they
 
02:49:31.670 --> 02:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
have to have their local permits in line
 
02:49:33.670 --> 02:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
they have to be ready to go pretty much
 
02:49:36.830 --> 02:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
but for the financing of the project uh
 
02:49:38.309 --> 02:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
that's the the one thing that's holding
 
02:49:41.190 --> 02:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
them back uh if they are successful if
 
02:49:44.030 --> 02:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
they meet threshold standards and then
 
02:49:47.030 --> 02:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh uh are competitive and get an award
 
02:49:50.590 --> 02:49:50.600 align:start position:0%
an allocation of a uh a tax credit they
 
02:49:53.070 --> 02:49:53.080 align:start position:0%
then the developer then has to go out
 
02:49:55.790 --> 02:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
and sell that tax credit to
 
02:49:59.630 --> 02:49:59.640 align:start position:0%
investors uh the investors um bid on
 
02:50:01.670 --> 02:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
this in an open market and this is often
 
02:50:05.550 --> 02:50:05.560 align:start position:0%
done through syndicators um but there
 
02:50:07.469 --> 02:50:07.479 align:start position:0%
there is a market for these tax credits
 
02:50:10.630 --> 02:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
which is very robust uh it's not quite
 
02:50:12.870 --> 02:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
as strong as it was uh since the more
 
02:50:15.670 --> 02:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
recent uh corporate tax reform but it is
 
02:50:19.150 --> 02:50:19.160 align:start position:0%
still very strong uh and uh as a result
 
02:50:21.269 --> 02:50:21.279 align:start position:0%
of the the investors involvement the
 
02:50:23.590 --> 02:50:23.600 align:start position:0%
investors essentially pay for those tax
 
02:50:26.229 --> 02:50:26.239 align:start position:0%
credits they become investors in the
 
02:50:28.870 --> 02:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
projects and in exchange get a a
 
02:50:31.309 --> 02:50:31.319 align:start position:0%
write-off against their Federal
 
02:50:33.349 --> 02:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
corporate income tax
 
02:50:35.710 --> 02:50:35.720 align:start position:0%
liability uh the developers then take
 
02:50:37.830 --> 02:50:37.840 align:start position:0%
that development equity and build the
 
02:50:41.830 --> 02:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
project uh the the investor gets under
 
02:50:45.550 --> 02:50:45.560 align:start position:0%
the federal law gets a A 10e year uh
 
02:50:47.510 --> 02:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
right off against uh whatever it
 
02:50:49.910 --> 02:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
purchased in in the market for its uh
 
02:50:52.950 --> 02:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
tax credit uh 10 years they're on the
 
02:50:57.910 --> 02:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
hook for 15 years uh so there is really
 
02:51:00.670 --> 02:51:00.680 align:start position:0%
strong um investor oversight of these
 
02:51:02.630 --> 02:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
projects so what we call Private Market
 
02:51:05.750 --> 02:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
discipline uh in these these low-income
 
02:51:08.670 --> 02:51:08.680 align:start position:0%
housing uh rental projects uh it's
 
02:51:10.469 --> 02:51:10.479 align:start position:0%
something that works and works really
 
02:51:10.479 --> 02:51:12.030 align:start position:0%
something that works and works really
well

02:51:12.030 --> 02:51:12.040 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:51:15.229 --> 02:51:15.239 align:start position:0%
um representative Aly I I I hope that
 
02:51:17.190 --> 02:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
addresses in part the question you asked
 
02:51:19.750 --> 02:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
about how the the program works as
 
02:51:21.510 --> 02:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
representative wilhem indicated we'd be
 
02:51:23.590 --> 02:51:23.600 align:start position:0%
happy to get you a lot more information
 
02:51:25.590 --> 02:51:25.600 align:start position:0%
and we can make it concise we can make
 
02:51:27.150 --> 02:51:27.160 align:start position:0%
it voluminous uh we'll start with
 
02:51:28.630 --> 02:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
concise and if you want voluminous we
 
02:51:31.469 --> 02:51:31.479 align:start position:0%
can give you that too it is arguably the
 
02:51:33.950 --> 02:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
most complex portion of the federal tax
 
02:51:37.630 --> 02:51:37.640 align:start position:0%
code um I've been told that um I don't
 
02:51:40.510 --> 02:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
delve into it myself um I leave that to
 
02:51:44.910 --> 02:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
others uh to do um uh representative Ro
 
02:51:46.750 --> 02:51:46.760 align:start position:0%
for you you asked about the difference
 
02:51:49.429 --> 02:51:49.439 align:start position:0%
between um uh Workforce housing and
 
02:51:51.750 --> 02:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
low-income housing the and this actually
 
02:51:53.630 --> 02:51:53.640 align:start position:0%
gets to representative fellow's question
 
02:51:56.229 --> 02:51:56.239 align:start position:0%
about what does low-income mean under
 
02:51:58.469 --> 02:51:58.479 align:start position:0%
federal law for the federal tax credit
 
02:52:02.030 --> 02:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
program uh low income means uh
 
02:52:05.469 --> 02:52:05.479 align:start position:0%
households earning up to 60% of the area
 
02:52:08.590 --> 02:52:08.600 align:start position:0%
Medan income and the areas are very
 
02:52:09.950 --> 02:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and the those
 
02:52:13.030 --> 02:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
income levels also vary those are uh
 
02:52:15.309 --> 02:52:15.319 align:start position:0%
defined annually by Hud
 
02:52:18.030 --> 02:52:18.040 align:start position:0%
although the federal program is not a
 
02:52:20.229 --> 02:52:20.239 align:start position:0%
HUD program it is a treasury program
 
02:52:21.670 --> 02:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
it's a tax credit
 
02:52:25.950 --> 02:52:25.960 align:start position:0%
program um a lot of the people a lot of
 
02:52:28.389 --> 02:52:28.399 align:start position:0%
the households occupying these projects
 
02:52:32.349 --> 02:52:32.359 align:start position:0%
are in fact in the workforce uh roughly
 
02:52:35.469 --> 02:52:35.479 align:start position:0%
2third of the households the the
 
02:52:37.790 --> 02:52:37.800 align:start position:0%
residents of low-income housing tax
 
02:52:39.510 --> 02:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
credit projects in New Hampshire are
 
02:52:41.790 --> 02:52:41.800 align:start position:0%
either elderly or disabled the remainder
 
02:52:44.429 --> 02:52:44.439 align:start position:0%
are in the workforce they are people who
 
02:52:47.110 --> 02:52:47.120 align:start position:0%
who are making uh incomes that are low
 
02:52:51.630 --> 02:52:51.640 align:start position:0%
they qualified to to reside there um uh
 
02:52:54.630 --> 02:52:54.640 align:start position:0%
but yes I'd say this as a study
 
02:52:57.429 --> 02:52:57.439 align:start position:0%
committee uh why not open it up to that
 
02:52:59.349 --> 02:52:59.359 align:start position:0%
that uh broader
 
02:53:03.510 --> 02:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
inquiry um as far as whether it's a
 
02:53:06.870 --> 02:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
committee or a commission uh as as
 
02:53:09.510 --> 02:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
introduced it's a committee um it it's
 
02:53:12.550 --> 02:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
immaterial to us uh we are happy to work
 
02:53:15.590 --> 02:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
with this committee and then uh if the
 
02:53:17.269 --> 02:53:17.279 align:start position:0%
legislature forms the study committee
 
02:53:19.309 --> 02:53:19.319 align:start position:0%
with that study committee uh to achieve
 
02:53:22.790 --> 02:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
the results in the time uh indicated uh
 
02:53:26.389 --> 02:53:26.399 align:start position:0%
it's it's the kind of work that we uh do
 
02:53:28.710 --> 02:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
I would be happy to take any questions
 
02:53:30.750 --> 02:53:30.760 align:start position:0%
um and just note that we also support
 
02:53:32.309 --> 02:53:32.319 align:start position:0%
the amendment uh proferred by
 
02:53:34.830 --> 02:53:34.840 align:start position:0%
representative will Holm thank you
 
02:53:36.910 --> 02:53:36.920 align:start position:0%
representative elme thank you just a
 
02:53:39.429 --> 02:53:39.439 align:start position:0%
quick question and maybe I was just
 
02:53:42.070 --> 02:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
writing too hard to hear you uh they're
 
02:53:45.030 --> 02:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
on the investors are on the hook for 15
 
02:53:49.269 --> 02:53:49.279 align:start position:0%
years for what uh they are liable uh for
 
02:53:51.110 --> 02:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
to the federal government for the
 
02:53:53.950 --> 02:53:53.960 align:start position:0%
project being built for not not the
 
02:53:55.229 --> 02:53:55.239 align:start position:0%
project being built because the tax
 
02:53:56.830 --> 02:53:56.840 align:start position:0%
credit doesn't kick in until the project
 
02:53:56.840 --> 02:53:57.550 align:start position:0%
credit doesn't kick in until the project
is

02:53:57.550 --> 02:53:57.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:54:00.469 --> 02:54:00.479 align:start position:0%
occupied um but for
 
02:54:04.190 --> 02:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
compliance with uh Federal standards and
 
02:54:06.469 --> 02:54:06.479 align:start position:0%
with um our standards at New Hampshire
 
02:54:10.070 --> 02:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
housing as the tax credit allocator so
 
02:54:12.790 --> 02:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
conceivably and this this rarely happens
 
02:54:15.229 --> 02:54:15.239 align:start position:0%
but it does happen uh investment may get
 
02:54:17.229 --> 02:54:17.239 align:start position:0%
recaptured and the investor has to
 
02:54:19.710 --> 02:54:19.720 align:start position:0%
essentially pay back their investment uh
 
02:54:23.309 --> 02:54:23.319 align:start position:0%
to the federal government uh it's a big
 
02:54:26.910 --> 02:54:26.920 align:start position:0%
stick uh and as a result the investors
 
02:54:29.830 --> 02:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
watch very carefully over these projects
 
02:54:31.030 --> 02:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh for
 
02:54:33.070 --> 02:54:33.080 align:start position:0%
compliance representative
 
02:54:37.190 --> 02:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
fellows so I I think my question is
 
02:54:42.030 --> 02:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
related to that so I I wanted
 
02:54:44.269 --> 02:54:44.279 align:start position:0%
to I have several little questions
 
02:54:47.349 --> 02:54:47.359 align:start position:0%
question s are are these always
 
02:54:51.110 --> 02:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
rentals these are always rentals okay so
 
02:54:53.469 --> 02:54:53.479 align:start position:0%
is one of the things that they the
 
02:54:56.349 --> 02:54:56.359 align:start position:0%
compliance for the 15 years is that one
 
02:54:59.750 --> 02:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
of those things making sure that they
 
02:55:02.750 --> 02:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
the rent doesn't go up does it it has to
 
02:55:05.110 --> 02:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
stay at that 60%
 
02:55:07.670 --> 02:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
level is yes that that is correct
 
02:55:10.990 --> 02:55:11.000 align:start position:0%
representative and one more piece so so
 
02:55:15.229 --> 02:55:15.239 align:start position:0%
if I buy a $100,000
 
02:55:18.510 --> 02:55:18.520 align:start position:0%
of these credits I give the developer
 
02:55:20.990 --> 02:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
$100,000 and I get
 
02:55:23.750 --> 02:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
credits how do I take advantage of that
 
02:55:28.150 --> 02:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
I get to deduct $10,000 a year for 10
 
02:55:28.160 --> 02:55:29.910 align:start position:0%
I get to deduct $10,000 a year for 10
years

02:55:29.910 --> 02:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:55:33.389 --> 02:55:33.399 align:start position:0%
or the this is a little more complex
 
02:55:37.750 --> 02:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
question um the the answer is that uh
 
02:55:39.550 --> 02:55:39.560 align:start position:0%
new and I'll use New Hampshire as an
 
02:55:41.190 --> 02:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
example because that's what I'm familiar
 
02:55:45.550 --> 02:55:45.560 align:start position:0%
with uh we current are are our
 
02:55:49.469 --> 02:55:49.479 align:start position:0%
2024 allocation is a little over $4
 
02:55:53.469 --> 02:55:53.479 align:start position:0%
million that because of the um the
 
02:55:56.790 --> 02:55:56.800 align:start position:0%
10-year uh period you multiply by 10 but
 
02:55:58.710 --> 02:55:58.720 align:start position:0%
then you also apply the the market
 
02:56:01.389 --> 02:56:01.399 align:start position:0%
Factor these tax credits tend to sell
 
02:56:04.910 --> 02:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
for something like 90 to 95 cents on the
 
02:56:08.590 --> 02:56:08.600 align:start position:0%
dollar so the $4 million annually will
 
02:56:11.950 --> 02:56:11.960 align:start position:0%
yield something on the order of $35 to
 
02:56:15.150 --> 02:56:15.160 align:start position:0%
$40 million in development equity
 
02:56:17.510 --> 02:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
a project might get an allocation of
 
02:56:20.309 --> 02:56:20.319 align:start position:0%
$800,000 of tax credits which is then
 
02:56:23.070 --> 02:56:23.080 align:start position:0%
marketed to produce several million
 
02:56:26.269 --> 02:56:26.279 align:start position:0%
dollars of development Equity from the
 
02:56:30.750 --> 02:56:30.760 align:start position:0%
developer um the the developer then uses
 
02:56:33.870 --> 02:56:33.880 align:start position:0%
that Equity to build the project now I
 
02:56:38.750 --> 02:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:41.309 --> 02:56:41.319 align:start position:0%
question i' be happy to T talk with you
 
02:56:43.830 --> 02:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
offline as well okay um any other
 
02:56:43.840 --> 02:56:48.070 align:start position:0%
offline as well okay um any other
questions

02:56:48.070 --> 02:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:51.750 --> 02:56:51.760 align:start position:0%
questions yes thank you I just as uh
 
02:56:54.269 --> 02:56:54.279 align:start position:0%
would you agree I just checked with the
 
02:56:57.030 --> 02:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
world population data that which markets
 
02:57:00.190 --> 02:57:00.200 align:start position:0%
the uh 2024 meeting incoming New
 
02:57:03.389 --> 02:57:03.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:08.510 --> 02:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
884 and 80% of that is 70
 
02:57:13.590 --> 02:57:13.600 align:start position:0%
71 roughly so would you agree that maybe
 
02:57:13.600 --> 02:57:14.870 align:start position:0%
71 roughly so would you agree that maybe
7

02:57:14.870 --> 02:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
7
 
02:57:20.309 --> 02:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
1,000 uh gross is the uh low income
 
02:57:22.510 --> 02:57:22.520 align:start position:0%
level for tax
 
02:57:25.110 --> 02:57:25.120 align:start position:0%
credits uh representative that number is
 
02:57:27.990 --> 02:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
actually high that the because the uh
 
02:57:32.190 --> 02:57:32.200 align:start position:0%
calculation is 60% not 80% excuse me and
 
02:57:36.870 --> 02:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
it also varies by area within the state
 
02:57:40.990 --> 02:57:41.000 align:start position:0%
so um and and one thing we haven't
 
02:57:44.110 --> 02:57:44.120 align:start position:0%
talked about is the the complexity of of
 
02:57:46.349 --> 02:57:46.359 align:start position:0%
the financing of these projects the tax
 
02:57:49.349 --> 02:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
credit is one piece uh there are often
 
02:57:52.309 --> 02:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
times many other layers of financing
 
02:57:54.670 --> 02:57:54.680 align:start position:0%
which may themselves have other far
 
02:57:57.389 --> 02:57:57.399 align:start position:0%
greater restrictions for example the
 
02:57:59.229 --> 02:57:59.239 align:start position:0%
National Housing Trust Fund New
 
02:58:01.110 --> 02:58:01.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing receives uh New
 
02:58:04.150 --> 02:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire receives we allocate uh three3
 
02:58:07.190 --> 02:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
to4 million a year it's a block grant
 
02:58:09.229 --> 02:58:09.239 align:start position:0%
and that is for use with extremely
 
02:58:12.670 --> 02:58:12.680 align:start position:0%
low-income housing uh households that
 
02:58:16.429 --> 02:58:16.439 align:start position:0%
are earning up to 30% of the area median
 
02:58:19.870 --> 02:58:19.880 align:start position:0%
income so a development that's using a
 
02:58:21.590 --> 02:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
the National Housing Trust Fund in
 
02:58:23.950 --> 02:58:23.960 align:start position:0%
addition to the low-income housing tax
 
02:58:26.790 --> 02:58:26.800 align:start position:0%
credit would be limited to that 30%
 
02:58:30.429 --> 02:58:30.439 align:start position:0%
level follow up Mr chair follow up uh
 
02:58:32.910 --> 02:58:32.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for that if you could you you
 
02:58:35.670 --> 02:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
were talking about an area uh income
 
02:58:39.510 --> 02:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
which is isn't going to show up um on
 
02:58:42.070 --> 02:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
that could you provide that uh to the
 
02:58:44.790 --> 02:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
committee and I what also like to thank
 
02:58:45.950 --> 02:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
you for
 
02:58:51.150 --> 02:58:51.160 align:start position:0%
illustrating the complexity of this uh
 
02:58:55.790 --> 02:58:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:59.429 --> 02:58:59.439 align:start position:0%
representative all set oh question yes
 
02:59:02.910 --> 02:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
represent so I'm wondering do you make
 
02:59:06.269 --> 02:59:06.279 align:start position:0%
projections about how many of these
 
02:59:09.229 --> 02:59:09.239 align:start position:0%
units are needed because there you know
 
02:59:11.510 --> 02:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
there is demographic data from the
 
02:59:13.910 --> 02:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
Census tell tells us how many people
 
02:59:17.550 --> 02:59:17.560 align:start position:0%
will fall in different income categories
 
02:59:19.590 --> 02:59:19.600 align:start position:0%
and not not all of them are going to use
 
02:59:21.150 --> 02:59:21.160 align:start position:0%
this program that some of them might
 
02:59:25.070 --> 02:59:25.080 align:start position:0%
live with relatives or whatever so where
 
02:59:26.990 --> 02:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
where where does this go because we've
 
02:59:29.309 --> 02:59:29.319 align:start position:0%
got a aging population that's going to
 
02:59:30.469 --> 02:59:30.479 align:start position:0%
they're not going to have regular
 
02:59:32.110 --> 02:59:32.120 align:start position:0%
incomes they're going to have just so
 
02:59:34.550 --> 02:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
Social Security and maybe a little bit
 
02:59:36.590 --> 02:59:36.600 align:start position:0%
out I'm just wondering if we're just
 
02:59:38.269 --> 02:59:38.279 align:start position:0%
going to need more and more and more and
 
02:59:40.670 --> 02:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
more of these
 
02:59:43.110 --> 02:59:43.120 align:start position:0%
rentals representative that is that's an
 
02:59:46.590 --> 02:59:46.600 align:start position:0%
excellent question and for as a as a
 
02:59:49.070 --> 02:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
starting point I would refer you to a
 
02:59:50.710 --> 02:59:50.720 align:start position:0%
study that New Hampshire housing
 
02:59:53.710 --> 02:59:53.720 align:start position:0%
completed in 2023 it's the Statewide
 
02:59:56.750 --> 02:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
housing needs assessment which indicates
 
02:59:59.590 --> 02:59:59.600 align:start position:0%
that we have a current shortage of over
 
03:00:03.790 --> 03:00:03.800 align:start position:0%
23,000 units of housing of all types for
 
03:00:03.800 --> 03:00:04.710 align:start position:0%
23,000 units of housing of all types for
all

03:00:04.710 --> 03:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
all
 
03:00:07.790 --> 03:00:07.800 align:start position:0%
incomes uh based on projected population
 
03:00:11.830 --> 03:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
growth we will need a total of 60,000
 
03:00:15.710 --> 03:00:15.720 align:start position:0%
produced by 2030 a total of 990,000
 
03:00:18.670 --> 03:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
units produced by 2040 that see those
 
03:00:20.910 --> 03:00:20.920 align:start position:0%
seems like very big numbers but it
 
03:00:22.670 --> 03:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
actually amounts to something on the
 
03:00:25.309 --> 03:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
order of a 35% increase in housing
 
03:00:28.309 --> 03:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
production so that that is doable uh
 
03:00:30.990 --> 03:00:31.000 align:start position:0%
it's a big lift but it is doable uh but
 
03:00:33.830 --> 03:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's for all income types uh
 
03:00:35.830 --> 03:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
that study does break things down I
 
03:00:37.389 --> 03:00:37.399 align:start position:0%
don't have the numbers off the top of my
 
03:00:40.070 --> 03:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
head that indicate what what we need for
 
03:00:42.710 --> 03:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
certain income levels but uh the need is
 
03:00:42.720 --> 03:00:44.790 align:start position:0%
certain income levels but uh the need is
significant

03:00:44.790 --> 03:00:44.800 align:start position:0%
significant
 
03:00:48.070 --> 03:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
so all right just follow so I I um thank
 
03:00:50.870 --> 03:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
you for sending that report to me about
 
03:00:52.710 --> 03:00:52.720 align:start position:0%

Frost made was that the what we are
 
03:04:45.469 --> 03:04:45.479 align:start position:0%
members call the capital stack depending
 
03:04:47.630 --> 03:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
on what financing that they receive
 
03:04:51.429 --> 03:04:51.439 align:start position:0%
really depends on who lives there and
 
03:04:53.269 --> 03:04:53.279 align:start position:0%
what income bracket they find themselves
 
03:04:56.070 --> 03:04:56.080 align:start position:0%
in so um another reason for considering
 
03:04:57.710 --> 03:04:57.720 align:start position:0%
that amendment is to consider the issue
 
03:05:01.990 --> 03:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
around Workforce housing um because um
 
03:05:04.630 --> 03:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
you can be building for uh people who
 
03:05:06.630 --> 03:05:06.640 align:start position:0%
are primarily in the workforce or people
 
03:05:09.550 --> 03:05:09.560 align:start position:0%
who are uh primarily extremely low
 
03:05:12.670 --> 03:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
income um and uh you know depending on
 
03:05:14.469 --> 03:05:14.479 align:start position:0%
on the fining ing tools is might be
 
03:05:16.469 --> 03:05:16.479 align:start position:0%
worth a study committee looking at how
 
03:05:18.910 --> 03:05:18.920 align:start position:0%
you want to Fashion a New Hampshire
 
03:05:22.309 --> 03:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
proposal another interesting
 
03:05:26.070 --> 03:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
um uh tidbit is that right now as uh
 
03:05:28.309 --> 03:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
Congress is putting together the the new
 
03:05:30.830 --> 03:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
tax package the uh housing credit
 
03:05:33.510 --> 03:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
Improvement act has some uh enhancements
 
03:05:35.349 --> 03:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
to this very popular program known as
 
03:05:37.349 --> 03:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
the low-income housing tax credit and
 
03:05:39.269 --> 03:05:39.279 align:start position:0%
because of the complexities that Mr
 
03:05:40.950 --> 03:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
Frost talked about they're going to
 
03:05:43.790 --> 03:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
rename the program the housing credit
 
03:05:45.389 --> 03:05:45.399 align:start position:0%
instead of the low-income housing credit
 
03:05:48.110 --> 03:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
because it really raises a lot of
 
03:05:50.510 --> 03:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
questions and it's not super accurate
 
03:05:53.190 --> 03:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
all the time sometimes it really is very
 
03:05:54.870 --> 03:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
low income extremely low income and
 
03:05:58.309 --> 03:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
sometimes it is uh Workforce um
 
03:06:01.110 --> 03:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
depending on on the project so I will
 
03:06:03.950 --> 03:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
say our members this is the number one
 
03:06:06.990 --> 03:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
um program financing tool um in New
 
03:06:09.630 --> 03:06:09.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that creates the production of
 
03:06:11.950 --> 03:06:11.960 align:start position:0%
affordable housing stock it is extremely
 
03:06:14.510 --> 03:06:14.520 align:start position:0%
competitive for tax credits and it is
 
03:06:18.389 --> 03:06:18.399 align:start position:0%
extremely uh uh uh attractive to
 
03:06:20.990 --> 03:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
investors and has been critical uh to
 
03:06:22.990 --> 03:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
making any progress as you know the
 
03:06:26.070 --> 03:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
housing crisis is very severe it we have
 
03:06:29.150 --> 03:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
three polls recent polls uh from St
 
03:06:32.550 --> 03:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
anome UNH Emerson College that all say
 
03:06:34.309 --> 03:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
that the housing crisis is the number
 
03:06:36.429 --> 03:06:36.439 align:start position:0%
one issue for New Hampshire residents
 
03:06:39.950 --> 03:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
right now um and uh Mr Frost shared the
 
03:06:43.030 --> 03:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
sobering uh data points um about how
 
03:06:46.950 --> 03:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
many many units are are needed so um you
 
03:06:49.710 --> 03:06:49.720 align:start position:0%
know we as we start to do the work that
 
03:06:52.670 --> 03:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
needs to be done um before the upcoming
 
03:06:54.830 --> 03:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
budget we welcome the opportunity for
 
03:06:57.150 --> 03:06:57.160 align:start position:0%
legislators or a larger commission to
 
03:07:00.429 --> 03:07:00.439 align:start position:0%
come together to explore um what a
 
03:07:02.229 --> 03:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
credit would look like in New Hampshire
 
03:07:05.670 --> 03:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
and um and and how it would work so urge
 
03:07:07.790 --> 03:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
your support for this I'm happy to take
 
03:07:10.469 --> 03:07:10.479 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you representative
 
03:07:13.750 --> 03:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
elme thank you um
 
03:07:19.150 --> 03:07:19.160 align:start position:0%
today and uh in recent weeks on we have
 
03:07:22.269 --> 03:07:22.279 align:start position:0%
been told to cut our taxes
 
03:07:26.110 --> 03:07:26.120 align:start position:0%
considerably on your asking for more
 
03:07:28.710 --> 03:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
revenue for what is one of our biggest
 
03:07:31.229 --> 03:07:31.239 align:start position:0%
needs according to the Bia and a lot of
 
03:07:34.670 --> 03:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
other people on another one is child
 
03:07:36.070 --> 03:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
care and there was someone in here for
 
03:07:39.630 --> 03:07:39.640 align:start position:0%
that just before uh how how do we
 
03:07:43.190 --> 03:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
reconcile these things thank you I mean
 
03:07:45.349 --> 03:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
don't come to the ones that are trying
 
03:07:48.469 --> 03:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
to cut the revenue that could be
 
03:07:51.269 --> 03:07:51.279 align:start position:0%
used um well I'm here to speak on behalf
 
03:07:54.429 --> 03:07:54.439 align:start position:0%
of the the housing needs and the um you
 
03:07:56.269 --> 03:07:56.279 align:start position:0%
know and our members who are on the
 
03:07:58.550 --> 03:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
front lines of uh trying to serve those
 
03:08:00.710 --> 03:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
in their communities and the you know
 
03:08:02.630 --> 03:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
essentially an unserved Market there is
 
03:08:04.590 --> 03:08:04.600 align:start position:0%
a demand for housing that's more
 
03:08:06.670 --> 03:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
affordable and um without these
 
03:08:09.110 --> 03:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
financing tools if you just you know
 
03:08:10.990 --> 03:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
they they become unaffordable right now
 
03:08:14.389 --> 03:08:14.399 align:start position:0%
to to to people of of you know of a lot
 
03:08:16.990 --> 03:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
of incomes I mean what I how I describe
 
03:08:18.950 --> 03:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
it is I one of the reasons I think that
 
03:08:20.870 --> 03:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
the political will has increased around
 
03:08:23.870 --> 03:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
this issue is just because you know the
 
03:08:26.590 --> 03:08:26.600 align:start position:0%
um the recognition in the general public
 
03:08:30.269 --> 03:08:30.279 align:start position:0%
that housing is the crisis is so acute
 
03:08:31.910 --> 03:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
and that's because it's impacting
 
03:08:33.469 --> 03:08:33.479 align:start position:0%
everyone at this point even if you're
 
03:08:35.229 --> 03:08:35.239 align:start position:0%
comfortable in your home at the price
 
03:08:37.030 --> 03:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
point that you're paying it's likely
 
03:08:38.670 --> 03:08:38.680 align:start position:0%
impacting your children or your
 
03:08:40.389 --> 03:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
neighbors or your community and it's
 
03:08:42.229 --> 03:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
certainly if you're trying to grow your
 
03:08:44.670 --> 03:08:44.680 align:start position:0%
Workforce it's probably the number one
 
03:08:48.070 --> 03:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
impediment to you growing your business
 
03:08:52.269 --> 03:08:52.279 align:start position:0%
um so that is I we need an all Hands-On
 
03:08:55.269 --> 03:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
deck approach if we're really going to
 
03:08:57.670 --> 03:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
make that achievable goal of increasing
 
03:08:59.710 --> 03:08:59.720 align:start position:0%
housing production right and so we need
 
03:09:02.229 --> 03:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
all the tools so I to answer your
 
03:09:03.750 --> 03:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
question more directly representative
 
03:09:05.630 --> 03:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
Aly I would say you know budgets are
 
03:09:08.110 --> 03:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
always about choices and priorities and
 
03:09:09.830 --> 03:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
and and different needs and and we know
 
03:09:11.229 --> 03:09:11.239 align:start position:0%
that there are many competing needs in
 
03:09:14.190 --> 03:09:14.200 align:start position:0%
the state and we ask you know we do the
 
03:09:16.309 --> 03:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
the homework necessary to to look at the
 
03:09:19.309 --> 03:09:19.319 align:start position:0%
tools to to address the housing needs
 
03:09:22.710 --> 03:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:27.510 --> 03:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
Ames uh thank you I I really appreciate
 
03:09:30.710 --> 03:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh and understand that the depth and
 
03:09:32.990 --> 03:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
extent of this Pro problem that you're
 
03:09:36.469 --> 03:09:36.479 align:start position:0%
trying to address is huge and important
 
03:09:39.750 --> 03:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering if uh you've seen I
 
03:09:42.389 --> 03:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
should have asked Mr Frost this question
 
03:09:47.150 --> 03:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
um as well any reports that
 
03:09:50.870 --> 03:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
quantify how much might be diverted
 
03:09:53.950 --> 03:09:53.960 align:start position:0%
essentially from the business taxes
 
03:09:56.469 --> 03:09:56.479 align:start position:0%
because that's what we're talking about
 
03:10:01.309 --> 03:10:01.319 align:start position:0%
to make a splash to to affect this uh or
 
03:10:03.349 --> 03:10:03.359 align:start position:0%
to to do something if there been any
 
03:10:06.429 --> 03:10:06.439 align:start position:0%
concrete studies on well if we have less
 
03:10:10.070 --> 03:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
and so tax credit we'd get thus and so
 
03:10:13.110 --> 03:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
reward right I mean you you in order to
 
03:10:15.670 --> 03:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
have a market for tax credit you need a
 
03:10:17.510 --> 03:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
a tax burden that you're trying to avoid
 
03:10:19.150 --> 03:10:19.160 align:start position:0%
but I I am not aware of any of those
 
03:10:22.070 --> 03:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
studies and um I don't know if Mr Frost
 
03:10:24.710 --> 03:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
is nope shaking his head now for the
 
03:10:26.990 --> 03:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
record but um certainly another
 
03:10:29.309 --> 03:10:29.319 align:start position:0%
important point for a committee or
 
03:10:31.389 --> 03:10:31.399 align:start position:0%
something we would need to understand um
 
03:10:32.670 --> 03:10:32.680 align:start position:0%
if we were going to come in with a
 
03:10:34.830 --> 03:10:34.840 align:start position:0%
proposal included into in the budget
 
03:10:34.840 --> 03:10:35.990 align:start position:0%
proposal included into in the budget
following

03:10:35.990 --> 03:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
following
 
03:10:36.000 --> 03:10:37.590 align:start position:0%
following
year

03:10:37.590 --> 03:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:10:39.830 --> 03:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
followup I guess related to that and
 
03:10:42.349 --> 03:10:42.359 align:start position:0%
this reflects my lack of understanding
 
03:10:45.389 --> 03:10:45.399 align:start position:0%
on this issue um those other states that
 
03:10:49.870 --> 03:10:49.880 align:start position:0%
have adopted state level tax credits do
 
03:10:52.910 --> 03:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
they engage their individual income tax
 
03:10:55.429 --> 03:10:55.439 align:start position:0%
as well as their business tax corporate
 
03:10:58.550 --> 03:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
tax um
 
03:11:02.670 --> 03:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
in whatever uh tax credit product that
 
03:11:06.910 --> 03:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
they work out do you know I don't
 
03:11:09.349 --> 03:11:09.359 align:start position:0%
know I don't know my my my sense is that
 
03:11:11.269 --> 03:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
it would vary but it would likely be
 
03:11:14.670 --> 03:11:14.680 align:start position:0%
more on the corporate Tex side um but uh
 
03:11:16.190 --> 03:11:16.200 align:start position:0%
you know it's certainly something worth
 
03:11:18.590 --> 03:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
looking into okay thank
 
03:11:21.630 --> 03:11:21.640 align:start position:0%
you representative ORS thank you Mr
 
03:11:23.590 --> 03:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking my question so
 
03:11:25.910 --> 03:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
does any of this provide an Avenue to
 
03:11:27.990 --> 03:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
get some of the people living on the
 
03:11:30.990 --> 03:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
streets off the streets and into some of
 
03:11:32.790 --> 03:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
this housing we're talking about or
 
03:11:36.469 --> 03:11:36.479 align:start position:0%
you're referring to so um the concerning
 
03:11:39.269 --> 03:11:39.279 align:start position:0%
issue of the increase in homelessness um
 
03:11:41.990 --> 03:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
I think is uh directly connected to the
 
03:11:44.309 --> 03:11:44.319 align:start position:0%
housing shortage I think I mentioned we
 
03:11:46.630 --> 03:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
were feeling like we were all impacted
 
03:11:49.309 --> 03:11:49.319 align:start position:0%
uh earlier by the housing crisis and
 
03:11:50.790 --> 03:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
talked about the impediments to
 
03:11:52.550 --> 03:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
Workforce Development now consider
 
03:11:55.630 --> 03:11:55.640 align:start position:0%
yourself maybe more financially fragile
 
03:11:58.429 --> 03:11:58.439 align:start position:0%
say you're a single parent in a low-wage
 
03:12:00.190 --> 03:12:00.200 align:start position:0%
job with a couple of kids and you
 
03:12:03.229 --> 03:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
experience um a Health crisis or or
 
03:12:04.830 --> 03:12:04.840 align:start position:0%
something I mean you could see the
 
03:12:08.190 --> 03:12:08.200 align:start position:0%
vulnerability in a in a market um with a
 
03:12:12.030 --> 03:12:12.040 align:start position:0%
05 vacancy rate and a required hourly
 
03:12:14.429 --> 03:12:14.439 align:start position:0%
wage of close to $30 an hour in New
 
03:12:20.790 --> 03:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so um the um so yes I I do
 
03:12:22.309 --> 03:12:22.319 align:start position:0%
think it's connected but it kind of
 
03:12:24.750 --> 03:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
depends on the units that you develop
 
03:12:28.670 --> 03:12:28.680 align:start position:0%
and um and and what our members like to
 
03:12:31.870 --> 03:12:31.880 align:start position:0%
say is they prefer not
 
03:12:35.269 --> 03:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
to have prescriptive financing tools
 
03:12:37.510 --> 03:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
that require developers to build for
 
03:12:39.550 --> 03:12:39.560 align:start position:0%
certain populations because they prefer
 
03:12:42.269 --> 03:12:42.279 align:start position:0%
the flexibility of responding to local
 
03:12:42.279 --> 03:12:43.590 align:start position:0%
the flexibility of responding to local
needs

03:12:43.590 --> 03:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
needs
 
03:12:46.269 --> 03:12:46.279 align:start position:0%
um there is a desire sometimes to say we
 
03:12:48.429 --> 03:12:48.439 align:start position:0%
should only build you know this type of
 
03:12:50.790 --> 03:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
housing uh for people in recovery or
 
03:12:53.870 --> 03:12:53.880 align:start position:0%
this for people um fleeing you know
 
03:12:57.070 --> 03:12:57.080 align:start position:0%
domestic violence um and in some cases
 
03:12:58.790 --> 03:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
that that might be the right solution
 
03:13:01.550 --> 03:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
but we prefer flexible financing tools
 
03:13:04.150 --> 03:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
so we can respond locally and we do have
 
03:13:05.429 --> 03:13:05.439 align:start position:0%
examples in New Hampshire of
 
03:13:08.150 --> 03:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
successfully building for chronically
 
03:13:10.590 --> 03:13:10.600 align:start position:0%
homeless and providing ongoing
 
03:13:13.950 --> 03:13:13.960 align:start position:0%
supportive services within that context
 
03:13:16.670 --> 03:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
um and uh something that we need to
 
03:13:19.550 --> 03:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
proliferate for sure uh when we start
 
03:13:22.229 --> 03:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
talking about how to serve our more
 
03:13:25.070 --> 03:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
vulnerable populations with such a basic
 
03:13:28.790 --> 03:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
need so thank you for the question great
 
03:13:31.469 --> 03:13:31.479 align:start position:0%
representative uh roachford yes thank
 
03:13:32.870 --> 03:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
03:13:35.950 --> 03:13:35.960 align:start position:0%
question so we've got where I come from
 
03:13:38.309 --> 03:13:38.319 align:start position:0%
there are a number of builders that have
 
03:13:40.750 --> 03:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
either started projects and stopped them
 
03:13:43.590 --> 03:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
or decided not to start housing project
 
03:13:46.269 --> 03:13:46.279 align:start position:0%
despite the need um because of the
 
03:13:49.550 --> 03:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
inflation and the cost of materials uh
 
03:13:51.349 --> 03:13:51.359 align:start position:0%
and you know even and then you add in
 
03:13:54.309 --> 03:13:54.319 align:start position:0%
the cost of the cost of money is is very
 
03:13:57.710 --> 03:13:57.720 align:start position:0%
expensive right now as well the finance
 
03:14:00.510 --> 03:14:00.520 align:start position:0%
it I I like the idea this is you know
 
03:14:02.469 --> 03:14:02.479 align:start position:0%
and I think tax incentives are a
 
03:14:05.870 --> 03:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
wonderful way to do this but would are
 
03:14:08.349 --> 03:14:08.359 align:start position:0%
you do you think this is enough uh if we
 
03:14:09.990 --> 03:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
were to give a tax
 
03:14:12.990 --> 03:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
credit um in in other in in the amended
 
03:14:14.710 --> 03:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
proposed amendments as other kind of
 
03:14:17.469 --> 03:14:17.479 align:start position:0%
opens the the other ways to tax credit
 
03:14:18.910 --> 03:14:18.920 align:start position:0%
is that enough to
 
03:14:22.710 --> 03:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
offset the increases in uh interest
 
03:14:24.750 --> 03:14:24.760 align:start position:0%
rates and building materials in order to
 
03:14:26.150 --> 03:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
maybe start some of these projects back
 
03:14:29.510 --> 03:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
up candidly you know probably not it's
 
03:14:31.510 --> 03:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
not enough but it will make a difference
 
03:14:33.830 --> 03:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
for those developers who are attracted
 
03:14:38.269 --> 03:14:38.279 align:start position:0%
to this type of favorable financing um
 
03:14:39.790 --> 03:14:39.800 align:start position:0%
but we're hearing the same thing from
 
03:14:42.590 --> 03:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
our members uh inflation impacting you
 
03:14:46.110 --> 03:14:46.120 align:start position:0%
know labor costs um materials costs uh
 
03:14:48.150 --> 03:14:48.160 align:start position:0%
you know supply side challenges that
 
03:14:52.550 --> 03:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
continue um and makes it harder uh to
 
03:14:54.710 --> 03:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
build affordably and the need for more
 
03:14:57.870 --> 03:14:57.880 align:start position:0%
subsidy in a in a project so uh
 
03:15:00.030 --> 03:15:00.040 align:start position:0%
essentially asking for more tools not
 
03:15:04.630 --> 03:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
less or not fewer tools and um but
 
03:15:06.269 --> 03:15:06.279 align:start position:0%
ultimately we're going to need the
 
03:15:10.229 --> 03:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
market to build and as well as um you
 
03:15:12.550 --> 03:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
know affordable housing financed uh
 
03:15:14.750 --> 03:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
we're gonna but we need the both the
 
03:15:18.190 --> 03:15:18.200 align:start position:0%
private Market to respond and uh and do
 
03:15:19.870 --> 03:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
what we can to make sure that we're
 
03:15:23.870 --> 03:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
we're building um affordable housing as
 
03:15:28.189 --> 03:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
well okay thank you very much thank
 
03:15:30.309 --> 03:15:30.319 align:start position:0%
you is there anyone else who would like
 
03:15:33.389 --> 03:15:33.399 align:start position:0%
to testify on hb1
 
03:15:35.670 --> 03:15:35.680 align:start position:0%
1470 okay seeing none I'll close the
 
03:15:35.680 --> 03:15:41.389 align:start position:0%
1470 okay seeing none I'll close the
public

03:15:41.389 --> 03:15:41.399 align:start position:0%

03:15:51.070 --> 03:15:51.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll open the public hearing on hb1
 
03:15:53.790 --> 03:15:53.800 align:start position:0%
1613 and
 
03:15:56.910 --> 03:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
um welcome up the uh sponsor

Muse

03:16:17.790 --> 03:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:19.349 --> 03:16:19.359 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee uh my
 
03:16:22.070 --> 03:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
name is representative David Muse uh I
 
03:16:24.790 --> 03:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
represent Portsmouth Newington and
 
03:16:28.030 --> 03:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
Newcastle um I'm before you today uh in
 
03:16:30.429 --> 03:16:30.439 align:start position:0%
large part because of a news story uh
 
03:16:32.550 --> 03:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
that I read in 2023 in the New Hampshire
 
03:16:34.830 --> 03:16:34.840 align:start position:0%
bulletin and the subject of that story
 
03:16:36.510 --> 03:16:36.520 align:start position:0%
was a settlement that the state of New
 
03:16:39.630 --> 03:16:39.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh received from Monsanto uh
 
03:16:43.070 --> 03:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
for $25 million for PCB contamination
 
03:16:46.070 --> 03:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
across the state uh pcbs if you're not
 
03:16:48.150 --> 03:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
familiar with them are polychoral bif
 
03:16:50.389 --> 03:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
phenols they were outlawed uh by the
 
03:16:52.070 --> 03:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
federal government in
 
03:16:55.110 --> 03:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
1979 uh they were used in applications
 
03:16:58.469 --> 03:16:58.479 align:start position:0%
like um uh oil that was used uh in
 
03:17:00.870 --> 03:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
Transformers uh uh that would actually
 
03:17:02.790 --> 03:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
cool the Transformers while they were
 
03:17:05.750 --> 03:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
working uh to provide us with uh with
 
03:17:07.750 --> 03:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
electricity uh they were also used in
 
03:17:10.070 --> 03:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
other industrial applications when they
 
03:17:13.349 --> 03:17:13.359 align:start position:0%
were outlawed in 1979 there was rush to
 
03:17:16.429 --> 03:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
uh dispose of a lot of this waste oil
 
03:17:19.710 --> 03:17:19.720 align:start position:0%
and a lot of this waste PCB material um
 
03:17:21.990 --> 03:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
some of it found its way into trucks uh
 
03:17:24.910 --> 03:17:24.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that were used uh to uh
 
03:17:27.429 --> 03:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
oil dirt roads in the summertime uh when
 
03:17:30.870 --> 03:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
the dust uh is known to choke the air um
 
03:17:32.750 --> 03:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
some of that oil was also illegally
 
03:17:35.750 --> 03:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
disposed of uh uh sometimes on land
 
03:17:36.870 --> 03:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes in
 
03:17:42.229 --> 03:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
waterways uh and uh other PCB uh uh uh
 
03:17:44.870 --> 03:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
components were uh were also uh
 
03:17:48.469 --> 03:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
improperly disposed of uh in that period
 
03:17:51.349 --> 03:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
um like the past chemicals I think that
 
03:17:53.030 --> 03:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of us have become familiar with
 
03:17:57.189 --> 03:17:57.199 align:start position:0%
over the last few years um pcbs are
 
03:17:59.870 --> 03:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
bioaccumulative um uh they also take a
 
03:18:01.510 --> 03:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
long time to break down in the
 
03:18:04.469 --> 03:18:04.479 align:start position:0%
environment hundreds of years uh so some
 
03:18:06.550 --> 03:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
of the health impacts uh that can be
 
03:18:08.790 --> 03:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
caused as a result of PCB contamination
 
03:18:12.429 --> 03:18:12.439 align:start position:0%
are things uh like cancer liver problems
 
03:18:14.910 --> 03:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
uh and birth defs uh there's a reason
 
03:18:18.990 --> 03:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:21.150 --> 03:18:21.160 align:start position:0%
1979 uh according to the story in the
 
03:18:25.070 --> 03:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire bulletin um uh pcbs have
 
03:18:28.630 --> 03:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
actually impaired 104 uh water bodies uh
 
03:18:31.189 --> 03:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire at least
 
03:18:34.309 --> 03:18:34.319 align:start position:0%
63,000 Acres of surface water and at
 
03:18:37.349 --> 03:18:37.359 align:start position:0%
least uh 2.3 linear miles of the sogan
 
03:18:40.550 --> 03:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
river um contaminated Lon eggs have been
 
03:18:42.990 --> 03:18:43.000 align:start position:0%
identified in 20 Lakes uh with the
 
03:18:47.030 --> 03:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
highest levels of pcbs being in Squam
 
03:18:49.910 --> 03:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
Lake uh so we're not talking about
 
03:18:51.670 --> 03:18:51.680 align:start position:0%
things that are something that's just a
 
03:18:53.710 --> 03:18:53.720 align:start position:0%
problem around major cities this is a
 
03:18:56.189 --> 03:18:56.199 align:start position:0%
problem in our recreational areas as
 
03:18:59.870 --> 03:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
well uh so the good news part of this
 
03:19:02.670 --> 03:19:02.680 align:start position:0%
story is that in 2022 the state of New
 
03:19:04.550 --> 03:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire received a $25 million
 
03:19:06.429 --> 03:19:06.439 align:start position:0%
settlement from monsano corporation
 
03:19:08.070 --> 03:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
which was one of the main manufacturers
 
03:19:08.080 --> 03:19:09.070 align:start position:0%
which was one of the main manufacturers
of

03:19:09.070 --> 03:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:19:14.229 --> 03:19:14.239 align:start position:0%
pcbs um the bad news uh is that uh the
 
03:19:16.469 --> 03:19:16.479 align:start position:0%
lawyers got $5 million of that
 
03:19:19.429 --> 03:19:19.439 align:start position:0%
settlement and the remaining $20 million
 
03:19:22.030 --> 03:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
of that settlement went into the general
 
03:19:25.389 --> 03:19:25.399 align:start position:0%
fund so why you may ask did that
 
03:19:27.189 --> 03:19:27.199 align:start position:0%
settlement go into the general fund
 
03:19:30.269 --> 03:19:30.279 align:start position:0%
instead of getting used to remediate PCB
 
03:19:32.269 --> 03:19:32.279 align:start position:0%
contamination uh to monitor it to
 
03:19:34.150 --> 03:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
educate people about it to actually do
 
03:19:36.189 --> 03:19:36.199 align:start position:0%
something about the contamination that
 
03:19:38.550 --> 03:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
the settlement was received for uh and
 
03:19:41.150 --> 03:19:41.160 align:start position:0%
the answer to that question is we
 
03:19:41.160 --> 03:19:42.630 align:start position:0%
the answer to that question is we
actually

03:19:42.630 --> 03:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
actually
 
03:19:46.269 --> 03:19:46.279 align:start position:0%
uh had no law in place that would have
 
03:19:49.830 --> 03:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
specifically directed uh that money from
 
03:19:52.429 --> 03:19:52.439 align:start position:0%
that type of settlement into a specific
 
03:19:54.870 --> 03:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
environmental Fund in New Hampshire so
 
03:19:56.830 --> 03:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
so for example we actually have a law in
 
03:19:58.710 --> 03:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that directs things like
 
03:20:01.429 --> 03:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
pasas settlements into the drinking and
 
03:20:05.150 --> 03:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund um uh we had
 
03:20:07.910 --> 03:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
nothing like that set up uh other funds
 
03:20:09.349 --> 03:20:09.359 align:start position:0%
that are comparable to that we have the
 
03:20:11.550 --> 03:20:11.560 align:start position:0%
opioid trust fund uh which is not an
 
03:20:13.269 --> 03:20:13.279 align:start position:0%
environment Al trust fund but we do have
 
03:20:17.229 --> 03:20:17.239 align:start position:0%
the mbte trust fund so in the absence of
 
03:20:19.710 --> 03:20:19.720 align:start position:0%
having a place that the
 
03:20:22.469 --> 03:20:22.479 align:start position:0%
legislature uh uh essentially directed
 
03:20:24.990 --> 03:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
the money to U the Attorney General is
 
03:20:27.429 --> 03:20:27.439 align:start position:0%
allowed to release those funds into the
 
03:20:29.950 --> 03:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
general fund so once they're releasing
 
03:20:33.229 --> 03:20:33.239 align:start position:0%
in the general fund sometimes money like
 
03:20:35.510 --> 03:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
that can be used to remediate
 
03:20:38.150 --> 03:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
environmental contamination but it also
 
03:20:40.309 --> 03:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
can be used to pay for things like copy
 
03:20:43.110 --> 03:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
your paper and toner and gas for snow
 
03:20:45.389 --> 03:20:45.399 align:start position:0%
plows and things of that of that nature
 
03:20:47.030 --> 03:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
once it goes in there we really don't
 
03:20:49.469 --> 03:20:49.479 align:start position:0%
know what's happening to it so in
 
03:20:51.469 --> 03:20:51.479 align:start position:0%
response to putting it into the general
 
03:20:52.990 --> 03:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
fund one of the things that the governor
 
03:20:56.309 --> 03:20:56.319 align:start position:0%
recommended was a $6 million allocation
 
03:20:58.590 --> 03:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
uh to actually address PCB contamination
 
03:21:00.349 --> 03:21:00.359 align:start position:0%
that the legislature decided not to act
 
03:21:03.469 --> 03:21:03.479 align:start position:0%
on so so in essence we received $20
 
03:21:06.790 --> 03:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
million for a PCB settlement and we
 
03:21:09.670 --> 03:21:09.680 align:start position:0%
actually may have used none of it to
 
03:21:12.030 --> 03:21:12.040 align:start position:0%
remediate or monitor PCP container
 
03:21:14.349 --> 03:21:14.359 align:start position:0%
mination on our state which according to
 
03:21:17.030 --> 03:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire bulletin story remains
 
03:21:19.710 --> 03:21:19.720 align:start position:0%
a significant problem in this state so
 
03:21:22.030 --> 03:21:22.040 align:start position:0%
what what this bill does is it attempts
 
03:21:25.309 --> 03:21:25.319 align:start position:0%
to address this situation going forward
 
03:21:27.150 --> 03:21:27.160 align:start position:0%
um what it would do is it would create a
 
03:21:29.550 --> 03:21:29.560 align:start position:0%
so a Soil and Water contamination trust
 
03:21:32.590 --> 03:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
fund and any funds received for an
 
03:21:34.269 --> 03:21:34.279 align:start position:0%
environmental uh settlement
 
03:21:36.150 --> 03:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
contamination settlement where the
 
03:21:38.349 --> 03:21:38.359 align:start position:0%
disposition of money hasn't been
 
03:21:40.550 --> 03:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
previously directed by the legislature
 
03:21:43.229 --> 03:21:43.239 align:start position:0%
would actually be deposit ited into this
 
03:21:45.550 --> 03:21:45.560 align:start position:0%
fund by the Attorney General until the
 
03:21:47.550 --> 03:21:47.560 align:start position:0%
legislature can direct what the
 
03:21:50.910 --> 03:21:50.920 align:start position:0%
legislature wants to do with these funds
 
03:21:52.830 --> 03:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's it's a pretty simple
 
03:21:56.189 --> 03:21:56.199 align:start position:0%
idea um money that we receive for
 
03:21:57.950 --> 03:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
environmental contamination should
 
03:22:01.670 --> 03:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
actually be used to combat environmental
 
03:22:04.630 --> 03:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
contamination um so I think we have a a
 
03:22:07.229 --> 03:22:07.239 align:start position:0%
glitch in our law that right now allows
 
03:22:09.710 --> 03:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
it to be used for uh for other purposes
 
03:22:12.349 --> 03:22:12.359 align:start position:0%
I think what I'm trying to do
 
03:22:14.110 --> 03:22:14.120 align:start position:0%
uh is address this glitch and I would be
 
03:22:15.910 --> 03:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
the first to admit to you it's this is
 
03:22:18.189 --> 03:22:18.199 align:start position:0%
the first time I've tried to draft
 
03:22:19.950 --> 03:22:19.960 align:start position:0%
legislation of this kind and we are
 
03:22:21.710 --> 03:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
going to hear from folks in the
 
03:22:23.389 --> 03:22:23.399 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
03:22:25.070 --> 03:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
who have some ideas about how
 
03:22:28.590 --> 03:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
potentially uh the bill could be uh uh
 
03:22:30.670 --> 03:22:30.680 align:start position:0%
made more specific in a way that would
 
03:22:33.229 --> 03:22:33.239 align:start position:0%
be helpful and uh I would urge you to
 
03:22:35.590 --> 03:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
listen to whatever they suggest Pretty
 
03:22:38.269 --> 03:22:38.279 align:start position:0%
strongly uh because we have we have an
 
03:22:40.950 --> 03:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
issue with contamination in this state
 
03:22:44.590 --> 03:22:44.600 align:start position:0%
um p contamination alone uh if if we
 
03:22:46.870 --> 03:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
look at the new EPA uh standards that
 
03:22:49.309 --> 03:22:49.319 align:start position:0%
have just come down if we try to REM
 
03:22:52.550 --> 03:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
remediate all of the the just the pasas
 
03:22:54.950 --> 03:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
contamination uh that that we've already
 
03:22:57.389 --> 03:22:57.399 align:start position:0%
identified in New Hampshire the cost is
 
03:22:59.349 --> 03:22:59.359 align:start position:0%
going to run into several billion
 
03:23:02.550 --> 03:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
dollars there are things out there um
 
03:23:05.510 --> 03:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
that we haven't accounted for um there
 
03:23:07.309 --> 03:23:07.319 align:start position:0%
are things that out there that we may
 
03:23:09.550 --> 03:23:09.560 align:start position:0%
not even know about yet there are
 
03:23:11.389 --> 03:23:11.399 align:start position:0%
settlements this settlement is an
 
03:23:15.070 --> 03:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
example of a settlement um where I don't
 
03:23:16.710 --> 03:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
think people in the legislature were
 
03:23:18.870 --> 03:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
even aware that this was happening so
 
03:23:20.630 --> 03:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
one of the things it's part a
 
03:23:23.309 --> 03:23:23.319 align:start position:0%
requirement in the bill is that when the
 
03:23:25.189 --> 03:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
Attorney General receives a settlement
 
03:23:26.830 --> 03:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
like this the fiscal committee is
 
03:23:29.550 --> 03:23:29.560 align:start position:0%
actually notified of it and actually
 
03:23:31.110 --> 03:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
receives a report around the amount of
 
03:23:32.630 --> 03:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
the settlement the parameters of the
 
03:23:35.910 --> 03:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
settlement uh and details like that what
 
03:23:39.670 --> 03:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
the bill also uh allows is for
 
03:23:42.670 --> 03:23:42.680 align:start position:0%
money uh to be
 
03:23:45.229 --> 03:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
uh it it it it remains dependent on the
 
03:23:47.510 --> 03:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
legislature to still appropriate money
 
03:23:49.910 --> 03:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
to address this form of contamination
 
03:23:52.590 --> 03:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
but once the money has been appropriated
 
03:23:55.550 --> 03:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
um money will be able to be used from
 
03:23:57.830 --> 03:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
this account to remediate that specific
 
03:23:58.950 --> 03:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
03:24:01.710 --> 03:24:01.720 align:start position:0%
contamination um the reason for
 
03:24:04.590 --> 03:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
specifying that it's the kind of that
 
03:24:06.269 --> 03:24:06.279 align:start position:0%
it's the contamination that's actually
 
03:24:08.429 --> 03:24:08.439 align:start position:0%
addressed in the settlement is so we
 
03:24:11.670 --> 03:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
don't run into a situation where where
 
03:24:13.189 --> 03:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
we actually have people in New Hampshire
 
03:24:14.670 --> 03:24:14.680 align:start position:0%
who've been harmed by one kind of
 
03:24:17.070 --> 03:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
contamination but who find that money
 
03:24:18.349 --> 03:24:18.359 align:start position:0%
received for the settlement to actually
 
03:24:21.510 --> 03:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
help them out is actually being used uh
 
03:24:23.469 --> 03:24:23.479 align:start position:0%
to address another form of contamination
 
03:24:26.870 --> 03:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so the idea is let's
 
03:24:29.070 --> 03:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
address the problem that the settlement
 
03:24:31.110 --> 03:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
was received for first let's give that
 
03:24:34.590 --> 03:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
first priority right um and then if we
 
03:24:37.550 --> 03:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
have money left over if we find out that
 
03:24:39.349 --> 03:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
well gee maybe the problem wasn't as bad
 
03:24:41.150 --> 03:24:41.160 align:start position:0%
as we thought it was and maybe maybe
 
03:24:42.710 --> 03:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
maybe there will be some money left over
 
03:24:44.990 --> 03:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
in the settlement there's a mechanism in
 
03:24:46.950 --> 03:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
the bill that would allow any remaining
 
03:24:50.150 --> 03:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
money to be transferred over into two uh
 
03:24:52.189 --> 03:24:52.199 align:start position:0%
other environmental funds uh the
 
03:24:53.870 --> 03:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
drinking and groundwater trust fund and
 
03:24:57.349 --> 03:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
the solid waste management fund um where
 
03:25:01.870 --> 03:25:01.880 align:start position:0%
it could then also be applied to uh to
 
03:25:04.110 --> 03:25:04.120 align:start position:0%
address environmental contamination in
 
03:25:08.910 --> 03:25:08.920 align:start position:0%
the state but again it all comes down to
 
03:25:11.550 --> 03:25:11.560 align:start position:0%
money that we get to remediate and
 
03:25:13.710 --> 03:25:13.720 align:start position:0%
environmental contamination should be
 
03:25:15.710 --> 03:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
used to remediate environmental
 
03:25:19.030 --> 03:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
contamination it's pretty pretty simple
 
03:25:22.269 --> 03:25:22.279 align:start position:0%
and uh and I hope uh I hope you find a
 
03:25:23.750 --> 03:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
way to support it and I'll answer any
 
03:25:26.590 --> 03:25:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:32.630 --> 03:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:36.309 --> 03:25:36.319 align:start position:0%
questions oh yes represent or thank you
 
03:25:37.870 --> 03:25:37.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and this may be a question
 
03:25:40.110 --> 03:25:40.120 align:start position:0%
for Mr whims when he gets here I see him
 
03:25:43.429 --> 03:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
waiting patiently uh uh for us but you
 
03:25:45.030 --> 03:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
did mention it that was my thought when
 
03:25:47.950 --> 03:25:47.960 align:start position:0%
when I saw this is the drinking water um
 
03:25:51.429 --> 03:25:51.439 align:start position:0%
uh and groundwater trust fund and that
 
03:25:53.670 --> 03:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
of course was related set up for another
 
03:25:57.110 --> 03:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
chemical that we were polluted with why
 
03:26:00.670 --> 03:26:00.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't we just maybe combine you know
 
03:26:03.189 --> 03:26:03.199 align:start position:0%
address the legislation or the statute
 
03:26:04.550 --> 03:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
that defines that because there's a fair
 
03:26:06.429 --> 03:26:06.439 align:start position:0%
amount of money in that as I as I am
 
03:26:09.990 --> 03:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
made aware of um so rather than make yet
 
03:26:12.389 --> 03:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
another fund Maybe
 
03:26:15.990 --> 03:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
re address the parameters of that fund
 
03:26:19.670 --> 03:26:19.680 align:start position:0%
so that we can put money through that I
 
03:26:21.870 --> 03:26:21.880 align:start position:0%
I think part of what I what I was trying
 
03:26:24.269 --> 03:26:24.279 align:start position:0%
to do with this I I know that there are
 
03:26:27.590 --> 03:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
um I think the funds that are out there
 
03:26:30.510 --> 03:26:30.520 align:start position:0%
um took time and Care uh to establish
 
03:26:32.830 --> 03:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
and the and the advantage of them is
 
03:26:34.910 --> 03:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
they're already established so if we
 
03:26:36.550 --> 03:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
actually receive settlement money that's
 
03:26:39.030 --> 03:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
supposed to go into those funds there's
 
03:26:40.830 --> 03:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
nothing in this bill that would keep
 
03:26:42.269 --> 03:26:42.279 align:start position:0%
that from happening happening so maybe
 
03:26:45.150 --> 03:26:45.160 align:start position:0%
Pas wasn't the uh the best example
 
03:26:46.870 --> 03:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
because money we receed for Pas
 
03:26:49.469 --> 03:26:49.479 align:start position:0%
settlements uh would actually go into
 
03:26:51.710 --> 03:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
the drinking and groundwater trust fund
 
03:26:53.349 --> 03:26:53.359 align:start position:0%
right so there we really don't have to
 
03:26:55.750 --> 03:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
do anything what what my bill does is
 
03:26:59.110 --> 03:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
sort of address um what up until now I
 
03:27:01.110 --> 03:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
think has been a fairly rare situation
 
03:27:03.389 --> 03:27:03.399 align:start position:0%
where we actually receive a substantial
 
03:27:05.710 --> 03:27:05.720 align:start position:0%
settlement uh for contamination that we
 
03:27:08.070 --> 03:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
haven't accounted for in our law yet so
 
03:27:12.189 --> 03:27:12.199 align:start position:0%
the idea is to just give that that money
 
03:27:14.790 --> 03:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
a place to live until the legislature
 
03:27:17.349 --> 03:27:17.359 align:start position:0%
can decide how it wants to spend it so
 
03:27:19.950 --> 03:27:19.960 align:start position:0%
we're not taking away the
 
03:27:21.950 --> 03:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
appropriation um ability of the
 
03:27:24.110 --> 03:27:24.120 align:start position:0%
legislature the legislator's ability to
 
03:27:26.030 --> 03:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
direct the money all we're doing is
 
03:27:28.630 --> 03:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
we're saying hey let's hold it in a
 
03:27:31.070 --> 03:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
specific fund until the legislature
 
03:27:33.110 --> 03:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
figures out what it wants to do with it
 
03:27:34.910 --> 03:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
once the legislature figures out what it
 
03:27:37.590 --> 03:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
wants to do with it then the money can
 
03:27:40.189 --> 03:27:40.199 align:start position:0%
start to be dispersed um and and I think
 
03:27:42.910 --> 03:27:42.920 align:start position:0%
this is one of the areas where DHHS had
 
03:27:45.229 --> 03:27:45.239 align:start position:0%
had some concerns is uh it's a little
 
03:27:47.429 --> 03:27:47.439 align:start position:0%
unclear in the bill around who you know
 
03:27:48.830 --> 03:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
which agency would actually be
 
03:27:51.229 --> 03:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
responsible for that so I think that's
 
03:27:52.469 --> 03:27:52.479 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things that we would
 
03:27:55.189 --> 03:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
look to need uh you know look at need at
 
03:27:56.790 --> 03:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
adding to the bill is to provide some
 
03:27:59.750 --> 03:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
clarity around that but I I don't see
 
03:28:02.349 --> 03:28:02.359 align:start position:0%
this as a statute that would be used a
 
03:28:05.710 --> 03:28:05.720 align:start position:0%
lot um but I think it's just a based on
 
03:28:08.189 --> 03:28:08.199 align:start position:0%
our experience with a PCB settlement it
 
03:28:10.229 --> 03:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
would be a good thing to
 
03:28:10.239 --> 03:28:12.429 align:start position:0%
would be a good thing to
have

03:28:12.429 --> 03:28:12.439 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:28:15.349 --> 03:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:28:17.510 --> 03:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:28:19.870 --> 03:28:19.880 align:start position:0%
representative this bill looks like it
 
03:28:25.510 --> 03:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
it adds the word soil to this uh to
 
03:28:29.309 --> 03:28:29.319 align:start position:0%
other to this effort and it seems to me
 
03:28:32.189 --> 03:28:32.199 align:start position:0%
that we focused mostly on water and
 
03:28:34.150 --> 03:28:34.160 align:start position:0%
drinking water and groundwater and I
 
03:28:36.070 --> 03:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
don't know that I've ever seen anything
 
03:28:38.150 --> 03:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
that says soil in this so this is
 
03:28:41.990 --> 03:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
different than what we've seen before so
 
03:28:44.870 --> 03:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh does that lend itself to combining
 
03:28:48.550 --> 03:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
with any other uh uh trust fund that we
 
03:28:49.990 --> 03:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
have thank
 
03:28:52.510 --> 03:28:52.520 align:start position:0%
you um the answer to your question is I
 
03:28:52.520 --> 03:28:53.229 align:start position:0%
you um the answer to your question is I
don't

03:28:53.229 --> 03:28:53.239 align:start position:0%
don't
 
03:28:55.469 --> 03:28:55.479 align:start position:0%
know this is this is where I think the
 
03:28:58.590 --> 03:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
experts might be able to help us out um
 
03:29:00.990 --> 03:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
the reason for putting soil in there is
 
03:29:03.870 --> 03:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
um uh and and I wasn't able to actually
 
03:29:06.189 --> 03:29:06.199 align:start position:0%
get uh an answer from the Attorney
 
03:29:07.990 --> 03:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
General's office around the specific
 
03:29:11.630 --> 03:29:11.640 align:start position:0%
reason why the PCB funds weren't put
 
03:29:13.269 --> 03:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
into the drinking and groundwater trust
 
03:29:17.229 --> 03:29:17.239 align:start position:0%
fund um but you know as as I as I looked
 
03:29:20.030 --> 03:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
at it um I know that when we talk about
 
03:29:22.229 --> 03:29:22.239 align:start position:0%
uh chemicals like pasas and things and
 
03:29:23.590 --> 03:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
and chemicals of that nature for the
 
03:29:25.030 --> 03:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
most part we're talking about water
 
03:29:26.710 --> 03:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
contamination even though the meramac
 
03:29:28.630 --> 03:29:28.640 align:start position:0%
situation it's also Airborne
 
03:29:30.349 --> 03:29:30.359 align:start position:0%
contamination that gets into the soil
 
03:29:32.790 --> 03:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
that contaminates the water it really
 
03:29:34.670 --> 03:29:34.680 align:start position:0%
was just an effort on my part to be more
 
03:29:36.830 --> 03:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
expansive around the types of
 
03:29:38.349 --> 03:29:38.359 align:start position:0%
settlements that could be could be
 
03:29:41.229 --> 03:29:41.239 align:start position:0%
entered I I also know that for from from
 
03:29:43.150 --> 03:29:43.160 align:start position:0%
my own experience back in the late '70s
 
03:29:45.309 --> 03:29:45.319 align:start position:0%
early 80s I was a reporter and I did
 
03:29:49.309 --> 03:29:49.319 align:start position:0%
several news stories on uh on on PCB and
 
03:29:52.150 --> 03:29:52.160 align:start position:0%
in particular I visited uh several uh
 
03:29:54.550 --> 03:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
sites in New Hampshire uh where waste
 
03:29:57.110 --> 03:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
pcbs were being stored basically imp
 
03:30:00.229 --> 03:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
properly in leaking barrels uh and some
 
03:30:01.950 --> 03:30:01.960 align:start position:0%
of the employees on those sites actually
 
03:30:04.750 --> 03:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
had an acute condition called chloracne
 
03:30:08.950 --> 03:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
which uh people can can get by actually
 
03:30:11.110 --> 03:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
getting the chemical on their skin it's
 
03:30:13.670 --> 03:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
self it develops a uh it it causes a
 
03:30:16.110 --> 03:30:16.120 align:start position:0%
skin condition very similar to to acne
 
03:30:19.189 --> 03:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
it's it's very uh quickly recognizable
 
03:30:22.469 --> 03:30:22.479 align:start position:0%
so um I know that it's it's not just
 
03:30:25.510 --> 03:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
water with pcbs it it is contaminated
 
03:30:27.830 --> 03:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
soil and brown brown fields and things
 
03:30:31.110 --> 03:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:33.790 --> 03:30:33.800 align:start position:0%
nature represent El
 
03:30:36.750 --> 03:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
me thank you
 
03:30:39.429 --> 03:30:39.439 align:start position:0%
um I
 
03:30:43.590 --> 03:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
do feel on that it's important to have
 
03:30:46.349 --> 03:30:46.359 align:start position:0%
something I'm sorry I'm having I do feel
 
03:30:48.830 --> 03:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
it it's important to have something more
 
03:30:51.750 --> 03:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
generalized like this the one before it
 
03:30:58.309 --> 03:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
for PC PF P seems to be only for four
 
03:31:01.429 --> 03:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
towns and there are a lot of other towns
 
03:31:06.630 --> 03:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
that have the P problem but um I wonder
 
03:31:11.150 --> 03:31:11.160 align:start position:0%
in particular this the the Monsanto one
 
03:31:15.590 --> 03:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh do we have methods for extracting
 
03:31:19.750 --> 03:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
this from water or some other way to to
 
03:31:22.510 --> 03:31:22.520 align:start position:0%
remediate What's Left of the problem at
 
03:31:24.309 --> 03:31:24.319 align:start position:0%
this point and would that money just be
 
03:31:25.670 --> 03:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
sitting there
 
03:31:29.150 --> 03:31:29.160 align:start position:0%
for decades while we wait to be able to
 
03:31:32.150 --> 03:31:32.160 align:start position:0%
solve it I am not an expert in
 
03:31:34.269 --> 03:31:34.279 align:start position:0%
remediation of this this chemical I do
 
03:31:36.990 --> 03:31:37.000 align:start position:0%
know that um I I actually live on
 
03:31:38.670 --> 03:31:38.680 align:start position:0%
Sagamore Creek and there's PCB
 
03:31:41.309 --> 03:31:41.319 align:start position:0%
contamination in the creek um and one of
 
03:31:43.910 --> 03:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
the the things I asked someone from the
 
03:31:45.910 --> 03:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
conservation law Foundation one time is
 
03:31:48.349 --> 03:31:48.359 align:start position:0%
well what what should we do about that
 
03:31:49.910 --> 03:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
and they said the best thing you can do
 
03:31:52.670 --> 03:31:52.680 align:start position:0%
is not to disturb it so I think
 
03:31:55.349 --> 03:31:55.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes we're in a situation like that
 
03:31:57.630 --> 03:31:57.640 align:start position:0%
however um it's a good idea to have
 
03:32:01.189 --> 03:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
people monitoring um that contamination
 
03:32:02.990 --> 03:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
um there's fishing that takes place in
 
03:32:04.550 --> 03:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
Sagamore Creek there's fishing that
 
03:32:07.309 --> 03:32:07.319 align:start position:0%
takes place in Squam Lake and if those
 
03:32:09.670 --> 03:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
if those chemicals work their way up the
 
03:32:11.429 --> 03:32:11.439 align:start position:0%
biological food chain we want people to
 
03:32:13.910 --> 03:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
be aware of the fact that um they're
 
03:32:15.750 --> 03:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
putting themselves and their families
 
03:32:19.429 --> 03:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
and anybody who eats that fish in danger
 
03:32:23.189 --> 03:32:23.199 align:start position:0%
um uh if if the level of PCB is above a
 
03:32:27.150 --> 03:32:27.160 align:start position:0%
certain level um so bottom line I I I
 
03:32:28.469 --> 03:32:28.479 align:start position:0%
one of the things is I think it's
 
03:32:30.670 --> 03:32:30.680 align:start position:0%
similar to pasas where it to actually
 
03:32:33.550 --> 03:32:33.560 align:start position:0%
destroy PCB uh it takes an extremely
 
03:32:36.670 --> 03:32:36.680 align:start position:0%
high temperature um so not not terribly
 
03:32:41.590 --> 03:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
easy to do um but um $20 million is $20
 
03:32:44.150 --> 03:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
million there just seems to have been
 
03:32:45.229 --> 03:32:45.239 align:start position:0%
there there might have been something
 
03:32:47.710 --> 03:32:47.720 align:start position:0%
else we could do other other than pay
 
03:32:49.910 --> 03:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
for copy or paper and
 
03:32:52.550 --> 03:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
toner uh there any pending lawsuits that
 
03:32:54.670 --> 03:32:54.680 align:start position:0%
you know of right now that could yield
 
03:32:57.550 --> 03:32:57.560 align:start position:0%
this sort of thing um I wish I did I
 
03:32:59.309 --> 03:32:59.319 align:start position:0%
wish I would have known about this
 
03:33:02.189 --> 03:33:02.199 align:start position:0%
one I think we all do or we we might
 
03:33:03.469 --> 03:33:03.479 align:start position:0%
have been able to kind of get to a
 
03:33:04.830 --> 03:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
different outcome and that's really what
 
03:33:06.670 --> 03:33:06.680 align:start position:0%
the bill is for to answer your question
 
03:33:08.150 --> 03:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
though I don't know of other lawsuits
 
03:33:10.590 --> 03:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
that are out there right now okay all
 
03:33:10.600 --> 03:33:11.469 align:start position:0%
that are out there right now okay all
right

03:33:11.469 --> 03:33:11.479 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:33:13.910 --> 03:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
right yes representa spillsbury thank
 
03:33:16.710 --> 03:33:16.720 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman so the bill basically
 
03:33:19.309 --> 03:33:19.319 align:start position:0%
sets up a prioritization order where for
 
03:33:22.030 --> 03:33:22.040 align:start position:0%
two years it's held for the specific
 
03:33:25.269 --> 03:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
type of contaminant treatment got that
 
03:33:27.830 --> 03:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
but it then defaults into these two
 
03:33:29.950 --> 03:33:29.960 align:start position:0%
existing funds Solid Waste Management
 
03:33:32.670 --> 03:33:32.680 align:start position:0%
fund and drinking water and groundwater
 
03:33:35.870 --> 03:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
trust fund I don't know much about those
 
03:33:38.070 --> 03:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
funds what's the current funding source
 
03:33:39.790 --> 03:33:39.800 align:start position:0%
and what are the current balances in
 
03:33:41.990 --> 03:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
those funds I don't know a lot about the
 
03:33:44.510 --> 03:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
other um current funding mechanisms
 
03:33:46.830 --> 03:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
either um so I'm not sure I'd be able to
 
03:33:48.750 --> 03:33:48.760 align:start position:0%
help you there uh what I do know is that
 
03:33:50.710 --> 03:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
money by those funds is used to
 
03:33:53.189 --> 03:33:53.199 align:start position:0%
remediate environmental contamination
 
03:33:54.790 --> 03:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
the reason for having that two-year
 
03:33:57.710 --> 03:33:57.720 align:start position:0%
period is sometimes it can take a long
 
03:33:59.670 --> 03:33:59.680 align:start position:0%
time for the legislature to agree on how
 
03:34:01.150 --> 03:34:01.160 align:start position:0%
money should be appropriated and
 
03:34:04.150 --> 03:34:04.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes we can't agree at all so the
 
03:34:06.710 --> 03:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
the thing is is fighting contamination
 
03:34:08.830 --> 03:34:08.840 align:start position:0%
in this state is urgent so what it it
 
03:34:10.750 --> 03:34:10.760 align:start position:0%
basically does is set a 2-year period
 
03:34:12.750 --> 03:34:12.760 align:start position:0%
perod where the legislature has time to
 
03:34:14.469 --> 03:34:14.479 align:start position:0%
make that decision has time to direct
 
03:34:16.750 --> 03:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
the funds um if at the end of that
 
03:34:19.309 --> 03:34:19.319 align:start position:0%
period the the legislature either hasn't
 
03:34:22.750 --> 03:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
directed the funds in a specific way or
 
03:34:24.790 --> 03:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
if there are it has directed the funds
 
03:34:26.910 --> 03:34:26.920 align:start position:0%
but there's money left over the money
 
03:34:29.710 --> 03:34:29.720 align:start position:0%
would flow into those two other existing
 
03:34:32.790 --> 03:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
funds where it could be used to
 
03:34:35.429 --> 03:34:35.439 align:start position:0%
remediate other problems in the state so
 
03:34:38.750 --> 03:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
the uh that's that's the
 
03:34:42.110 --> 03:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
intent follow up okay so I think the
 
03:34:44.349 --> 03:34:44.359 align:start position:0%
intent is clear I suppose I would want
 
03:34:47.030 --> 03:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
to know more about the answers to the
 
03:34:49.030 --> 03:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
two questions I posed before I thought
 
03:34:51.830 --> 03:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
that was the right default step and you
 
03:34:53.950 --> 03:34:53.960 align:start position:0%
know I don't know whether two years is
 
03:34:57.469 --> 03:34:57.479 align:start position:0%
actually sufficient to earmark funds for
 
03:34:59.030 --> 03:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
the specific
 
03:35:01.309 --> 03:35:01.319 align:start position:0%
contaminant um but I just want to point
 
03:35:02.910 --> 03:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
out incidentally I think there's some
 
03:35:05.870 --> 03:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
language here that's going to trip us up
 
03:35:09.910 --> 03:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
on line 30 of of uh page two the first
 
03:35:11.710 --> 03:35:11.720 align:start position:0%
page of the bill
 
03:35:15.590 --> 03:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
so what this sentence seems to do is
 
03:35:18.349 --> 03:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
exclude certain settlements settlements
 
03:35:21.349 --> 03:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
not included under the scope of this
 
03:35:24.030 --> 03:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
section include dot dot
 
03:35:27.790 --> 03:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
dot those eligible to be directed I
 
03:35:30.550 --> 03:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
think that the language but are not
 
03:35:33.429 --> 03:35:33.439 align:start position:0%
limited to has to be
 
03:35:35.910 --> 03:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
struck be I because I don't think you
 
03:35:38.030 --> 03:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
can construct an
 
03:35:41.750 --> 03:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
exclusion that is not limited it eats up
 
03:35:41.760 --> 03:35:45.790 align:start position:0%
exclusion that is not limited it eats up
the

03:35:45.790 --> 03:35:45.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:48.030 --> 03:35:48.040 align:start position:0%
whole and I think the reason for that
 
03:35:50.030 --> 03:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
language was a little bit of an out on
 
03:35:52.070 --> 03:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
my part because I wasn't sure if I had
 
03:35:54.309 --> 03:35:54.319 align:start position:0%
captured um all of the existing
 
03:35:56.189 --> 03:35:56.199 align:start position:0%
settlement funds which which means the
 
03:36:00.070 --> 03:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
exclusions can be unlimited
 
03:36:02.389 --> 03:36:02.399 align:start position:0%
yes so if that's something that the
 
03:36:04.070 --> 03:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
committee would like to address and and
 
03:36:06.990 --> 03:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
also my my guess is um uh Department of
 
03:36:08.269 --> 03:36:08.279 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services will have
 
03:36:12.550 --> 03:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:15.710 --> 03:36:15.720 align:start position:0%
okay uh represent elme just briefly did
 
03:36:15.720 --> 03:36:17.110 align:start position:0%
okay uh represent elme just briefly did
you

03:36:17.110 --> 03:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:36:21.870 --> 03:36:21.880 align:start position:0%
uh see the fiscal note and did you um
 
03:36:24.510 --> 03:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
look at what the Department of
 
03:36:24.520 --> 03:36:26.750 align:start position:0%
look at what the Department of
Environmental

03:36:26.750 --> 03:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
Environmental
 
03:36:29.790 --> 03:36:29.800 align:start position:0%
Services reservations are did I look at
 
03:36:31.910 --> 03:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
the Department of Environmental Services
 
03:36:34.189 --> 03:36:34.199 align:start position:0%
regulations on this I did not
 
03:36:37.229 --> 03:36:37.239 align:start position:0%
reservations about it the reservations
 
03:36:40.670 --> 03:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
they are they are saying that they worry
 
03:36:43.830 --> 03:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
that uh money is going to be diverted
 
03:36:48.070 --> 03:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
from uh other other um income coming
 
03:36:50.670 --> 03:36:50.680 align:start position:0%
into de the intent the intent of the
 
03:36:53.070 --> 03:36:53.080 align:start position:0%
bill is not to do that it's it's really
 
03:36:56.229 --> 03:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
only to to give funds that are
 
03:36:59.349 --> 03:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
undirected a place to go so they don't
 
03:37:01.469 --> 03:37:01.479 align:start position:0%
get put into the general fund that
 
03:37:03.110 --> 03:37:03.120 align:start position:0%
that's really what we're trying to do
 
03:37:06.670 --> 03:37:06.680 align:start position:0%
here so what I what I tried to do was to
 
03:37:06.680 --> 03:37:07.590 align:start position:0%
here so what I what I tried to do was to
very

03:37:07.590 --> 03:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
very
 
03:37:11.070 --> 03:37:11.080 align:start position:0%
clearly uh separate any
 
03:37:14.950 --> 03:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
um um uh any any provisions the
 
03:37:16.670 --> 03:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
legislature has already made to direct
 
03:37:18.710 --> 03:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
funds for specific type of contamination
 
03:37:22.710 --> 03:37:22.720 align:start position:0%
into existing trust funds so what what I
 
03:37:24.469 --> 03:37:24.479 align:start position:0%
did not want to do with this bill at all
 
03:37:26.070 --> 03:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
was to get in the way of anything that's
 
03:37:28.990 --> 03:37:29.000 align:start position:0%
already working um what I was trying to
 
03:37:31.790 --> 03:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
do do do is to address the one thing
 
03:37:36.269 --> 03:37:36.279 align:start position:0%
that appears not to be working thank
 
03:37:39.389 --> 03:37:39.399 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you thank
 
03:37:39.399 --> 03:37:43.830 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you thank
you

03:37:43.830 --> 03:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:51.030 --> 03:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:55.670 --> 03:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:58.189 --> 03:37:58.199 align:start position:0%
to good morning Mr chair and honorable
 
03:38:00.830 --> 03:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um at LSR
 
03:38:02.750 --> 03:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
filing time representative Muse and I
 
03:38:05.309 --> 03:38:05.319 align:start position:0%
both recognize the need for a bill such
 
03:38:09.590 --> 03:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
as HB 16 1613 and both of us filed lsrs
 
03:38:10.830 --> 03:38:10.840 align:start position:0%
with the same goal
 
03:38:12.389 --> 03:38:12.399 align:start position:0%
I withdrew my LSR and I'm happy to
 
03:38:14.229 --> 03:38:14.239 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor and testify to the merits of
 
03:38:17.030 --> 03:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
this important bill establishing a Soil
 
03:38:18.870 --> 03:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
and Water contamination settlement trust
 
03:38:21.309 --> 03:38:21.319 align:start position:0%
fund for funds or proceeds received by
 
03:38:23.389 --> 03:38:23.399 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General on behalf of the
 
03:38:26.070 --> 03:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
state or its citizens as a result of any
 
03:38:27.830 --> 03:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
civil judgment or settlement of a claim
 
03:38:30.550 --> 03:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
suit petition or other action regarding
 
03:38:32.429 --> 03:38:32.439 align:start position:0%
damages from environmental contamination
 
03:38:35.269 --> 03:38:35.279 align:start position:0%
of soil and water makes good sense it
 
03:38:36.510 --> 03:38:36.520 align:start position:0%
especially makes good sense to
 
03:38:37.910 --> 03:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
communities who have found themselves
 
03:38:39.710 --> 03:38:39.720 align:start position:0%
the unwitting victims of environmental
 
03:38:39.720 --> 03:38:40.870 align:start position:0%
the unwitting victims of environmental
contamination

03:38:40.870 --> 03:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
contamination
 
03:38:43.630 --> 03:38:43.640 align:start position:0%
are living with the negative impacts of
 
03:38:45.429 --> 03:38:45.439 align:start position:0%
environmental and public health
 
03:38:47.790 --> 03:38:47.800 align:start position:0%
contamination they've neither caused nor
 
03:38:50.110 --> 03:38:50.120 align:start position:0%
have the ability to stop and find that
 
03:38:51.830 --> 03:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
the resources aren't available to take
 
03:38:54.110 --> 03:38:54.120 align:start position:0%
all appropriate action I'll share a bit
 
03:38:56.309 --> 03:38:56.319 align:start position:0%
about my community as the environmental
 
03:38:58.550 --> 03:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
contamination experience there can be
 
03:39:00.550 --> 03:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
extrapolated to reflect the experience
 
03:39:02.429 --> 03:39:02.439 align:start position:0%
of other communities with other
 
03:39:04.790 --> 03:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
contaminants I live in and represent the
 
03:39:07.030 --> 03:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
town of marac the site of the largest
 
03:39:09.150 --> 03:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
industrial environmental disaster in New
 
03:39:11.110 --> 03:39:11.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's history related to the
 
03:39:13.189 --> 03:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
production practices of a multi-billion
 
03:39:16.830 --> 03:39:16.840 align:start position:0%
dollar multinational polluter St gobain
 
03:39:18.790 --> 03:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
marac residents have been and will
 
03:39:20.469 --> 03:39:20.479 align:start position:0%
continue to be greatly impact by
 
03:39:23.070 --> 03:39:23.080 align:start position:0%
impacted by pest a group of man-made
 
03:39:24.990 --> 03:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
toxins which such concerning
 
03:39:26.790 --> 03:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
bioaccumulation and
 
03:39:28.630 --> 03:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
biodegradation properties that they are
 
03:39:31.309 --> 03:39:31.319 align:start position:0%
known as forever chemicals PS are known
 
03:39:32.870 --> 03:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
to be linked to many negative Health
 
03:39:36.030 --> 03:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
impacts and at least one of the 12 to
 
03:39:38.950 --> 03:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
14,000 or so pest has recently been
 
03:39:41.150 --> 03:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
proven to cause cancer with further
 
03:39:43.229 --> 03:39:43.239 align:start position:0%
study I believe that other pfest will be
 
03:39:46.229 --> 03:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
C found to cause the same or S similar
 
03:39:49.389 --> 03:39:49.399 align:start position:0%
negative Health outcomes given a 42%
 
03:39:51.389 --> 03:39:51.399 align:start position:0%
higher kidney cancer incidence than
 
03:39:54.110 --> 03:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
would be expected my town is currently
 
03:39:56.750 --> 03:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
the subject of a $500,000 kidney cancer
 
03:39:59.030 --> 03:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
study for which in collaboration with
 
03:40:01.830 --> 03:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire DHHS I filed legislation
 
03:40:04.670 --> 03:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
to access funding the current study is a
 
03:40:06.830 --> 03:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
phase three feasibility study which may
 
03:40:09.710 --> 03:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
indicate a need for a more comprehensive
 
03:40:12.590 --> 03:40:12.600 align:start position:0%
full epidemiological health study as one
 
03:40:14.150 --> 03:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
might imagine health studies are
 
03:40:17.070 --> 03:40:17.080 align:start position:0%
expensive and trying to access funding
 
03:40:19.349 --> 03:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
for such important work given the many
 
03:40:21.110 --> 03:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
competing needs we have in New Hampshire
 
03:40:23.950 --> 03:40:23.960 align:start position:0%
can be challenging class action lawsuits
 
03:40:25.950 --> 03:40:25.960 align:start position:0%
have been filed to address the public
 
03:40:27.790 --> 03:40:27.800 align:start position:0%
health impacts of these dangerous
 
03:40:30.309 --> 03:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
environmental contaminants to date New
 
03:40:31.990 --> 03:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens living in pasas
 
03:40:34.150 --> 03:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
impacted communities have been denied
 
03:40:36.630 --> 03:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
medical monitoring and thus far at least
 
03:40:38.349 --> 03:40:38.359 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge New Hampshire has not
 
03:40:40.389 --> 03:40:40.399 align:start position:0%
received funding judgments or settl
 
03:40:42.710 --> 03:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
specific to pest that could be used to
 
03:40:44.429 --> 03:40:44.439 align:start position:0%
help address the significant and ever
 
03:40:46.349 --> 03:40:46.359 align:start position:0%
increasing problems it has
 
03:40:48.750 --> 03:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
created keeping the funds and proceeds
 
03:40:51.189 --> 03:40:51.199 align:start position:0%
from legal action taken in response to
 
03:40:54.189 --> 03:40:54.199 align:start position:0%
soil or water contamination distinct and
 
03:40:56.510 --> 03:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
separate from all other state funds and
 
03:40:58.870 --> 03:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
require they that they be deposited into
 
03:41:01.429 --> 03:41:01.439 align:start position:0%
a designated trust fund ensures that the
 
03:41:03.229 --> 03:41:03.239 align:start position:0%
funds received will actually be
 
03:41:05.590 --> 03:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
available to address and remediate the
 
03:41:07.710 --> 03:41:07.720 align:start position:0%
environmental contamination that
 
03:41:10.309 --> 03:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
precipitated the legal action my
 
03:41:11.830 --> 03:41:11.840 align:start position:0%
community and several others in Southern
 
03:41:13.309 --> 03:41:13.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire would like to be able to

be hearing from both of those U areas
 
03:42:36.189 --> 03:42:36.199 align:start position:0%

good afternoon thank you members of the
 
03:43:24.469 --> 03:43:24.479 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is

Services Division of Public Health
 
03:43:35.830 --> 03:43:35.840 align:start position:0%
Services uh the department does not have
 
03:43:37.710 --> 03:43:37.720 align:start position:0%
a position on this bill but does have
 
03:43:37.720 --> 03:43:38.590 align:start position:0%
a position on this bill but does have
some

03:43:38.590 --> 03:43:38.600 align:start position:0%
some
 
03:43:40.630 --> 03:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
concerns regard regarding the
 
03:43:42.590 --> 03:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
administrative responsibilities of the
 
03:43:45.269 --> 03:43:45.279 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation the proposed Bill
 
03:43:47.429 --> 03:43:47.439 align:start position:0%
amends New Hampshire RSA
 
03:43:49.990 --> 03:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
126a which is the statute that provides
 
03:43:51.389 --> 03:43:51.399 align:start position:0%
authority to the Department of Health
 
03:43:55.830 --> 03:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
and Human Services as written HB 1613 is
 
03:43:58.790 --> 03:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
not clear on determination of agency
 
03:44:01.189 --> 03:44:01.199 align:start position:0%
administrative responsibilities related
 
03:44:03.630 --> 03:44:03.640 align:start position:0%
to the proposed New Hampshire Soil and
 
03:44:06.670 --> 03:44:06.680 align:start position:0%
Water contamination settlement fund the
 
03:44:08.469 --> 03:44:08.479 align:start position:0%
proposed Bill does not provide an
 
03:44:10.030 --> 03:44:10.040 align:start position:0%
appropriation to the Department to
 
03:44:12.389 --> 03:44:12.399 align:start position:0%
support management of the trust fund and
 
03:44:13.990 --> 03:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
does not provide any rul making
 
03:44:17.070 --> 03:44:17.080 align:start position:0%
authority to establish um rules
 
03:44:19.910 --> 03:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
pertaining to administration of the fund
 
03:44:22.030 --> 03:44:22.040 align:start position:0%
uh the department recommends providing
 
03:44:24.229 --> 03:44:24.239 align:start position:0%
Clarity on agency administration of the
 
03:44:27.469 --> 03:44:27.479 align:start position:0%
trust fund and Associated Provisions for
 
03:44:29.670 --> 03:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
implementation and in particular because
 
03:44:32.149 --> 03:44:32.159 align:start position:0%
this trust fund is uh focused on
 
03:44:34.269 --> 03:44:34.279 align:start position:0%
environmental contamination and we heard
 
03:44:36.670 --> 03:44:36.680 align:start position:0%
from previous testimony about maybe the
 
03:44:40.510 --> 03:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
funds being directed to uh provide and
 
03:44:42.950 --> 03:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
um you know clean up of environmental
 
03:44:44.750 --> 03:44:44.760 align:start position:0%
contamination uh the Department of
 
03:44:46.550 --> 03:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services may be the more
 
03:44:48.990 --> 03:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate agency to the over the
 
03:44:51.630 --> 03:44:51.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
03:44:53.110 --> 03:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
while the Department of Health and Human
 
03:44:58.189 --> 03:44:58.199 align:start position:0%
Services does H um oversee one uh
 
03:45:01.510 --> 03:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
particular it's RSA 13A which uh is
 
03:45:04.229 --> 03:45:04.239 align:start position:0%
childhood lead poisoning so there is um
 
03:45:06.149 --> 03:45:06.159 align:start position:0%
Authority Under RSA 13A for the
 
03:45:08.030 --> 03:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
Department to do investigations related
 
03:45:10.710 --> 03:45:10.720 align:start position:0%
to to lead hazards that is really the
 
03:45:12.550 --> 03:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
limit of what the department oversees in
 
03:45:15.269 --> 03:45:15.279 align:start position:0%
terms of environmental contamination so
 
03:45:17.590 --> 03:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
um we just ask that the committee
 
03:45:20.110 --> 03:45:20.120 align:start position:0%
consider uh the purpose of the fund and
 
03:45:22.510 --> 03:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
and maybe look at which agency is more
 
03:45:26.189 --> 03:45:26.199 align:start position:0%
appropriate to oversee that
 
03:45:29.110 --> 03:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
um that pretty much sums up my testimony
 
03:45:31.389 --> 03:45:31.399 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions and
 
03:45:32.630 --> 03:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
I'm also happy to work with the bill
 
03:45:35.670 --> 03:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
sponsor on any revisions uh to this to
 
03:45:42.309 --> 03:45:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:45.830 --> 03:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
03:45:49.910 --> 03:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
you and the last pink card I have is
 
03:45:49.920 --> 03:45:53.349 align:start position:0%
you and the last pink card I have is
um

03:45:53.349 --> 03:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:55.550 --> 03:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
Adam I'm having trouble reading it so
 
03:45:59.950 --> 03:45:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:02.510 --> 03:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
nhdes good good afternoon members of the
 
03:46:04.469 --> 03:46:04.479 align:start position:0%
committee uh my name is Adam kpo I'm the
 
03:46:05.950 --> 03:46:05.960 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner at the Department
 
03:46:09.229 --> 03:46:09.239 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services and I have uh
 
03:46:11.189 --> 03:46:11.199 align:start position:0%
Mike at the director of the waste
 
03:46:13.349 --> 03:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
division with me here today to help
 
03:46:15.349 --> 03:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
answer some any technical questions you
 
03:46:18.149 --> 03:46:18.159 align:start position:0%
might have um the Department's not
 
03:46:20.590 --> 03:46:20.600 align:start position:0%
taking a position on this bill um the
 
03:46:22.630 --> 03:46:22.640 align:start position:0%
bill would as you've heard establish a
 
03:46:24.630 --> 03:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
trust fund to administer funding
 
03:46:26.630 --> 03:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
obtained um from environmental
 
03:46:29.110 --> 03:46:29.120 align:start position:0%
contamination Court settlements or
 
03:46:31.630 --> 03:46:31.640 align:start position:0%
judgments um currently the department
 
03:46:34.030 --> 03:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
administers many compliance enforcement
 
03:46:35.469 --> 03:46:35.479 align:start position:0%
and Remediation
 
03:46:37.670 --> 03:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
programs um that collect penalties and
 
03:46:39.750 --> 03:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
recover costs for Environmental remed
 
03:46:41.670 --> 03:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
mediation those funds are either
 
03:46:44.469 --> 03:46:44.479 align:start position:0%
deposited into funds created in statute
 
03:46:47.830 --> 03:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
or the general fund um as you heard from
 
03:46:50.710 --> 03:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh previous speakers there there was a
 
03:46:54.870 --> 03:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
PCB um settlement that went into the um
 
03:46:57.469 --> 03:46:57.479 align:start position:0%
general fund and so um it just depends
 
03:46:59.550 --> 03:46:59.560 align:start position:0%
on if there's a statutory mechanism for
 
03:47:02.750 --> 03:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
that um the department believes that
 
03:47:04.750 --> 03:47:04.760 align:start position:0%
this bill given the language in part
 
03:47:07.630 --> 03:47:07.640 align:start position:0%
five would only uh affect funds that go
 
03:47:11.269 --> 03:47:11.279 align:start position:0%
into the general fund uh
 
03:47:14.349 --> 03:47:14.359 align:start position:0%
one concern that we did have is that the
 
03:47:16.870 --> 03:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
bill is narrowly constricted so it would
 
03:47:19.269 --> 03:47:19.279 align:start position:0%
require any funds received from a
 
03:47:21.429 --> 03:47:21.439 align:start position:0%
judgment or a settlement to be used for
 
03:47:24.030 --> 03:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
a specific type of contamination um
 
03:47:26.550 --> 03:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
while in the case of PCB that was a
 
03:47:29.510 --> 03:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
pretty large settlement but um there are
 
03:47:31.349 --> 03:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
other ones that you know should in the
 
03:47:33.229 --> 03:47:33.239 align:start position:0%
future we get anything they may be
 
03:47:36.070 --> 03:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
smaller and either may not be enough or
 
03:47:40.189 --> 03:47:40.199 align:start position:0%
too much or um whatever the case is so
 
03:47:41.550 --> 03:47:41.560 align:start position:0%
we encourage the committee to provide
 
03:47:43.349 --> 03:47:43.359 align:start position:0%
some flexibility there to be able to use
 
03:47:45.550 --> 03:47:45.560 align:start position:0%
it on contamination generally should you
 
03:47:47.389 --> 03:47:47.399 align:start position:0%
decide to move forward with the
 
03:47:47.399 --> 03:47:50.030 align:start position:0%
decide to move forward with the
bill

03:47:50.030 --> 03:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:47:55.030 --> 03:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
um it is UN as H DHHS spoke about
 
03:47:58.469 --> 03:47:58.479 align:start position:0%
earlier um it's unclear which department
 
03:48:01.750 --> 03:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
ad is administering this fund so I I
 
03:48:04.309 --> 03:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
would encourage the committee to um you
 
03:48:07.550 --> 03:48:07.560 align:start position:0%
know clear that up and if you decide to
 
03:48:10.070 --> 03:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
move forward with the bill I would uh
 
03:48:11.910 --> 03:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
strongly consider making it a non-aps
 
03:48:14.189 --> 03:48:14.199 align:start position:0%
fund and continually appropriated so
 
03:48:15.670 --> 03:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
those are really the general the the
 
03:48:17.269 --> 03:48:17.279 align:start position:0%
gist of the comments in our testimony
 
03:48:19.550 --> 03:48:19.560 align:start position:0%
letter um but happy to answer any
 
03:48:21.990 --> 03:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
questions that you might have
 
03:48:24.070 --> 03:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
representative shamber thank you Mr
 
03:48:25.590 --> 03:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking this
 
03:48:28.429 --> 03:48:28.439 align:start position:0%
question uh what is presently your
 
03:48:33.469 --> 03:48:33.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:36.590 --> 03:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
overall Mike do you think that's a good
 
03:48:37.750 --> 03:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
question I always have that number
 
03:48:39.429 --> 03:48:39.439 align:start position:0%
memorized when we're in budget but then
 
03:48:42.189 --> 03:48:42.199 align:start position:0%
then then it leaves my brain it's uh I I
 
03:48:43.670 --> 03:48:43.680 align:start position:0%
I don't want to guess I I don't know the
 
03:48:45.590 --> 03:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
answer to that um I know just an answer
 
03:48:47.429 --> 03:48:47.439 align:start position:0%
somewh I know that for my division it's
 
03:48:49.309 --> 03:48:49.319 align:start position:0%
on the order of about $100
 
03:48:52.710 --> 03:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
million um but for the Department it is
 
03:48:54.149 --> 03:48:54.159 align:start position:0%
substantially greater than that because
 
03:48:57.030 --> 03:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
we administer um not only do we the
 
03:48:58.670 --> 03:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
division is only about one quarter of
 
03:49:00.750 --> 03:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
the number of people in the department
 
03:49:02.750 --> 03:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
but we also through our Water Division
 
03:49:04.389 --> 03:49:04.399 align:start position:0%
and and through our waste division
 
03:49:08.149 --> 03:49:08.159 align:start position:0%
administer um a a drinking water uh uh
 
03:49:09.990 --> 03:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
State revolving fund and a clean water
 
03:49:11.630 --> 03:49:11.640 align:start position:0%
State revolving fund that are
 
03:49:13.910 --> 03:49:13.920 align:start position:0%
essentially like a $200 million bank so
 
03:49:15.990 --> 03:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
it it it runs that number up in a way
 
03:49:17.189 --> 03:49:17.199 align:start position:0%
that doesn't really reflect the
 
03:49:19.229 --> 03:49:19.239 align:start position:0%
operations budget and we have all those
 
03:49:20.510 --> 03:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
numbers we could certainly provide them
 
03:49:21.870 --> 03:49:21.880 align:start position:0%
to you but I don't I don't want to
 
03:49:26.389 --> 03:49:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:29.790 --> 03:49:29.800 align:start position:0%
now oh yes representative
 
03:49:32.429 --> 03:49:32.439 align:start position:0%
Malloy thank you um Mr chairman thank
 
03:49:36.870 --> 03:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question earlier I
 
03:49:38.990 --> 03:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned the word soil was added to
 
03:49:42.710 --> 03:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
this um and we've I'm relatively
 
03:49:45.469 --> 03:49:45.479 align:start position:0%
familiar with the water mitigation and
 
03:49:50.030 --> 03:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
the pfoa and pfas U situations and that
 
03:49:53.670 --> 03:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just posing this question and
 
03:49:55.790 --> 03:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
I don't know that it's it's answerable
 
03:49:59.229 --> 03:49:59.239 align:start position:0%
here but how does one mitigate the
 
03:50:01.830 --> 03:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
soil the uh the the contaminants that
 
03:50:03.870 --> 03:50:03.880 align:start position:0%
are in the soil I'm familiar with the
 
03:50:06.790 --> 03:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
water and stuff that's my question sure
 
03:50:08.429 --> 03:50:08.439 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question soil can
 
03:50:10.510 --> 03:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
certainly be more challenging than water
 
03:50:12.229 --> 03:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
um particularly it's in situ right so
 
03:50:14.229 --> 03:50:14.239 align:start position:0%
unless you can either get some kind of a
 
03:50:16.910 --> 03:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
treatment reagent into it in place or
 
03:50:19.469 --> 03:50:19.479 align:start position:0%
dig it up and treat it um then it's hard
 
03:50:21.750 --> 03:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
to do with water we usually treat water
 
03:50:23.269 --> 03:50:23.279 align:start position:0%
either in a Wastewater setting at a
 
03:50:25.269 --> 03:50:25.279 align:start position:0%
Wastewater Plant or in a drinking water
 
03:50:27.429 --> 03:50:27.439 align:start position:0%
setting at a drinking water plant or in
 
03:50:29.510 --> 03:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
the case of a individual home at a at a
 
03:50:31.990 --> 03:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
treatment system within the home um so
 
03:50:34.070 --> 03:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
so but soil is is I think appropriate
 
03:50:36.429 --> 03:50:36.439 align:start position:0%
here in this case because in the case of
 
03:50:39.389 --> 03:50:39.399 align:start position:0%
pcbs it is it is true that most most of
 
03:50:41.110 --> 03:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
the contamination we have with respect
 
03:50:43.670 --> 03:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
to pcbs in the state is associated
 
03:50:45.590 --> 03:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
either with soil contamination or
 
03:50:47.750 --> 03:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
sediments at the bottom of of our water
 
03:50:50.590 --> 03:50:50.600 align:start position:0%
bodies because of the chemical nature of
 
03:50:53.030 --> 03:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
pcbs and the way it's strongly absorbed
 
03:50:55.070 --> 03:50:55.080 align:start position:0%
to soils and sediments we don't actually
 
03:50:57.030 --> 03:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
have very many instances of groundwater
 
03:50:58.830 --> 03:50:58.840 align:start position:0%
or drinking water contamination with
 
03:51:03.910 --> 03:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:08.149 --> 03:51:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:08.159 --> 03:51:10.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:51:10.910 --> 03:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:12.750 --> 03:51:12.760 align:start position:0%
so you've indicated that you would
 
03:51:15.429 --> 03:51:15.439 align:start position:0%
prefer not to have a constraint in the
 
03:51:17.550 --> 03:51:17.560 align:start position:0%
first two years on the specific
 
03:51:20.550 --> 03:51:20.560 align:start position:0%
contaminant but to to have more freedom
 
03:51:23.429 --> 03:51:23.439 align:start position:0%
okay what is your view towards the
 
03:51:25.830 --> 03:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
provision that then defaults unspent
 
03:51:28.590 --> 03:51:28.600 align:start position:0%
funds at the end of two years into these
 
03:51:31.429 --> 03:51:31.439 align:start position:0%
two specific existing
 
03:51:33.630 --> 03:51:33.640 align:start position:0%
funds I don't think we have we have a
 
03:51:35.630 --> 03:51:35.640 align:start position:0%
position on that or or the bill
 
03:51:39.630 --> 03:51:39.640 align:start position:0%
specifically but um you know if if the
 
03:51:40.870 --> 03:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
legis if it's the will of the
 
03:51:42.830 --> 03:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
legislature to not appropriate funding
 
03:51:44.910 --> 03:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
or there's a or there's not a mechanism
 
03:51:47.309 --> 03:51:47.319 align:start position:0%
to if there's no agreement to
 
03:51:50.429 --> 03:51:50.439 align:start position:0%
appropriate funding anywhere then maybe
 
03:51:51.990 --> 03:51:52.000 align:start position:0%
there should it should lapse into
 
03:51:55.110 --> 03:51:55.120 align:start position:0%
another um settlement fund such as the
 
03:51:56.389 --> 03:51:56.399 align:start position:0%
drinking water groundwater trust fund or
 
03:51:57.630 --> 03:51:57.640 align:start position:0%
something like
 
03:52:00.990 --> 03:52:01.000 align:start position:0%
that yeah if I might add I I think it's
 
03:52:03.269 --> 03:52:03.279 align:start position:0%
it's relevant to note because it's very
 
03:52:06.110 --> 03:52:06.120 align:start position:0%
specific to what actually happened um
 
03:52:08.550 --> 03:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
the the the the outsized response that
 
03:52:10.389 --> 03:52:10.399 align:start position:0%
the agency has had to make with regard
 
03:52:13.110 --> 03:52:13.120 align:start position:0%
to our discovery of past contamination
 
03:52:15.149 --> 03:52:15.159 align:start position:0%
initially out at the Sea Coast at the
 
03:52:17.349 --> 03:52:17.359 align:start position:0%
peas trade port and then a couple in
 
03:52:20.990 --> 03:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
2014 and then two years later in 2016 in
 
03:52:22.710 --> 03:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire as a result of
 
03:52:24.710 --> 03:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
some releases from some manufacturing
 
03:52:27.710 --> 03:52:27.720 align:start position:0%
facilities um we had to act very quickly
 
03:52:29.630 --> 03:52:29.640 align:start position:0%
like literally over the weekend when we
 
03:52:31.510 --> 03:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
learned about that to go out and do a
 
03:52:34.110 --> 03:52:34.120 align:start position:0%
lot of work to sample people's Wells to
 
03:52:35.790 --> 03:52:35.800 align:start position:0%
do and we've done a tremendous amount of
 
03:52:37.389 --> 03:52:37.399 align:start position:0%
work since that time which was eight
 
03:52:39.510 --> 03:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
years now um the only reason we were
 
03:52:41.349 --> 03:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
able to do that work is because we had
 
03:52:44.630 --> 03:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
access to funding that gave us broader
 
03:52:47.229 --> 03:52:47.239 align:start position:0%
um broader authority to use it most of
 
03:52:50.309 --> 03:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
the funds that we used to do the initial
 
03:52:53.750 --> 03:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
sampling and Analysis for pasas came
 
03:52:55.750 --> 03:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
from the drinking water and groundwater
 
03:52:58.750 --> 03:52:58.760 align:start position:0%
trust fund or from the MTB settlement
 
03:53:00.790 --> 03:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
funds we were the MTB settlement funds
 
03:53:02.830 --> 03:53:02.840 align:start position:0%
were directly related to mtbe but we
 
03:53:05.550 --> 03:53:05.560 align:start position:0%
were able to pay for actual sampling of
 
03:53:07.990 --> 03:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
Wells because we also could look at mtbe
 
03:53:09.429 --> 03:53:09.439 align:start position:0%
and we would take an additional bottle
 
03:53:12.550 --> 03:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
for pasas at that time in real time
 
03:53:14.469 --> 03:53:14.479 align:start position:0%
using those funds and then for
 
03:53:16.309 --> 03:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
analytical cost for pasas we were able
 
03:53:17.550 --> 03:53:17.560 align:start position:0%
to access to drinking water and
 
03:53:19.510 --> 03:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund all of those
 
03:53:21.149 --> 03:53:21.159 align:start position:0%
funds that I just mentioned the MTB
 
03:53:22.950 --> 03:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
settlement funds and the drinking water
 
03:53:26.349 --> 03:53:26.359 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund came from a
 
03:53:29.830 --> 03:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
lawsuit against Exxon Mobile and others
 
03:53:32.630 --> 03:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
directly associated with mtbe so it was
 
03:53:34.710 --> 03:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
very important that in the case
 
03:53:35.750 --> 03:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
particularly of the drinking water
 
03:53:37.590 --> 03:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust funds that we had the
 
03:53:39.389 --> 03:53:39.399 align:start position:0%
authority to use them in a broader sense
 
03:53:42.670 --> 03:53:42.680 align:start position:0%
for other contaminants because if we had
 
03:53:44.950 --> 03:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
then just used those funds for mtbe at
 
03:53:47.510 --> 03:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
that time when we had this complete
 
03:53:50.149 --> 03:53:50.159 align:start position:0%
explosive crisis with respect to pasas I
 
03:53:51.429 --> 03:53:51.439 align:start position:0%
don't think anybody would have been very
 
03:53:53.389 --> 03:53:53.399 align:start position:0%
happy with us at that time but because
 
03:53:56.790 --> 03:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
we had that ability to do that it made a
 
03:53:58.790 --> 03:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
world of difference in how responsive we
 
03:54:01.990 --> 03:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
were able to be to the Pas
 
03:54:04.469 --> 03:54:04.479 align:start position:0%
crisis brief followup
 
03:54:06.790 --> 03:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
so I think you're making a valuable
 
03:54:09.149 --> 03:54:09.159 align:start position:0%
Point am I right in assuming that the
 
03:54:11.070 --> 03:54:11.080 align:start position:0%
two funds specifically mentioned here
 
03:54:15.030 --> 03:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
are both currently administered by
 
03:54:18.870 --> 03:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
Dees they're entirely with agency that's
 
03:54:21.830 --> 03:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
correct thank you and I apolog I always
 
03:54:23.510 --> 03:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
wait for a question but if I might I
 
03:54:25.070 --> 03:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
have to leave here in five minutes for
 
03:54:26.590 --> 03:54:26.600 align:start position:0%
to be in another hearing that I cannot
 
03:54:28.990 --> 03:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
miss I do want to add one point if I
 
03:54:31.149 --> 03:54:31.159 align:start position:0%
might and that is that um because I
 
03:54:32.590 --> 03:54:32.600 align:start position:0%
think it will help the committee
 
03:54:34.710 --> 03:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
understand and I completely understand
 
03:54:36.389 --> 03:54:36.399 align:start position:0%
representative M's reason for wanting to
 
03:54:38.990 --> 03:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
do this the the circumstances surround
 
03:54:41.229 --> 03:54:41.239 align:start position:0%
in the PCB lawsuit were somewhat unique
 
03:54:45.510 --> 03:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
in the case of the um mtbe lawsuit we
 
03:54:47.229 --> 03:54:47.239 align:start position:0%
knew that that money was coming we had a
 
03:54:49.189 --> 03:54:49.199 align:start position:0%
lot of time the legislature talked about
 
03:54:51.469 --> 03:54:51.479 align:start position:0%
that and in a full session was able to
 
03:54:53.790 --> 03:54:53.800 align:start position:0%
develop and Implement a law that
 
03:54:54.990 --> 03:54:55.000 align:start position:0%
established the drinking water and
 
03:54:56.790 --> 03:54:56.800 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund so that money
 
03:54:58.750 --> 03:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
would have a place and a mission when it
 
03:55:01.830 --> 03:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
arrived at the agen at at the state in
 
03:55:03.790 --> 03:55:03.800 align:start position:0%
the case of the PCB lawsuit it was
 
03:55:05.309 --> 03:55:05.319 align:start position:0%
something that the Department of Justice
 
03:55:07.950 --> 03:55:07.960 align:start position:0%
was working on um it happened very
 
03:55:10.070 --> 03:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
quickly surpris even them how fast the
 
03:55:11.790 --> 03:55:11.800 align:start position:0%
settlement came and there was
 
03:55:13.750 --> 03:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
essentially no time to do that kind of
 
03:55:16.750 --> 03:55:16.760 align:start position:0%
process that was done with the uh uh
 
03:55:19.229 --> 03:55:19.239 align:start position:0%
with the with the with the mtbe lawsuit
 
03:55:21.349 --> 03:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
so I'm not here to present or take a
 
03:55:23.149 --> 03:55:23.159 align:start position:0%
position on the way to approach that in
 
03:55:24.830 --> 03:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
the future I think it's a it's a valid
 
03:55:26.510 --> 03:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
concern but I just want you to
 
03:55:27.469 --> 03:55:27.479 align:start position:0%
understand there's a significant
 
03:55:28.590 --> 03:55:28.600 align:start position:0%
difference between what happened with
 
03:55:31.189 --> 03:55:31.199 align:start position:0%
the PCB lawsuit and and what happened
 
03:55:33.389 --> 03:55:33.399 align:start position:0%
when we had that we knew that that mtbe
 
03:55:37.790 --> 03:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:37.800 --> 03:55:39.429 align:start position:0%
 
coming

03:55:39.429 --> 03:55:39.439 align:start position:0%
coming
 
03:55:41.710 --> 03:55:41.720 align:start position:0%
representative one other question Mr oh
 
03:55:41.720 --> 03:55:42.910 align:start position:0%
representative one other question Mr oh
I'm

03:55:42.910 --> 03:55:42.920 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
03:55:46.590 --> 03:55:46.600 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm wondering if if we had these
 
03:55:49.030 --> 03:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh this past and we had the three funds
 
03:55:53.229 --> 03:55:53.239 align:start position:0%
if you would um run into problems with
 
03:55:56.830 --> 03:55:56.840 align:start position:0%
receiving a new settlement coming in and
 
03:55:59.149 --> 03:55:59.159 align:start position:0%
not really knowing which partt to put it
 
03:56:01.990 --> 03:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
in or would you be faced with like oh do
 
03:56:06.189 --> 03:56:06.199 align:start position:0%
we put like 50% here and 50% there I I
 
03:56:07.670 --> 03:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
think depending on how the language is
 
03:56:10.830 --> 03:56:10.840 align:start position:0%
drafted this this fun I think the intent
 
03:56:13.309 --> 03:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
from represented Muse is to this to be a
 
03:56:15.790 --> 03:56:15.800 align:start position:0%
catchall for what isn't currently in
 
03:56:18.429 --> 03:56:18.439 align:start position:0%
statute so if it's not current currently
 
03:56:24.309 --> 03:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:27.710 --> 03:56:27.720 align:start position:0%
catchall yes A new a new settlement that
 
03:56:30.309 --> 03:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
isn't already accounted for in statute
 
03:56:32.790 --> 03:56:32.800 align:start position:0%
somewhere so in the case of PCB we
 
03:56:36.550 --> 03:56:36.560 align:start position:0%
didn't have a PCB remediation fund
 
03:56:38.510 --> 03:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
established and so it wouldn't have gone
 
03:56:40.990 --> 03:56:41.000 align:start position:0%
into into that um or or there wasn't a
 
03:56:42.309 --> 03:56:42.319 align:start position:0%
place for it to go so it Go went into
 
03:56:44.750 --> 03:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
the general fund um this would be catch
 
03:56:46.710 --> 03:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
anything that would currently go into
 
03:56:48.030 --> 03:56:48.040 align:start position:0%
the general
 
03:56:51.469 --> 03:56:51.479 align:start position:0%
fund just can I just follow up on that
 
03:56:54.110 --> 03:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
I'm just thinking about if something if
 
03:56:56.550 --> 03:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
a settlement comes in and it impacts
 
03:57:00.349 --> 03:57:00.359 align:start position:0%
water and it impacts soil and how you
 
03:57:04.309 --> 03:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
know you drinking water all it could it
 
03:57:06.429 --> 03:57:06.439 align:start position:0%
could impact all of those things how
 
03:57:09.110 --> 03:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
what would you do sure I it's a great
 
03:57:11.149 --> 03:57:11.159 align:start position:0%
question I I think the the answer is is
 
03:57:13.149 --> 03:57:13.159 align:start position:0%
that depends on the lawsuit and depends
 
03:57:15.189 --> 03:57:15.199 align:start position:0%
on the legal action if the lawsuit of
 
03:57:17.229 --> 03:57:17.239 align:start position:0%
the legal action is taken under an
 
03:57:20.110 --> 03:57:20.120 align:start position:0%
existing state statute that already says
 
03:57:22.189 --> 03:57:22.199 align:start position:0%
money goes to a certain place then it
 
03:57:23.790 --> 03:57:23.800 align:start position:0%
would be clear where that would have to
 
03:57:26.550 --> 03:57:26.560 align:start position:0%
go for example in the case of the PCB
 
03:57:28.030 --> 03:57:28.040 align:start position:0%
lawsuit I I don't remember all the
 
03:57:29.790 --> 03:57:29.800 align:start position:0%
details but my recollection is that that
 
03:57:31.870 --> 03:57:31.880 align:start position:0%
was essentially a nuisance claim there
 
03:57:34.229 --> 03:57:34.239 align:start position:0%
was no underlying State Environmental
 
03:57:36.950 --> 03:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
statute where that was being used to
 
03:57:39.630 --> 03:57:39.640 align:start position:0%
advance that lawsuit so as a result when
 
03:57:42.510 --> 03:57:42.520 align:start position:0%
the settlement occurred there was no uh
 
03:57:44.269 --> 03:57:44.279 align:start position:0%
controlling statute that would tell you
 
03:57:46.149 --> 03:57:46.159 align:start position:0%
here's where that money ought to go so
 
03:57:47.670 --> 03:57:47.680 align:start position:0%
when that happens when there's nothing
 
03:57:49.750 --> 03:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
there it defaults to go to the general
 
03:57:52.590 --> 03:57:52.600 align:start position:0%
fund so to answer your question I think
 
03:57:54.550 --> 03:57:54.560 align:start position:0%
uh if a lawsuit like that were moved
 
03:57:56.189 --> 03:57:56.199 align:start position:0%
forward that was again under a general
 
03:57:57.750 --> 03:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
nuisance claim or some other legal
 
03:57:59.550 --> 03:57:59.560 align:start position:0%
theory that wasn't tied to a State
 
03:58:01.590 --> 03:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
Environmental statute then it would
 
03:58:03.950 --> 03:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
likely go if it was about contamination
 
03:58:05.510 --> 03:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
it would likely go to this fund if this
 
03:58:07.590 --> 03:58:07.600 align:start position:0%
fund were created right a new a new
 
03:58:09.830 --> 03:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
settlement right
 
03:58:11.830 --> 03:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
representative shamberg followed by
 
03:58:13.630 --> 03:58:13.640 align:start position:0%
represent oh is he first okay
 
03:58:15.070 --> 03:58:15.080 align:start position:0%
representative Malloy thank you thank
 
03:58:17.990 --> 03:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
you very quickly P Money where would
 
03:58:19.269 --> 03:58:19.279 align:start position:0%
that go if
 
03:58:23.070 --> 03:58:23.080 align:start position:0%
we get that I I don't believe as I think
 
03:58:24.670 --> 03:58:24.680 align:start position:0%
probably most people here know there's a
 
03:58:26.309 --> 03:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
there's a there are pending lawsuits
 
03:58:28.389 --> 03:58:28.399 align:start position:0%
against the manufacturers of pasas that
 
03:58:30.229 --> 03:58:30.239 align:start position:0%
may take quite some time to reconcile
 
03:58:31.670 --> 03:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
but assuming that they do and that
 
03:58:33.830 --> 03:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
there's some award that comes to the
 
03:58:36.830 --> 03:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
state um I don't think this bill would
 
03:58:38.830 --> 03:58:38.840 align:start position:0%
impact that because there's already a
 
03:58:41.309 --> 03:58:41.319 align:start position:0%
lot of law on the books that say exactly
 
03:58:43.189 --> 03:58:43.199 align:start position:0%
where that money will go if and when
 
03:58:44.750 --> 03:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
those settlements or or verdict money
 
03:58:46.149 --> 03:58:46.159 align:start position:0%
would come in
 
03:58:48.790 --> 03:58:48.800 align:start position:0%
thank Senator CH thank you Mr chairman
 
03:58:50.149 --> 03:58:50.159 align:start position:0%
thank you I'll get you out of here real
 
03:58:54.070 --> 03:58:54.080 align:start position:0%
quick at the end of your Mo historically
 
03:58:55.469 --> 03:58:55.479 align:start position:0%
end of your budget
 
03:59:00.429 --> 03:59:00.439 align:start position:0%
years do you have Surplus money left
 
03:59:03.830 --> 03:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
over um that's a complex question on the
 
03:59:05.590 --> 03:59:05.600 align:start position:0%
general fund side there's certainly
 
03:59:08.630 --> 03:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
money that lapses and in fact um in many
 
03:59:11.229 --> 03:59:11.239 align:start position:0%
cases we're directed to have a lapse
 
03:59:12.870 --> 03:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
have money left over that will go back
 
03:59:15.950 --> 03:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
to the to the to the um State's coffers
 
03:59:18.910 --> 03:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
with respect to the um the kinds of uh
 
03:59:20.469 --> 03:59:20.479 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds that we've been talking
 
03:59:22.189 --> 03:59:22.199 align:start position:0%
about here most of those are
 
03:59:24.670 --> 03:59:24.680 align:start position:0%
continuously appropriated and non-lps so
 
03:59:26.389 --> 03:59:26.399 align:start position:0%
they they go over to the next bium they
 
03:59:28.389 --> 03:59:28.399 align:start position:0%
don't revert to the state
 
03:59:31.830 --> 03:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
cence representative ORS thank you Mr
 
03:59:34.030 --> 03:59:34.040 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking my question you
 
03:59:36.149 --> 03:59:36.159 align:start position:0%
say you're directed to put the money
 
03:59:37.750 --> 03:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
back to make sure you have money to put
 
03:59:39.389 --> 03:59:39.399 align:start position:0%
back in the general enal fund I'm not
 
03:59:42.550 --> 03:59:42.560 align:start position:0%
quite understanding that uh typically
 
03:59:44.870 --> 03:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
you know uh I don't know if you want to
 
03:59:47.229 --> 03:59:47.239 align:start position:0%
answer that typically the the governor's
 
03:59:49.550 --> 03:59:49.560 align:start position:0%
office is is you know as the head of the
 
03:59:51.950 --> 03:59:51.960 align:start position:0%
Executive Branch is looking to make sure
 
03:59:54.590 --> 03:59:54.600 align:start position:0%
that that all that everything works out
 
03:59:56.670 --> 03:59:56.680 align:start position:0%
financially for the state and they may
 
03:59:59.229 --> 03:59:59.239 align:start position:0%
have in a particular year a need for a
 
04:00:01.030 --> 04:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
certain amount of money to come back and
 
04:00:03.229 --> 04:00:03.239 align:start position:0%
and what often happens is you know for
 
04:00:05.030 --> 04:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
example I don't want to get too detailed
 
04:00:07.110 --> 04:00:07.120 align:start position:0%
but in the case of permanent full-time
 
04:00:10.070 --> 04:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
positions those are budgeted in class 10
 
04:00:12.149 --> 04:00:12.159 align:start position:0%
and if you have any vacancies during the
 
04:00:13.750 --> 04:00:13.760 align:start position:0%
during the year you're going to have
 
04:00:16.349 --> 04:00:16.359 align:start position:0%
extra money in that that money is not
 
04:00:18.950 --> 04:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
suddenly ever they never tell us oh you
 
04:00:20.429 --> 04:00:20.439 align:start position:0%
can use that for something else if you
 
04:00:22.910 --> 04:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
want to that money always lapses back to
 
04:00:27.070 --> 04:00:27.080 align:start position:0%
the to the state which as it should so
 
04:00:29.670 --> 04:00:29.680 align:start position:0%
follow thank you so I take it so it's
 
04:00:31.950 --> 04:00:31.960 align:start position:0%
not impacting what you're trying to do
 
04:00:34.389 --> 04:00:34.399 align:start position:0%
in terms of your day-to-day operations
 
04:00:34.399 --> 04:00:35.149 align:start position:0%
in terms of your day-to-day operations
or

04:00:35.149 --> 04:00:35.159 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:00:37.670 --> 04:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
whatever I'm sorry what's not impacting
 
04:00:39.590 --> 04:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
the money going back to the general fund
 
04:00:41.750 --> 04:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not taking out of what you
 
04:00:44.670 --> 04:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
need money for not typically no okay
 
04:00:44.680 --> 04:00:47.030 align:start position:0%
need money for not typically no okay
thank

04:00:47.030 --> 04:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:49.630 --> 04:00:49.640 align:start position:0%
you and I do apologize I I do have to
 
04:00:52.309 --> 04:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
step away representative
 
04:00:55.389 --> 04:00:55.399 align:start position:0%
roord thank you Mr chairman and I'm glad
 
04:00:56.710 --> 04:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
we got somebody staying because I've got
 
04:00:58.110 --> 04:00:58.120 align:start position:0%
a question hopefully you can answer this
 
04:00:59.710 --> 04:00:59.720 align:start position:0%
for me and and I think the the point of
 
04:01:02.429 --> 04:01:02.439 align:start position:0%
this bill is really to get the money
 
04:01:04.550 --> 04:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
that's going to the people that it's
 
04:01:07.389 --> 04:01:07.399 align:start position:0%
supposed to go to and and and and and I
 
04:01:09.710 --> 04:01:09.720 align:start position:0%
think that I hope we can all agree that
 
04:01:13.389 --> 04:01:13.399 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's a good cause um so
 
04:01:15.870 --> 04:01:15.880 align:start position:0%
I guess I know we have the drinking
 
04:01:17.870 --> 04:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
water and groundwater trust fund which
 
04:01:19.309 --> 04:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
that was already there it's already
 
04:01:20.830 --> 04:01:20.840 align:start position:0%
existed if I wonder if you could just
 
04:01:23.950 --> 04:01:23.960 align:start position:0%
describe to me a little bit because
 
04:01:25.469 --> 04:01:25.479 align:start position:0%
having been here a year I've only been
 
04:01:27.910 --> 04:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
here a year things move slow here and
 
04:01:31.070 --> 04:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
you know I I I I think sometimes that
 
04:01:33.469 --> 04:01:33.479 align:start position:0%
I in and in context of getting the money
 
04:01:35.429 --> 04:01:35.439 align:start position:0%
to where it needs to go we want to get
 
04:01:38.590 --> 04:01:38.600 align:start position:0%
it there as fast as we can as well so in
 
04:01:40.950 --> 04:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
that context could you describe a little
 
04:01:43.070 --> 04:01:43.080 align:start position:0%
bit how the drinking water and
 
04:01:44.630 --> 04:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust F works I know there's
 
04:01:46.670 --> 04:01:46.680 align:start position:0%
a commission or committee it's got 10 or
 
04:01:50.349 --> 04:01:50.359 align:start position:0%
12 people on it what's the process of
 
04:01:51.309 --> 04:01:51.319 align:start position:0%
getting and I think there's a lot of
 
04:01:53.429 --> 04:01:53.439 align:start position:0%
money in this fund quite a bit actually
 
04:01:57.149 --> 04:01:57.159 align:start position:0%
uh right now um and so how what's the
 
04:01:59.710 --> 04:01:59.720 align:start position:0%
process of getting that money to the
 
04:02:02.229 --> 04:02:02.239 align:start position:0%
people that need it and to making sure
 
04:02:07.469 --> 04:02:07.479 align:start position:0%
it goes to the the Urgent acute needs um
 
04:02:09.149 --> 04:02:09.159 align:start position:0%
you know and I and I say that in the
 
04:02:11.070 --> 04:02:11.080 align:start position:0%
context of you know I understand what
 
04:02:14.469 --> 04:02:14.479 align:start position:0%
the point of the bill is but I I don't
 
04:02:15.750 --> 04:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
want to reinvent the wheel I want to
 
04:02:16.750 --> 04:02:16.760 align:start position:0%
make sure we're getting the money where
 
04:02:18.950 --> 04:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
it needs to go as quick as we can get it
 
04:02:21.269 --> 04:02:21.279 align:start position:0%
sure sure so uh in in the case of the
 
04:02:22.590 --> 04:02:22.600 align:start position:0%
drinking water groundwater trust fund
 
04:02:24.550 --> 04:02:24.560 align:start position:0%
there is a drinking waterw trustman
 
04:02:27.269 --> 04:02:27.279 align:start position:0%
advisory commission that makes recommend
 
04:02:27.279 --> 04:02:28.149 align:start position:0%
advisory commission that makes recommend
uh

04:02:28.149 --> 04:02:28.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:02:30.590 --> 04:02:30.600 align:start position:0%
that helps establish the budget you know
 
04:02:31.710 --> 04:02:31.720 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of the Department of
 
04:02:34.309 --> 04:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services and and various
 
04:02:35.990 --> 04:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
other entities there are some State reps
 
04:02:37.389 --> 04:02:37.399 align:start position:0%
on there right now representative Bill
 
04:02:40.830 --> 04:02:40.840 align:start position:0%
Boyds the the chair um they they help
 
04:02:42.550 --> 04:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
decide where this money goes and and
 
04:02:45.950 --> 04:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
what the what the emerging needs are and
 
04:02:48.229 --> 04:02:48.239 align:start position:0%
what it would might be eligible for um
 
04:02:51.550 --> 04:02:51.560 align:start position:0%
and then once that is in place uh and
 
04:02:53.910 --> 04:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
they decide that then it goes through um
 
04:02:55.710 --> 04:02:55.720 align:start position:0%
Governor councel the governor councel
 
04:02:59.590 --> 04:02:59.600 align:start position:0%
process and and sort of the pro the uh
 
04:03:01.510 --> 04:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
mission of state government if you will
 
04:03:04.349 --> 04:03:04.359 align:start position:0%
so um I can get more information on that
 
04:03:07.870 --> 04:03:07.880 align:start position:0%
more detailed information on how those F
 
04:03:11.990 --> 04:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
what pockets of funds there are um and
 
04:03:14.550 --> 04:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
exactly where where those funds go if
 
04:03:17.110 --> 04:03:17.120 align:start position:0%
you'd like but that's from a 30,000 foot
 
04:03:20.429 --> 04:03:20.439 align:start position:0%
view how that works follow follow thank
 
04:03:23.590 --> 04:03:23.600 align:start position:0%
you um so I guess also looking at
 
04:03:25.790 --> 04:03:25.800 align:start position:0%
timeline I mean are we talking you know
 
04:03:28.110 --> 04:03:28.120 align:start position:0%
so if I if I find out the well of my
 
04:03:31.950 --> 04:03:31.960 align:start position:0%
backyard has mtbe microplastics past
 
04:03:33.670 --> 04:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
whatever it may be in it and I need a
 
04:03:36.149 --> 04:03:36.159 align:start position:0%
new well and that's determined you know
 
04:03:38.469 --> 04:03:38.479 align:start position:0%
it fits the criteria and I can go to
 
04:03:40.149 --> 04:03:40.159 align:start position:0%
this board and say hey because I think
 
04:03:42.550 --> 04:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
we've replaced two Wells this year uh
 
04:03:44.229 --> 04:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
you know I think it came from arpa funds
 
04:03:45.790 --> 04:03:45.800 align:start position:0%
but I think eventually this fund will be
 
04:03:47.229 --> 04:03:47.239 align:start position:0%
getting hit quite a
 
04:03:50.710 --> 04:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
bit point being is how quickly once I
 
04:03:52.950 --> 04:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
file a claim am I going to get help is
 
04:03:55.349 --> 04:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
this going to be years is it going to be
 
04:03:57.110 --> 04:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
weeks is it going to be months it
 
04:03:58.790 --> 04:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
depends on the the program there are
 
04:04:00.389 --> 04:04:00.399 align:start position:0%
several programs within the drinking
 
04:04:03.349 --> 04:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
water groundwater trust fund that that
 
04:04:05.030 --> 04:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
are administered and and the board helps
 
04:04:08.990 --> 04:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
decide where those go um you know and so
 
04:04:10.630 --> 04:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
we got a pretty large settlement from
 
04:04:14.070 --> 04:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
the Exon Mobile case um that's that's in
 
04:04:17.830 --> 04:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
the fund and you know it's really
 
04:04:20.550 --> 04:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
determining how much can be done each
 
04:04:23.590 --> 04:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
year because a lot of these funds go to
 
04:04:25.189 --> 04:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
um Grant there some of them are grants
 
04:04:27.469 --> 04:04:27.479 align:start position:0%
some of them are uh loans that come back
 
04:04:30.349 --> 04:04:30.359 align:start position:0%
and and with that we get uh interest on
 
04:04:33.510 --> 04:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
those loans so it so as to keep you know
 
04:04:35.710 --> 04:04:35.720 align:start position:0%
recycling the funding and you know
 
04:04:38.510 --> 04:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
moving forward so it really depends on
 
04:04:40.110 --> 04:04:40.120 align:start position:0%
on what program you might be talking
 
04:04:43.309 --> 04:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
about the um we we had a program
 
04:04:46.429 --> 04:04:46.439 align:start position:0%
regarding uh droughts and being able to
 
04:04:48.590 --> 04:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
drill new wells um if you're if your
 
04:04:51.870 --> 04:04:51.880 align:start position:0%
well went dry and you uh met some income
 
04:04:54.590 --> 04:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
requirements you so you may that may be
 
04:04:57.910 --> 04:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
what you're referring to but um but it
 
04:04:59.590 --> 04:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
just depends on the program and which
 
04:05:01.030 --> 04:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
program you're applying for and all of
 
04:05:02.710 --> 04:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
that and which programs are still open
 
04:05:05.269 --> 04:05:05.279 align:start position:0%
to apply for I have one more problem
 
04:05:09.229 --> 04:05:09.239 align:start position:0%
sure thank you um so the the uh actually
 
04:05:11.550 --> 04:05:11.560 align:start position:0%
it was a p I think there was a well in
 
04:05:13.550 --> 04:05:13.560 align:start position:0%
Canterbury and maybe out on the western
 
04:05:15.149 --> 04:05:15.159 align:start position:0%
side of the state two Wells were
 
04:05:18.349 --> 04:05:18.359 align:start position:0%
replaced uh because of contamination um
 
04:05:21.630 --> 04:05:21.640 align:start position:0%
so the legislation that's being proposed
 
04:05:23.429 --> 04:05:23.439 align:start position:0%
and maybe this is a question for the
 
04:05:25.750 --> 04:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor how would that would would it
 
04:05:27.309 --> 04:05:27.319 align:start position:0%
take an act of Congress an act of
 
04:05:29.189 --> 04:05:29.199 align:start position:0%
legislature if the money gets dumped
 
04:05:32.070 --> 04:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
into that trust fund an additional Act
 
04:05:35.830 --> 04:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
of this body to get the money out so I
 
04:05:38.030 --> 04:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
again the way I I can't I'm not clear
 
04:05:39.870 --> 04:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
when reading it so I want to make sure
 
04:05:42.030 --> 04:05:42.040 align:start position:0%
we have the easiest access to this that
 
04:05:44.149 --> 04:05:44.159 align:start position:0%
we can yeah my understanding based on
 
04:05:45.870 --> 04:05:45.880 align:start position:0%
the language is that the general court
 
04:05:48.349 --> 04:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
would need to uh administer the fund and
 
04:05:50.189 --> 04:05:50.199 align:start position:0%
and decide where those funds go the
 
04:05:51.910 --> 04:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
agency wouldn't be the one under the
 
04:05:56.389 --> 04:05:56.399 align:start position:0%
bill to do that um so that's it would
 
04:05:57.950 --> 04:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
take an act of the legislature if you
 
04:06:00.030 --> 04:06:00.040 align:start position:0%
will um I don't know I think uh
 
04:06:01.950 --> 04:06:01.960 align:start position:0%
representative you mentioned the fiscal
 
04:06:03.630 --> 04:06:03.640 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee at one point I'm
 
04:06:05.110 --> 04:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
not sure if that was the intent but I
 
04:06:08.469 --> 04:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
know it would be the as it now would be
 
04:06:10.070 --> 04:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
an act of the general
 
04:06:14.229 --> 04:06:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:18.269 --> 04:06:18.279 align:start position:0%

04:06:20.550 --> 04:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
