people to have more kids in China
 
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:07.640 align:start position:0%
today so I recently dug that book out I
 
00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:08.599 align:start position:0%
thumped through it again and I was
 
00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:10.719 align:start position:0%
stunned by how wrong its doomsday
 
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:12.920 align:start position:0%
projections were uh I I think
 
00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:14.839 align:start position:0%
brainwashing is probably too strong of a
 
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:18.920 align:start position:0%
term uh from Professor Swan who I liked
 
00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
but I was certainly I think I was
 
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 align:start position:0%
indoctrinated um and despite how wrong
 
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
those 70s activists were hysterical
 
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 align:start position:0%
pronouncements continue to this day in
 
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 align:start position:0%
ice a in the 70s was going to be an Ice
 
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
Age Ice Age is coming no and then no the
 
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
polar ice is melting uh Florida will
 
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
soon be underwater I could go on and on
 
00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 align:start position:0%
I'm going to uh jump to a few
 
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
examples uh both recent and not so
 
00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 align:start position:0%
recent on March 20th 2023 a year less
 
00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 align:start position:0%
than a year ago the United Nations
 
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
warned of Humanity's ticking Time Bomb
 
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
quote unquote and they released a report
 
00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:57.039 align:start position:0%
of reports enumerating multi-trillion
 
00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:58.630 align:start position:0%
of reports enumerating multi-trillion
multi-trillion

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 align:start position:0%

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 align:start position:0%
gutterz proclaimed the report quote a
 
00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439 align:start position:0%
survival guide for Humanity and called
 
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 align:start position:0%
for the phase out of fossil fuels this
 
00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 align:start position:0%
is from the UN last year phase out
 
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels to save the planet he wrote
 
00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
dear friends humanity is on thin ice
 
00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
that is ice that is melting fast some
 
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 align:start position:0%
other quick examples 1982 Mustafa Toba
 
00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 align:start position:0%
executive director of the un's this is
 
00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
years ago the un's environment program
 
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 align:start position:0%
warned of widespread Devastation in less
 
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
than 20 years he quoted he said quote an
 
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.630 align:start position:0%
than 20 years he quoted he said quote an
environmental

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 align:start position:0%
environmental
 
00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
catastrophe which will witness that
 
00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 align:start position:0%
Devastation as complete as irreversible
 
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
as any nuclear Holocaust is upon us this
 
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.630 align:start position:0%
as any nuclear Holocaust is upon us this
is

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 align:start position:0%
1982 uh back in the 70s uh Harvard
 
00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
biologist and Nobel Prize winner George
 
00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 align:start position:0%
Wald speaking at the University of Rhode
 
00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 align:start position:0%
Island said quote Civilization will end
 
00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 align:start position:0%
within 15 or 30 years unless immediate
 
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 align:start position:0%
action is taken this isn't the 70s
 
00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 align:start position:0%
civilization will end unless immediate
 
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 align:start position:0%
action is
 
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
taken uh in the 70s again when I took
 
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
this class Greenhouse theorists pushed a
 
00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 align:start position:0%
rise in average temperature plenty of
 
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
prognosticators predictors said a big
 
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 align:start position:0%
freeze is coming and uh I won't get into
 
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
all the stats and projected it's going
 
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 align:start position:0%
to 11Â° colder by the year 2000 uh ice
 
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 align:start position:0%
age is coming of course that didn't
 
00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
happen uh so in the 70s Ice Age is
 
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 align:start position:0%
coming but within a couple years
 
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
suddenly uh global cooling is not
 
00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 align:start position:0%
happening global warming is happening so
 
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
the the climate has always changed and I
 
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 align:start position:0%
am not a climate denier so to speak uh
 
00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
climate has always changed the big issue
 
00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
is how much is man's activities
 
00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 align:start position:0%
impacting climate nobody knows for sure
 
00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:04.599 align:start position:0%
some say minimally some say a lot we
 
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 align:start position:0%
don't know and some scientists say some
 
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 align:start position:0%
things other scientists say different
 
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 align:start position:0%
things the concern and the reason for
 
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
this this uh resolution is
 
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
that scientists who don't seem to adhere
 
00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319 align:start position:0%
to or Gom on to the the most uh extreme
 
00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 align:start position:0%
predictions um are being
 
00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
silenced and that is a concern
 
00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 align:start position:0%
uh 2006 former vice president Gore
 
00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 align:start position:0%
predicted that unless drastic measures
 
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
were implemented the planet would hit
 
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
quote an irreversible point of no return
 
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
by 2016 well that was eight years ago
 
00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 align:start position:0%
and I'm the point of no return was just
 
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
not clear as as recently as April of
 
00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
2008 CNN uh media Mogul Ted Turner Ted
 
00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 align:start position:0%
Turner stressed the consequences of
 
00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:03.159 align:start position:0%
climate action action now he said quote
 
00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 align:start position:0%
not doing it will be catastrophic most
 
00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 align:start position:0%
of the people will have died and the
 
00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 align:start position:0%
rest of us will be cannibals
 
00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 align:start position:0%
civilization will have broken down the
 
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 align:start position:0%
droughts will be so bad there'll be no
 
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
more corn
 
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
growing well the corn is still growing
 
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
all these year this is 16 years later uh
 
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 align:start position:0%
just went by Senator Pearl's Farm many a
 
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
number of times he's got plenty of corn
 
00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:27.759 align:start position:0%
growing so Ted Turner was wrong the
 
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
cannibalism that he predicted I hope it
 
00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen I'm not seeing any
 
00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:33.150 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen I'm not seeing any
imminent

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 align:start position:0%
imminent
 
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 align:start position:0%
cannibalism uh July uh 2009 a year later
 
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 align:start position:0%
Prince Charles now King Charles Prince
 
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
Charles asserted the planet had 96
 
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
months to avoid decimation quote
 
00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 align:start position:0%
irretrievable climate and ecosystem
 
00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
collaps and all that goes with it is
 
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
imminent uh and one more um January 2019
 
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
representative Alexandria acassio Cortez
 
00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 align:start position:0%
put her chips on 2031 is the potential
 
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
end of days so that hasn't got here yet
 
00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
it's coming quote Millennials and other
 
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
people you know gen Z and all these
 
00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:08.199 align:start position:0%
folks that will come after us are
 
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
looking up and we're like the world is
 
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
going to end in 12 years if we don't
 
00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
address climate and your biggest issue
 
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
is how we're going to pay for it and
 
00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919 align:start position:0%
like this is war this is our World War
 
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
II so anyway so there's some examples of
 
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 align:start position:0%
of uh climate activism maybe climate
 
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
extremism uh these predictions these
 
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 align:start position:0%
forecasts routinely are
 
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
wrong and yet as legislators as
 
00:05:40.309 --> 00:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
lawmakers we are under incredible
 
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
pressures to uh respond to these uh you
 
00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
know these extremists I think uh calls
 
00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.469 align:start position:0%
know these extremists I think uh calls
for

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 align:start position:0%
Action so what prompts this extreme
 
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
activism uh media sensationalism is part
 
00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 align:start position:0%
of it you know the if if the world is
 
00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
going to end and that's that's a that's
 
00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
a story
 
00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 align:start position:0%
except that the these these dramatic
 
00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
warnings of the world then they just
 
00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:09.160 align:start position:0%
have have don't haven't happened uh
 
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
media sensationalism uh green energy
 
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
companies of course they do everything
 
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
that they can to create uh concerns and
 
00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:20.759 align:start position:0%
and a demand for green Energy Products
 
00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
whether it's batteries or solar panels
 
00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
um or whatever of course they're going
 
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 align:start position:0%
to try to make a case that their
 
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
products are needed
 
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
um and on and on uh activists activists
 
00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720 align:start position:0%
need causes they that's that's how they
 
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
draw their energy so those of us who
 
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
make laws as they just said are
 
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
pressured by climate activists to take
 
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
action or else we're doomed laws are in
 
00:06:48.309 --> 00:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
place in some states that eventually ban
 
00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:51.319 align:start position:0%
not only gas powered vehicles but gas
 
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
stoves gas stoves are not here in New
 
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yet it's being talked about
 
00:06:58.189 --> 00:06:58.199 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire but there are some
 
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:00.440 align:start position:0%
localities and some states that are
 
00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:02.759 align:start position:0%
phasing out gas stoves they're phasing
 
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
out uh gas uh powered
 
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
vehicles and is that necessary is it
 
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:11.800 align:start position:0%
right uh there are folks here in New
 
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that want uh us legislators to
 
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:17.240 align:start position:0%
to look at taking similar action uh
 
00:07:18.909 --> 00:07:18.919 align:start position:0%
people want to mandate electric school
 
00:07:21.309 --> 00:07:21.319 align:start position:0%
buses is that the best way to go is it
 
00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
safe is it practical does it work in the
 
00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
cold um military jets are this's
 
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
pressure for them to use organic fuel
 
00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
regardless of the extra cost uh we've
 
00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
had bills in this chamber or in this
 
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:39.800 align:start position:0%
house to ban wood stoves and that's why
 
00:07:43.390 --> 00:07:43.400 align:start position:0%
it's relevant to us if we have these
 
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
bills whether it's to ban wood stoves or
 
00:07:49.629 --> 00:07:49.639 align:start position:0%
have buy electric buses or ban gas
 
00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
stoves like is happening elsewhere is
 
00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
that good public policy is it based on
 
00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:56.919 align:start position:0%
good science well we look at scientists
 
00:07:59.309 --> 00:07:59.319 align:start position:0%
and and the scientists that that said
 
00:08:01.309 --> 00:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
say wo you know it's not as bad as some
 
00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
others are saying their voices I we keep
 
00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
seeing are being stifled farmers and
 
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
rancors are now struggling against the
 
00:08:11.629 --> 00:08:11.639 align:start position:0%
imposition of unreasonable fertilizers
 
00:08:14.589 --> 00:08:14.599 align:start position:0%
and livestock reduction mandates
 
00:08:18.309 --> 00:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
So speaking of food it's the activists
 
00:08:22.909 --> 00:08:22.919 align:start position:0%
who are putting farmers in some cases uh
 
00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
in bad places because of uh methane we
 
00:08:29.629 --> 00:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
need fewer cows fewer cows means less
 
00:08:33.389 --> 00:08:33.399 align:start position:0%
milk means Less meat and so while the
 
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:36.240 align:start position:0%
the food problems didn't materialize the
 
00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:39.240 align:start position:0%
the very folks that worn of them want
 
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
policies that are going to create food
 
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
short shortages with their Farm policies
 
00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:46.720 align:start position:0%
fertilizer policies livestock reduction
 
00:08:49.949 --> 00:08:49.959 align:start position:0%
yes cows create methane how bad is the
 
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
methane problem from cows it depends on
 
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
who you talk to but the those who who
 
00:08:59.430 --> 00:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
emphasize the greatest danger in C
 
00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
methane problems uh are the ones who
 
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
seem to drive the
 
00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
conversation uh so activists often cite
 
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
scientific consensus and arguing for
 
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
emergency climate action but unlike
 
00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
political policies we work on consensus
 
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
this committee we we try to come to
 
00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
consensus when we can science is
 
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
different science isn't about compromise
 
00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
it isn't about consensus it isn't about
 
00:09:24.509 --> 00:09:24.519 align:start position:0%
voting it's about
 
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
numbers and facts and
 
00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:30.279 align:start position:0%
data in scientific is being twisted and
 
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
used to promote political agendas
 
00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
scientists are bullied into signing on
 
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
you see all these uh scientists you know
 
00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:40.399 align:start position:0%
100 scientists signed on for something
 
00:09:42.509 --> 00:09:42.519 align:start position:0%
some of them later on say I didn't dare
 
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
not to sign
 
00:09:48.509 --> 00:09:48.519 align:start position:0%
on and it's beyond science act I have a
 
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
professor background I've been in work
 
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:53.560 align:start position:0%
taught at a number of colleges
 
00:09:56.790 --> 00:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
universities and have done research and
 
00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:00.200 align:start position:0%
research is being compromised by the
 
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:02.920 align:start position:0%
climate activists and extremist Dr
 
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
Frederick sites former head of the
 
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
United States National Academy of
 
00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:11.240 align:start position:0%
Sciences wrote in more than 60 years as
 
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:13.120 align:start position:0%
a member of the scientific Community I
 
00:10:15.069 --> 00:10:15.079 align:start position:0%
have never witnessed a more disturbing
 
00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:17.800 align:start position:0%
Corruption of the peer review process
 
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:19.880 align:start position:0%
than the events that now shape climate
 
00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:20.910 align:start position:0%
than the events that now shape climate
change

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
reports peer review is what happens with
 
00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:26.200 align:start position:0%
with scholarly papers you your peers
 
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
look at them and and give input on them
 
00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.790 align:start position:0%
look at them and and give input on them
and

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:29.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
the peer review process has been
 
00:10:35.949 --> 00:10:35.959 align:start position:0%
corrupted which is a concern to those of
 
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
us in
 
00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
Academia which brings us to the purpose
 
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
of this resolution which simply calls
 
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
for all the voices to be heard as we
 
00:10:45.949 --> 00:10:45.959 align:start position:0%
develop climate policies and pass
 
00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
laws those experts who are being
 
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
threatened uh and ignored deserve to be
 
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:54.760 align:start position:0%
heard and we need to stop scaring the
 
00:10:57.150 --> 00:10:57.160 align:start position:0%
heck out of kids the way UNH scared the
 
00:10:58.750 --> 00:10:58.760 align:start position:0%
heck out of me when I was a freshman
 
00:10:58.760 --> 00:10:59.990 align:start position:0%
heck out of me when I was a freshman
there

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:02.240 align:start position:0%
most of us agree that measured and
 
00:11:04.949 --> 00:11:04.959 align:start position:0%
sensible reductions in fossil fuel
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
emissions are
 
00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
desirable and we can do that by working
 
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
together like we used to the EPA was
 
00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:14.240 align:start position:0%
established under a Republican
 
00:11:17.949 --> 00:11:17.959 align:start position:0%
Presidential Administration and together
 
00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
we've worked and cleaned as I said
 
00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
earlier we've cleaned our lakes and
 
00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:23.959 align:start position:0%
rivers we've cleaned our air does
 
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
anybody remember how terrible the air
 
00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:28.360 align:start position:0%
was air pollution in New York City or or
 
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
Los Angeles
 
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
we've done a great bipartisan job for
 
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
decades of working together sensibly to
 
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
address pollution and air pollution
 
00:11:41.829 --> 00:11:41.839 align:start position:0%
water pollution
 
00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:45.320 align:start position:0%
climate is a little bit different you
 
00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
know that's where the debate is so
 
00:11:50.829 --> 00:11:50.839 align:start position:0%
climate to finish up climate extremists
 
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
who shut down debate and try to impose
 
00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:55.720 align:start position:0%
radical measures help create bad
 
00:11:59.670 --> 00:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
policies and bad laws while silencing
 
00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:02.200 align:start position:0%
contrary opinions so this resolution
 
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
simply calls for us to listen to All
 
00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
voices just says let's just listen to
 
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:11.200 align:start position:0%
everybody and stop shutting out some
 
00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
voices who don't adhere to the extremist
 
00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
activist climate agenda as we formulate
 
00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
policy so if that sounds reasonable then
 
00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:21.880 align:start position:0%
I hope we can eventually vote Yes to
 
00:12:24.389 --> 00:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
listen to All voices or if you don't
 
00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:26.680 align:start position:0%
want to listen to All voices then I
 
00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:29.519 align:start position:0%
think that would be a concern uh that's
 
00:12:31.189 --> 00:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
all I have thank you Mr chair take
 
00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:33.839 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any do we have
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
any questions yes representative
 
00:12:40.189 --> 00:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
gagy thank you representative for this
 
00:12:41.949 --> 00:12:41.959 align:start position:0%
good stuff look I've lived on this
 
00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:44.360 align:start position:0%
planet for almost 80 years now and I've
 
00:12:47.069 --> 00:12:47.079 align:start position:0%
heard this from the get-go and you're
 
00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:50.440 align:start position:0%
talking about comments
 
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
here when in the 50s when the mills in
 
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
Manchester were running they they were
 
00:12:57.790 --> 00:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
starting to die but they were still
 
00:12:59.710 --> 00:12:59.720 align:start position:0%
running you could could go and look at
 
00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
the marac river and see what kind of
 
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
merchandise they were making by the
 
00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
color of the river red one day green
 
00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
another day blue another day was just
 
00:13:12.069 --> 00:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
discharged that's all cleaned up like
 
00:13:15.509 --> 00:13:15.519 align:start position:0%
you like you said that the uh that has
 
00:13:17.230 --> 00:13:17.240 align:start position:0%
been cleaned up you can actually swim in
 
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
the river now and we're taking uh we're
 
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
taking water from the marac river for
 
00:13:25.829 --> 00:13:25.839 align:start position:0%
our drinking water now also uh I also
 
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
remember another uh incident for me back
 
00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:33.279 align:start position:0%
when I uh started working at the post
 
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:34.240 align:start position:0%
office in
 
00:13:36.629 --> 00:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
1984 and some of my colleagues were
 
00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:39.320 align:start position:0%
saying what do you want to do that we're
 
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
going to be out of business in about two
 
00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
three years right and although things
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
might be slowing down and not like they
 
00:13:47.629 --> 00:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
used to be now the internet still has
 
00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
not quite taken over and they're still I
 
00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
still like my letters uh so would you
 
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
say that it's a control issue that the
 
00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
the minority Elite wants to control the
 
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:05.720 align:start position:0%
masses by fear I spoke to u a uh some
 
00:14:07.470 --> 00:14:07.480 align:start position:0%
some time ago
 
00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
about newspaper uh uh he was tele he's a
 
00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:17.839 align:start position:0%
television uh uh reporter and he said if
 
00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:21.839 align:start position:0%
it bleeds it leads so my bottom line
 
00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:23.720 align:start position:0%
what I got out of that was that keep the
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
fear before the people so they'll listen
 
00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
to these controlling Elites would that a
 
00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
fair assessment thank you for the
 
00:14:32.749 --> 00:14:32.759 align:start position:0%
comment and the question representative
 
00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:34.959 align:start position:0%
I totally agree uh you mentioned fear
 
00:14:38.069 --> 00:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
this is all about fear frankly I think
 
00:14:41.189 --> 00:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
uh and I many of us are just tired you
 
00:14:43.829 --> 00:14:43.839 align:start position:0%
know going back uh as you said Decades
 
00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:46.600 align:start position:0%
of the fear mongering which is going on
 
00:14:49.509 --> 00:14:49.519 align:start position:0%
uh again I recited when I was a 50 years
 
00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:51.880 align:start position:0%
ago when I was a freshman at UNH uh they
 
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
scared the heck out of me as I've
 
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
already as I've already said and you
 
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned the rivers and so it goes back
 
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
to working together uh I I one quick
 
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
comment on climate uh if you do some
 
00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:07.959 align:start position:0%
history I in 536 ad during the Dark Ages
 
00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
there apparently was a huge volcanic
 
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
event uh not well recorded it was 536
 
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
but if you go back and look at the tree
 
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
rings in those days uh apparently the
 
00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
the the world was dark uh trees didn't
 
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
grow in that year the temperatures
 
00:15:25.749 --> 00:15:25.759 align:start position:0%
plunged now that happened that wasn't
 
00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:28.120 align:start position:0%
man-made that was due to a volcanic
 
00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
eruption same thing happened around 1816
 
00:15:32.749 --> 00:15:32.759 align:start position:0%
I was talking to representative sh
 
00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:35.720 align:start position:0%
sherff a little bit earlier about 18 New
 
00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 1816 and froze to death uh
 
00:15:40.189 --> 00:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
people get the heck out of New Hampshire
 
00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
why because of volcanic activity Cato
 
00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
TOA so not that I buy Into Climate
 
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
Change man caused but I would say to
 
00:15:51.629 --> 00:15:51.639 align:start position:0%
some of the activists who are telling us
 
00:15:53.829 --> 00:15:53.839 align:start position:0%
that we've increased temperature by two
 
00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
degrees I don't necessarily agree but
 
00:15:58.030 --> 00:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
let's say that's true if that is true
 
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
then the next volcanic eruption where
 
00:16:02.829 --> 00:16:02.839 align:start position:0%
the the temperatures Dro two degrees
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
this climate increase might save us
 
00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
Greenland used to have people living
 
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
there 700 years ago anyway I thank you
 
00:16:11.069 --> 00:16:11.079 align:start position:0%
for your comment and your
 
00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
question any further
 
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:16.240 align:start position:0%
questions go ahead thank you Mr chair
 
00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:17.560 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question would you
 
00:16:19.629 --> 00:16:19.639 align:start position:0%
believe that uh during lockdowns when
 
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
nobody was driving very few people were
 
00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
driving a lot of the world economy was
 
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
kind of shut down people weren't working
 
00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
uh through that entire year we only uh
 
00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
reduced carbon emissions by
 
00:16:29.199 --> 00:16:30.910 align:start position:0%
reduced carbon emissions by
7%

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
7%
 
00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:33.160 align:start position:0%
globally I would believe that coming
 
00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:35.240 align:start position:0%
from repes repes Manion I'm sure that
 
00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.030 align:start position:0%
from repes repes Manion I'm sure that
that's

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
accurate any further questions okay I
 
00:16:42.749 --> 00:16:42.759 align:start position:0%
have a question for the chair do you
 
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
feel that this the EV move towards
 
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles is sustainable in this
 
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
country and what do you feel the outcome
 
00:16:52.350 --> 00:16:52.360 align:start position:0%
will be if we continue on this path
 
00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question about EVS
 
00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles uh I am not a
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
scientist uh although I I
 
00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
pay attention to this stuff I'm
 
00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
concerned in terms of EVS for a lot of
 
00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
reasons the the batteries is
 
00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:07.000 align:start position:0%
problematical in terms of some of the
 
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
pollution that happens in trying to get
 
00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:13.240 align:start position:0%
the you know the uh lithium Etc that's
 
00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:16.280 align:start position:0%
needed for batteries um when it's really
 
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
cold these uh the these electric
 
00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:22.280 align:start position:0%
vehicles have problems that's why the
 
00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
move for electric buses that we have in
 
00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:26.839 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire concerns me if if the
 
00:17:28.429 --> 00:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
buses don't start or if they're not
 
00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
Dependable or the range decreases in
 
00:17:32.789 --> 00:17:32.799 align:start position:0%
extreme cold that's a problem I have
 
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
with EVS I want to get get smarter about
 
00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:38.799 align:start position:0%
that uh in the military I I was in a
 
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
zoom conference about the military
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
needing to go green uh I mentioned
 
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
earlier about the push for organic jet
 
00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:48.280 align:start position:0%
fuel it which is much more
 
00:17:51.549 --> 00:17:51.559 align:start position:0%
expensive um and also using uh where you
 
00:17:54.909 --> 00:17:54.919 align:start position:0%
can electric vehicles tactically and
 
00:17:56.990 --> 00:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
there some sense to that they're quieter
 
00:17:58.870 --> 00:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
but if if you can't depend on them you
 
00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
can't charge them I mean in the military
 
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:03.640 align:start position:0%
you want to accomplish the mission and
 
00:18:06.270 --> 00:18:06.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know give the commanders what
 
00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:07.720 align:start position:0%
they need to accomplish the mission so
 
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
EVS uh I I think are problematical in
 
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
some ways and and I I don't know that
 
00:18:17.149 --> 00:18:17.159 align:start position:0%
the the the be all and the end
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
all thank you representative any further
 
00:18:21.029 --> 00:18:21.039 align:start position:0%
questions have one more representative
 
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
gagy thank you you you um just got my
 
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
mind going in regards to batteries uh
 
00:18:34.149 --> 00:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
the was it nickel I forget what what
 
00:18:36.149 --> 00:18:36.159 align:start position:0%
their name
 
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
yeah many people do not realize that in
 
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:40.390 align:start position:0%
yeah many people do not realize that in
the

00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
winter it's less effective because the
 
00:18:46.029 --> 00:18:46.039 align:start position:0%
batteries themselves keep the heat going
 
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
to keep their batteries warm so you have
 
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
less Road time is that correct Yes again
 
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
as I said I'm at a scientist but most of
 
00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
us understand how cold impacts batteries
 
00:18:59.390 --> 00:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
and and cold and batteries uh my iPod
 
00:19:01.669 --> 00:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
which which that didn't work this
 
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
morning because it was my car was cold
 
00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
so cold yes cold is cold and batteries
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:14.789 --> 00:19:14.799 align:start position:0%
together any further questions Carrie do
 
00:19:17.149 --> 00:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
you think books like the one you read
 
00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:19.880 align:start position:0%
and Rachel Carson's Silent Spring
 
00:19:22.549 --> 00:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
actually helped inspired a generation in
 
00:19:25.149 --> 00:19:25.159 align:start position:0%
the 70s to start cleaning up the dump
 
00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
they had dumped in the rivers and
 
00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:29.919 align:start position:0%
landfill and everywhere
 
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
else thank you representative I agree
 
00:19:34.669 --> 00:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
with you uh Silent Spring about the
 
00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
birds dying from um you
 
00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:41.960 align:start position:0%
know right uh that profoundly I agree
 
00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:43.919 align:start position:0%
that profoundly moved people to become
 
00:19:49.149 --> 00:19:49.159 align:start position:0%
activists uh Mo most of us uh want to
 
00:19:51.070 --> 00:19:51.080 align:start position:0%
fight pollution you know fighting
 
00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
pollution and fighting climate change
 
00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:55.480 align:start position:0%
really are two different things uh but I
 
00:19:57.710 --> 00:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
I agree that was an important book that
 
00:19:59.669 --> 00:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
made a difference and they made people
 
00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh aware and and caused people to want
 
00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:05.720 align:start position:0%
to take action against pollution uh
 
00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
there's another book called the
 
00:20:10.149 --> 00:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
population Bomb by Paul Erick in the uh
 
00:20:13.789 --> 00:20:13.799 align:start position:0%
around 1970 is that was really scary he
 
00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
said we're really doomed and he was
 
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
completely wrong but Rachel Carson
 
00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:26.669 --> 00:20:26.679 align:start position:0%
her any further questions seeing none
 
00:20:28.669 --> 00:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Moffett
 
00:20:32.669 --> 00:20:32.679 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair now i' like to call
 
00:20:32.679 --> 00:20:34.470 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair now i' like to call
up

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
Ma Cal Helen hello
 
00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah stated I'm bad pronunciation
 
00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:51.870 align:start position:0%
sorry yeah stated I'm bad pronunciation
thank

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:51.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
you there I go great um well thank you
 
00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
chairman Moffett and members of the
 
00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:58.710 align:start position:0%
chairman Moffett and members of the
committee

00:20:58.710 --> 00:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:21:00.669 --> 00:21:00.679 align:start position:0%
my name is Matthew K elain I'm a
 
00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
resident of conquer New Hampshire and I
 
00:21:03.789 --> 00:21:03.799 align:start position:0%
support the bill with a few comments on
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
how it might be improved um as a brief
 
00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:08.200 align:start position:0%
background I've worked in public health
 
00:21:10.029 --> 00:21:10.039 align:start position:0%
issues in New Hampshire for over three
 
00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:11.720 align:start position:0%
decades focusing on environmental
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
hazards um measuring Health impacts uh
 
00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:16.520 align:start position:0%
taking action to reduce risks um from
 
00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.559 align:start position:0%
2013 to 2022 I led a program in DHHS
 
00:21:22.669 --> 00:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
that specifically focused on weather
 
00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:25.039 align:start position:0%
climate and uh Health outcomes I
 
00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
published several peer-reviewed studies
 
00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:28.480 align:start position:0%
and continue to work on Research with my
 
00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
partners at Dartmouth and UNH and and
 
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
Antioch um I'm an instructor in Antioch
 
00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
and Environmental Studies department and
 
00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
currently a private consultant a bit
 
00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:39.039 align:start position:0%
about my background um the reason I
 
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
emphasize weather versus climate because
 
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
I think it's misunderstood quite a lot
 
00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
of the time and that's what I really try
 
00:21:46.029 --> 00:21:46.039 align:start position:0%
to emphasize my work understanding the
 
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
difference in working with it um I
 
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
believe the bill does contain some
 
00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
language that can be improved by
 
00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
removing references to fraudulent
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
research and intimidation even if those
 
00:21:58.750 --> 00:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
do occur in rare cases I believe this
 
00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
bill asked an important question what is
 
00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:03.320 align:start position:0%
truth um I would propose to you that
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
truth is a balanced mixture of two
 
00:22:07.549 --> 00:22:07.559 align:start position:0%
elements that is accurate information
 
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
and a trusted messenger um in this age
 
00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
of disinformation and and polarization
 
00:22:14.029 --> 00:22:14.039 align:start position:0%
it's a question we all have to ask
 
00:22:16.269 --> 00:22:16.279 align:start position:0%
ourselves about the truth over and over
 
00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
while challenging our own assumptions
 
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
and our biases that's what I tried to do
 
00:22:21.149 --> 00:22:21.159 align:start position:0%
when I was a public servant really
 
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
trying to understand what truth was and
 
00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:25.640 align:start position:0%
then say it in in a trusted way so
 
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
people could understand it um
 
00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
today I have both good news and bad news
 
00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
about the changing environment and the
 
00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:34.799 align:start position:0%
health the good news is that on a
 
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
national and a state level our citizens
 
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
have adapted well to the Extremes in
 
00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
heat and precipitation even as climate
 
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
warm Society has been able to reduce
 
00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
heat related deaths by over uh uh
 
00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:47.919 align:start position:0%
significantly over the past 50 years
 
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
cutting the death risk of death in half
 
00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
in our
 
00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:54.760 align:start position:0%
cities that's as the the the uh uh
 
00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
conditions in the planet continue to
 
00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
warm in addition we've been able ble to
 
00:22:59.909 --> 00:22:59.919 align:start position:0%
improve air quality and reduce related
 
00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
deaths by over $100,000 a year you heard
 
00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
that mention 100,000 people per year uh
 
00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:07.240 align:start position:0%
deaths these are improvements you rarely
 
00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
hear about in the media or from ad
 
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
advocacy groups I believe we need to
 
00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:14.799 align:start position:0%
teach our children and youth um I should
 
00:23:17.269 --> 00:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
say citizens and youth about the past
 
00:23:20.110 --> 00:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
successes if they're have hope and kindy
 
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
insights on how we're going to address
 
00:23:24.269 --> 00:23:24.279 align:start position:0%
and solve these larger issues of climate
 
00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
change um the bad news about um climate
 
00:23:29.149 --> 00:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
is rapidly warming it's causing
 
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
disruptions in our environment and our
 
00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
economy um it's unbalancing our
 
00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
ecosystems and it's threatening our
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
health we can and will adapt to changes
 
00:23:40.029 --> 00:23:40.039 align:start position:0%
in our own state yet mitigating the
 
00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
global causes will require significant
 
00:23:45.630 --> 00:23:45.640 align:start position:0%
diplomatic effort Investments free
 
00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:48.200 align:start position:0%
market Innovations and international
 
00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:50.440 align:start position:0%
cooperation um no matter how much this
 
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
nation reduces it fossil fuels or invest
 
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
in new technology we cannot spend or
 
00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
legislate our way out of this situation
 
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
as introduced HR 27 would direct the
 
00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:09.080 align:start position:0%
legislator to support all relevant data
 
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
and perspectives on climate policy yet
 
00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:13.919 align:start position:0%
how will you do this as individuals and
 
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
as committees each year there are up to
 
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
50,000 new studies related to weather
 
00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
climate and Earth Sciences of these at
 
00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
least a thousand make it into the main
 
00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:25.240 align:start position:0%
three media sources that gain public
 
00:24:27.909 --> 00:24:27.919 align:start position:0%
attention in order to assess which study
 
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
is relevant or unbiased you'll need to
 
00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:31.640 align:start position:0%
trust someone to interpret that
 
00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
information for you I would propose that
 
00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:36.440 align:start position:0%
this legislative body work together in a
 
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
bipartisan way to develop guidelines for
 
00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
this challenging task first there's a
 
00:24:43.029 --> 00:24:43.039 align:start position:0%
need to identify the best information
 
00:24:44.669 --> 00:24:44.679 align:start position:0%
from the least bi sources who will
 
00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:47.320 align:start position:0%
assess them here I encourage you to find
 
00:24:48.789 --> 00:24:48.799 align:start position:0%
engage with and support the New
 
00:24:51.070 --> 00:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State programs um state
 
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
agencies that and the people who are
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
dedicated both the climate science and
 
00:24:57.789 --> 00:24:57.799 align:start position:0%
to ongoing critique of that there there
 
00:24:59.950 --> 00:24:59.960 align:start position:0%
is some settled science yet many gaps
 
00:25:02.549 --> 00:25:02.559 align:start position:0%
and knowledges uh knowledge to explore
 
00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
second there's a need to develop
 
00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
competencies for teaching differences
 
00:25:09.149 --> 00:25:09.159 align:start position:0%
between weather climate n and their
 
00:25:11.669 --> 00:25:11.679 align:start position:0%
natural and human influences to set a
 
00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:13.720 align:start position:0%
via a set of critical thinking Concepts
 
00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
and skills our schools and yours your
 
00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
universities I believe would do
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
currently doing a fair job of teach
 
00:25:21.149 --> 00:25:21.159 align:start position:0%
teaching critical thinking and feeling
 
00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
skills in closing I believe this is a
 
00:25:25.549 --> 00:25:25.559 align:start position:0%
good starting point to provide both the
 
00:25:27.789 --> 00:25:27.799 align:start position:0%
legislative and executive branches with
 
00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:29.480 align:start position:0%
clear concise and evidence-based
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
information that will allow you to make
 
00:25:33.029 --> 00:25:33.039 align:start position:0%
the sound decisions about weather
 
00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:35.919 align:start position:0%
climate and health policy thank you for
 
00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:39.000 align:start position:0%
for allowing me the opportunity to speak
 
00:25:41.669 --> 00:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
today will you take any questions I'm
 
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions yes
 
00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:44.830 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions yes

gagy thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:25:49.549 --> 00:25:49.559 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
question isn't climate change term
 
00:25:56.549 --> 00:25:56.559 align:start position:0%
that's being used cyclical has it not
 
00:25:58.950 --> 00:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
happened in the past even before man was
 
00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:02.360 align:start position:0%
on this planet and where we might have
 
00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:07.480 align:start position:0%
had uh frozen tundra that it you'd have
 
00:26:10.430 --> 00:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
palm trees A Thousand Years
 
00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
Later the way I describe it to my
 
00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:14.360 align:start position:0%
students when I'm teaching is that yes
 
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
climate has had a lot of variability and
 
00:26:18.789 --> 00:26:18.799 align:start position:0%
is a and over time what we're seeing
 
00:26:21.149 --> 00:26:21.159 align:start position:0%
differently now is the rate of change it
 
00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
is increasing much more rapidly than it
 
00:26:25.149 --> 00:26:25.159 align:start position:0%
has in the past and because of our
 
00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
Advanced scientific understanding we can
 
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
that to certain both natural and human
 
00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:31.480 align:start position:0%
influences but we're very clear about
 
00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
influences any further
 
00:26:39.110 --> 00:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you sir
 
00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:52.480 align:start position:0%

the

committee I came here in support of U HR
 
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
27 and I was com felt compelled to come
 
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
here to speak because I really hate when
 
00:27:27.789 --> 00:27:27.799 align:start position:0%
science is used to lie cheat and
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
exaggerate and I come at this position
 
00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
from the perspective of a philosopher of
 
00:27:35.669 --> 00:27:35.679 align:start position:0%
Science and epistemology
 
00:27:39.029 --> 00:27:39.039 align:start position:0%
epistemology is the theory of knowledge
 
00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:40.440 align:start position:0%
in the theory of
 
00:27:43.389 --> 00:27:43.399 align:start position:0%
knowledge you go you try to figure out
 
00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:45.880 align:start position:0%
how do you know that you know now I'm
 
00:27:47.669 --> 00:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
not going to take this to the extreme
 
00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
position of like dayart I think
 
00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
therefore I am or Socrates all that I
 
00:27:56.549 --> 00:27:56.559 align:start position:0%
know is that I know nothing but uh
 
00:27:58.350 --> 00:27:58.360 align:start position:0%
there's a level of humil there that's
 
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
missing in many of our PhD scientists I
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
mean PhD is a doctor of philosophy and
 
00:28:07.389 --> 00:28:07.399 align:start position:0%
they're um not doing the philosophy
 
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
they're not doing the more rigorous
 
00:28:14.509 --> 00:28:14.519 align:start position:0%
certainty thinking here now inep in
 
00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
epistemology you learn that there's
 
00:28:19.389 --> 00:28:19.399 align:start position:0%
degrees of certainty and that there's an
 
00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:23.720 align:start position:0%
anatomy to knowledge now there two types
 
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
of knowledge
 
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
essentially what's called a prior
 
00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.310 align:start position:0%
essentially what's called a prior
knowledge

00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
which is reason derived from thought
 
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
logic and math 2 * 2 equals four that's
 
00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:37.590 align:start position:0%
logic and math 2 * 2 equals four that's
high

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
high
 
00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
certainty and then there's empirical
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
knowledge which is experimental and
 
00:28:44.509 --> 00:28:44.519 align:start position:0%
observational lower
 
00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
certainty experimental studies they have
 
00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:49.880 align:start position:0%
variables increased complexity certainty
 
00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
drops off exponentially at this point
 
00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
most scientific studies end up being
 
00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
wrong in the end and contradict each
 
00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.830 align:start position:0%
wrong in the end and contradict each
other

00:28:58.830 --> 00:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
science looks for uh predictive value
 
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
and certainty and that's where we come
 
00:29:06.509 --> 00:29:06.519 align:start position:0%
to the climate issue and my professor
 
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
used to say um if you can't make the
 
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
prediction you're wrong get back to the
 
00:29:16.389 --> 00:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
drawing board and there is a spectrum of
 
00:29:18.269 --> 00:29:18.279 align:start position:0%
certainty in
 
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
science there are there are
 
00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:24.760 align:start position:0%
um predictive
 
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
sciences and it goes towards descriptive
 
00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:30.640 align:start position:0%
Sciences which don't predict anything it
 
00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:33.640 align:start position:0%
tells you what is and they make
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
extrapolations and well good luck with
 
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
anything after that and an example of u
 
00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
a predictive science would be um in
 
00:29:47.509 --> 00:29:47.519 align:start position:0%
physics and chemistry using mostly a
 
00:29:52.269 --> 00:29:52.279 align:start position:0%
prior knowledge of logic and math mixing
 
00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:55.960 align:start position:0%
element a with element B explosion
 
00:29:58.149 --> 00:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
happens simple
 
00:30:00.269 --> 00:30:00.279 align:start position:0%
now as the variables
 
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
increase your certainty drops off and
 
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
then throughout different Sciences your
 
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
variables are increasing exponentially
 
00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:12.440 align:start position:0%
biology psychology sociology economics
 
00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.230 align:start position:0%
biology psychology sociology economics
climatology

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
climatology
 
00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:16.360 align:start position:0%
Evolution now in
 
00:30:18.149 --> 00:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
evolution they're not going to tell you
 
00:30:19.789 --> 00:30:19.799 align:start position:0%
anything about where we're going they'll
 
00:30:21.269 --> 00:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
tell you where we've been but not where
 
00:30:21.279 --> 00:30:22.070 align:start position:0%
tell you where we've been but not where
we're

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
going economics
 
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
again um if eon economists were any good
 
00:30:31.269 --> 00:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
at predicting they'd all be
 
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
multi-millionaires and the same goes for
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh climate
 
00:30:39.149 --> 00:30:39.159 align:start position:0%
science it's the best that they could do
 
00:30:39.159 --> 00:30:40.389 align:start position:0%
science it's the best that they could do
is

00:30:40.389 --> 00:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:30:42.789 --> 00:30:42.799 align:start position:0%
extrapolate and they have ex
 
00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
extrapolated global
 
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
warming and they've turned it into a
 
00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:50.120 align:start position:0%
revenue stream through fear-mongering
 
00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
and fearmongering cells gets funding
 
00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
creates some funding bias everything is
 
00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
connected to it and it corrupts the
 
00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:02.200 align:start position:0%
science which brings us to the bill um
 
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
consider all relevant information much
 
00:31:06.629 --> 00:31:06.639 align:start position:0%
information is
 
00:31:09.509 --> 00:31:09.519 align:start position:0%
ignored and not properly
 
00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
reviewed it doesn't fit the
 
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
narrative I have an
 
00:31:17.549 --> 00:31:17.559 align:start position:0%
example the uh there's a the nicolov
 
00:31:20.509 --> 00:31:20.519 align:start position:0%
Zeller study it's a they came up with a
 
00:31:23.509 --> 00:31:23.519 align:start position:0%
mathematical model that predicts
 
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
accurately predicts Global mean surface
 
00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:29.720 align:start position:0%
temperatures of rocky planets and moons
 
00:31:32.269 --> 00:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
in the solar system including the Earth
 
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
in a nutshell what they came up with is
 
00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.629 align:start position:0%
in a nutshell what they came up with is
atmospheric

00:31:36.629 --> 00:31:36.639 align:start position:0%
atmospheric
 
00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
pressure and Atmospheric density are the
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
climate drivers you have Venus which is
 
00:31:44.789 --> 00:31:44.799 align:start position:0%
very thin
 
00:31:48.789 --> 00:31:48.799 align:start position:0%
atmosphere and very cold Venus which was
 
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
always the analog for the greenhouse
 
00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:54.120 align:start position:0%
story is 90 times greater pressure than
 
00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:55.070 align:start position:0%
story is 90 times greater pressure than
the

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
earth and is extremely
 
00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
hot so so the analogy would be a thick
 
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
blanket versus a thin
 
00:32:07.789 --> 00:32:07.799 align:start position:0%
blanket and this incidentally This
 
00:32:10.590 --> 00:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
research is also Beed out by uh
 
00:32:14.269 --> 00:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
NASA they have What's called the Havoc
 
00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:18.440 align:start position:0%
program uh it's the High Altitude Venus
 
00:32:21.909 --> 00:32:21.919 align:start position:0%
o uh operational concept they have a
 
00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
plan to send people to
 
00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:27.720 align:start position:0%
Venus but obviously they wouldn't be
 
00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
able to be on the surface with the
 
00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:32.120 align:start position:0%
surface pressure and heat being so
 
00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:43.149 --> 00:32:43.159 align:start position:0%
floating vessel about 50 km up in the
 
00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:47.720 align:start position:0%
atmosphere where the density is similar
 
00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
to Earth and so is the temperature
 
00:32:55.230 --> 00:32:55.240 align:start position:0%
despite the 96% carbon dioxide versus
 
00:32:58.350 --> 00:32:58.360 align:start position:0%
a minuscule percent
 
00:33:01.750 --> 00:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
on Earth again pointing to
 
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
the density being the
 
00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:06.950 align:start position:0%
the density being the
key

00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
key
 
00:33:09.669 --> 00:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
so finally I do want to point out
 
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
another thing if we
 
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
ever come up with a carbon tax and
 
00:33:16.629 --> 00:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
codify it into our Revenue stream we
 
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
could just forget about getting
 
00:33:22.269 --> 00:33:22.279 align:start position:0%
anything about the truth in this matter
 
00:33:23.909 --> 00:33:23.919 align:start position:0%
I'll answer any
 
00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
questions we have any
 
00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.509 align:start position:0%
questions we have any
questions

00:33:28.509 --> 00:33:28.519 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you representative
 
00:33:33.149 --> 00:33:33.159 align:start position:0%
taking the time to come here today and I
 
00:33:36.789 --> 00:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
will now close the hearing on HR 27 and
 
00:33:52.909 --> 00:33:52.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:55.629 --> 00:33:55.639 align:start position:0%
pona thank you representative when you
 
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
say rightful owner my name is is on this
 
00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
gal now I don't you mention it uh thank
 
00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
you for willing it for us here and
 
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
moving on to the next scheduled uh
 
00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
measure hr26 urging Congress to adopt a
 
00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment to distinguish
 
00:34:17.149 --> 00:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
between corporate and individual rights
 
00:34:19.829 --> 00:34:19.839 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:23.560 align:start position:0%
hr26 uh representative n is is the uh
 
00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
Prime the prime sponsor she is in the
 
00:34:29.109 --> 00:34:29.119 align:start position:0%
house and we're very pleased to welcome
 
00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:32.760 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor to uh introduce hr26
 
00:34:35.149 --> 00:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
welcome representative thank you thank
 
00:34:37.069 --> 00:34:37.079 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you to the
 
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for uh taking
 
00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:40.919 align:start position:0%
you uh your time and consideration this
 
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
morning so what we have is um a call on
 
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
Congress to propose an amendment that
 
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
clarifies that corporations are not
 
00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
endowed with the same um constitutional
 
00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
rights as individual um living breathing
 
00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
human beings seems pretty obvious to me
 
00:34:59.190 --> 00:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
but we have uh precedent based on
 
00:35:01.069 --> 00:35:01.079 align:start position:0%
precedent built on precedent where the
 
00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court has ruled essentially that
 
00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
they are entitled to the same rights one
 
00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:07.240 align:start position:0%
thing I thought was really interesting
 
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to uh show you today
 
00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:15.640 align:start position:0%
um and now I can't find it okay um was
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
that there was a market change so there
 
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
were rules uh there were rulings in the
 
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
first place the Supreme Court made
 
00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:23.320 align:start position:0%
rulings that did clarify and they did
 
00:35:26.069 --> 00:35:26.079 align:start position:0%
say in their summary that uh that uh
 
00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
corporations were not end endowed with
 
00:35:29.910 --> 00:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
the same rights but along the way we
 
00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:31.400 align:start position:0%
have changed this essentially coming
 
00:35:33.349 --> 00:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
from uh way back to the railroads I
 
00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
believe that was in the 1850s um there
 
00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
was precedent that uh put them on the
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
same footing as whatever so what I'd
 
00:35:41.589 --> 00:35:41.599 align:start position:0%
really like to clarify is the logic of
 
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
this if we're really looking at what the
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
logic um ends up being at the end of the
 
00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
day with our rights come
 
00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:51.160 align:start position:0%
responsibilities so we are endowed with
 
00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
these rights but they also come with
 
00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:53.960 align:start position:0%
responsibilities because if we live in a
 
00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
society then we all need to we all also
 
00:35:57.630 --> 00:35:57.640 align:start position:0%
have the respons responsibility not to
 
00:35:59.630 --> 00:35:59.640 align:start position:0%
infringe on other people's rights that's
 
00:36:01.069 --> 00:36:01.079 align:start position:0%
what comes along with having these
 
00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:02.920 align:start position:0%
rights and these rights being insured
 
00:36:05.309 --> 00:36:05.319 align:start position:0%
and as a society how we ensure that
 
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
these rights are maintained and that
 
00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:09.680 align:start position:0%
everyone's rights are are protected is
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh we have accountability for that so if
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
you infringe on someone else's rights
 
00:36:14.589 --> 00:36:14.599 align:start position:0%
then you have accountability that comes
 
00:36:17.270 --> 00:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
along with it um and so what I really
 
00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:18.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to do was kind of personalize
 
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
this in a way and and really just kind
 
00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
of deconstruct this argument because um
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
I know personally and I think a lot of
 
00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:27.160 align:start position:0%
us are are well aware of the situ ation
 
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
with for example um Purdue Pharma Purdue
 
00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:32.440 align:start position:0%
Pharma infringed on people's rights by
 
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
lying outright malicious actions this is
 
00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
something that they did that infringed
 
00:36:40.109 --> 00:36:40.119 align:start position:0%
on our rights as human beings yet at the
 
00:36:41.750 --> 00:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
end of the day I mean it sounds really
 
00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
silly right to say is uh is this
 
00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
Corporation in jail has their Liberty
 
00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
been taken away have they had the same
 
00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:51.200 align:start position:0%
accountability that an individual would
 
00:36:52.829 --> 00:36:52.839 align:start position:0%
have if they transgressed on someone
 
00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
else's rights of course not you can't
 
00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
put a corporation in jail it's a limited
 
00:37:00.069 --> 00:37:00.079 align:start position:0%
liability Corporation for a reason and
 
00:37:02.069 --> 00:37:02.079 align:start position:0%
that makes sense in certain context but
 
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
as far as having the rights that we are
 
00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:07.720 align:start position:0%
entitled to uh within our constitution
 
00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
as laid out in our constitution it
 
00:37:12.349 --> 00:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
logically does not make sense for them
 
00:37:14.109 --> 00:37:14.119 align:start position:0%
to have the same rights if they do not
 
00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
have the same responsibilities and the
 
00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
same accountability I.E taking away
 
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
their individual freedom and individual
 
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
liberty so that's my argument um the
 
00:37:24.589 --> 00:37:24.599 align:start position:0%
reason why it needs to be a
 
00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment is because we
 
00:37:29.109 --> 00:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
do have this precedent on Supreme Court
 
00:37:30.829 --> 00:37:30.839 align:start position:0%
rulings where somewhere along the line
 
00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:33.160 align:start position:0%
there was a rational rationalization
 
00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
that made the comparison and said they
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
they are uh equal to people and then
 
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
there was another ruling and then there
 
00:37:40.829 --> 00:37:40.839 align:start position:0%
was another ruling and and precedent
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
upon precedent upon precedent has put us
 
00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
in this place we have Constitutional
 
00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:47.800 align:start position:0%
Amendments for a reason to either say
 
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
yeah maybe we were wrong on that let's
 
00:37:51.710 --> 00:37:51.720 align:start position:0%
correct this maybe we needed to include
 
00:37:54.589 --> 00:37:54.599 align:start position:0%
more people expand these protections um
 
00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
and also to clarify things so what this
 
00:37:59.589 --> 00:37:59.599 align:start position:0%
is is essentially clarifying that
 
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
corporations are not entitled to the
 
00:38:03.710 --> 00:38:03.720 align:start position:0%
same rights as an
 
00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:06.200 align:start position:0%
individual uh would be in the society
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
and therefore it is okay for us to uh to
 
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
uh to curb their privileges in certain
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
ways I.E spending in political
 
00:38:19.670 --> 00:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
campaigns I think that's that's
 
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
basically it um I'm happy to answer any
 
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative uh
 
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
the notion that money is speech um it's
 
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
been out there a lot and in the wording
 
00:38:34.589 --> 00:38:34.599 align:start position:0%
in your resolution specifically says
 
00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
money is not speech uh I'm trying to
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
remember maybe some of the other members
 
00:38:41.670 --> 00:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
of the committee can member uh money
 
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
being speech is you mentioned the
 
00:38:46.589 --> 00:38:46.599 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court precedence the where did
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
that come from the notion that money is
 
00:38:51.069 --> 00:38:51.079 align:start position:0%
speech that's out there right yeah
 
00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:53.000 align:start position:0%
actually I do have an expert here uh Sam
 
00:38:55.589 --> 00:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
Feldman and he can speak much better to
 
00:38:57.790 --> 00:38:57.800 align:start position:0%
um the the process of how the precedent
 
00:38:59.630 --> 00:38:59.640 align:start position:0%
has been laid out essentially it started
 
00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:01.960 align:start position:0%
with corporate personhood and then based
 
00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:03.800 align:start position:0%
on corporate personhood that you say
 
00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:05.200 align:start position:0%
okay well then what rights are they
 
00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
entitled to if they're equal to a person
 
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
um Sam can lay it out much better I I
 
00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
questions citizens united is what I'm
 
00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I don't want to speak out of
 
00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
turn uh go go ahead representative
 
00:39:25.069 --> 00:39:25.079 align:start position:0%
citizens united is the latest one uh
 
00:39:26.309 --> 00:39:26.319 align:start position:0%
people kind of say it opens the flood
 
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
gate but it's not the first it really
 
00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:30.680 align:start position:0%
goes back to Citizens United is based on
 
00:39:32.349 --> 00:39:32.359 align:start position:0%
other precedent that has been in Supreme
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
Court ruling so it's really kind of this
 
00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:37.720 align:start position:0%
this morphing overtime um I believe the
 
00:39:39.829 --> 00:39:39.839 align:start position:0%
the first one was the railroads back in
 
00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:43.640 align:start position:0%
1850 something out in California um and
 
00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
that was the the argument then that was
 
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
the initial personhood argument and then
 
00:39:49.109 --> 00:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
it's just kind of built on based on
 
00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
here's this rationalization that we
 
00:39:53.069 --> 00:39:53.079 align:start position:0%
provided in this which is a a Supreme
 
00:39:54.589 --> 00:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
Court ruling which is precedent so then
 
00:39:56.589 --> 00:39:56.599 align:start position:0%
it's considered in the next one so it
 
00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
kind of uh it builds on itself and it's
 
00:40:00.069 --> 00:40:00.079 align:start position:0%
gotten to the point where it kind of
 
00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:03.640 align:start position:0%
morphs into uh what we have
 
00:40:06.990 --> 00:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
today other questions representative
 
00:40:09.270 --> 00:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
shli thank you thank you for being with
 
00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:11.240 align:start position:0%
us today I was just wondering if you've
 
00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:13.400 align:start position:0%
spoken to any of the four members of
 
00:40:15.069 --> 00:40:15.079 align:start position:0%
Congress from New Hampshire about filing
 
00:40:17.309 --> 00:40:17.319 align:start position:0%
a constitutional amendment and if so
 
00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
what was their response actually we just
 
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
recently had something very similar um
 
00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
HR I mean Haj resolution 54 this is a
 
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
joint resolution we do have our members
 
00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
of Congress are are on board to a to a
 
00:40:32.069 --> 00:40:32.079 align:start position:0%
degree it's not exactly the same
 
00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
language um but they are trying to to
 
00:40:36.349 --> 00:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
kind of get to the same effect uh this
 
00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:38.079 align:start position:0%
is making the point this is encouraging
 
00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
them I understand this is non-binding
 
00:40:42.390 --> 00:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
this is uh really a statement of this is
 
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
what we'd really like you to do and they
 
00:40:46.670 --> 00:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
are already doing it I feel like this is
 
00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
um this is clarifying exactly what we
 
00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
would like to be in that that Amendment
 
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
and what we'd like to address with it
 
00:40:55.309 --> 00:40:55.319 align:start position:0%
you know what what our intent
 
00:40:55.319 --> 00:40:57.589 align:start position:0%
you know what what our intent
is

00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:40:57.599 --> 00:41:00.309 align:start position:0%
is
other

00:41:00.309 --> 00:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:02.670 --> 00:41:02.680 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none uh thank you
 
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
representative representative n uh Sam
 
00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:07.720 align:start position:0%
fieldman is here he's been here before
 
00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
welcome back Sam uh he's asked for three
 
00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
minutes to amplify a little bit on uh
 
00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
representative n's measure uh
 
00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
Sam thank you Mr chair thank you members
 
00:41:26.309 --> 00:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Sam fieldman
 
00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
with Wolfpack um when Wolfpack first
 
00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
formed part of why it Formed um there
 
00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
was already an existing group moved to
 
00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:36.280 align:start position:0%
amend that was working on resolutions
 
00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
very much like this one and moved to
 
00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:40.079 align:start position:0%
amend at the time opposed the Article 5
 
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
convention route Wolfpack was formed
 
00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:44.440 align:start position:0%
partially in response to that to make
 
00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
sure that there was a group pushing for
 
00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
the Article 5 convention route like hjr
 
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
9 that this committee passed uh just
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
recently um both groups have since
 
00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:55.160 align:start position:0%
changed their position to some degree
 
00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:56.920 align:start position:0%
moved to amend has since embrace the
 
00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
idea of resolutions like hj9 that passed
 
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
recently and Wolfpack has also seen the
 
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
additional separate value in in passing
 
00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:07.480 align:start position:0%
resolutions like this one here they
 
00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
should not be considered in competition
 
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
with each other they should both pass um
 
00:42:15.870 --> 00:42:15.880 align:start position:0%
and the best example of why we saw in
 
00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:18.560 align:start position:0%
the 17th Amendment uh it's not certainly
 
00:42:20.069 --> 00:42:20.079 align:start position:0%
not the only example the Bill of Rights
 
00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:23.000 align:start position:0%
is an example the um uh repeal of
 
00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
prohibition is an example but um in uh
 
00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
the 17th Amendment uh there was a strong
 
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
push for an article 5 convention effort
 
00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:33.720 align:start position:0%
to uh to get direct election of senators
 
00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:35.800 align:start position:0%
and that worked side by side with a
 
00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:37.960 align:start position:0%
number of other political efforts to
 
00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:39.880 align:start position:0%
change public opinion to send messages
 
00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:42.200 align:start position:0%
to Congress to actually propose direct
 
00:42:44.549 --> 00:42:44.559 align:start position:0%
election themselves and that's why once
 
00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
we got to the point where we were very
 
00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:47.800 align:start position:0%
close to the number of states that we
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
needed to call a convention within one
 
00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
or two um the O un other underlying
 
00:42:55.790 --> 00:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
political work uh to push Congress had
 
00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
gotten to to the point where they were
 
00:42:58.870 --> 00:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
able to use that leverage to get over
 
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
the hump and that's how these two ideas
 
00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
work hand inand together um I do also
 
00:43:07.390 --> 00:43:07.400 align:start position:0%
want to say a word about the uh the
 
00:43:08.829 --> 00:43:08.839 align:start position:0%
language here corporations are not
 
00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
people and money is not speech Wolfpack
 
00:43:12.589 --> 00:43:12.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't usually use those terms but
 
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
other groups do and we do not uh have
 
00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
any problem with groups using those
 
00:43:20.109 --> 00:43:20.119 align:start position:0%
terms uh I myself have have used them um
 
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
individually many times um the the first
 
00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
case the cases that deal with corporate
 
00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
personhood uh date back to the to the
 
00:43:31.349 --> 00:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
1800s um and for a very long time you
 
00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
can see cases where rights were granted
 
00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:35.109 align:start position:0%
can see cases where rights were granted
to

00:43:35.109 --> 00:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:37.480 align:start position:0%
corporations that made sense for
 
00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:41.000 align:start position:0%
corporations to have as standin for
 
00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
individual human rights uh rights of
 
00:43:45.549 --> 00:43:45.559 align:start position:0%
actual people are guaranteed by the
 
00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:47.640 align:start position:0%
Constitution there are some rights like
 
00:43:49.349 --> 00:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
the right to contract the right to sue
 
00:43:52.549 --> 00:43:52.559 align:start position:0%
and be sued things like that where um
 
00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:54.680 align:start position:0%
you need to have in order for humans to
 
00:43:57.150 --> 00:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
exercise those rights the corporations
 
00:43:59.190 --> 00:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
that they own must also exercise those
 
00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:01.000 align:start position:0%
rights but it should never be confused
 
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
with the idea of the corporation itself
 
00:44:04.829 --> 00:44:04.839 align:start position:0%
having rights corporations are not
 
00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:06.680 align:start position:0%
people corporations are liability
 
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
Shields if you treat a corporation as
 
00:44:11.829 --> 00:44:11.839 align:start position:0%
identical to yourself you literally lose
 
00:44:14.069 --> 00:44:14.079 align:start position:0%
the corporation it dissolves you lose
 
00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:17.480 align:start position:0%
the liability Shield it it simply is not
 
00:44:19.950 --> 00:44:19.960 align:start position:0%
um identical with the human who owns it
 
00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:21.839 align:start position:0%
it's not it's by law not allowed to be
 
00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
treated as such um and then when we saw
 
00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
in the case of Bot
 
00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh the First National Bank of
 
00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:31.240 align:start position:0%
Boston uh there was a great dissent
 
00:44:34.069 --> 00:44:34.079 align:start position:0%
there written by Justice ranquist who
 
00:44:35.349 --> 00:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
listed all of the times that
 
00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
corporations had been granted uh
 
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
personhood rights in the US Constitution
 
00:44:40.829 --> 00:44:40.839 align:start position:0%
this is in
 
00:44:44.510 --> 00:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
1978 um and he noted in in that case uh
 
00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
well first of all it was clear in that
 
00:44:47.230 --> 00:44:47.240 align:start position:0%
case that all of those could be
 
00:44:50.309 --> 00:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
justified As Natural extensions of the
 
00:44:52.510 --> 00:44:52.520 align:start position:0%
rights of actual humans not rights given
 
00:44:54.349 --> 00:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
directly to the corporation having the
 
00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:55.480 align:start position:0%
corporation have their own Rights was
 
00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
not necess necessary for any of those
 
00:44:59.950 --> 00:44:59.960 align:start position:0%
and then he noted that the extension of
 
00:45:01.390 --> 00:45:01.400 align:start position:0%
that which was what was what happened in
 
00:45:04.270 --> 00:45:04.280 align:start position:0%
that case to political rights as a
 
00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
separate entity for the corporation was
 
00:45:08.309 --> 00:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
highly dangerous and completely
 
00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:11.240 align:start position:0%
unprecedented uh with respect to um
 
00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
anything that had come before that uh
 
00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:15.800 align:start position:0%
and we've seen that play out and magnify
 
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
with cases like citizens united that
 
00:45:19.630 --> 00:45:19.640 align:start position:0%
came around later also in answer to to
 
00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
your question the the case that uh
 
00:45:25.470 --> 00:45:25.480 align:start position:0%
initially claimed that um that money is
 
00:45:28.549 --> 00:45:28.559 align:start position:0%
speed as opposed to a tool for speech uh
 
00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
was two years before that it was um
 
00:45:35.349 --> 00:45:35.359 align:start position:0%
I Buckle V valo in
 
00:45:39.549 --> 00:45:39.559 align:start position:0%
1976 um and up until that point the idea
 
00:45:41.670 --> 00:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
was that money is a tool for speech just
 
00:45:44.309 --> 00:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
like a bullhorn as a tool for speech
 
00:45:45.870 --> 00:45:45.880 align:start position:0%
you're not and there's limits on how you
 
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
can use it you can't take a bullhorn to
 
00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
a polling place and tell people how to
 
00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:53.720 align:start position:0%
vote just like in uh in some states
 
00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:56.200 align:start position:0%
people literally buy up all of the
 
00:45:59.390 --> 00:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
advertising airtime and drown out all
 
00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
other messages that is incompatible with
 
00:46:04.349 --> 00:46:04.359 align:start position:0%
the Free Speech rights of actual humans
 
00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:07.960 align:start position:0%
to use that tool in excess um the
 
00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
limitations that we always have on on
 
00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
speech are uh that you can have uh
 
00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
limited reasonable content neutral
 
00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:19.480 align:start position:0%
restrictions on time place and manner uh
 
00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
if the Restriction is unreasonable that
 
00:46:23.069 --> 00:46:23.079 align:start position:0%
would be unconstitutional if it's
 
00:46:26.829 --> 00:46:26.839 align:start position:0%
content based that's also uncons ution
 
00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
uh it can only be a limit on how much
 
00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:30.640 align:start position:0%
money you can spend under certain
 
00:46:32.589 --> 00:46:32.599 align:start position:0%
circumstances to make sure that people
 
00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
are still able to exercise their speech
 
00:46:37.270 --> 00:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
but not in such a way that it drowns out
 
00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
other speech uh and that's that's always
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
been the Constitutional test up until
 
00:46:43.950 --> 00:46:43.960 align:start position:0%
Buckle V valo and up until Botti and
 
00:46:45.069 --> 00:46:45.079 align:start position:0%
that's what the Constitutional test
 
00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
should still be thank
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
you thank you m fieldman questions
 
00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:50.950 align:start position:0%

00:47:07.589 --> 00:47:07.599 align:start position:0%
six so that at this
 
00:47:21.790 --> 00:47:21.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%

hr23
 
00:47:31.390 --> 00:47:31.400 align:start position:0%
hr23 is a resolution calling for the New
 
00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Congressional Delegation to
 
00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:35.240 align:start position:0%

resolution but I would ask that uh if if
 
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
some points have been made that uh that
 
00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:43.960 align:start position:0%
you don't feel a need to repeat or
 
00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
reiterate uh information that we've
 
00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
already heard uh always looking for new
 
00:48:51.150 --> 00:48:51.160 align:start position:0%
uh new
 
00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:53.839 align:start position:0%
information uh represent mon

welcome well thank you Mr chairperson
 
00:48:59.190 --> 00:48:59.200 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee for letting
 
00:49:02.109 --> 00:49:02.119 align:start position:0%
me speak today um and I will try to keep
 
00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
it brief it's hard it's a long
 
00:49:08.430 --> 00:49:08.440 align:start position:0%
resolution um but just a little bit of
 
00:49:12.750 --> 00:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
my own background I worked for um 15 to
 
00:49:15.349 --> 00:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
20 years in in various forms of Public
 
00:49:19.789 --> 00:49:19.799 align:start position:0%
Health Nutrition and my last um job in
 
00:49:22.069 --> 00:49:22.079 align:start position:0%
that field I was a wick director for two
 
00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
counties in North Carolina and our
 
00:49:27.870 --> 00:49:27.880 align:start position:0%
clinics were all located in in either
 
00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:31.480 align:start position:0%
County Public Health offices or
 
00:49:34.549 --> 00:49:34.559 align:start position:0%
Community um health organizations
 
00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:37.720 align:start position:0%
nonprofits whose mission it was was to
 
00:49:41.309 --> 00:49:41.319 align:start position:0%
serve uh uninsured and underinsured
 
00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:44.440 align:start position:0%
people in the community and as
 
00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:47.240 align:start position:0%
organizations they were just barely able
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
to scrape enough money up through some
 
00:49:53.069 --> 00:49:53.079 align:start position:0%
Medicaid self-pay and some grants to
 
00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
operate and we couldn't even afford to
 
00:49:58.549 --> 00:49:58.559 align:start position:0%
provide health insurance for our own
 
00:50:02.109 --> 00:50:02.119 align:start position:0%
employees um so we were on our own and
 
00:50:05.789 --> 00:50:05.799 align:start position:0%
in my other career I work in um
 
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
residential home construction so I know
 
00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
what it's like to have to buy health
 
00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:12.520 align:start position:0%
insurance on your own not through your
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
employer so about this resolution let me
 
00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
be clear that this is not socialized
 
00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:20.200 align:start position:0%
medicine uh we're talking about a
 
00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
single-payer managed system that is n
 
00:50:27.069 --> 00:50:27.079 align:start position:0%
National and publicly um
 
00:50:30.270 --> 00:50:30.280 align:start position:0%
managed we already have Single Payer
 
00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:33.720 align:start position:0%
Health um in systems in this country
 
00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:34.630 align:start position:0%
Health um in systems in this country
like

00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:34.640 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
Medicare or Tri care they are single
 
00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:40.640 align:start position:0%
pair they're just not Universal and
 
00:50:42.349 --> 00:50:42.359 align:start position:0%
that's what we're looking
 
00:50:47.549 --> 00:50:47.559 align:start position:0%
for um and it's our current system is
 
00:50:50.390 --> 00:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
tremendously expensive and
 
00:50:54.829 --> 00:50:54.839 align:start position:0%
inefficient and by freeing ourselves
 
00:50:56.589 --> 00:50:56.599 align:start position:0%
from this very very complicated system
 
00:50:59.670 --> 00:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
of private insurance it really would be
 
00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
a boon
 
00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
for doctors to be able to open their own
 
00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:07.160 align:start position:0%
practice again like we haven't seen in
 
00:51:10.109 --> 00:51:10.119 align:start position:0%
decades and this would be very helpful
 
00:51:12.109 --> 00:51:12.119 align:start position:0%
to rural areas because one of the
 
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
biggest problems is that a medical
 
00:51:17.230 --> 00:51:17.240 align:start position:0%
practice has to have a team of Staff
 
00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:20.720 align:start position:0%
people whose sole job is to try to
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
negotiate with insurance companies all
 
00:51:22.559 --> 00:51:24.349 align:start position:0%
negotiate with insurance companies all
day

00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:51:24.359 --> 00:51:26.270 align:start position:0%
day
long

00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
long
 
00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
so we we also don't have you know moving
 
00:51:31.910 --> 00:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
on to the second point of my resolution
 
00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
we don't have Universal coverage there's
 
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
still a lot of people that lack health
 
00:51:37.789 --> 00:51:37.799 align:start position:0%
insurance in this country about 25
 
00:51:40.589 --> 00:51:40.599 align:start position:0%
million and even those that have
 
00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:44.240 align:start position:0%
insurance have high barriers such as
 
00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
deductibles and restrictive networks of
 
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
what what doctors they can go
 
00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:52.040 align:start position:0%
to we have the most expensive healthc
 
00:51:54.670 --> 00:51:54.680 align:start position:0%
care in the world and really the worst
 
00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
outcomes of of any developed
 
00:52:01.230 --> 00:52:01.240 align:start position:0%
country and we have major gaps in our
 
00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:02.870 align:start position:0%
country and we have major gaps in our
insurance

00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
system that's particularly for dental
 
00:52:08.789 --> 00:52:08.799 align:start position:0%
care and for long-term care and for me
 
00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
that's one of the the most criminal
 
00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
aspects of our system is that if you're
 
00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
not lucky enough to die in your sleep
 
00:52:20.430 --> 00:52:20.440 align:start position:0%
peacefully in your late 80s and you end
 
00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
up needing long-term care for any length
 
00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
of time if you're not a rich person very
 
00:52:28.829 --> 00:52:28.839 align:start position:0%
much you will deplete all of your assets
 
00:52:31.309 --> 00:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
leaving nothing for your children and go
 
00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
on Medicaid at the end of your life this
 
00:52:37.630 --> 00:52:37.640 align:start position:0%
is what happens to Working Families
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
middle class families all over New
 
00:52:43.390 --> 00:52:43.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the country and the reason
 
00:52:45.589 --> 00:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
for that is we don't have National
 
00:52:45.599 --> 00:52:49.670 align:start position:0%
for that is we don't have National
long-term

00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:53.030 --> 00:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
care and another big problem with our
 
00:52:56.910 --> 00:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
private insurance system is
 
00:52:59.510 --> 00:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
that there it's really an impediment for
 
00:53:03.870 --> 00:53:03.880 align:start position:0%
people seeking preventive care with high
 
00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:06.440 align:start position:0%
deductibles and so people delay getting
 
00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
care for chronic mental conditions and
 
00:53:10.829 --> 00:53:10.839 align:start position:0%
end up going to the ER instead of a
 
00:53:12.750 --> 00:53:12.760 align:start position:0%
primary care
 
00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
doctor and we all know this is a huge um
 
00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:19.400 align:start position:0%
cost to hospitals and for our system
 
00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:22.990 align:start position:0%
cost to hospitals and for our system
functioning

00:53:22.990 --> 00:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:26.349 --> 00:53:26.359 align:start position:0%
efficiently and I we have several
 
00:53:28.349 --> 00:53:28.359 align:start position:0%
doctors that can speak more to the
 
00:53:30.910 --> 00:53:30.920 align:start position:0%
effects on their own
 
00:53:34.309 --> 00:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
practices but another big area is um
 
00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
what high medical costs do to Americans
 
00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.510 align:start position:0%
what high medical costs do to Americans
um

00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:43.349 --> 00:53:43.359 align:start position:0%
financially 20% of Americans report that
 
00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to pay their medical
 
00:53:50.309 --> 00:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
bills and 66% of all bankruptcies in the
 
00:53:52.990 --> 00:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
United States are due to medical
 
00:53:58.950 --> 00:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
another big reason that I am in favor of
 
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
a national universal health insurance
 
00:54:08.829 --> 00:54:08.839 align:start position:0%
program is having Insurance that's
 
00:54:11.710 --> 00:54:11.720 align:start position:0%
independent of your job will allow
 
00:54:14.069 --> 00:54:14.079 align:start position:0%
people to pursue happiness in the job
 
00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:17.240 align:start position:0%
that they love not just the job with
 
00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:18.549 align:start position:0%
that they love not just the job with
health

00:54:18.549 --> 00:54:18.559 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:54:21.670 --> 00:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
benefits personal freedom is one of the
 
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
biggest reasons I'm in favor of a
 
00:54:27.309 --> 00:54:27.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:29.870 --> 00:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
system um just think what it would mean
 
00:54:31.710 --> 00:54:31.720 align:start position:0%
for people that want to start their own
 
00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:33.880 align:start position:0%
business and already have to come up
 
00:54:36.309 --> 00:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
with a lot of money but then to have to
 
00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:39.400 align:start position:0%
pay for health insurance for all their
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
employees it's a daunting thing it would
 
00:54:44.549 --> 00:54:44.559 align:start position:0%
be a great freedom for small businesses
 
00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
and entrepreneurs and let alone the big
 
00:54:50.109 --> 00:54:50.119 align:start position:0%
manufacturing companies that have to
 
00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:53.000 align:start position:0%
compete with businesses from other
 
00:54:55.510 --> 00:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
countries where those businesses don't
 
00:54:56.990 --> 00:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
have to pay for insurance for their
 
00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:00.280 align:start position:0%
employees it's already paid for so
 
00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
that's a huge economic disadvantage for
 
00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:11.470 --> 00:55:11.480 align:start position:0%
internationally and another big group
 
00:55:14.789 --> 00:55:14.799 align:start position:0%
are um having an insurance program for
 
00:55:17.349 --> 00:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
everyone it would help gig workers who
 
00:55:19.870 --> 00:55:19.880 align:start position:0%
do not get benefits in their job and
 
00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:21.880 align:start position:0%
they're an increasingly large part of
 
00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:22.789 align:start position:0%
they're an increasingly large part of
our

00:55:22.789 --> 00:55:22.799 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:55:25.549 --> 00:55:25.559 align:start position:0%
Workforce they could get insurance
 
00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
um as easily as their social security
 
00:55:32.510 --> 00:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
card but let's be be clear we do not
 
00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
have a free market and health insurance
 
00:55:36.589 --> 00:55:36.599 align:start position:0%
in this
 
00:55:38.829 --> 00:55:38.839 align:start position:0%
country if you get coverage through your
 
00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:40.720 align:start position:0%
job your employer is the one who picks a
 
00:55:44.109 --> 00:55:44.119 align:start position:0%
plan not you if you buy through the
 
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
marketplace which I do now you really
 
00:55:50.029 --> 00:55:50.039 align:start position:0%
only have one or two options and then
 
00:55:53.789 --> 00:55:53.799 align:start position:0%
when you look at what um you know on the
 
00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
marketplace when I first signed up there
 
00:55:58.549 --> 00:55:58.559 align:start position:0%
were two different plans so I I went
 
00:56:00.069 --> 00:56:00.079 align:start position:0%
with one and and then after a couple
 
00:56:01.470 --> 00:56:01.480 align:start position:0%
years thought well maybe I should try
 
00:56:02.950 --> 00:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
this other one might it might save a
 
00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
little bit of money on my premium and
 
00:56:08.829 --> 00:56:08.839 align:start position:0%
then I found that none of the none of my
 
00:56:11.630 --> 00:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
doctors were on that other plan you know
 
00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
I really had to go with that one
 
00:56:16.109 --> 00:56:16.119 align:start position:0%
insurance company who was had the main
 
00:56:20.829 --> 00:56:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:23.309 --> 00:56:23.319 align:start position:0%
choice and then you know the
 
00:56:27.309 --> 00:56:27.319 align:start position:0%
plans they this array of plan options
 
00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:28.760 align:start position:0%
but they all amount to the same thing
 
00:56:30.589 --> 00:56:30.599 align:start position:0%
you either pay more in
 
00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:33.920 align:start position:0%
premiums or have a higher deductible and
 
00:56:36.109 --> 00:56:36.119 align:start position:0%
you end up making you know spending
 
00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
money and another really important
 
00:56:44.589 --> 00:56:44.599 align:start position:0%
reason for me to have a national
 
00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:47.200 align:start position:0%
universal health insurance plan is to
 
00:56:50.069 --> 00:56:50.079 align:start position:0%
eliminate the need for poverty only
 
00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
government health insurance mainly
 
00:56:56.390 --> 00:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and I don't want to anyone to
 
00:56:58.990 --> 00:56:59.000 align:start position:0%
leave here thinking I want to stop the
 
00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program only if we have another
 
00:57:04.390 --> 00:57:04.400 align:start position:0%
option in place because it's the only
 
00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
option for so many millions of
 
00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
people but
 
00:57:11.349 --> 00:57:11.359 align:start position:0%
Medicaid it's has enormous
 
00:57:11.359 --> 00:57:12.870 align:start position:0%
Medicaid it's has enormous
administrative

00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
00:57:15.950 --> 00:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
costs both you know to qualify People
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
based on their income and then you have
 
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
to do it over and over and over again
 
00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
and it's also tedious to be on the other
 
00:57:23.789 --> 00:57:23.799 align:start position:0%
side of that to have to apply for
 
00:57:27.230 --> 00:57:27.240 align:start position:0%
that and also the stigma of having
 
00:57:29.589 --> 00:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
Insurance that's only for poor
 
00:57:33.309 --> 00:57:33.319 align:start position:0%
people when I first applied for um to be
 
00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
on the exchange through the Affordable
 
00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:39.280 align:start position:0%
Care Act uh our business had been
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
decimated by the recession our income
 
00:57:44.589 --> 00:57:44.599 align:start position:0%
was really low and they told me I had to
 
00:57:47.549 --> 00:57:47.559 align:start position:0%
apply for Medicaid first and my reaction
 
00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
I was kind of mortified like I I have
 
00:57:52.029 --> 00:57:52.039 align:start position:0%
never been on any kind of Public
 
00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
Assistance in my life and I thought I
 
00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
don't I don't want to have a Medicaid
 
00:57:59.270 --> 00:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
card I know what that would be like when
 
00:58:01.150 --> 00:58:01.160 align:start position:0%
I go to the doctor's
 
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
office and I was fortunately I made just
 
00:58:07.470 --> 00:58:07.480 align:start position:0%
enough money that I didn't have to do
 
00:58:11.349 --> 00:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
that um and it's also it's a literal
 
00:58:14.190 --> 00:58:14.200 align:start position:0%
barrier to access because me many
 
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
private practices will simply not take
 
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
you if if Medicaid is your only
 
00:58:23.549 --> 00:58:23.559 align:start position:0%
Insurance the other thing is Medicaid is
 
00:58:27.910 --> 00:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
a disincentive to work if you're at
 
00:58:31.390 --> 00:58:31.400 align:start position:0%
this position with your income like oh
 
00:58:33.589 --> 00:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
if I if I make just a little bit more
 
00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
I'm going to lose my health insurance
 
00:58:38.549 --> 00:58:38.559 align:start position:0%
and I'm pregnant like I can't do that
 
00:58:43.069 --> 00:58:43.079 align:start position:0%
I'm going to cut back my hours in order
 
00:58:44.670 --> 00:58:44.680 align:start position:0%
to qualify or I'm going to work under
 
00:58:48.029 --> 00:58:48.039 align:start position:0%
the table so that I don't know that I
 
00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
make a little too much to qualify for
 
00:58:53.589 --> 00:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and there are so many lower
 
00:58:56.510 --> 00:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
wage jobs in which the employer gets out
 
00:58:59.190 --> 00:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
of the responsibility to private to to
 
00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
provide in Insurance like they say oh it
 
00:59:05.549 --> 00:59:05.559 align:start position:0%
can only offer you 29 hours a week or
 
00:59:07.349 --> 00:59:07.359 align:start position:0%
that's why you have many people that are
 
00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:10.720 align:start position:0%
working more than one job but they still
 
00:59:12.349 --> 00:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
don't get
 
00:59:12.359 --> 00:59:14.270 align:start position:0%
don't get
insurance

00:59:14.270 --> 00:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
00:59:18.029 --> 00:59:18.039 align:start position:0%
and you know and also Medicaid expansion
 
00:59:21.630 --> 00:59:21.640 align:start position:0%
while I'm in favor of it in many ways it
 
00:59:24.829 --> 00:59:24.839 align:start position:0%
uses taxpayer money to subsidize big
 
00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:27.640 align:start position:0%
employers who find these loopholes
 
00:59:29.349 --> 00:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
loopholes of not paying their own
 
00:59:31.829 --> 00:59:31.839 align:start position:0%
employees the
 
00:59:34.670 --> 00:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
insurance and Medicaid puts half the
 
00:59:37.390 --> 00:59:37.400 align:start position:0%
burden on States setting up constant
 
00:59:39.349 --> 00:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
battles in state
 
00:59:42.750 --> 00:59:42.760 align:start position:0%
legislatures and creating disparities in
 
00:59:46.910 --> 00:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:48.710 align:start position:0%
 
state

00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
and a big reason we need the National
 
00:59:53.549 --> 00:59:53.559 align:start position:0%
Health Plan is the economy of scale we
 
00:59:55.910 --> 00:59:55.920 align:start position:0%
can't fix this in New Hampshire we're
 
00:59:57.430 --> 00:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
not big enough to have our own
 
01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:03.829 --> 01:00:03.839 align:start position:0%
system and finally I think the most
 
01:00:07.069 --> 01:00:07.079 align:start position:0%
important at all is
 
01:00:07.079 --> 01:00:08.789 align:start position:0%
important at all is
understanding

01:00:08.789 --> 01:00:08.799 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
that we are probably the only country in
 
01:00:16.470 --> 01:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
the world that has um a low-risk Health
 
01:00:19.470 --> 01:00:19.480 align:start position:0%
Insurance Pool and a highrisk Health
 
01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:20.789 align:start position:0%
Insurance Pool and a highrisk Health
Insurance

01:00:20.789 --> 01:00:20.799 align:start position:0%
Insurance
 
01:00:24.589 --> 01:00:24.599 align:start position:0%
Pool we already have 35% of our
 
01:00:28.230 --> 01:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
Americans on some type of government
 
01:00:31.789 --> 01:00:31.799 align:start position:0%
insurance but government spending on
 
01:00:34.829 --> 01:00:34.839 align:start position:0%
Health Care accounts for
 
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
64% of Total Health Care expenditures so
 
01:00:41.470 --> 01:00:41.480 align:start position:0%
why is that if they're only covering
 
01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
35% why I have do they have really twice
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
that much of a share of expenditures
 
01:00:50.309 --> 01:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
that's because that
 
01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:54.119 align:start position:0%
35% represents the highrisk pool right
 
01:00:55.829 --> 01:00:55.839 align:start position:0%
the government government is
 
01:00:59.190 --> 01:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
ensuring uh all the Indigent anyone with
 
01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:00.430 align:start position:0%
ensuring uh all the Indigent anyone with
a

01:01:00.430 --> 01:01:00.440 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:01:03.150 --> 01:01:03.160 align:start position:0%
disability any child born with a major
 
01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
medical problem goes on the chip
 
01:01:08.309 --> 01:01:08.319 align:start position:0%
program and most important of all all
 
01:01:08.319 --> 01:01:09.230 align:start position:0%
program and most important of all all
the

01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:09.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:01:11.950 --> 01:01:11.960 align:start position:0%
seniors the ones that are most that need
 
01:01:14.789 --> 01:01:14.799 align:start position:0%
the most health care and have the most
 
01:01:17.309 --> 01:01:17.319 align:start position:0%
um long-term expensive Health Care needs
 
01:01:19.150 --> 01:01:19.160 align:start position:0%
the government pays for them and
 
01:01:20.789 --> 01:01:20.799 align:start position:0%
meanwhile the private insurance
 
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
companies like oh you can Ure the
 
01:01:27.069 --> 01:01:27.079 align:start position:0%
healthy work adult and their children
 
01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:30.280 align:start position:0%
very few of them are going to have my
 
01:01:31.710 --> 01:01:31.720 align:start position:0%
high medical
 
01:01:35.589 --> 01:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
expenses so it's it's set up this system
 
01:01:38.109 --> 01:01:38.119 align:start position:0%
where they get to make enormous profits
 
01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
ensuring a low risk pool and the
 
01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
government picks up the
 
01:01:46.510 --> 01:01:46.520 align:start position:0%
rest so how is this
 
01:01:49.069 --> 01:01:49.079 align:start position:0%
sustainable and people uh when I talked
 
01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
to them about universal healthcare they
 
01:01:51.990 --> 01:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
said well you know that sounds great but
 
01:01:54.589 --> 01:01:54.599 align:start position:0%
how can we afford it but really how how
 
01:01:58.750 --> 01:01:58.760 align:start position:0%
can we afford not to do that how can we
 
01:02:01.950 --> 01:02:01.960 align:start position:0%
afford not to combine the risk pools
 
01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
pools like every other country in the
 
01:02:06.670 --> 01:02:06.680 align:start position:0%
world if we did
 
01:02:09.950 --> 01:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
that instead of private insurance making
 
01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:14.200 align:start position:0%
enormous profits of the the lowrisk pool
 
01:02:17.829 --> 01:02:17.839 align:start position:0%
we could have enough money for Medicare
 
01:02:19.309 --> 01:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
not to need any
 
01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
supplements from Medicare to include
 
01:02:25.789 --> 01:02:25.799 align:start position:0%
dental care and from Medicare to include
 
01:02:28.029 --> 01:02:28.039 align:start position:0%
long-term care insurance so we can
 
01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:30.760 align:start position:0%
actually take care of our elderly in a
 
01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:34.990 align:start position:0%
actually take care of our elderly in a
dignified

01:02:34.990 --> 01:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
way and so I urge you to vote uh to pass
 
01:02:43.269 --> 01:02:43.279 align:start position:0%
on this resolution it will cost us
 
01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
nothing it will save us all money if it
 
01:02:47.950 --> 01:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
actually goes
 
01:02:51.150 --> 01:02:51.160 align:start position:0%
anywhere but we do want to send a
 
01:02:53.870 --> 01:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
message to Congress that we need a real
 
01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:55.309 align:start position:0%
message to Congress that we need a real
solution

01:02:55.309 --> 01:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
solution
 
01:02:56.870 --> 01:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
and it has to be
 
01:03:00.269 --> 01:03:00.279 align:start position:0%
National and I say this to members of my
 
01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:03.680 align:start position:0%
own party that I want them to do
 
01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
more as well as the other
 
01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:09.990 align:start position:0%
more as well as the other
party

01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
party
 
01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:13.680 align:start position:0%
so uh I'm welcome to take any
 
01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
questions thank you so much
 
01:03:17.349 --> 01:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
representative uh I have a couple quick
 
01:03:20.029 --> 01:03:20.039 align:start position:0%
ones um so
 
01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh famously supposedly uh
 
01:03:25.150 --> 01:03:25.160 align:start position:0%
a few years ago developed a near
 
01:03:30.029 --> 01:03:30.039 align:start position:0%
Universal State health care plan um What
 
01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
If This Were to move forward C can you
 
01:03:35.269 --> 01:03:35.279 align:start position:0%
speak very briefly at all
 
01:03:38.269 --> 01:03:38.279 align:start position:0%
about what would that how would that
 
01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
impact existing state plans that are
 
01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
near Universal or near Universal yeah
 
01:03:46.349 --> 01:03:46.359 align:start position:0%
well the the Massachusetts plan is
 
01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
really it's much like um what we have at
 
01:03:54.910 --> 01:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
the federal level already in terms of um
 
01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:56.589 align:start position:0%
the federal level already in terms of um
it

01:03:56.589 --> 01:03:56.599 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:03:58.789 --> 01:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
guarantee you know it's a mixture of
 
01:04:02.710 --> 01:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
public and private right there are some
 
01:04:05.230 --> 01:04:05.240 align:start position:0%
you know people don't qualify Medicare
 
01:04:07.470 --> 01:04:07.480 align:start position:0%
they can get on Mass health which it
 
01:04:10.789 --> 01:04:10.799 align:start position:0%
covers a certain another point but you
 
01:04:13.309 --> 01:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
know one of the aspects of the
 
01:04:14.910 --> 01:04:14.920 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act while there are many
 
01:04:17.109 --> 01:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
good things that I like about it is it
 
01:04:21.789 --> 01:04:21.799 align:start position:0%
also relies on um subsidies so if you if
 
01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
you don't if you make too much to qualif
 
01:04:25.829 --> 01:04:25.839 align:start position:0%
for some of these other federally
 
01:04:28.109 --> 01:04:28.119 align:start position:0%
managed programs but not quite enough to
 
01:04:30.029 --> 01:04:30.039 align:start position:0%
F the pay the full
 
01:04:32.549 --> 01:04:32.559 align:start position:0%
premium the government basically writes
 
01:04:34.829 --> 01:04:34.839 align:start position:0%
a check to the private insurance company
 
01:04:36.789 --> 01:04:36.799 align:start position:0%
to fill the Gap in that premium I I
 
01:04:39.230 --> 01:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
don't like that at all I mean it's just
 
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
making the situation worse another
 
01:04:44.269 --> 01:04:44.279 align:start position:0%
proposal that is often heard like well
 
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
let's just open up Medicare for people
 
01:04:49.549 --> 01:04:49.559 align:start position:0%
55 to
 
01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
65 that would actually make the
 
01:04:54.269 --> 01:04:54.279 align:start position:0%
disparities worse it would put more
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
people that are hired to
 
01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
insure um on the government Dole and
 
01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
taking less off the private risk pool
 
01:05:06.190 --> 01:05:06.200 align:start position:0%
right it'll make it worse it's got to be
 
01:05:08.309 --> 01:05:08.319 align:start position:0%
Universal and then we could do away with
 
01:05:09.630 --> 01:05:09.640 align:start position:0%
some of these programs that are
 
01:05:11.829 --> 01:05:11.839 align:start position:0%
inefficient to
 
01:05:14.190 --> 01:05:14.200 align:start position:0%
run thank you for that my my other
 
01:05:17.630 --> 01:05:17.640 align:start position:0%
question uh as most everyone knows our
 
01:05:20.109 --> 01:05:20.119 align:start position:0%
country is being inundated not New
 
01:05:22.589 --> 01:05:22.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as much as other places with
 
01:05:26.029 --> 01:05:26.039 align:start position:0%
uh migrants uh here uh coming into the
 
01:05:29.549 --> 01:05:29.559 align:start position:0%
country illegally and and uh my question
 
01:05:31.950 --> 01:05:31.960 align:start position:0%
is we're talking about millions and
 
01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
millions of undocumented folks and I
 
01:05:37.870 --> 01:05:37.880 align:start position:0%
know uh current Law requires emergency
 
01:05:39.630 --> 01:05:39.640 align:start position:0%
rooms to take care of people who show up
 
01:05:42.510 --> 01:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
looking for health care but would your
 
01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
do you envision your National universal
 
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
health insurance program H how would
 
01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
would illegal or undocumented uh
 
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
migrants that type of uh those types of
 
01:05:56.990 --> 01:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
folks would they be covered by the plan
 
01:05:58.670 --> 01:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
that you
 
01:06:01.789 --> 01:06:01.799 align:start position:0%
envision well if they're working
 
01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:05.640 align:start position:0%
jobs um and paying if they're getting a
 
01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
paycheck then yes they would probably be
 
01:06:11.269 --> 01:06:11.279 align:start position:0%
contributing as well as receiving just
 
01:06:13.150 --> 01:06:13.160 align:start position:0%
like now many illegal workers are
 
01:06:15.630 --> 01:06:15.640 align:start position:0%
working with illegal Social Security
 
01:06:16.990 --> 01:06:17.000 align:start position:0%
numbers and they're paying into the
 
01:06:19.029 --> 01:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
Social Security System unfortunately
 
01:06:20.430 --> 01:06:20.440 align:start position:0%
they'll probably never be able to
 
01:06:23.309 --> 01:06:23.319 align:start position:0%
collect on that benefit cuz in the end
 
01:06:26.109 --> 01:06:26.119 align:start position:0%
they'll be found out an illegal card but
 
01:06:29.230 --> 01:06:29.240 align:start position:0%
ideally we live in a system where uh
 
01:06:32.069 --> 01:06:32.079 align:start position:0%
anyone that's working um can be
 
01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:36.640 align:start position:0%
recognized for working and and and if
 
01:06:38.349 --> 01:06:38.359 align:start position:0%
they're paying into it they should get
 
01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
the benefits as well so what I'm hearing
 
01:06:42.910 --> 01:06:42.920 align:start position:0%
is that if they're not working they
 
01:06:45.390 --> 01:06:45.400 align:start position:0%
would not be covered is that fair to say
 
01:06:49.789 --> 01:06:49.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:53.230 --> 01:06:53.240 align:start position:0%
um the social security number is is
 
01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:55.269 align:start position:0%
um the social security number is is
basically

01:06:55.269 --> 01:06:55.279 align:start position:0%
basically
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
um you have one whether you're working
 
01:06:59.430 --> 01:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
or not right even if you don't have a
 
01:07:01.870 --> 01:07:01.880 align:start position:0%
job you might still be eligible Social
 
01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
Security benefits depending on your
 
01:07:07.870 --> 01:07:07.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances but how I Envision
 
01:07:11.029 --> 01:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
Medicare We already pay a Medicare
 
01:07:15.029 --> 01:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
deduction right for the future that's
 
01:07:17.710 --> 01:07:17.720 align:start position:0%
which like around 2 and a half or 3% of
 
01:07:22.190 --> 01:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
our paycheck right and I how I Envision
 
01:07:24.589 --> 01:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
expanding making Medicare
 
01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:27.480 align:start position:0%
Universal is you increase that just by a
 
01:07:29.230 --> 01:07:29.240 align:start position:0%
couple percentage points and that would
 
01:07:32.430 --> 01:07:32.440 align:start position:0%
be enough Medicare the administrative
 
01:07:36.430 --> 01:07:36.440 align:start position:0%
cost of Medicare now is only about
 
01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:40.640 align:start position:0%
3% compared to what you pay for private
 
01:07:43.230 --> 01:07:43.240 align:start position:0%
insurance you're paying anywhere to 12
 
01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
to 20% of your paycheck for private
 
01:07:50.430 --> 01:07:50.440 align:start position:0%
insurance so what I'm saying is you you
 
01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:53.079 align:start position:0%
pay you're paying in if you have a job
 
01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
you're not if you don't don't but as
 
01:07:57.910 --> 01:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
long as you have that number you do but
 
01:08:01.109 --> 01:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
unlike um Medicaid there's actually no
 
01:08:04.109 --> 01:08:04.119 align:start position:0%
disincentive to work right the more you
 
01:08:06.789 --> 01:08:06.799 align:start position:0%
work great you know you're paying a
 
01:08:11.470 --> 01:08:11.480 align:start position:0%
little bit more but only as a
 
01:08:14.109 --> 01:08:14.119 align:start position:0%
percentage thank you for that uh other
 
01:08:16.709 --> 01:08:16.719 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:08:19.390 --> 01:08:19.400 align:start position:0%
gagy thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm going to be 80
 
01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
years old in a couple of days I have
 
01:08:25.709 --> 01:08:25.719 align:start position:0%
haven't worked since
 
01:08:29.510 --> 01:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
2006 retired from the Postal
 
01:08:33.430 --> 01:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
Service my health insurance that I pay
 
01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
the government does not pay my health
 
01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:39.480 align:start position:0%
insurance takes up half my annuity I'm
 
01:08:42.349 --> 01:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
happy with that because I don't I'm not
 
01:08:45.229 --> 01:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
being I'm 80 years old I'm not working
 
01:08:47.149 --> 01:08:47.159 align:start position:0%
suppose someone who's 40 years old and
 
01:08:50.269 --> 01:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
is working and paying into the system
 
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
right and I have the same condition that
 
01:08:55.149 --> 01:08:55.159 align:start position:0%
person has the same condition but he's
 
01:08:57.430 --> 01:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
that individual is still able to work
 
01:08:59.269 --> 01:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
would that be something like managed
 
01:09:01.829 --> 01:09:01.839 align:start position:0%
care where if the money is tight
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
government wise that uh maybe uh someone
 
01:09:08.149 --> 01:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
like me would be pushed aside down the
 
01:09:10.990 --> 01:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
road that happened in Canada I know from
 
01:09:14.189 --> 01:09:14.199 align:start position:0%
my relatives point that the older people
 
01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
waited like a year to a year and a half
 
01:09:19.110 --> 01:09:19.120 align:start position:0%
before they were seen some of them died
 
01:09:22.590 --> 01:09:22.600 align:start position:0%
whereas the working people were seen
 
01:09:25.550 --> 01:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
first with do you envision perhaps a
 
01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:28.910 align:start position:0%
possible scenario that
 
01:09:28.910 --> 01:09:31.110 align:start position:0%
possible scenario that
[Music]

01:09:31.110 --> 01:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:09:35.070 --> 01:09:35.080 align:start position:0%
way not really I think one one thing is
 
01:09:37.870 --> 01:09:37.880 align:start position:0%
having a national program will give us
 
01:09:42.110 --> 01:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
the scale that we can set up um policies
 
01:09:44.550 --> 01:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
that work for everybody and and I
 
01:09:46.990 --> 01:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
believe we have enough resources in this
 
01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
country that we don't have to
 
01:09:51.189 --> 01:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
deny people
 
01:09:53.309 --> 01:09:53.319 align:start position:0%
coverage but you know it seems to me
 
01:09:56.229 --> 01:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
that what we call Managed Care Now is
 
01:09:59.189 --> 01:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
mostly insurance companies trying to
 
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
deny claims and coverage in order to
 
01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:04.750 align:start position:0%
deny claims and coverage in order to
maximize

01:10:04.750 --> 01:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
maximize
 
01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
profits that's what the private
 
01:10:09.870 --> 01:10:09.880 align:start position:0%
insurance companies call Managed Care
 
01:10:12.030 --> 01:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
but I think if it's a publicly run
 
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
program with independent panels to
 
01:10:18.149 --> 01:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
determine best quality of care and
 
01:10:21.149 --> 01:10:21.159 align:start position:0%
priorities that wouldn't that wouldn't
 
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
be the the main motivation for it
 
01:10:27.470 --> 01:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
it but right now you know my husband's
 
01:10:30.110 --> 01:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
doctor just retired after being his
 
01:10:32.590 --> 01:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
doctor for about 40 years and he had to
 
01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
find a new primary care we spent about
 
01:10:35.950 --> 01:10:35.960 align:start position:0%
three months just trying to find a
 
01:10:37.870 --> 01:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
primary care doctor accepting new
 
01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
patients and his first Primary Care Appo
 
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
appointment is 7 months away so we we
 
01:10:49.310 --> 01:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
have a problem already I hope we can fix
 
01:10:53.430 --> 01:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
it other questions representative masso
 
01:10:55.149 --> 01:10:55.159 align:start position:0%
thank thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:10:57.950 --> 01:10:57.960 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
01:11:02.189 --> 01:11:02.199 align:start position:0%
could you clarify the difference between
 
01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
Universal um health care and socialized
 
01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
healthare yes socialized medicine is
 
01:11:12.510 --> 01:11:12.520 align:start position:0%
really uh in which the government is
 
01:11:15.669 --> 01:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
actually running the health care
 
01:11:18.510 --> 01:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
facilities that's not the case the only
 
01:11:20.470 --> 01:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
thing that comes close to that in this
 
01:11:22.750 --> 01:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
country is the VA where that's a
 
01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
government government Managed Health
 
01:11:30.270 --> 01:11:30.280 align:start position:0%
Service um what we're talking about here
 
01:11:33.550 --> 01:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
is the only the insurance aspect of
 
01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:36.760 align:start position:0%
it who's paying for that it's you can go
 
01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:44.110 --> 01:11:44.120 align:start position:0%
Medicare good question and good answer I
 
01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
think representative
 
01:11:48.110 --> 01:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
Manion thank you uh Mr chair thanks for
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question so uh during the
 
01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:52.719 align:start position:0%
pandemic and after there was a lot of
 
01:11:54.430 --> 01:11:54.440 align:start position:0%
push especially from in heads at night
 
01:11:56.110 --> 01:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
late night shows where they were saying
 
01:11:58.110 --> 01:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
um if you refuse to get the jab you
 
01:12:00.270 --> 01:12:00.280 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be allowed to have health care
 
01:12:02.189 --> 01:12:02.199 align:start position:0%
uh would you uh oppose any kind of
 
01:12:03.629 --> 01:12:03.639 align:start position:0%
measure like that that may be appended
 
01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
to some kind of universal Medicare or
 
01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
would you say that someone has the right
 
01:12:09.669 --> 01:12:09.679 align:start position:0%
to not get vaccinated and continue to
 
01:12:09.679 --> 01:12:11.070 align:start position:0%
to not get vaccinated and continue to
get

01:12:11.070 --> 01:12:11.080 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:12:15.189 --> 01:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
care um I probably would not support
 
01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:18.280 align:start position:0%
that even though I believe vaccines are
 
01:12:21.629 --> 01:12:21.639 align:start position:0%
good but I do think
 
01:12:26.070 --> 01:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
um depending on on the stage of an
 
01:12:29.229 --> 01:12:29.239 align:start position:0%
epidemic um it's certainly um I think
 
01:12:32.149 --> 01:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
the right of any practice to say no you
 
01:12:34.629 --> 01:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
must be vaccinated to not put their own
 
01:12:37.629 --> 01:12:37.639 align:start position:0%
people and other patients at risk but
 
01:12:37.639 --> 01:12:38.990 align:start position:0%
people and other patients at risk but
that's

01:12:38.990 --> 01:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:12:42.350 --> 01:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
not perhaps one of the Physicians that
 
01:12:46.030 --> 01:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
are speaking may may better answer that
 
01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
question other
 
01:12:51.790 --> 01:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
questions seeing n thank you so much uh

members for listening to me I'll try to
 
01:13:15.149 --> 01:13:15.159 align:start position:0%
be really succinct uh before I became a
 
01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
representative I spent a decade on the
 
01:13:19.709 --> 01:13:19.719 align:start position:0%
Oyster River School Board and also on
 
01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
the durm toown council and my major
 
01:13:24.430 --> 01:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
capacity I worked on the budget
 
01:13:26.830 --> 01:13:26.840 align:start position:0%
committee and I worked on uh negotiating
 
01:13:29.110 --> 01:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
with our collective bargaining units and
 
01:13:32.030 --> 01:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
because we're really personnal driven
 
01:13:34.430 --> 01:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
health care costs have a huge impact on
 
01:13:37.629 --> 01:13:37.639 align:start position:0%
us and what we were really looking for
 
01:13:40.629 --> 01:13:40.639 align:start position:0%
is the ability to stabilize our health
 
01:13:43.070 --> 01:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
care costs which everybody is trying to
 
01:13:46.430 --> 01:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
do uh and it really really is
 
01:13:50.110 --> 01:13:50.120 align:start position:0%
challenging um this year for example uh
 
01:13:53.070 --> 01:13:53.080 align:start position:0%
deep in our budget process you find out
 
01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
from the the insurance companies what
 
01:13:57.430 --> 01:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
your guaranteed maximum is and so this
 
01:13:59.590 --> 01:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
year at the end of October we found out
 
01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:00.430 align:start position:0%
year at the end of October we found out
it's

01:14:00.430 --> 01:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
15% that's a that's a million doll
 
01:14:05.390 --> 01:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
impact on our budget that we have two
 
01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
months to figure out how to come up with
 
01:14:10.030 --> 01:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
that before we do our public hearing and
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
it directly impacts of course the tax
 
01:14:14.910 --> 01:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
impact our our our residents are going
 
01:14:17.470 --> 01:14:17.480 align:start position:0%
to feel and then that impacts whether
 
01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
they'll vote for our budget and so we we
 
01:14:22.990 --> 01:14:23.000 align:start position:0%
tried everything uh we tried working
 
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
with different higher deductible plans
 
01:14:27.510 --> 01:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
for our younger workers and giving them
 
01:14:30.669 --> 01:14:30.679 align:start position:0%
uh Health uh benefit cards to offset
 
01:14:34.229 --> 01:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
their co-pays we tried steering them to
 
01:14:36.870 --> 01:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
Price shopping so that they could get
 
01:14:39.629 --> 01:14:39.639 align:start position:0%
the best rate on MRIs or blood work or
 
01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
anything else to stabilize our costs we
 
01:14:45.669 --> 01:14:45.679 align:start position:0%
tried to have them participate in health
 
01:14:49.270 --> 01:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
um Healthy Living uh programs to try to
 
01:14:51.629 --> 01:14:51.639 align:start position:0%
lower their risk and and none of it
 
01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
works and I think it was touched on on
 
01:14:56.390 --> 01:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
by the prime sponsor it's because the
 
01:14:59.270 --> 01:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
pool our pool is too small we couldn't
 
01:15:01.110 --> 01:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
mitigate the risk and so there's no
 
01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
ability despite trying our best to be
 
01:15:07.709 --> 01:15:07.719 align:start position:0%
able to control our costs and so uh the
 
01:15:10.110 --> 01:15:10.120 align:start position:0%
state faces the same problem we come to
 
01:15:12.189 --> 01:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
you and say can you please help us we
 
01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
need to stabilize our costs what can you
 
01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
do to help us and then New Hampshire
 
01:15:18.990 --> 01:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
runs into the same problem we did their
 
01:15:21.470 --> 01:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
pool is too small you can't mitigate the
 
01:15:23.910 --> 01:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
risk you're also dealing with impact of
 
01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
Health Care cost on your budget and so
 
01:15:28.669 --> 01:15:28.679 align:start position:0%
that's why we're asking for or that's
 
01:15:31.790 --> 01:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
why I support the resolution a national
 
01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
program broadens our pool and not only
 
01:15:37.470 --> 01:15:37.480 align:start position:0%
helps the state but helps our
 
01:15:40.229 --> 01:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
municipalities and our businesses so
 
01:15:42.470 --> 01:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
that's the reason I support the uh bill
 
01:15:45.470 --> 01:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
and I I hope I came in under my three
 
01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
minutes very well presented
 
01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:49.510 align:start position:0%
minutes very well presented
representative

01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:15:51.870 --> 01:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
questions uh Ron
 
01:15:55.470 --> 01:15:55.480 align:start position:0%
carry so based on your experience do you
 
01:15:57.629 --> 01:15:57.639 align:start position:0%
believe because New Hampshire is the
 
01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
second oldest state in the United States
 
01:16:03.310 --> 01:16:03.320 align:start position:0%
that our costs are higher as a result of
 
01:16:05.550 --> 01:16:05.560 align:start position:0%
us being an aging
 
01:16:07.629 --> 01:16:07.639 align:start position:0%
population thank you for the question I
 
01:16:09.910 --> 01:16:09.920 align:start position:0%
do and in fact that was part of our
 
01:16:12.350 --> 01:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
strategy our strategy was our younger
 
01:16:15.229 --> 01:16:15.239 align:start position:0%
workers if we put them on a higher
 
01:16:17.950 --> 01:16:17.960 align:start position:0%
deductible then it lowed the cost of
 
01:16:20.830 --> 01:16:20.840 align:start position:0%
their premiums and we could then make up
 
01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
for the cost of our older workers who
 
01:16:25.870 --> 01:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
were more costly it doesn't work the
 
01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
pool was still too
 
01:16:30.870 --> 01:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
small another good question and good
 
01:16:32.709 --> 01:16:32.719 align:start position:0%
answer any other
 
01:16:34.910 --> 01:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you

01:16:59.709 --> 01:16:59.719 align:start position:0%
supporting the
 
01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
resolution thank you I'm not used to
 
01:17:12.270 --> 01:17:12.280 align:start position:0%
mics being here uh greetings and thank
 
01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
you for taking the time for this Mr
 
01:17:16.510 --> 01:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
chairman and honorable members of this
 
01:17:20.430 --> 01:17:20.440 align:start position:0%
committee I am a former rep and when I
 
01:17:23.669 --> 01:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
was here I won't I was a republic
 
01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
and I was vice chair of Commerce and
 
01:17:28.750 --> 01:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
consumer affairs and for 20 years of my
 
01:17:31.709 --> 01:17:31.719 align:start position:0%
life I served my community as an EMT and
 
01:17:33.910 --> 01:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
as a medical technician in
 
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
hospital I truly believe that we could
 
01:17:39.270 --> 01:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
fix healthc care I believed in creating
 
01:17:41.430 --> 01:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
Health Care compacts and proper
 
01:17:43.629 --> 01:17:43.639 align:start position:0%
government controls to ensure that the
 
01:17:46.350 --> 01:17:46.360 align:start position:0%
basics were covered there was a level of
 
01:17:49.390 --> 01:17:49.400 align:start position:0%
expectation that I had that insurance
 
01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:50.790 align:start position:0%
expectation that I had that insurance
would

01:17:50.790 --> 01:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:17:53.910 --> 01:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
cover I was blind to the real reties of
 
01:17:55.669 --> 01:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
what happens when you're the one who
 
01:17:59.669 --> 01:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
gets sick I learned the hard way and I'd
 
01:18:02.709 --> 01:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
like to ask you not to support forcing
 
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
others to do the same and pass this
 
01:18:07.709 --> 01:18:07.719 align:start position:0%
resolution sending a clear message to
 
01:18:09.470 --> 01:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
the hill that we need
 
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
change health insurance is the best scam
 
01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
in America they make money off the sick
 
01:18:17.790 --> 01:18:17.800 align:start position:0%
and the Dying by denying and delaying
 
01:18:20.790 --> 01:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
care I've seen patients denied chemo
 
01:18:22.350 --> 01:18:22.360 align:start position:0%
because the insurance wanted them to try
 
01:18:23.950 --> 01:18:23.960 align:start position:0%
a different Cho
 
01:18:26.350 --> 01:18:26.360 align:start position:0%
first and the cheaper one didn't work
 
01:18:27.709 --> 01:18:27.719 align:start position:0%
and by the time they knew that it was
 
01:18:30.270 --> 01:18:30.280 align:start position:0%
too late to give them the one that might
 
01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
have I hugged a daughter of a college
 
01:18:34.350 --> 01:18:34.360 align:start position:0%
professor who was forced to watch her
 
01:18:36.750 --> 01:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
father pass as he was denied access to
 
01:18:38.590 --> 01:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
the very care that could have given him
 
01:18:40.990 --> 01:18:41.000 align:start position:0%
more time and isn't that what we all
 
01:18:44.390 --> 01:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
want time health insurance companies
 
01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:50.310 --> 01:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
sailboats this body can tell Congress to
 
01:18:53.030 --> 01:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
end the fleecing of America Medicare
 
01:18:55.390 --> 01:18:55.400 align:start position:0%
premiums end up in profit margins while
 
01:18:57.870 --> 01:18:57.880 align:start position:0%
people die and suffer denied access to
 
01:19:00.310 --> 01:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
life-saving care did you know that
 
01:19:02.189 --> 01:19:02.199 align:start position:0%
private for profit insurance companies
 
01:19:05.149 --> 01:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
collect over $140 billion dollar in
 
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
medicare premiums and
 
01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
overpayments every
 
01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
year just on their Medicare products
 
01:19:14.669 --> 01:19:14.679 align:start position:0%
never mind the private insurance
 
01:19:16.629 --> 01:19:16.639 align:start position:0%
products that they
 
01:19:18.750 --> 01:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
sell and uh they won't give your

grandmother any teeth she can have puree
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
a child goes without a athetic that
 
01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
works for a cheaper one
 
01:19:29.470 --> 01:19:29.480 align:start position:0%
instead I've taken my struggles publicly
 
01:19:31.990 --> 01:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
to access the care that I need to stay
 
01:19:34.870 --> 01:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
alive I had to fight United Healthcare
 
01:19:37.390 --> 01:19:37.400 align:start position:0%
in the press and in the social media I
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
had to shame them into talking to me I
 
01:19:42.070 --> 01:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
had to go to Washington DC and have
 
01:19:44.390 --> 01:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
meetings and press conferences I met
 
01:19:46.189 --> 01:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
with senior AIDS and federal of our
 
01:19:48.590 --> 01:19:48.600 align:start position:0%
federal delegation and they've had to
 
01:19:51.030 --> 01:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
help me get
 
01:19:53.629 --> 01:19:53.639 align:start position:0%
coverage I've had to fight for for every
 
01:20:01.350 --> 01:20:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:06.149 --> 01:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:09.550 --> 01:20:09.560 align:start position:0%
me I want more quality moments in
 
01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
life isn't that what you want to to have
 
01:20:15.790 --> 01:20:15.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
living it's a constant Terror to worry
 
01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
about access to care I'm one of many
 
01:20:23.709 --> 01:20:23.719 align:start position:0%
whose cost of living was exacerbated at
 
01:20:25.709 --> 01:20:25.719 align:start position:0%
the end of the pandemic when our rent
 
01:20:28.629 --> 01:20:28.639 align:start position:0%
was raised $400 all at once and we were
 
01:20:31.790 --> 01:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
told to vacate or pay within
 
01:20:34.790 --> 01:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
two I had to start rationing my
 
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
infusions and I still do that
 
01:20:39.950 --> 01:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
today I get to ration them a little less
 
01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
when United Healthcare pays at least
 
01:20:43.270 --> 01:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
01:20:46.229 --> 01:20:46.239 align:start position:0%
cost you know they boasted 8 billion do
 
01:20:48.430 --> 01:20:48.440 align:start position:0%
in first quar of profits last year while
 
01:20:51.149 --> 01:20:51.159 align:start position:0%
they refused to pay $600 for my
 
01:20:54.310 --> 01:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
infusion let me explain expl something I
 
01:20:58.750 --> 01:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
have CRPS complex regional pain syndrome
 
01:21:00.510 --> 01:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
it is the most painful disease known to
 
01:21:03.070 --> 01:21:03.080 align:start position:0%
modern medicine it has no cure and in
 
01:21:05.070 --> 01:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
the United States there is no approved
 
01:21:07.550 --> 01:21:07.560 align:start position:0%
treatment and the fact that the FDA has
 
01:21:09.310 --> 01:21:09.320 align:start position:0%
failed to approve a treatment has
 
01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
actually caused my insurance company to
 
01:21:14.430 --> 01:21:14.440 align:start position:0%
use as an excuse to not cover my care so
 
01:21:17.629 --> 01:21:17.639 align:start position:0%
if I don't pay nobody
 
01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
does they don't make money if they pay
 
01:21:23.189 --> 01:21:23.199 align:start position:0%
for my health care
 
01:21:25.030 --> 01:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
in fact I would challenge you to tell me
 
01:21:27.910 --> 01:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
one thing that health insurance does to
 
01:21:30.669 --> 01:21:30.679 align:start position:0%
increase positive medical outcomes in
 
01:21:32.950 --> 01:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
any medical
 
01:21:36.110 --> 01:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
situation National handcuff National
 
01:21:38.149 --> 01:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
healthc care would grant us true medical
 
01:21:40.110 --> 01:21:40.120 align:start position:0%
Freedom it would enable everyone to
 
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
access the same Health Care currently
 
01:21:44.510 --> 01:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
limited to the rich and the Pampered and
 
01:21:46.870 --> 01:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
Powerful Elite with the removal of
 
01:21:48.790 --> 01:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
insurance companies more people would
 
01:21:50.790 --> 01:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
live more importantly they would live
 
01:21:53.950 --> 01:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
longer and with quality a life worth
 
01:21:56.430 --> 01:21:56.440 align:start position:0%
living this resolution is the will of
 
01:21:58.790 --> 01:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
the people and we are hoping that you
 
01:22:01.510 --> 01:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
hear us we are tired of insurance
 
01:22:03.189 --> 01:22:03.199 align:start position:0%
companies forcing our loved ones to
 
01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
suffer and die while a life could have
 
01:22:07.790 --> 01:22:07.800 align:start position:0%
been saved If Only They had not been
 
01:22:11.270 --> 01:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
denied access to care I had the chance
 
01:22:13.149 --> 01:22:13.159 align:start position:0%
to travel to the Netherlands and
 
01:22:15.350 --> 01:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
experience National Health Care
 
01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
firsthand I was even able to access some
 
01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
care with a modest out of pocket the
 
01:22:23.070 --> 01:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
point is that everyone has access no one
 
01:22:26.189 --> 01:22:26.199 align:start position:0%
is denied medication is given when the
 
01:22:27.830 --> 01:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
doctor orders
 
01:22:31.510 --> 01:22:31.520 align:start position:0%

justice committee and she brought in a

bill to legalize switchblades which the
 
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%

um and I'm giving testimony um in um um
 
01:29:25.390 --> 01:29:25.400 align:start position:0%
proposing we move forward with hr23
 
01:29:27.470 --> 01:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
resolution it's sometimes said that
 
01:29:30.189 --> 01:29:30.199 align:start position:0%
America that we Americans um always do
 
01:29:32.310 --> 01:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
the right thing after we've tried
 
01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:33.390 align:start position:0%
the right thing after we've tried
everything

01:29:33.390 --> 01:29:33.400 align:start position:0%
everything
 
01:29:36.990 --> 01:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
else and our everything else has been
 
01:29:39.229 --> 01:29:39.239 align:start position:0%
these past 40 years the
 
01:29:39.239 --> 01:29:44.270 align:start position:0%
these past 40 years the
privatizing

01:29:44.270 --> 01:29:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:46.550 --> 01:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
profetizare those of us with gray hair
 
01:29:48.390 --> 01:29:48.400 align:start position:0%
we remember Blue Cross Blue Shield which
 
01:29:50.350 --> 01:29:50.360 align:start position:0%
our parents probably had when we were
 
01:29:53.270 --> 01:29:53.280 align:start position:0%
kids and was affordable
 
01:29:56.470 --> 01:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
what's the consequence of this this
 
01:29:58.950 --> 01:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
deregulation your New Hampshire workers
 
01:30:01.990 --> 01:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
who have health benefits have shouldered
 
01:30:05.229 --> 01:30:05.239 align:start position:0%
quadrupling insurance premiums since
 
01:30:05.239 --> 01:30:06.990 align:start position:0%
quadrupling insurance premiums since
1999

01:30:06.990 --> 01:30:07.000 align:start position:0%
1999
 
01:30:11.310 --> 01:30:11.320 align:start position:0%
quadrupled even while added deductibles
 
01:30:14.430 --> 01:30:14.440 align:start position:0%
make Affordable Care
 
01:30:16.629 --> 01:30:16.639 align:start position:0%
impossible New Hampshire
 
01:30:19.109 --> 01:30:19.119 align:start position:0%
employers scramble to find reasonable
 
01:30:22.030 --> 01:30:22.040 align:start position:0%
health plans for their employees and
 
01:30:24.669 --> 01:30:24.679 align:start position:0%
those workers potential salary raises
 
01:30:28.310 --> 01:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
are siphoned off to cover insurance
 
01:30:30.910 --> 01:30:30.920 align:start position:0%
coverage for Gig workers as mentioned
 
01:30:33.709 --> 01:30:33.719 align:start position:0%
and for those families living in poverty
 
01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
healthc care is fragmented by transient
 
01:30:39.109 --> 01:30:39.119 align:start position:0%
coverage either on the ACA or Medicaid
 
01:30:41.750 --> 01:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
both of which the state now contracts
 
01:30:44.750 --> 01:30:44.760 align:start position:0%
out to manage care companies whose
 
01:30:47.070 --> 01:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
fiduciary responsibility is to Wall
 
01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
Street that's their mission they are a
 
01:30:53.830 --> 01:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
for-profit organization um so as of
 
01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:55.510 align:start position:0%
for-profit organization um so as of
January

01:30:55.510 --> 01:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
January
 
01:30:58.470 --> 01:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
2024 additionally 15 million Americans
 
01:31:00.870 --> 01:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
have lost that Medicaid coverage uh that
 
01:31:02.149 --> 01:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
was due to the lapse of the American
 
01:31:05.310 --> 01:31:05.320 align:start position:0%
Rescue act adding to the 25 million
 
01:31:07.510 --> 01:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
Americans who already go without health
 
01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
insurance so unique to this developed
 
01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
country Americans create GoFundMe sites
 
01:31:17.550 --> 01:31:17.560 align:start position:0%
to pay for their Cancer Care or go
 
01:31:19.669 --> 01:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
bankrupt even if they have insurance
 
01:31:21.830 --> 01:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
from uncovered medical expenses that is
 
01:31:25.070 --> 01:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
is the reality didn't used to be that
 
01:31:28.430 --> 01:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
way as a primary care internist and a
 
01:31:30.350 --> 01:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
geriatrician uh I've served New
 
01:31:32.910 --> 01:31:32.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire patients for 40 years I have
 
01:31:34.910 --> 01:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
personally witnessed People's Health
 
01:31:37.149 --> 01:31:37.159 align:start position:0%
destroyed when their medical care is
 
01:31:39.189 --> 01:31:39.199 align:start position:0%
interrupted by loss of coverage and loss
 
01:31:41.470 --> 01:31:41.480 align:start position:0%
of their treatments or by arbitrary
 
01:31:44.149 --> 01:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
denials of service or medication we hear
 
01:31:45.390 --> 01:31:45.400 align:start position:0%
so much about
 
01:31:48.189 --> 01:31:48.199 align:start position:0%
rationing the rationing is happening
 
01:31:50.910 --> 01:31:50.920 align:start position:0%
towards Wall Street towards profit and
 
01:31:53.709 --> 01:31:53.719 align:start position:0%
who's paying for that we are with our
 
01:31:57.189 --> 01:31:57.199 align:start position:0%
health the absence of a health
 
01:31:59.790 --> 01:31:59.800 align:start position:0%
system devoted to health rather than
 
01:32:01.990 --> 01:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
profit has resulted in preventative and
 
01:32:04.510 --> 01:32:04.520 align:start position:0%
essential Primary Care becoming ever
 
01:32:07.149 --> 01:32:07.159 align:start position:0%
harder to find as we all know especially
 
01:32:08.189 --> 01:32:08.199 align:start position:0%
in rural
 
01:32:10.590 --> 01:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
areas we Trail the developed world in
 
01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
the rate of death which would otherwise
 
01:32:15.390 --> 01:32:15.400 align:start position:0%
be prevented by the way had quality Care
 
01:32:18.910 --> 01:32:18.920 align:start position:0%
been delivered and that's only one of
 
01:32:21.830 --> 01:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
numerous dismal metrics which reflect
 
01:32:25.590 --> 01:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
the absence of a genuine health system
 
01:32:28.470 --> 01:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
in the United States any semblance of a
 
01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
systemwide health planning is sacrificed
 
01:32:33.310 --> 01:32:33.320 align:start position:0%
to short-term corporate profit that's
 
01:32:35.510 --> 01:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
why the companies exist to make profit
 
01:32:39.109 --> 01:32:39.119 align:start position:0%
that's fine but it doesn't serve us well
 
01:32:41.149 --> 01:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
um as a public good of Interest
 
01:32:43.030 --> 01:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
basically for 60 years by the way
 
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
traditional Medicare has excelled in
 
01:32:49.310 --> 01:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
administrative efficiency and is enabled
 
01:32:51.629 --> 01:32:51.639 align:start position:0%
exemplary care actually by those Med
 
01:32:54.510 --> 01:32:54.520 align:start position:0%
metric for seniors and those with kidney
 
01:32:57.070 --> 01:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
failure and disabilities however even
 
01:32:58.590 --> 01:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
there a recent
 
01:33:00.870 --> 01:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
privatization with overly subsidized
 
01:33:02.709 --> 01:33:02.719 align:start position:0%
contracts to the poorly regulated
 
01:33:04.669 --> 01:33:04.679 align:start position:0%
intermediary Medicare Advantage
 
01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
megaliths now threatens the financial
 
01:33:10.350 --> 01:33:10.360 align:start position:0%
Integrity of Medicare the public dollars
 
01:33:13.229 --> 01:33:13.239 align:start position:0%
lost as mentioned to fraudulent upcoding
 
01:33:15.189 --> 01:33:15.199 align:start position:0%
denial and restriction of services and
 
01:33:17.550 --> 01:33:17.560 align:start position:0%
lucrative contract subsidies would be
 
01:33:20.189 --> 01:33:20.199 align:start position:0%
better spent improving traditional
 
01:33:22.990 --> 01:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
Medicare so in National Health Care and
 
01:33:25.390 --> 01:33:25.400 align:start position:0%
coverage system is really required to
 
01:33:27.109 --> 01:33:27.119 align:start position:0%
coordinate the availability of
 
01:33:29.629 --> 01:33:29.639 align:start position:0%
clinicians and eliminate the obvious
 
01:33:32.270 --> 01:33:32.280 align:start position:0%
pricing failure we're all seeing an
 
01:33:33.990 --> 01:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
extraordinary administrative waste of
 
01:33:35.390 --> 01:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
our healthc care
 
01:33:39.629 --> 01:33:39.639 align:start position:0%
Dollar by the way as a side note um
 
01:33:41.470 --> 01:33:41.480 align:start position:0%
funding by A Single Payer such as
 
01:33:44.470 --> 01:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
Medicare does not preclude prevent the
 
01:33:46.669 --> 01:33:46.679 align:start position:0%
involvement of intermediary
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
insurers that's common in many other
 
01:33:53.310 --> 01:33:53.320 align:start position:0%
countries um but what it does require is
 
01:33:55.310 --> 01:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
adequate regulation and
 
01:33:57.270 --> 01:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
standardization directed towards
 
01:33:59.149 --> 01:33:59.159 align:start position:0%
efficient Health Care rather than
 
01:34:01.109 --> 01:34:01.119 align:start position:0%
diversion towards
 
01:34:03.750 --> 01:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
profit for the first time since polling
 
01:34:05.430 --> 01:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
has been done by the way in the United
 
01:34:09.070 --> 01:34:09.080 align:start position:0%
States a majority of Americans now rate
 
01:34:12.510 --> 01:34:12.520 align:start position:0%
the quality of US Health Care as only
 
01:34:16.629 --> 01:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
fair or quote poor that's new in my
 
01:34:19.590 --> 01:34:19.600 align:start position:0%
lifetime um selecting health insurance
 
01:34:21.510 --> 01:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
as many of us know if you have health
 
01:34:24.510 --> 01:34:24.520 align:start position:0%
insurance is a hassle deductibles are
 
01:34:27.629 --> 01:34:27.639 align:start position:0%
absurd locating a primary care doctor is
 
01:34:30.189 --> 01:34:30.199 align:start position:0%
difficult if not impossible your medical
 
01:34:31.229 --> 01:34:31.239 align:start position:0%
care is
 
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
fragmented figuring out what medications
 
01:34:36.510 --> 01:34:36.520 align:start position:0%
are covered by your insurance is
 
01:34:38.950 --> 01:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
inscrutable for you as the patient and
 
01:34:42.629 --> 01:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
for me as the doctor that's not by
 
01:34:46.350 --> 01:34:46.360 align:start position:0%
accident we continue to lack guarantees
 
01:34:48.350 --> 01:34:48.360 align:start position:0%

65 no 62 well no 65 because no Medicare
 
01:36:29.510 --> 01:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
until you are 65 do you find it
 
01:36:32.109 --> 01:36:32.119 align:start position:0%
satisfactory having had Medicare I don't
 
01:36:35.109 --> 01:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
use it doesn't do anything your heal so
 
01:36:37.510 --> 01:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
your health is good my health well I've
 
01:36:39.550 --> 01:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
had 13 getting into a kind of
 
01:36:41.590 --> 01:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
a so I guess what I guess what I'm
 
01:36:44.310 --> 01:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
saying is you currently have what is the
 
01:36:47.149 --> 01:36:47.159 align:start position:0%
most favored form of health insurance in
 
01:36:51.910 --> 01:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
the United States if you look at hmos uh
 
01:36:54.669 --> 01:36:54.679 align:start position:0%
if you look at proprietary insurance
 
01:36:56.990 --> 01:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
that existed before hmos Travelers
 
01:37:00.270 --> 01:37:00.280 align:start position:0%
Metropolitan Health whatnot since the
 
01:37:03.550 --> 01:37:03.560 align:start position:0%
the the um end of Blue Cross Blue Shield
 
01:37:06.830 --> 01:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
which was nonprofit Community rated
 
01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:07.750 align:start position:0%
which was nonprofit Community rated
health

01:37:07.750 --> 01:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
health
 
01:37:09.709 --> 01:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
insurance the most popular health
 
01:37:12.510 --> 01:37:12.520 align:start position:0%
insurance has been consistently Medicare
 
01:37:15.229 --> 01:37:15.239 align:start position:0%
it has a three why is that it's not
 
01:37:15.239 --> 01:37:16.510 align:start position:0%
it has a three why is that it's not
socialized

01:37:16.510 --> 01:37:16.520 align:start position:0%
socialized
 
01:37:21.030 --> 01:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
medicine Medicare has a 3% overhead for
 
01:37:24.790 --> 01:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
it Administration by the way in 1965
 
01:37:26.870 --> 01:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
when it was started 19 million people
 
01:37:29.149 --> 01:37:29.159 align:start position:0%
were enrolled without computers in a
 
01:37:32.790 --> 01:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
year government can be efficient we've
 
01:37:34.870 --> 01:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
and it's been demonstrated in that
 
01:37:37.149 --> 01:37:37.159 align:start position:0%
particular form of single-payer namely
 
01:37:40.229 --> 01:37:40.239 align:start position:0%
Medicare it's now threatened by um
 
01:37:44.750 --> 01:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
propati and and over anyhow so so my
 
01:37:47.870 --> 01:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
question sir is who would be responsible
 
01:37:50.189 --> 01:37:50.199 align:start position:0%
for its Administration would it be
 
01:37:51.870 --> 01:37:51.880 align:start position:0%
medical professionals or somebody
 
01:37:53.790 --> 01:37:53.800 align:start position:0%
elected into office deciding well
 
01:37:55.470 --> 01:37:55.480 align:start position:0%
there's only going to be so much money
 
01:37:56.830 --> 01:37:56.840 align:start position:0%
given for this
 
01:37:58.830 --> 01:37:58.840 align:start position:0%
procedure so you're asking about who
 
01:38:00.669 --> 01:38:00.679 align:start position:0%
would be responsible for making
 
01:38:03.430 --> 01:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
decisions about what is covered thank
 
01:38:06.229 --> 01:38:06.239 align:start position:0%
you okay so so the administration would
 
01:38:07.990 --> 01:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
would be a government by the way this
 
01:38:12.390 --> 01:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't describe the details of what a
 
01:38:15.709 --> 01:38:15.719 align:start position:0%
universal uh accessible uh um Health
 
01:38:18.510 --> 01:38:18.520 align:start position:0%
System would look like um but as to who
 
01:38:21.229 --> 01:38:21.239 align:start position:0%
does the um uh decision it's your doctor
 
01:38:23.950 --> 01:38:23.960 align:start position:0%
doctor that's what Medicare Does
 
01:38:27.149 --> 01:38:27.159 align:start position:0%
Medicare will um
 
01:38:30.430 --> 01:38:30.440 align:start position:0%
essentially cover what CL more so than
 
01:38:32.750 --> 01:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
private insurance what your clinician
 
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
feels that you require that's the nature
 
01:38:37.350 --> 01:38:37.360 align:start position:0%
of Medicare it is not socialized
 
01:38:40.109 --> 01:38:40.119 align:start position:0%
medicine the hospitals are not owned by
 
01:38:42.629 --> 01:38:42.639 align:start position:0%
Medicare or a single-payer system
 
01:38:43.910 --> 01:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
they're not built by Medicare or
 
01:38:46.070 --> 01:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
single-payer system they're independent
 
01:38:48.350 --> 01:38:48.360 align:start position:0%
doctors are independent they make their
 
01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
medical decisions
 
01:38:53.149 --> 01:38:53.159 align:start position:0%
independently um um and again you have a
 
01:38:55.589 --> 01:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
supplement to pay for your Medicare Part
 
01:38:57.229 --> 01:38:57.239 align:start position:0%
D that's a different story in terms of
 
01:38:59.310 --> 01:38:59.320 align:start position:0%
drugs guess who's making the decisions
 
01:39:01.550 --> 01:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
about whose whose drugs are
 
01:39:03.870 --> 01:39:03.880 align:start position:0%
covered it's not the government it's
 
01:39:06.310 --> 01:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
your insurance company oh we don't pay
 
01:39:08.589 --> 01:39:08.599 align:start position:0%
for Jans for your diabetes sorry you
 
01:39:10.629 --> 01:39:10.639 align:start position:0%
have to do you have to jump through this
 
01:39:13.750 --> 01:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
hoop then that hoop then this hoop then
 
01:39:15.950 --> 01:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
maybe we'll pay for the EXP for the more
 
01:39:18.510 --> 01:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
pricey but more effective medication
 
01:39:20.109 --> 01:39:20.119 align:start position:0%
that's not the government that's doing
 
01:39:22.629 --> 01:39:22.639 align:start position:0%
that that's your health health
 
01:39:26.030 --> 01:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
insurance followup sir followup thank
 
01:39:27.669 --> 01:39:27.679 align:start position:0%
you thank you again for putting up with
 
01:39:30.189 --> 01:39:30.199 align:start position:0%
me no no not at all uh they're excellent
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
questions because uh
 
01:39:36.430 --> 01:39:36.440 align:start position:0%
okay I have a procedure done at
 
01:39:39.109 --> 01:39:39.119 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock they charge x amount
 
01:39:42.109 --> 01:39:42.119 align:start position:0%
of dollars okay it goes to Medicare and
 
01:39:44.629 --> 01:39:44.639 align:start position:0%
Medicare says no we're not going to pay
 
01:39:47.589 --> 01:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
that right we're going to pay instead of
 
01:39:52.910 --> 01:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh $2,000 we're going to pay $400 $50 MH
 
01:39:55.709 --> 01:39:55.719 align:start position:0%
so if I don't have insurance my regular
 
01:39:57.070 --> 01:39:57.080 align:start position:0%
insurance that I'm paying half my
 
01:39:57.080 --> 01:39:58.350 align:start position:0%
insurance that I'm paying half my
annuity

01:39:58.350 --> 01:39:58.360 align:start position:0%
annuity
 
01:40:00.510 --> 01:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
for I would have that would be out of
 
01:40:04.189 --> 01:40:04.199 align:start position:0%
pocket totally agree it's nuts and it's
 
01:40:05.910 --> 01:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
and unfort that's why people have
 
01:40:08.350 --> 01:40:08.360 align:start position:0%
GoFundMe um they go on in the internet
 
01:40:10.990 --> 01:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
because they they didn't have insurance
 
01:40:12.550 --> 01:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
because there's no Universal Insurance
 
01:40:14.390 --> 01:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
here unlike anywhere else on Earth in
 
01:40:16.870 --> 01:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
developed countries or you have
 
01:40:19.830 --> 01:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
insurance but it's out of network so you
 
01:40:21.950 --> 01:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
ended up with the only place in in the
 
01:40:24.510 --> 01:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
in the state can provide your care but
 
01:40:26.310 --> 01:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
oh well by the way your insurance
 
01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
company says you're out a
 
01:40:31.030 --> 01:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
network if you are an investor on Wall
 
01:40:34.310 --> 01:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
Street you're making big bucks who's
 
01:40:36.709 --> 01:40:36.719 align:start position:0%
making these decisions it's being made
 
01:40:40.189 --> 01:40:40.199 align:start position:0%
by uh not by folks who have interest in
 
01:40:43.229 --> 01:40:43.239 align:start position:0%
in health outcomes um and that's the
 
01:40:45.629 --> 01:40:45.639 align:start position:0%
difference between Single Payer programs
 
01:40:47.470 --> 01:40:47.480 align:start position:0%
that are devoted towards Health
 
01:40:50.189 --> 01:40:50.199 align:start position:0%
versus profit which is what a company
 
01:40:52.189 --> 01:40:52.199 align:start position:0%
that is in the business to make profits
 
01:40:55.310 --> 01:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
has to do thank you for that thank you
 
01:40:57.629 --> 01:40:57.639 align:start position:0%

question sh thank you so much for that
 
01:41:03.470 --> 01:41:03.480 align:start position:0%

Lynn
 
01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
Brown Lynn is here from lime she is the
 
01:41:10.910 --> 01:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
individual who asked for two minutes and

30 seconds we won't hold you to that Lyn
 
01:41:15.910 --> 01:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming to
 
01:41:18.430 --> 01:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
conquered uh thank you thank you Mr
 
01:41:20.990 --> 01:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
chairman and to all the members of the
 
01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
committee um I am speaking in support of
 
01:41:26.790 --> 01:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
um of of this
 
01:41:28.990 --> 01:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
resolution um I've never done this
 
01:41:31.510 --> 01:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
before so this is sort of exciting I
 
01:41:33.229 --> 01:41:33.239 align:start position:0%
have been a physician since
 
01:41:35.950 --> 01:41:35.960 align:start position:0%
1979 in New Hampshire I've worked at
 
01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
dmouth hitchcok Medical Center and at
 
01:41:40.669 --> 01:41:40.679 align:start position:0%
New London Hospital and I have been
 
01:41:43.950 --> 01:41:43.960 align:start position:0%
dismayed over my 40 plus years of um
 
01:41:47.550 --> 01:41:47.560 align:start position:0%
practice here on how increasingly
 
01:41:50.310 --> 01:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
dysfunctional this system has become
 
01:41:52.629 --> 01:41:52.639 align:start position:0%
patients with commercial and public
 
01:41:55.629 --> 01:41:55.639 align:start position:0%
Insurance struggle to pay for health
 
01:41:57.149 --> 01:41:57.159 align:start position:0%
care and especially those patients
 
01:41:59.709 --> 01:41:59.719 align:start position:0%
without health insurance high and ever
 
01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
increasing premiums High deductibles and
 
01:42:06.229 --> 01:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
co-pays all add up for everyone the cost
 
01:42:08.750 --> 01:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
of tests and medication are routinely
 
01:42:11.109 --> 01:42:11.119 align:start position:0%
things that I talk about with my
 
01:42:12.990 --> 01:42:13.000 align:start position:0%
patients in treating their
 
01:42:15.350 --> 01:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
arthritis I'm a rheumatologist and I
 
01:42:17.870 --> 01:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
have had the pleasure of seeing the
 
01:42:21.390 --> 01:42:21.400 align:start position:0%
treatment of arthritis evolve amazing ly
 
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
we have medicines that really can make
 
01:42:27.870 --> 01:42:27.880 align:start position:0%
people well lead normal lives stop
 
01:42:32.229 --> 01:42:32.239 align:start position:0%
having um joint Replacements Etc but uh
 
01:42:34.870 --> 01:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
insurance companies also dictate what
 
01:42:37.030 --> 01:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
drugs can be used they require
 
01:42:39.350 --> 01:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
pre-authorization forms which are all
 
01:42:42.070 --> 01:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
different which take time from me and my
 
01:42:44.910 --> 01:42:44.920 align:start position:0%
staff and frequently delay treatment for
 
01:42:47.550 --> 01:42:47.560 align:start position:0%
patients for weeks this
 
01:42:50.229 --> 01:42:50.239 align:start position:0%
pre-authorization is required every year
 
01:42:53.149 --> 01:42:53.159 align:start position:0%
or with the the change of insurance and
 
01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
may even result in people stopping a
 
01:42:57.149 --> 01:42:57.159 align:start position:0%
drug that's effective because it's no
 
01:42:58.870 --> 01:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
longer covered by the insurance that
 
01:43:02.189 --> 01:43:02.199 align:start position:0%
they now have um patients stay in jobs
 
01:43:04.070 --> 01:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
as you've heard specifically because
 
01:43:04.990 --> 01:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
they get
 
01:43:08.790 --> 01:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
insurance I have had patients who are
 
01:43:11.750 --> 01:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
very well off have insurance have
 
01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
Medicare have supplemental insurance
 
01:43:16.950 --> 01:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
have their insur their arthritis is not
 
01:43:18.510 --> 01:43:18.520 align:start position:0%
well controlled on the medications that
 
01:43:21.709 --> 01:43:21.719 align:start position:0%
they're currently using I've suggested
 
01:43:26.109 --> 01:43:26.119 align:start position:0%
that we change those add to it and my
 
01:43:29.629 --> 01:43:29.639 align:start position:0%
patient has um decided not to take those
 
01:43:32.750 --> 01:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
medications because even with Medicare
 
01:43:35.310 --> 01:43:35.320 align:start position:0%
co- Insurance it this is going to cost
 
01:43:38.149 --> 01:43:38.159 align:start position:0%
her more than $2,000 a month this
 
01:43:40.990 --> 01:43:41.000 align:start position:0%
shouldn't happen in our great country
 
01:43:42.750 --> 01:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
there's lots of money as you've heard in
 
01:43:45.030 --> 01:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
the system but it's siphoned off to
 
01:43:48.149 --> 01:43:48.159 align:start position:0%
profits and administrative overhead so
 
01:43:51.229 --> 01:43:51.239 align:start position:0%
often so we need a new F system at the
 
01:43:53.830 --> 01:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
federal level because all states are
 
01:43:57.149 --> 01:43:57.159 align:start position:0%
small so I'm asking you to empower our
 
01:43:59.830 --> 01:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
state representatives and Senators to
 
01:44:02.070 --> 01:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
support this resolution for national
 
01:44:03.910 --> 01:44:03.920 align:start position:0%
health coverage for all Americans
 
01:44:07.350 --> 01:44:07.360 align:start position:0%

um good morning to you and to your other
 
01:44:53.629 --> 01:44:53.639 align:start position:0%

01:44:56.669 --> 01:44:56.679 align:start position:0%
today um I have practiced medicine for
 
01:44:56.679 --> 01:44:59.550 align:start position:0%
today um I have practiced medicine for
49

01:44:59.550 --> 01:44:59.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:02.830 --> 01:45:02.840 align:start position:0%
years I practiced at Dartmouth Hitchcock
 
01:45:05.430 --> 01:45:05.440 align:start position:0%
for a number of years and retired from
 
01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:06.149 align:start position:0%
for a number of years and retired from
that

01:45:06.149 --> 01:45:06.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:45:09.589 --> 01:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
institution 10 years
 
01:45:12.790 --> 01:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
ago during the years I've been in
 
01:45:15.669 --> 01:45:15.679 align:start position:0%
practice there have been countless
 
01:45:18.870 --> 01:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
occasions when I've had patients who
 
01:45:21.510 --> 01:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
have suffered greatly because of the
 
01:45:25.030 --> 01:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
lack of affordable accessible Health
 
01:45:27.550 --> 01:45:27.560 align:start position:0%
Care I've listened to their
 
01:45:30.550 --> 01:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
concerns about the cost of medical care
 
01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
for themselves and their loved
 
01:45:37.270 --> 01:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
ones millions of Americans now are
 
01:45:39.990 --> 01:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
either uninsured or
 
01:45:42.510 --> 01:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
underinsured imagine what it would be
 
01:45:45.550 --> 01:45:45.560 align:start position:0%
like to be in such a situation without
 
01:45:48.390 --> 01:45:48.400 align:start position:0%
access to health care because of being
 
01:45:51.550 --> 01:45:51.560 align:start position:0%
able unable to afford the insurance
 
01:45:53.790 --> 01:45:53.800 align:start position:0%
premiums and the high
 
01:45:56.390 --> 01:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
deductibles sadly those who lack
 
01:45:59.109 --> 01:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
coverage often are faced with exorbitant
 
01:46:02.109 --> 01:46:02.119 align:start position:0%
bills for their care and many will have
 
01:46:05.189 --> 01:46:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:08.030 --> 01:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy my focus includes those
 
01:46:12.310 --> 01:46:12.320 align:start position:0%
patients but also those who do have
 
01:46:14.910 --> 01:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
insurance I have often seen that even
 
01:46:17.350 --> 01:46:17.360 align:start position:0%
patients who have insurance can suffer
 
01:46:19.589 --> 01:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
because of the current health insurance
 
01:46:22.510 --> 01:46:22.520 align:start position:0%
system which is a profit-based
 
01:46:25.550 --> 01:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
system which pits the need for medically
 
01:46:27.589 --> 01:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
necessary treatment against the
 
01:46:30.189 --> 01:46:30.199 align:start position:0%
insurance company's bottom line this
 
01:46:33.709 --> 01:46:33.719 align:start position:0%
happens all too often I'd like to share
 
01:46:35.830 --> 01:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
with you a case in
 
01:46:37.950 --> 01:46:37.960 align:start position:0%
point I had a
 
01:46:40.669 --> 01:46:40.679 align:start position:0%
patient a woman in her
 
01:46:42.830 --> 01:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
50s with
 
01:46:46.990 --> 01:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
insurance who had an imuno deficiency
 
01:46:51.149 --> 01:46:51.159 align:start position:0%
syndrome and this meant that she lacked
 
01:46:54.790 --> 01:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
the um imunoglobulin which are proteins
 
01:46:58.550 --> 01:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
made by the immune system which protect
 
01:46:58.560 --> 01:46:59.870 align:start position:0%
made by the immune system which protect
us

01:46:59.870 --> 01:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:47:02.350 --> 01:47:02.360 align:start position:0%
from serious
 
01:47:05.830 --> 01:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
infections well this woman lacked those
 
01:47:08.229 --> 01:47:08.239 align:start position:0%
and therefore she needed to receive
 
01:47:11.669 --> 01:47:11.679 align:start position:0%
intravenous infusions of imunoglobulin
 
01:47:15.750 --> 01:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
on a monthly basis so that she would not
 
01:47:18.229 --> 01:47:18.239 align:start position:0%
have recurrent episodes of severe
 
01:47:20.910 --> 01:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
life-threatening infection which would
 
01:47:22.390 --> 01:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
lead to
 
01:47:26.589 --> 01:47:26.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:30.709 --> 01:47:30.719 align:start position:0%
death when I saw this
 
01:47:33.990 --> 01:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
patient I ordered immune globuline
 
01:47:35.910 --> 01:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
infusions for
 
01:47:39.390 --> 01:47:39.400 align:start position:0%
her our insurance company denied the
 
01:47:42.430 --> 01:47:42.440 align:start position:0%
infusions they would not pay for
 
01:47:45.189 --> 01:47:45.199 align:start position:0%
them I made many phone calls to the
 
01:47:48.870 --> 01:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
insurance company about this issue I
 
01:47:51.229 --> 01:47:51.239 align:start position:0%
wrote letters
 
01:47:53.109 --> 01:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
and I even talked to the medical
 
01:47:56.430 --> 01:47:56.440 align:start position:0%
director of the insurance
 
01:48:00.830 --> 01:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:04.390 --> 01:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
avail finally a colleague of mine who
 
01:48:05.629 --> 01:48:05.639 align:start position:0%
had seen the
 
01:48:10.790 --> 01:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
patient in the past as well joined me in
 
01:48:14.510 --> 01:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
writing a strongly worded letter to the
 
01:48:17.350 --> 01:48:17.360 align:start position:0%
insurance company stating that if this
 
01:48:20.950 --> 01:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
patient died as a result of denial of
 
01:48:26.870 --> 01:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:30.470 --> 01:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility only after this did the
 
01:48:34.470 --> 01:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
insurance company agree to approve the
 
01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
essential treatment for this
 
01:48:40.910 --> 01:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
patient this is just one example in
 
01:48:43.070 --> 01:48:43.080 align:start position:0%
which the physician's responsibility for
 
01:48:46.109 --> 01:48:46.119 align:start position:0%
the patient's Medical Care is balanced
 
01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
against the insurance company's bottom
 
01:48:51.430 --> 01:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
line as
 
01:48:55.229 --> 01:48:55.239 align:start position:0%
legislators you have the opportunity to
 
01:48:57.390 --> 01:48:57.400 align:start position:0%

01:49:00.669 --> 01:49:00.679 align:start position:0%
difference for the people of New
 
01:49:04.870 --> 01:49:04.880 align:start position:0%

01:49:41.790 --> 01:49:41.800 align:start position:0%
questions seeing on thanks
 
01:49:47.270 --> 01:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
again we'll now move on to uh Julie
 
01:49:57.870 --> 01:49:57.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:00.510 --> 01:50:00.520 align:start position:0%
welcome good morning chairman Moffett
 
01:50:03.149 --> 01:50:03.159 align:start position:0%
Vice chair rolands committee members
 
01:50:05.629 --> 01:50:05.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to share
 
01:50:08.629 --> 01:50:08.639 align:start position:0%
input on this very important issue I'm
 
01:50:10.790 --> 01:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
here today on behalf of my daughter and
 
01:50:13.189 --> 01:50:13.199 align:start position:0%
every child who is relying on us to
 
01:50:15.750 --> 01:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
provide a safer healthier
 
01:50:18.669 --> 01:50:18.679 align:start position:0%
World there are many explanations as to
 
01:50:20.870 --> 01:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
why a universal health fund Health Care
 
01:50:23.830 --> 01:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
Program won't work the American Bar
 
01:50:26.070 --> 01:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
Association reported that we have a
 
01:50:29.270 --> 01:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
100-year history of failed attempts to
 
01:50:32.270 --> 01:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
deliver Universal Health Coverage to
 
01:50:35.430 --> 01:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
Americans it is daunting at best and
 
01:50:38.430 --> 01:50:38.440 align:start position:0%
more than challenging work it calls for
 
01:50:40.750 --> 01:50:40.760 align:start position:0%
large system disruption it calls for
 
01:50:43.069 --> 01:50:43.079 align:start position:0%
breaking down silos and creating
 
01:50:45.830 --> 01:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
collaboration between competing
 
01:50:49.069 --> 01:50:49.079 align:start position:0%
groups and I know we're smart enough to
 
01:50:51.390 --> 01:50:51.400 align:start position:0%
do the work we just have to care about
 
01:50:53.030 --> 01:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
the same
 
01:50:55.589 --> 01:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
things many of the cons to Universal
 
01:50:58.790 --> 01:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
healthc care are fear-based it's too
 
01:51:01.510 --> 01:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
expensive it will never work it's never
 
01:51:01.520 --> 01:51:02.430 align:start position:0%
expensive it will never work it's never
worked

01:51:02.430 --> 01:51:02.440 align:start position:0%
worked
 
01:51:05.030 --> 01:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
before there will always be a story of a
 
01:51:08.109 --> 01:51:08.119 align:start position:0%
failure used as a shiny example of why
 
01:51:10.550 --> 01:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
Universal Health Care doesn't
 
01:51:13.830 --> 01:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
work but then I'm REM then I'm reminded
 
01:51:15.550 --> 01:51:15.560 align:start position:0%
of what leadership
 
01:51:18.270 --> 01:51:18.280 align:start position:0%
is leaders don't go to the table with
 
01:51:20.669 --> 01:51:20.679 align:start position:0%
what doesn't work they go to the table
 
01:51:20.679 --> 01:51:21.510 align:start position:0%
what doesn't work they go to the table
with

01:51:21.510 --> 01:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:51:23.669 --> 01:51:23.679 align:start position:0%
Solutions with an entrepreneurial
 
01:51:26.790 --> 01:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
mindset they focus on what's possible
 
01:51:28.990 --> 01:51:29.000 align:start position:0%
they innovate they challenge the status
 
01:51:33.270 --> 01:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
quo they don't let fear sty
 
01:51:36.390 --> 01:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
progress when we hear people debating
 
01:51:37.990 --> 01:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
why what the other side of the aisle
 
01:51:41.470 --> 01:51:41.480 align:start position:0%
wants won't work we often hear
 
01:51:44.030 --> 01:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
anger yet emotional intelligence
 
01:51:47.390 --> 01:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
research tells us that anger is almost
 
01:51:50.589 --> 01:51:50.599 align:start position:0%
always a byproduct of fear
 
01:51:52.910 --> 01:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
when we hear someone getting upset about
 
01:51:56.550 --> 01:51:56.560 align:start position:0%
change we know they are experiencing
 
01:51:59.750 --> 01:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
fear the good news is we can manage our
 
01:52:02.589 --> 01:52:02.599 align:start position:0%
fears we can replace them with Hope by
 
01:52:05.109 --> 01:52:05.119 align:start position:0%
focusing on a common goal a common
 
01:52:08.510 --> 01:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
purpose to unit us a federally funded
 
01:52:10.669 --> 01:52:10.679 align:start position:0%
Universal healthc Care Program provides
 
01:52:13.589 --> 01:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
a common goal we are here to make the
 
01:52:15.750 --> 01:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
world a better place for the generations
 
01:52:19.149 --> 01:52:19.159 align:start position:0%
that come after US Safety and Security
 
01:52:21.030 --> 01:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
comes from the knowled that healthc care
 
01:52:24.750 --> 01:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
is accessible affordable and includes
 
01:52:26.109 --> 01:52:26.119 align:start position:0%
the whole
 
01:52:30.229 --> 01:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
person census census.gov reported that
 
01:52:34.229 --> 01:52:34.239 align:start position:0%
in 2021 3.9 million children didn't have
 
01:52:37.550 --> 01:52:37.560 align:start position:0%
health insurance that is an egregious
 
01:52:39.830 --> 01:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
failing and it's still not the full
 
01:52:42.589 --> 01:52:42.599 align:start position:0%
picture I'd like to share a very quick
 
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
story of my family's Journey since
 
01:52:48.109 --> 01:52:48.119 align:start position:0%
adopting our daughter in 2022 to
 
01:52:49.830 --> 01:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
highlight that even with private
 
01:52:52.149 --> 01:52:52.159 align:start position:0%
Insurance we're failing because our
 
01:52:54.149 --> 01:52:54.159 align:start position:0%
Medical Systems divide mental and
 
01:52:56.669 --> 01:52:56.679 align:start position:0%
physical health care a divide that
 
01:52:58.830 --> 01:52:58.840 align:start position:0%
desperately needs to be
 
01:53:01.510 --> 01:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
addressed we adopted a beautiful bright
 
01:53:04.109 --> 01:53:04.119 align:start position:0%
intelligent funny 8-year-old and within
 
01:53:06.069 --> 01:53:06.079 align:start position:0%
a short time realized that her mental
 
01:53:08.709 --> 01:53:08.719 align:start position:0%
health needs were
 
01:53:11.229 --> 01:53:11.239 align:start position:0%
extraordinary as was her past
 
01:53:13.990 --> 01:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
trauma despite having private insurance
 
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
and Medicaid because she was in the
 
01:53:18.270 --> 01:53:18.280 align:start position:0%
foster care system her mental health
 
01:53:20.350 --> 01:53:20.360 align:start position:0%
needs were not met in New
 
01:53:22.709 --> 01:53:22.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we ultimately enrolled her in
 
01:53:25.589 --> 01:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
a program in Missouri that helps adopted
 
01:53:27.790 --> 01:53:27.800 align:start position:0%
children learn how to attach to and
 
01:53:31.350 --> 01:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
Trust grown-ups we've paid over
 
01:53:33.790 --> 01:53:33.800 align:start position:0%
$180,000 and the state of New Hampshire
 
01:53:37.189 --> 01:53:37.199 align:start position:0%
is now covering her costs of
 
01:53:39.669 --> 01:53:39.679 align:start position:0%
care while I'm grateful she's getting
 
01:53:42.510 --> 01:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
support it is not a small thing that
 
01:53:44.709 --> 01:53:44.719 align:start position:0%
instead of enjoying third grade she
 
01:53:48.149 --> 01:53:48.159 align:start position:0%
spent weeks on end in emergency
 
01:53:50.629 --> 01:53:50.639 align:start position:0%
departments three different extended
 
01:53:53.189 --> 01:53:53.199 align:start position:0%
emergency department stays waiting for
 
01:53:53.199 --> 01:53:55.229 align:start position:0%
emergency department stays waiting for
stabilization

01:53:55.229 --> 01:53:55.239 align:start position:0%
stabilization
 
01:53:57.149 --> 01:53:57.159 align:start position:0%
hospitals between her first two
 
01:53:58.910 --> 01:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
emergency department stage she went to
 
01:54:01.510 --> 01:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
Hamstead Hospital the only Psychiatric
 
01:54:04.149 --> 01:54:04.159 align:start position:0%
Hospital in the state for children and
 
01:54:06.510 --> 01:54:06.520 align:start position:0%
what we saw there broke our
 
01:54:09.510 --> 01:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
hearts after 10 days we brought her home
 
01:54:11.709 --> 01:54:11.719 align:start position:0%
because we were told she wasn't
 
01:54:14.870 --> 01:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
safe they were overrun with need and are
 
01:54:17.350 --> 01:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
grossly underresourced
 
01:54:20.589 --> 01:54:20.599 align:start position:0%
my daughter deserved better
 
01:54:23.750 --> 01:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
she deserved safe home as an infant and
 
01:54:27.470 --> 01:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:29.950 --> 01:54:29.960 align:start position:0%
child and she deserves a Health Care
 
01:54:32.229 --> 01:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
system that is equipped to meet the
 
01:54:34.629 --> 01:54:34.639 align:start position:0%
needs of children in
 
01:54:37.229 --> 01:54:37.239 align:start position:0%
crisis a universal healthc CARE program
 
01:54:39.470 --> 01:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
that includes mental and physical health
 
01:54:41.830 --> 01:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
under the same system can create
 
01:54:44.550 --> 01:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
synergies of collaboration that can make
 
01:54:47.430 --> 01:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
a real difference for the most
 
01:54:49.950 --> 01:54:49.960 align:start position:0%
vulnerable we have to do better and I
 
01:54:52.189 --> 01:54:52.199 align:start position:0%
believe that you can make a real
 
01:54:54.750 --> 01:54:54.760 align:start position:0%
difference if we use the right language
 
01:54:57.390 --> 01:54:57.400 align:start position:0%
people will listen if we rally behind a
 
01:54:59.390 --> 01:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
common goal of protecting families and
 
01:55:02.470 --> 01:55:02.480 align:start position:0%
children we can find what unites us and
 
01:55:05.350 --> 01:55:05.360 align:start position:0%
we can disrupt systems for the
 
01:55:07.830 --> 01:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
better please stand in support of a
 
01:55:10.430 --> 01:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
federal Universal Health Care program
 
01:55:12.669 --> 01:55:12.679 align:start position:0%
that couples mental and physical health
 
01:55:13.990 --> 01:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
under one
 
01:55:16.910 --> 01:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
system the work is worth it our
 
01:55:19.750 --> 01:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
communities our families our children
 
01:55:23.229 --> 01:55:23.239 align:start position:0%

01:57:00.149 --> 01:57:00.159 align:start position:0%
I consider myself very lucky to be

sitting here talking before you today I
 
01:57:04.430 --> 01:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
considered myself to be a pretty lucky
 
01:57:06.550 --> 01:57:06.560 align:start position:0%
person in general I grew up in a good
 
01:57:08.669 --> 01:57:08.679 align:start position:0%
area house had some issues but we were
 
01:57:10.629 --> 01:57:10.639 align:start position:0%
able to stay out of trouble for the most
 
01:57:13.669 --> 01:57:13.679 align:start position:0%
part uh when I was 18 I joined the
 
01:57:15.750 --> 01:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
Marines and I served Faithfully for five
 
01:57:18.270 --> 01:57:18.280 align:start position:0%
years Ura
 
01:57:21.470 --> 01:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:24.830 --> 01:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
in 2018 I got out and my luck started to
 
01:57:27.870 --> 01:57:27.880 align:start position:0%
run out a little bit I was in between TR
 
01:57:31.270 --> 01:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
care and Care at the VA and the mission
 
01:57:34.709 --> 01:57:34.719 align:start position:0%
act hadn't started yet I got in a
 
01:57:36.950 --> 01:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
vehicle or not vehicle excuse me a a
 
01:57:39.149 --> 01:57:39.159 align:start position:0%
motor accident the damage kept me out of
 
01:57:42.149 --> 01:57:42.159 align:start position:0%
work for several months your visit alone
 
01:57:44.629 --> 01:57:44.639 align:start position:0%
was about 9
 
01:57:47.109 --> 01:57:47.119 align:start position:0%
Grand uh but I thought it was nothing I
 
01:57:50.109 --> 01:57:50.119 align:start position:0%
couldn't handle uh I was able to get an
 
01:57:52.229 --> 01:57:52.239 align:start position:0%
optometry appointment during my finals
 
01:57:54.750 --> 01:57:54.760 align:start position:0%
week my first semester back at College
 
01:57:56.870 --> 01:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh and it was there that I had found it
 
01:57:59.229 --> 01:57:59.239 align:start position:0%
was found that I had a massive retinal
 
01:58:01.709 --> 01:58:01.719 align:start position:0%
tear that was at risk for total
 
01:58:04.189 --> 01:58:04.199 align:start position:0%
Detachment uh turns out this condition
 
01:58:05.990 --> 01:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
is secondary to something I was born
 
01:58:09.470 --> 01:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
with a condition that is not rare um and
 
01:58:11.870 --> 01:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
that makes it more likely uh this was
 
01:58:14.430 --> 01:58:14.440 align:start position:0%
the first time in my life that I felt
 
01:58:17.589 --> 01:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
the real fear of
 
01:58:20.510 --> 01:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy I consider myself be unlucky
 
01:58:23.910 --> 01:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
the VA covered the surgery and the
 
01:58:25.229 --> 01:58:25.239 align:start position:0%
soonest day that they could do it was
 
01:58:28.350 --> 01:58:28.360 align:start position:0%
Christmas Eve uh Christmas Day I woke up
 
01:58:31.310 --> 01:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
from the surgery my eye was covered and
 
01:58:33.870 --> 01:58:33.880 align:start position:0%
I had the real thought I wonder if this
 
01:58:35.149 --> 01:58:35.159 align:start position:0%
eye will be blind for the rest of my
 
01:58:37.069 --> 01:58:37.079 align:start position:0%
life I wonder if it'll happen to the
 
01:58:39.229 --> 01:58:39.239 align:start position:0%
other eye too will my joints
 
01:58:42.270 --> 01:58:42.280 align:start position:0%
recover I lay in the bed crippled
 
01:58:44.790 --> 01:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
physically and emotionally by the fear
 
01:58:47.430 --> 01:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
of economic
 
01:58:50.030 --> 01:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
dread luckily again
 
01:58:54.350 --> 01:58:54.360 align:start position:0%
I continue with PT OT and Continued
 
01:58:57.990 --> 01:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
Care and I make a pretty substantial
 
01:59:01.310 --> 01:59:01.320 align:start position:0%
recovery here today um I went on to
 
01:59:05.109 --> 01:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
become an EMT and then in EKG tech I
 
01:59:08.350 --> 01:59:08.360 align:start position:0%
worked as both uh during the pandemic in
 
01:59:11.030 --> 01:59:11.040 align:start position:0%

those
 
01:59:23.270 --> 01:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
months these people didn't work less
 
01:59:25.189 --> 01:59:25.199 align:start position:0%
than me they didn't want to live less
 
01:59:27.030 --> 01:59:27.040 align:start position:0%
than me they didn't love their family
 
01:59:30.430 --> 01:59:30.440 align:start position:0%
less than me they left them all the same
 
01:59:32.390 --> 01:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
and they left them with hundreds and
 
01:59:37.669 --> 01:59:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:40.910 --> 01:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
debt I considered myself lucky the prior
 
01:59:42.390 --> 01:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
Health complications that I am burdened
 
01:59:45.229 --> 01:59:45.239 align:start position:0%
with have not taken my life however like
 
01:59:47.390 --> 01:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
many of you I'm predisposed to
 
01:59:49.350 --> 01:59:49.360 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's so we'll see where that that
 
01:59:50.910 --> 01:59:50.920 align:start position:0%
takes us in a few
 
01:59:53.149 --> 01:59:53.159 align:start position:0%
years a good chunk of those that were
 
01:59:56.109 --> 01:59:56.119 align:start position:0%
lost in 2020 and outside of those years
 
01:59:59.270 --> 01:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
have had comorbidities sure but with my
 
02:00:01.229 --> 02:00:01.239 align:start position:0%
mechanic background I can tell you it's
 
02:00:05.030 --> 02:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
cheaper at every level to put in the
 
02:00:06.270 --> 02:00:06.280 align:start position:0%
preventative maintenance before an
 
02:00:09.430 --> 02:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
endstage condition is found it's more
 
02:00:11.510 --> 02:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
effective to treat these conditions
 
02:00:13.270 --> 02:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
before they
 
02:00:15.510 --> 02:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
progress as many of them can't be cured
 
02:00:17.109 --> 02:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
past a certain
 
02:00:19.870 --> 02:00:19.880 align:start position:0%
point and I'll make the argument that
 
02:00:22.990 --> 02:00:23.000 align:start position:0%
it's just nicer to love one's neighbor
 
02:00:25.270 --> 02:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
and care for them before they're sick
 
02:00:27.910 --> 02:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
before they're transformed by these
 
02:00:30.069 --> 02:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
illnesses for these reasons I consider
 
02:00:33.589 --> 02:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
myself lucky to be able to support hr23
 
02:00:37.510 --> 02:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:40.870 --> 02:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
too thank you for that uh again sharing
 
02:00:44.470 --> 02:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:47.069 --> 02:00:47.079 align:start position:0%
questions CA thank you so much for
 
02:00:50.629 --> 02:00:50.639 align:start position:0%
coming over here thank you
 
02:00:52.870 --> 02:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
okay we are looking at uh three more
 
02:00:59.109 --> 02:00:59.119 align:start position:0%
cards here um also from Lebanon Alec
 
02:01:01.709 --> 02:01:01.719 align:start position:0%
colado you can correct my pronunciation
 
02:01:09.510 --> 02:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:14.109 --> 02:01:14.119 align:start position:0%
would um so it's colado um and firstly
 
02:01:15.990 --> 02:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
of course I'd like to thank uh you Mr
 
02:01:18.229 --> 02:01:18.239 align:start position:0%
chairman and the rest of the
 
02:01:20.950 --> 02:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
distinguished Representatives uh for the
 
02:01:23.510 --> 02:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak uh on this matter
 
02:01:25.790 --> 02:01:25.800 align:start position:0%
that I think is really of of utmost
 
02:01:30.589 --> 02:01:30.599 align:start position:0%
importance um when I first dawned my
 
02:01:32.750 --> 02:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
white coat as a medical student at
 
02:01:36.589 --> 02:01:36.599 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth I accepted for myself a
 
02:01:40.669 --> 02:01:40.679 align:start position:0%
lifelong Duty uh to care for
 
02:01:43.550 --> 02:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
people very often to care for people
 
02:01:45.189 --> 02:01:45.199 align:start position:0%
that they're most
 
02:01:48.229 --> 02:01:48.239 align:start position:0%
vulnerable um and I consider that an
 
02:01:50.709 --> 02:01:50.719 align:start position:0%
enormous uh privilege and I consider
 
02:01:55.109 --> 02:01:55.119 align:start position:0%
myself very fortunate to uh be in a
 
02:01:57.229 --> 02:01:57.239 align:start position:0%
position to
 
02:02:00.149 --> 02:02:00.159 align:start position:0%
uh take on that
 
02:02:03.430 --> 02:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
responsibility but currently the Health
 
02:02:05.669 --> 02:02:05.679 align:start position:0%
Care system in the United States is
 
02:02:08.149 --> 02:02:08.159 align:start position:0%
standing in my
 
02:02:10.870 --> 02:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
way the priority is
 
02:02:13.910 --> 02:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
profit fortunately patients sometimes
 
02:02:15.390 --> 02:02:15.400 align:start position:0%
receive the care that they
 
02:02:18.350 --> 02:02:18.360 align:start position:0%
need I used to volunteer as a medical
 
02:02:21.470 --> 02:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
interpreter at a free clinic which by
 
02:02:21.480 --> 02:02:22.229 align:start position:0%
interpreter at a free clinic which by
the

02:02:22.229 --> 02:02:22.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:02:25.589 --> 02:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
way I I think it's a little ridiculous
 
02:02:27.310 --> 02:02:27.320 align:start position:0%
that free clinics exist in the United
 
02:02:30.550 --> 02:02:30.560 align:start position:0%
States um but there I saw plenty of
 
02:02:33.550 --> 02:02:33.560 align:start position:0%
low-income diabetic patients uh suffer
 
02:02:36.430 --> 02:02:36.440 align:start position:0%
the long-term negative effects of being
 
02:02:39.910 --> 02:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
unable to reliably afford
 
02:02:42.310 --> 02:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
insulin I also met patients who hadn't
 
02:02:46.390 --> 02:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
seen a doctor who had foregone necessary
 
02:02:49.750 --> 02:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
screening uh in years because of
 
02:02:53.030 --> 02:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
concerns regarding payment of course
 
02:02:55.470 --> 02:02:55.480 align:start position:0%
these are not reare occurrences one in
 
02:02:57.709 --> 02:02:57.719 align:start position:0%
five Americans had a prescription go
 
02:03:01.310 --> 02:03:01.320 align:start position:0%
unfilled due to cost in this last year
 
02:03:04.430 --> 02:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
2023 in the same year 8.7% of Americans
 
02:03:06.950 --> 02:03:06.960 align:start position:0%
reported not seeing a doctor likewise
 
02:03:10.629 --> 02:03:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:12.950 --> 02:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
concerns if we look at racial and ethnic
 
02:03:15.550 --> 02:03:15.560 align:start position:0%
minorities separately those percentages
 
02:03:17.870 --> 02:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
balloon into the mid
 
02:03:17.880 --> 02:03:20.830 align:start position:0%
balloon into the mid
teens

02:03:20.830 --> 02:03:20.840 align:start position:0%
teens
 
02:03:20.840 --> 02:03:22.350 align:start position:0%
teens
don't

02:03:22.350 --> 02:03:22.360 align:start position:0%
don't
 
02:03:24.270 --> 02:03:24.280 align:start position:0%
worry I'm going to take the best
 
02:03:25.629 --> 02:03:25.639 align:start position:0%
possible care of
 
02:03:27.950 --> 02:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
you I would like to utter those words to
 
02:03:30.109 --> 02:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
my future patients without
 
02:03:32.149 --> 02:03:32.159 align:start position:0%
hesitation but the only way that I'd be
 
02:03:35.870 --> 02:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
able to offer the best care to my
 
02:03:38.709 --> 02:03:38.719 align:start position:0%
patients all of my patients is if
 
02:03:42.430 --> 02:03:42.440 align:start position:0%
they're covered sufficiently and
 
02:03:44.229 --> 02:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
equitably as it
 
02:03:47.790 --> 02:03:47.800 align:start position:0%
stands 88.3% of Americans are uninsured
 
02:03:50.390 --> 02:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
nearly double if between the ages of 19
 
02:03:53.109 --> 02:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
and 25 and triple if they're Hispanic
 
02:03:55.310 --> 02:03:55.320 align:start position:0%
with other minority groups also covered
 
02:03:58.189 --> 02:03:58.199 align:start position:0%
at lower rates than the
 
02:04:00.510 --> 02:04:00.520 align:start position:0%
average at this
 
02:04:02.910 --> 02:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
juncture we have the power to bring us
 
02:04:05.830 --> 02:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
closer to a future where all Americans
 
02:04:07.589 --> 02:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
can receive the medical care that they
 
02:04:10.310 --> 02:04:10.320 align:start position:0%
both need and I believe
 
02:04:12.510 --> 02:04:12.520 align:start position:0%
deserve and so for that reason I urge
 
02:04:14.709 --> 02:04:14.719 align:start position:0%
you to vote in favor of
 
02:04:17.870 --> 02:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
hr23 and although this issue can only be
 
02:04:21.069 --> 02:04:21.079 align:start position:0%
corrected at the national scale My Hope
 
02:04:22.910 --> 02:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
Is that New Hampshire's voice will be
 
02:04:26.229 --> 02:04:26.239 align:start position:0%
used to create positive change not only
 
02:04:27.990 --> 02:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
for the citizens of the State of New
 
02:04:29.870 --> 02:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but also the citizens of the
 
02:04:31.549 --> 02:04:31.559 align:start position:0%
United States at
 
02:04:34.189 --> 02:04:34.199 align:start position:0%
large uh so thank you once again for
 
02:04:36.750 --> 02:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
your time and for the platform and I'd
 
02:04:39.350 --> 02:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any
 
02:04:41.790 --> 02:04:41.800 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Alec I'm G to ask
 
02:04:43.470 --> 02:04:43.480 align:start position:0%
I'm gon to throw something out that I
 
02:04:45.990 --> 02:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
maybe could have done or should have
 
02:04:49.669 --> 02:04:49.679 align:start position:0%
done to some of your PR preceding um I
 
02:04:52.629 --> 02:04:52.639 align:start position:0%
don't want to call them Witnesses
 
02:04:56.589 --> 02:04:56.599 align:start position:0%
uh I'm sorry presenters uh Judge Lynn
 
02:04:59.430 --> 02:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
who chairs Judiciary was watching it his
 
02:05:01.950 --> 02:05:01.960 align:start position:0%
uh on YouTube I was watching some of his
 
02:05:03.589 --> 02:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
he refers to the people as Witnesses but
 
02:05:07.990 --> 02:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
he's a judge uh presenters yes it's um
 
02:05:12.149 --> 02:05:12.159 align:start position:0%
typically when we have measures um we
 
02:05:14.950 --> 02:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
have people from both sides or you know
 
02:05:19.470 --> 02:05:19.480 align:start position:0%
Pro or con um and as I mentioned before
 
02:05:21.510 --> 02:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
every single pink card that I have every
 
02:05:24.310 --> 02:05:24.320 align:start position:0%
person here today speaking in favor of
 
02:05:26.549 --> 02:05:26.559 align:start position:0%
the uh the
 
02:05:30.229 --> 02:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
resolution um which is just fine um but
 
02:05:33.470 --> 02:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
I I find myself uh very sympathetic to
 
02:05:35.510 --> 02:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
everything I'm here of course and
 
02:05:36.790 --> 02:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate people
 
02:05:40.870 --> 02:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
personalizing but um I wish that like in
 
02:05:42.870 --> 02:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
as is usually the case there is at least
 
02:05:46.470 --> 02:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
one or two or or some folks who would uh
 
02:05:49.189 --> 02:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
flag some of the what they see is
 
02:05:50.910 --> 02:05:50.920 align:start position:0%
problems the resolution I'm not a health
 
02:05:50.920 --> 02:05:51.709 align:start position:0%
problems the resolution I'm not a health
care

02:05:51.709 --> 02:05:51.719 align:start position:0%
care
 
02:05:54.629 --> 02:05:54.639 align:start position:0%
expert um although I'm in Health Care
 
02:05:58.589 --> 02:05:58.599 align:start position:0%
Systems as all of most of us are I've
 
02:06:01.470 --> 02:06:01.480 align:start position:0%
spouse and a lot of people my family are
 
02:06:02.709 --> 02:06:02.719 align:start position:0%
nurses and
 
02:06:05.189 --> 02:06:05.199 align:start position:0%
whatever um but let me ask you this and
 
02:06:08.149 --> 02:06:08.159 align:start position:0%
and I'll ask the same thing of the the
 
02:06:11.069 --> 02:06:11.079 align:start position:0%
the last couple folks
 
02:06:15.109 --> 02:06:15.119 align:start position:0%
um what what is a drawback with this
 
02:06:17.189 --> 02:06:17.199 align:start position:0%
resolution we're hearing that it's good
 
02:06:19.470 --> 02:06:19.480 align:start position:0%
and and there's no one here to to flag
 
02:06:22.589 --> 02:06:22.599 align:start position:0%
any pieces of it that we that we should
 
02:06:25.990 --> 02:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh also be thinking about so I'm asking
 
02:06:27.750 --> 02:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
you to be kind of a devil's advocate if
 
02:06:29.350 --> 02:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
you can you is
 
02:06:31.790 --> 02:06:31.800 align:start position:0%
there what about this resolution should
 
02:06:35.430 --> 02:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
we be concerned about or if
 
02:06:38.709 --> 02:06:38.719 align:start position:0%
anything well as far as I understand it
 
02:06:43.830 --> 02:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
um this resolution is effectively asking
 
02:06:46.830 --> 02:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
uh to send the message that we need some
 
02:06:50.830 --> 02:06:50.840 align:start position:0%
sort of a universal health care plan um
 
02:06:55.149 --> 02:06:55.159 align:start position:0%
to Washington DC um and
 
02:07:00.270 --> 02:07:00.280 align:start position:0%
so you know I'm not sure that it
 
02:07:07.549 --> 02:07:07.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:09.950 --> 02:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps thank you for for trying that
 
02:07:13.790 --> 02:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
one uh represent gagy sure go
 
02:07:18.310 --> 02:07:18.320 align:start position:0%
ahead I don't have horns I promise okay
 
02:07:18.320 --> 02:07:20.250 align:start position:0%
ahead I don't have horns I promise okay
uh

uh
 
02:07:20.260 --> 02:07:21.510 align:start position:0%
uh
[Music]

02:07:21.510 --> 02:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:07:23.350 --> 02:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
I didn't hear the first part of of your
 
02:07:25.790 --> 02:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
your are you a medical doctor now I'm
 
02:07:28.910 --> 02:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
I'm a medical student student okay now
 
02:07:30.990 --> 02:07:31.000 align:start position:0%
when you graduate from Med medical
 
02:07:32.709 --> 02:07:32.719 align:start position:0%
school you do your
 
02:07:35.430 --> 02:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
internship if this becomes a Universal
 
02:07:39.189 --> 02:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
Health Care uh situation now I know for
 
02:07:42.270 --> 02:07:42.280 align:start position:0%
a fact my my daughter's an NP and not
 
02:07:45.189 --> 02:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
all NPS make the same pay scale depends
 
02:07:47.950 --> 02:07:47.960 align:start position:0%
where they work and what they do would
 
02:07:51.549 --> 02:07:51.559 align:start position:0%
that affect fect your bottom line like a
 
02:07:54.990 --> 02:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
doctor a chiropractor or a just a
 
02:07:58.229 --> 02:07:58.239 align:start position:0%
GP the pay scale would be different who
 
02:08:01.149 --> 02:08:01.159 align:start position:0%
would set that pay scale universally
 
02:08:03.950 --> 02:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:06.109 --> 02:08:06.119 align:start position:0%
country I'm I'm sorry your question is
 
02:08:07.790 --> 02:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
who would set the pay scale for
 
02:08:07.800 --> 02:08:09.350 align:start position:0%
who would set the pay scale for
healthcare

02:08:09.350 --> 02:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
healthcare
 
02:08:13.830 --> 02:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
providers yes if if this becomes sort of
 
02:08:16.910 --> 02:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
like managed care if this should should
 
02:08:21.430 --> 02:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:23.910 --> 02:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
it would be controlled
 
02:08:26.709 --> 02:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
nationally okay now there's going to be
 
02:08:28.709 --> 02:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
some cost savings going on somewhere
 
02:08:30.870 --> 02:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
because you you you you want to give
 
02:08:33.510 --> 02:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
everybody the same care that they
 
02:08:36.149 --> 02:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
deserve I have no problem with that but
 
02:08:39.270 --> 02:08:39.280 align:start position:0%
I know we all know for a fact that
 
02:08:41.109 --> 02:08:41.119 align:start position:0%
medical professions as any other
 
02:08:43.950 --> 02:08:43.960 align:start position:0%
profession not every Medical
 
02:08:46.589 --> 02:08:46.599 align:start position:0%
Professional makes the same pay
 
02:08:50.709 --> 02:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
scale so be you know for overhead so if
 
02:08:56.350 --> 02:08:56.360 align:start position:0%
there was one price for a particular
 
02:08:59.229 --> 02:08:59.239 align:start position:0%
procedure how would that work out if if
 
02:09:00.549 --> 02:09:00.559 align:start position:0%
you're not making enough money to stay
 
02:09:05.589 --> 02:09:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:05.599 --> 02:09:07.390 align:start position:0%
 
practice

02:09:07.390 --> 02:09:07.400 align:start position:0%
practice
 
02:09:10.629 --> 02:09:10.639 align:start position:0%
so I I think the best uh person to
 
02:09:12.149 --> 02:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
answer that question would have been one
 
02:09:14.750 --> 02:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
of the uh Physicians that are speaking
 
02:09:20.350 --> 02:09:20.360 align:start position:0%
here today but as far as I um as far as
 
02:09:21.510 --> 02:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
I am
 
02:09:24.830 --> 02:09:24.840 align:start position:0%
concerned uh Health Care as it uh health
 
02:09:26.950 --> 02:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
insurance as it is
 
02:09:32.030 --> 02:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
today um often takes on the uh job of
 
02:09:34.149 --> 02:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
determining whether certain procedures
 
02:09:37.149 --> 02:09:37.159 align:start position:0%
are even medically necessary for
 
02:09:40.069 --> 02:09:40.079 align:start position:0%
patients and the way that I see it the
 
02:09:42.669 --> 02:09:42.679 align:start position:0%
only people that should be involved in
 
02:09:44.990 --> 02:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
making that decision are healthc care
 
02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:46.709 align:start position:0%
making that decision are healthc care
providers

02:09:46.709 --> 02:09:46.719 align:start position:0%
providers
 
02:09:49.390 --> 02:09:49.400 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:09:52.069 --> 02:09:52.079 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure if this is answering the
 
02:09:54.350 --> 02:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
question or not but I think that at that
 
02:09:57.910 --> 02:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
point payment uh would be determined by
 
02:09:59.629 --> 02:09:59.639 align:start position:0%
the health care that is being delivered
 
02:09:59.639 --> 02:10:01.629 align:start position:0%
the health care that is being delivered
to

02:10:01.629 --> 02:10:01.639 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:10:03.709 --> 02:10:03.719 align:start position:0%
patients thank you for allowing me to
 
02:10:06.589 --> 02:10:06.599 align:start position:0%
put you on a spot represent
 
02:10:09.109 --> 02:10:09.119 align:start position:0%
levit thank you chair Mett I'd like to
 
02:10:13.470 --> 02:10:13.480 align:start position:0%
call up one of the presenters
 
02:10:16.149 --> 02:10:16.159 align:start position:0%
please call back up thank you recall
 
02:10:18.830 --> 02:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative gagy
 
02:10:22.350 --> 02:10:22.360 align:start position:0%
yes yes yeah the grayhair
 
02:10:33.109 --> 02:10:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:36.030 --> 02:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
oh cuz it's a terrific question and it's
 
02:10:39.109 --> 02:10:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:41.270 --> 02:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
question yes in fact I was I was looking
 
02:10:45.390 --> 02:10:45.400 align:start position:0%
for your card that's why I was uh so uh
 
02:10:47.950 --> 02:10:47.960 align:start position:0%
please thank you I'm I'm I'm kend alart
 
02:10:50.750 --> 02:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
so so you asked a really important
 
02:10:53.350 --> 02:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
question that very few people including
 
02:10:55.790 --> 02:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
doctors know the answer
 
02:10:59.310 --> 02:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
to how do you determine how much a
 
02:11:02.189 --> 02:11:02.199 align:start position:0%
physician gets paid for what they
 
02:11:04.990 --> 02:11:05.000 align:start position:0%
do and it turns
 
02:11:08.549 --> 02:11:08.559 align:start position:0%
out that there is a little known um
 
02:11:13.310 --> 02:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
relative value scale committee or The
 
02:11:16.430 --> 02:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
Ruck that is formed by the American
 
02:11:20.270 --> 02:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:22.430 --> 02:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
it consists of
 
02:11:26.270 --> 02:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
27 leaders from different from 27
 
02:11:29.470 --> 02:11:29.480 align:start position:0%
Specialties neurosurgery general surgery
 
02:11:32.910 --> 02:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
vascular surgery and among those 27 are
 
02:11:35.270 --> 02:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
three primary care Specialties
 
02:11:38.109 --> 02:11:38.119 align:start position:0%
Pediatrics family medicine and uh
 
02:11:41.830 --> 02:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
General Internal Medicine this
 
02:11:44.910 --> 02:11:44.920 align:start position:0%
committee looks at well we think
 
02:11:47.750 --> 02:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
spending an hour discussing one's
 
02:11:47.760 --> 02:11:48.669 align:start position:0%
spending an hour discussing one's
depression

02:11:48.669 --> 02:11:48.679 align:start position:0%
depression
 
02:11:50.669 --> 02:11:50.679 align:start position:0%
and why you cannot take care of your
 
02:11:52.149 --> 02:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
your diabetes
 
02:11:55.350 --> 02:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
accordingly uh how much that is worth
 
02:11:57.830 --> 02:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
versus half an hour in the
 
02:12:03.990 --> 02:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
O uh repairing a hernia versus zapping a
 
02:12:06.350 --> 02:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
non-cancerous potentially precancerous
 
02:12:09.830 --> 02:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
lesion on an arm you get 80 bucks to do
 
02:12:12.430 --> 02:12:12.440 align:start position:0%
this with a liquid nitrogen shot maybe
 
02:12:14.430 --> 02:12:14.440 align:start position:0%
50 bucks to spend that half an hour or
 
02:12:17.549 --> 02:12:17.559 align:start position:0%
an hour talking this is this committee
 
02:12:19.830 --> 02:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
that committee
 
02:12:22.229 --> 02:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
gives advice to centers for medical
 
02:12:26.950 --> 02:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
services CMS which always takes their
 
02:12:29.270 --> 02:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
recommendations one of the problems with
 
02:12:32.030 --> 02:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
primary care is that there's only three
 
02:12:33.750 --> 02:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
representatives of primary care on that
 
02:12:36.750 --> 02:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
the a is a Lobby to to boost and support
 
02:12:39.069 --> 02:12:39.079 align:start position:0%
Physicians salaries so guess where the
 
02:12:43.189 --> 02:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
Bucks go um the other thing that is
 
02:12:46.629 --> 02:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
important so so that's how salaries and
 
02:12:49.229 --> 02:12:49.239 align:start position:0%
and reimbursement is currently set to an
 
02:12:49.239 --> 02:12:50.950 align:start position:0%
and reimbursement is currently set to an
extent

02:12:50.950 --> 02:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
extent
 
02:12:55.390 --> 02:12:55.400 align:start position:0%
um the other thing by the way is private
 
02:12:59.149 --> 02:12:59.159 align:start position:0%
insurers market so if I'm United healthc
 
02:13:02.350 --> 02:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
care I want to say that I have more fine
 
02:13:05.069 --> 02:13:05.079 align:start position:0%
cardiologists in the Portsmouth area
 
02:13:06.990 --> 02:13:07.000 align:start position:0%
than Etna does or than Sigma does or
 
02:13:10.629 --> 02:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
whatnot so guess what they will
 
02:13:14.950 --> 02:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
boost um by about 300% in many instances
 
02:13:18.390 --> 02:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
above what that recommended scale is to
 
02:13:20.750 --> 02:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
attract and bring in more subsp
 
02:13:25.189 --> 02:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
Specialists Primary Care gets boosted 5%
 
02:13:27.470 --> 02:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
maybe it's 105% about what CMS
 
02:13:29.510 --> 02:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
recommended for that reimbursement
 
02:13:31.950 --> 02:13:31.960 align:start position:0%
that's part of the problem we have with
 
02:13:33.310 --> 02:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
a nons
 
02:13:36.069 --> 02:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
system um it's not looking at what you
 
02:13:38.149 --> 02:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
actually need in the way of primary care
 
02:13:39.910 --> 02:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
versus cardiologists versus
 
02:13:42.270 --> 02:13:42.280 align:start position:0%
neurosurgeons it's based on other
 
02:13:43.910 --> 02:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
factors so is
 
02:13:46.510 --> 02:13:46.520 align:start position:0%
that helpful
 
02:13:50.470 --> 02:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh and can I follow up thank you Mr
 
02:13:52.589 --> 02:13:52.599 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Mr chairman for
 
02:13:56.750 --> 02:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
allowing the doctor to come back
 
02:13:59.750 --> 02:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh I've got a high school education so
 
02:14:03.669 --> 02:14:03.679 align:start position:0%
I'm you know my my my son is a patent
 
02:14:07.030 --> 02:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
attorney and my daughter's an NP so they
 
02:14:09.870 --> 02:14:09.880 align:start position:0%
all have they did it way better than I
 
02:14:11.910 --> 02:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
did I was a lumper which is why I've had
 
02:14:14.229 --> 02:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
13 surgeries I was a black belt
 
02:14:16.669 --> 02:14:16.679 align:start position:0%
instructor back in the last century and
 
02:14:18.669 --> 02:14:18.679 align:start position:0%
that's what I knew
 
02:14:21.790 --> 02:14:21.800 align:start position:0%
uh so would you say that this the AMC
 
02:14:23.510 --> 02:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
with these
 
02:14:27.310 --> 02:14:27.320 align:start position:0%
27 leaders the the American Medical
 
02:14:29.790 --> 02:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
Association ama ama it's it's called The
 
02:14:31.790 --> 02:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
Ruck the
 
02:14:35.790 --> 02:14:35.800 align:start position:0%
relative AMA is good yeah am is good so
 
02:14:40.470 --> 02:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
would you say that these 27
 
02:14:43.629 --> 02:14:43.639 align:start position:0%
Specialists uh set parameters for what
 
02:14:47.589 --> 02:14:47.599 align:start position:0%
will be charged for um hospital visits
 
02:14:50.750 --> 02:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
or routine visits yes they make they
 
02:14:53.470 --> 02:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
they give advice to centers for medical
 
02:14:56.270 --> 02:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
services which which is what also sets
 
02:14:58.950 --> 02:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
by the way Medicare reimbursement and
 
02:15:01.149 --> 02:15:01.159 align:start position:0%
then private insurers use that as a
 
02:15:05.430 --> 02:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
benchmark to booster or subtract um well
 
02:15:08.109 --> 02:15:08.119 align:start position:0%
to boost uh reimbursement can I do one
 
02:15:12.030 --> 02:15:12.040 align:start position:0%
more Mr chairman proceed thank you for
 
02:15:12.040 --> 02:15:12.750 align:start position:0%
more Mr chairman proceed thank you for
your

02:15:12.750 --> 02:15:12.760 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:15:15.910 --> 02:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
Indulgence um so these 27 lers if this
 
02:15:19.069 --> 02:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
becomes if this should pass
 
02:15:19.079 --> 02:15:20.629 align:start position:0%
becomes if this should pass
Universal

02:15:20.629 --> 02:15:20.639 align:start position:0%
Universal
 
02:15:23.549 --> 02:15:23.559 align:start position:0%
glasses well Universal uh health
 
02:15:26.870 --> 02:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
insurance program would this affect the
 
02:15:29.189 --> 02:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
AMA with these 27 leaders would they
 
02:15:33.950 --> 02:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
have to take instruction from the people
 
02:15:35.229 --> 02:15:35.239 align:start position:0%
running this
 
02:15:38.910 --> 02:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
thing no no I mean it's it's
 
02:15:40.990 --> 02:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
interesting again we haven't talked
 
02:15:44.549 --> 02:15:44.559 align:start position:0%
about the specifics of what a single
 
02:15:46.990 --> 02:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
pair system would look like but it looks
 
02:15:49.149 --> 02:15:49.159 align:start position:0%
like a lot like like Medicare except
 
02:15:51.910 --> 02:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
improved and Universal not just for
 
02:15:53.870 --> 02:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
folks who attain the age of
 
02:15:57.709 --> 02:15:57.719 align:start position:0%
65 so Medicare currently is using which
 
02:15:59.350 --> 02:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
needs to be reformed obviously there's
 
02:16:00.990 --> 02:16:01.000 align:start position:0%
there's a crisis in Primary Care in the
 
02:16:03.750 --> 02:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
United States so that this mechanism has
 
02:16:06.830 --> 02:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
to be changed to some extent um but it's
 
02:16:08.629 --> 02:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
a lobbying group so the but but it's
 
02:16:11.270 --> 02:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
also entrenched as the mechanism that
 
02:16:13.910 --> 02:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
sets prices I don't know what the
 
02:16:16.189 --> 02:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
legislation would look like um to be
 
02:16:17.830 --> 02:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
honest maybe that's the better answer
 
02:16:20.790 --> 02:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
sir what ultimate legislation would look
 
02:16:24.229 --> 02:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
like with providing Universal Insurance
 
02:16:25.990 --> 02:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
for all Americans to
 
02:16:28.790 --> 02:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
experience um would have mechanisms like
 
02:16:30.350 --> 02:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
this in play but hopefully they'd be
 
02:16:32.750 --> 02:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
reformed it' be nice to keep politics
 
02:16:35.709 --> 02:16:35.719 align:start position:0%
out of it agree this is not political
 
02:16:38.469 --> 02:16:38.479 align:start position:0%
this this is I agree with you this is a
 
02:16:40.349 --> 02:16:40.359 align:start position:0%
part from politics thank you doctor for
 
02:16:43.070 --> 02:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
uh stepping back up I mentioned earlier
 
02:16:47.429 --> 02:16:47.439 align:start position:0%
that our clerk is uh one of the best oh
 
02:16:50.150 --> 02:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
oh uh s simai uh you have a question for
 
02:16:53.950 --> 02:16:53.960 align:start position:0%
this doctor uh represent yes sorry
 
02:16:57.429 --> 02:16:57.439 align:start position:0%
representative Le sorry thank you uh CH
 
02:17:01.110 --> 02:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
muet so let's be honest this has been
 
02:17:03.349 --> 02:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
you know debated and legislated for
 
02:17:05.509 --> 02:17:05.519 align:start position:0%
decades now I mean there's a lot of
 
02:17:07.469 --> 02:17:07.479 align:start position:0%
money at stake with the insurance
 
02:17:10.790 --> 02:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
companies and big Pharma um we go on by
 
02:17:12.790 --> 02:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
saying it's that we don't want it to be
 
02:17:14.629 --> 02:17:14.639 align:start position:0%
political it's very political it's
 
02:17:16.389 --> 02:17:16.399 align:start position:0%
extremely political because there's a
 
02:17:21.669 --> 02:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
lot um a lot of money in this um you
 
02:17:23.750 --> 02:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
know we live in a capitalistic system
 
02:17:26.469 --> 02:17:26.479 align:start position:0%
where people go to
 
02:17:29.309 --> 02:17:29.319 align:start position:0%
school they go to
 
02:17:32.509 --> 02:17:32.519 align:start position:0%
internship they become
 
02:17:35.750 --> 02:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
doctors different type of
 
02:17:38.629 --> 02:17:38.639 align:start position:0%
Physicians I don't think that part needs
 
02:17:40.270 --> 02:17:40.280 align:start position:0%
to be
 
02:17:43.230 --> 02:17:43.240 align:start position:0%
regulated problem I'm having here is
 
02:17:46.070 --> 02:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
it's pretty simple
 
02:17:48.910 --> 02:17:48.920 align:start position:0%
is if you want want to do something with
 
02:17:51.750 --> 02:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
the Universal Health
 
02:17:55.589 --> 02:17:55.599 align:start position:0%
Care we need to start small I understand
 
02:17:58.110 --> 02:17:58.120 align:start position:0%
coming to the New Hampshire legislature
 
02:18:01.870 --> 02:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
is the beginning of the process and I
 
02:18:04.549 --> 02:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
respect that and and I thank you for
 
02:18:09.030 --> 02:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
that but we're talking
 
02:18:09.040 --> 02:18:11.190 align:start position:0%
that but we're talking
about

02:18:11.190 --> 02:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:18:14.549 --> 02:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
lobbyists lawyers
 
02:18:19.230 --> 02:18:19.240 align:start position:0%
organizations that will not
 
02:18:25.270 --> 02:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
that do not want to upset the status quo
 
02:18:28.870 --> 02:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
so what we're running into here is all
 
02:18:31.709 --> 02:18:31.719 align:start position:0%
good Common Sense
 
02:18:34.509 --> 02:18:34.519 align:start position:0%
legislation but we do run
 
02:18:37.830 --> 02:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
into things
 
02:18:42.110 --> 02:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
um um and and the question is Roadblocks
 
02:18:46.429 --> 02:18:46.439 align:start position:0%
that is um something that we are not
 
02:18:48.790 --> 02:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
going to be able to to
 
02:18:52.589 --> 02:18:52.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:55.589 --> 02:18:55.599 align:start position:0%
that um I think we all
 
02:18:59.429 --> 02:18:59.439 align:start position:0%
recognize how much moneyed special
 
02:19:03.469 --> 02:19:03.479 align:start position:0%
interests in Washington DC has affected
 
02:19:03.479 --> 02:19:04.309 align:start position:0%
interests in Washington DC has affected
our

02:19:04.309 --> 02:19:04.319 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:19:09.870 --> 02:19:09.880 align:start position:0%
lives and what you are pointing out is
 
02:19:14.790 --> 02:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
the difficulty in countering
 
02:19:18.349 --> 02:19:18.359 align:start position:0%
marketing uh inducement of year in the
 
02:19:22.110 --> 02:19:22.120 align:start position:0%
public about changes when there's a lot
 
02:19:25.790 --> 02:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
of money in special interests
 
02:19:28.429 --> 02:19:28.439 align:start position:0%
um the status quo is going to be
 
02:19:30.230 --> 02:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
supported by that special interest
 
02:19:31.750 --> 02:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
that's that's the nature of campaign
 
02:19:33.830 --> 02:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
finance and the whole host of other
 
02:19:37.950 --> 02:19:37.960 align:start position:0%
issues you are right this is Way Beyond
 
02:19:40.110 --> 02:19:40.120 align:start position:0%
the legis the state house in New
 
02:19:42.070 --> 02:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're a small state we can't
 
02:19:45.190 --> 02:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
do this on our own this is a
 
02:19:50.190 --> 02:19:50.200 align:start position:0%
resolution saying two our Congressional
 
02:19:52.910 --> 02:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
Representatives we recognize how people
 
02:19:55.110 --> 02:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
are suffering
 
02:19:59.030 --> 02:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily because of the um to to
 
02:20:02.030 --> 02:20:02.040 align:start position:0%
basically provide profit uh for what's a
 
02:20:05.389 --> 02:20:05.399 align:start position:0%
public good that should not have been
 
02:20:09.110 --> 02:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
prophetie so the simple it's actually a
 
02:20:13.950 --> 02:20:13.960 align:start position:0%
very simple process of making a
 
02:20:16.790 --> 02:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
nonbinding resolution that people
 
02:20:19.630 --> 02:20:19.640 align:start position:0%
recognize is the system is as terribly
 
02:20:22.190 --> 02:20:22.200 align:start position:0%
broken and people are suffering as much
 
02:20:26.750 --> 02:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
as they are for lack of a health
 
02:20:29.830 --> 02:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
system by the way it's really cheap to
 
02:20:31.670 --> 02:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
take care of kids you know you mentioned
 
02:20:31.680 --> 02:20:32.750 align:start position:0%
take care of kids you know you mentioned
starting

02:20:32.750 --> 02:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
starting
 
02:20:35.990 --> 02:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
small kids don't cost a lot they need
 
02:20:38.870 --> 02:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
immunizations they need well baby care
 
02:20:40.950 --> 02:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
it's not pricey we talk about the
 
02:20:42.990 --> 02:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
billions of dollars that are siphoned
 
02:20:46.190 --> 02:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
off of Medicare and everything else
 
02:20:48.590 --> 02:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
preventative care is not not expensive
 
02:20:51.030 --> 02:20:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh covering folks who are currently
 
02:20:55.070 --> 02:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
uninsured could actually even be done by
 
02:20:58.429 --> 02:20:58.439 align:start position:0%
the various intermediary Health insurers
 
02:20:59.990 --> 02:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's just they'd have to take a hit in
 
02:21:01.670 --> 02:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
terms of their profit they'd have to be
 
02:21:03.630 --> 02:21:03.640 align:start position:0%
responsible for that there's a lot of
 
02:21:05.150 --> 02:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
ways to get from point A to point B I
 
02:21:06.670 --> 02:21:06.680 align:start position:0%
guess is what I'm saying this doesn't
 
02:21:08.710 --> 02:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
tell us how to form the legislation it's
 
02:21:10.429 --> 02:21:10.439 align:start position:0%
just saying we recognize the issue needs
 
02:21:13.510 --> 02:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
to be solved at a federal level if that
 
02:21:16.510 --> 02:21:16.520 align:start position:0%
helps thank you for those comments thank
 
02:21:18.349 --> 02:21:18.359 align:start position:0%
you doctor for your second appearance
 
02:21:20.790 --> 02:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
and for uh also your point about this
 
02:21:22.830 --> 02:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
being resolution as well taken sometimes
 
02:21:26.070 --> 02:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
there's confusion as to uh HB versus an
 
02:21:28.670 --> 02:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
HR this is a as you pointed out so well
 
02:21:31.030 --> 02:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
this is a resolution resolutions can
 
02:21:33.710 --> 02:21:33.720 align:start position:0%
matter uh they sometimes get more much
 
02:21:35.510 --> 02:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
more attention than some bills do we
 
02:21:38.510 --> 02:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
have two more cards uh Dr Fisher or
 
02:21:41.429 --> 02:21:41.439 align:start position:0%
Fisher and also uh Laura Lynch I'll ask
 
02:21:45.309 --> 02:21:45.319 align:start position:0%
Dr f is it Fisher or Fisher Dr
 
02:21:48.309 --> 02:21:48.319 align:start position:0%
Fisher but uh and while he's approaching
 
02:21:50.830 --> 02:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
the uh not the witness stand but the
 
02:21:52.790 --> 02:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
presenter stand uh he's asked for up to
 
02:21:55.870 --> 02:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
five minutes and then uh Laura our final
 
02:21:59.150 --> 02:21:59.160 align:start position:0%
uh presenter uh three minutes um I also
 
02:22:00.870 --> 02:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh I mentioned our clerk is one of the
 
02:22:03.190 --> 02:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
best we also have one of the best uh

02:23:10.270 --> 02:23:10.280 align:start position:0%
you had a lot of questions and I wrote a
 
02:23:13.630 --> 02:23:13.640 align:start position:0%
few notes down uh and so I'm going to I
 
02:23:15.469 --> 02:23:15.479 align:start position:0%
mean you've been sitting here for an
 
02:23:17.590 --> 02:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
hour and 35 minutes listening to
 
02:23:19.510 --> 02:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
testimony and I thought it might be
 
02:23:22.030 --> 02:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
refreshing just to kind of sit back and
 
02:23:24.190 --> 02:23:24.200 align:start position:0%
kind of answer a few questions some that
 
02:23:26.950 --> 02:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
have already been asked uh and you might
 
02:23:28.590 --> 02:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
have some fresh questions as well and I
 
02:23:29.790 --> 02:23:29.800 align:start position:0%
thought that might be a better use of
 
02:23:33.550 --> 02:23:33.560 align:start position:0%
our time um so uh chairman you had a a
 
02:23:35.590 --> 02:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
question about uh immigrants and paying
 
02:23:37.389 --> 02:23:37.399 align:start position:0%
for immigrants well first of all we're
 
02:23:40.150 --> 02:23:40.160 align:start position:0%
paying for them now okay the difference
 
02:23:42.469 --> 02:23:42.479 align:start position:0%
is these same people these immigrants
 
02:23:44.510 --> 02:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
that are coming into the emergency room
 
02:23:47.389 --> 02:23:47.399 align:start position:0%
by law we obliged to take care of we
 
02:23:49.630 --> 02:23:49.640 align:start position:0%
can't just say sorry you're out on the
 
02:23:52.389 --> 02:23:52.399 align:start position:0%
street uh and just die outside the
 
02:23:54.630 --> 02:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
hospital someplace we we take care of
 
02:23:56.750 --> 02:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
them but the problem is under the
 
02:23:59.630 --> 02:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
present system the hospital gets to
 
02:24:02.469 --> 02:24:02.479 align:start position:0%
charge an administrative fee and the
 
02:24:04.190 --> 02:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
insurance companies that gets passed
 
02:24:05.790 --> 02:24:05.800 align:start position:0%
along to the insurance companies the
 
02:24:07.830 --> 02:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
insurance companies then have us pay for
 
02:24:10.190 --> 02:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
it that's why insurance rates are one of
 
02:24:12.630 --> 02:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
the reasons they're so high plus the
 
02:24:14.110 --> 02:24:14.120 align:start position:0%
administrative fee that the insurance
 
02:24:17.030 --> 02:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
companies put on us so by switching to a
 
02:24:19.349 --> 02:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
universal healthcare we cut out a lot of
 
02:24:20.710 --> 02:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
those middlemen and a lot of that
 
02:24:23.870 --> 02:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
administrative fees as as Dr dolkart
 
02:24:26.710 --> 02:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
pointed out the administrative fee for
 
02:24:28.990 --> 02:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
the government run insurance plan of
 
02:24:33.389 --> 02:24:33.399 align:start position:0%
Medicare is around 2 to 3% as opposed to
 
02:24:36.750 --> 02:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 20 and 30% for Private
 
02:24:39.550 --> 02:24:39.560 align:start position:0%
health insurances so the answer your
 
02:24:41.230 --> 02:24:41.240 align:start position:0%
question is yeah taxpayers are still
 
02:24:43.870 --> 02:24:43.880 align:start position:0%
paying for it we're stuck okay we can't
 
02:24:46.670 --> 02:24:46.680 align:start position:0%
just let people die in the streets but
 
02:24:48.110 --> 02:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
the but at least it's going to be
 
02:24:50.230 --> 02:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
cheaper to pay for them under a
 
02:24:54.389 --> 02:24:54.399 align:start position:0%
universal plan um uh uh representative
 
02:24:56.429 --> 02:24:56.439 align:start position:0%
gagy you had a whole bunch of questions
 
02:24:57.550 --> 02:24:57.560 align:start position:0%
about how this is going to be
 
02:25:00.030 --> 02:25:00.040 align:start position:0%
administered and those are really good
 
02:25:03.070 --> 02:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
questions and and besides the fact that
 
02:25:05.550 --> 02:25:05.560 align:start position:0%
all the presenters had same thing in
 
02:25:07.950 --> 02:25:07.960 align:start position:0%
common that we all were in favor of this
 
02:25:09.750 --> 02:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
resolution we have something else in
 
02:25:12.710 --> 02:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
common too and that is all the stories
 
02:25:14.590 --> 02:25:14.600 align:start position:0%
that you've heard all the things that
 
02:25:15.950 --> 02:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
you've heard from the doctors and from
 
02:25:17.429 --> 02:25:17.439 align:start position:0%
the patients okay
 
02:25:19.550 --> 02:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
there was a difference between who is it
 
02:25:21.790 --> 02:25:21.800 align:start position:0%
that's going to manage your health care
 
02:25:25.070 --> 02:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
is it going to be your doctor and and a
 
02:25:26.830 --> 02:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
collaboration between the doctor and the
 
02:25:29.150 --> 02:25:29.160 align:start position:0%
patient or is it going to be a private
 
02:25:31.630 --> 02:25:31.640 align:start position:0%
health insurance these managed care
 
02:25:34.150 --> 02:25:34.160 align:start position:0%
companies okay who's going to make the
 
02:25:36.469 --> 02:25:36.479 align:start position:0%
decision somebody who's looking out for
 
02:25:38.910 --> 02:25:38.920 align:start position:0%
Wall Street or someone whose sole
 
02:25:41.830 --> 02:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
purpose is to look out for you now in
 
02:25:44.429 --> 02:25:44.439 align:start position:0%
terms of what's the downside well there
 
02:25:47.030 --> 02:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
can be a lot of downsides okay and as
 
02:25:48.670 --> 02:25:48.680 align:start position:0%
you know Congress is kind of
 
02:25:52.510 --> 02:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
dysfunctional at this time so yeah any
 
02:25:57.230 --> 02:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
any small group of individuals who
 
02:26:00.150 --> 02:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
have pretty secure congressional
 
02:26:03.309 --> 02:26:03.319 align:start position:0%
districts can kind of mess things up and
 
02:26:05.349 --> 02:26:05.359 align:start position:0%
they can change the formula any way they
 
02:26:08.309 --> 02:26:08.319 align:start position:0%
want but you know we've got we're the
 
02:26:11.110 --> 02:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
richest country in the world we spend
 
02:26:13.590 --> 02:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
twice as much on healthare as any other
 
02:26:16.990 --> 02:26:17.000 align:start position:0%
Nation does okay and we've got well of
 
02:26:20.389 --> 02:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
the one of my statistics is we rank 58th
 
02:26:23.830 --> 02:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of life expectancy 58th in in
 
02:26:26.190 --> 02:26:26.200 align:start position:0%
the world okay it's kind of hard to
 
02:26:27.790 --> 02:26:27.800 align:start position:0%
screw that up more than we've screwed it
 
02:26:30.830 --> 02:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
up now all right can it be done well you
 
02:26:32.870 --> 02:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
know I have a lot of faith in in
 
02:26:34.870 --> 02:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
Washington that maybe they could do it
 
02:26:37.230 --> 02:26:37.240 align:start position:0%
okay but I also have faith in both
 
02:26:39.550 --> 02:26:39.560 align:start position:0%
Republicans and Democrats that that
 
02:26:42.110 --> 02:26:42.120 align:start position:0%
people aren't totally stupid okay yeah
 
02:26:43.790 --> 02:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
you get into office and you're you're
 
02:26:45.309 --> 02:26:45.319 align:start position:0%
there to represent your your
 
02:26:47.150 --> 02:26:47.160 align:start position:0%
constituents and some people people come
 
02:26:49.830 --> 02:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
in with some weird agendas but most
 
02:26:51.830 --> 02:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
people are honest we're all trying to
 
02:26:53.190 --> 02:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
most of us are trying to do the right
 
02:26:55.269 --> 02:26:55.279 align:start position:0%
thing for for the people that we
 
02:26:58.389 --> 02:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
represent and and so I have faith that
 
02:26:59.750 --> 02:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
eventually they'll come up with
 
02:27:01.429 --> 02:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
something especially if we give them a
 
02:27:04.550 --> 02:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
mandate that we want we want them to do
 
02:27:06.830 --> 02:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
something we want to get things done so
 
02:27:09.750 --> 02:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
what hr23 does basically is says
 
02:27:12.190 --> 02:27:12.200 align:start position:0%
look you these private insurance
 
02:27:14.750 --> 02:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
companies they spend Millions hundreds
 
02:27:17.349 --> 02:27:17.359 align:start position:0%
of millions of dollars to Lobby Congress
 
02:27:19.750 --> 02:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
people uh they they don't just Lobby
 
02:27:23.070 --> 02:27:23.080 align:start position:0%
Cong they Lobby uh Chambers of Commerce
 
02:27:25.550 --> 02:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
they try to get uh they try to get the
 
02:27:27.469 --> 02:27:27.479 align:start position:0%
Chambers of Commerce to go against any
 
02:27:30.190 --> 02:27:30.200 align:start position:0%
sort of uh deal that actually benefits
 
02:27:33.190 --> 02:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
private businesses so it's hard to to
 
02:27:35.429 --> 02:27:35.439 align:start position:0%
work up against those as as as
 
02:27:38.070 --> 02:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
representative lit mentions but we have
 
02:27:40.429 --> 02:27:40.439 align:start position:0%
a chance by sending it to on a national
 
02:27:42.990 --> 02:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
basis and looking and taking the total
 
02:27:45.510 --> 02:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
process I I I know I said I was going to
 
02:27:46.830 --> 02:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
just answer questions but those those
 
02:27:48.349 --> 02:27:48.359 align:start position:0%
were the questions that you asked I
 
02:27:50.230 --> 02:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to address some of those thank
 
02:27:53.070 --> 02:27:53.080 align:start position:0%
you for that Dr uh R
 
02:27:56.990 --> 02:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
gagy thank you thank you Doctor
 
02:28:01.230 --> 02:28:01.240 align:start position:0%
uh my big concern of all of
 
02:28:04.429 --> 02:28:04.439 align:start position:0%
this is not I don't want to care for
 
02:28:07.110 --> 02:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
people to have have them cared for it's
 
02:28:09.990 --> 02:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
government mandates that would tell me
 
02:28:12.550 --> 02:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
if I'm if I have when I have children
 
02:28:14.349 --> 02:28:14.359 align:start position:0%
that this is what you have to do with
 
02:28:16.070 --> 02:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
your children you have to bring them in
 
02:28:17.790 --> 02:28:17.800 align:start position:0%
to do this you have to bring them in to
 
02:28:20.429 --> 02:28:20.439 align:start position:0%
do that government mandates have always
 
02:28:23.990 --> 02:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
bothered me would you you know I was say
 
02:28:26.590 --> 02:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
yeah there was uh would you believe uh
 
02:28:28.150 --> 02:28:28.160 align:start position:0%
we are supposed to ask questions and
 
02:28:29.790 --> 02:28:29.800 align:start position:0%
that technically was would you would you
 
02:28:32.670 --> 02:28:32.680 align:start position:0%
believe what he just said Doctor uh I
 
02:28:34.590 --> 02:28:34.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I I understand about government
 
02:28:38.230 --> 02:28:38.240 align:start position:0%
mandates uh and and I have the same sort
 
02:28:40.469 --> 02:28:40.479 align:start position:0%
of concerns about government mandates as
 
02:28:43.349 --> 02:28:43.359 align:start position:0%
well I I definitely share that with you
 
02:28:45.670 --> 02:28:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh fortunately with the examples that I
 
02:28:47.269 --> 02:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
have and I've also worked for the VA
 
02:28:50.630 --> 02:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
system okay um when it comes to Health
 
02:28:53.030 --> 02:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
Care the government mandates have been
 
02:28:55.630 --> 02:28:55.640 align:start position:0%
more about the financial aspects and not
 
02:28:58.389 --> 02:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
about the personal aspects uh there are
 
02:29:01.630 --> 02:29:01.640 align:start position:0%
some concerns about you know uh of what
 
02:29:03.630 --> 02:29:03.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to cover what for Co what
 
02:29:06.309 --> 02:29:06.319 align:start position:0%
what counts as costs and so on but you
 
02:29:08.670 --> 02:29:08.680 align:start position:0%
know those are all upfront uh when it
 
02:29:12.510 --> 02:29:12.520 align:start position:0%
comes to um especially about Medicare uh
 
02:29:14.190 --> 02:29:14.200 align:start position:0%
Doc and I've worked with a lot of
 
02:29:15.990 --> 02:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
Medicare patients you know what you're
 
02:29:17.790 --> 02:29:17.800 align:start position:0%
dealing with you know what they're going
 
02:29:19.510 --> 02:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
to approve and what they're not going to
 
02:29:22.389 --> 02:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
approve so the rate of of denials for
 
02:29:25.590 --> 02:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
government run uh health insurance
 
02:29:30.349 --> 02:29:30.359 align:start position:0%
Medicare is next to zero the rate of
 
02:29:33.870 --> 02:29:33.880 align:start position:0%
denials for private healthare is close
 
02:29:37.670 --> 02:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
to 30% so in terms of mandates who's
 
02:29:39.190 --> 02:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
really giving you the
 
02:29:41.710 --> 02:29:41.720 align:start position:0%
mandates it's it's really the private
 
02:29:43.469 --> 02:29:43.479 align:start position:0%
companies that are doing the mandates
 
02:29:45.870 --> 02:29:45.880 align:start position:0%
not the government thank you for that
 
02:29:45.880 --> 02:29:47.710 align:start position:0%
not the government thank you for that
doctor

02:29:47.710 --> 02:29:47.720 align:start position:0%
doctor
 
02:29:51.309 --> 02:29:51.319 align:start position:0%
uh other questions yes representative
 
02:29:53.950 --> 02:29:53.960 align:start position:0%
levit thank you chair
 
02:29:56.510 --> 02:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
maret so as we
 
02:30:00.950 --> 02:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
know how hr23 reads is is calling upon
 
02:30:02.750 --> 02:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Congressional
 
02:30:04.429 --> 02:30:04.439 align:start position:0%
Delegation to support a national
 
02:30:07.269 --> 02:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
universal health insurance program we
 
02:30:10.870 --> 02:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
support you then what doctor I beg you
 
02:30:13.150 --> 02:30:13.160 align:start position:0%
we decide this is a good resolution
 
02:30:17.070 --> 02:30:17.080 align:start position:0%
we're bypassing support then what well
 
02:30:20.710 --> 02:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
you know if if you pass this on and if
 
02:30:23.070 --> 02:30:23.080 align:start position:0%
you approve of it then basically what
 
02:30:25.590 --> 02:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
happens is our Congressional
 
02:30:29.230 --> 02:30:29.240 align:start position:0%
Delegation takes a stand and there's
 
02:30:31.030 --> 02:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
some there's some real advantages to
 
02:30:32.630 --> 02:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
that especially coming from New
 
02:30:34.790 --> 02:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that actually it was one of
 
02:30:36.670 --> 02:30:36.680 align:start position:0%
the things I actually wrote down before
 
02:30:39.750 --> 02:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
I I came up here uh and let me see if I
 
02:30:43.830 --> 02:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
can find it here uh oh yeah look I I've
 
02:30:46.670 --> 02:30:46.680 align:start position:0%
only lived in New Hampshire for 35 years
 
02:30:49.710 --> 02:30:49.720 align:start position:0%
um but you know New Hampshire is known
 
02:30:53.150 --> 02:30:53.160 align:start position:0%
for pragmatism okay yeah we get
 
02:30:55.750 --> 02:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
political okay but we're more pragmatic
 
02:30:58.309 --> 02:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
than anything else and we also none of
 
02:31:01.590 --> 02:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
us like wasteful spending we have to be
 
02:31:04.349 --> 02:31:04.359 align:start position:0%
frugal with our bucks and we're really
 
02:31:07.750 --> 02:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
good at that as a state so coming this
 
02:31:10.389 --> 02:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
resolution being sent to Washington from
 
02:31:12.910 --> 02:31:12.920 align:start position:0%
our Congressional Delegation tells the
 
02:31:15.710 --> 02:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
rest of the nation look we're tired of
 
02:31:18.910 --> 02:31:18.920 align:start position:0%
spending wasting government money and
 
02:31:21.830 --> 02:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
wasting private money on things that
 
02:31:24.510 --> 02:31:24.520 align:start position:0%
aren't doing anything for us you know
 
02:31:26.950 --> 02:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
when you look when you when you look at
 
02:31:28.710 --> 02:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
the outcomes from Private health
 
02:31:31.389 --> 02:31:31.399 align:start position:0%
insurance they're horrible I mean
 
02:31:33.910 --> 02:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
they're great for for making money for
 
02:31:36.190 --> 02:31:36.200 align:start position:0%
people but in terms of actual health
 
02:31:39.150 --> 02:31:39.160 align:start position:0%
care it's terrible and so we want our
 
02:31:40.990 --> 02:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
health care System to take care of
 
02:31:43.230 --> 02:31:43.240 align:start position:0%
Health Care and it's a very practical
 
02:31:45.110 --> 02:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
it's a very pragmatic thing and that's
 
02:31:46.630 --> 02:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
what we're known for that's what we're
 
02:31:48.670 --> 02:31:48.680 align:start position:0%
good at and so let's tell the rest of
 
02:31:51.309 --> 02:31:51.319 align:start position:0%
the nation that's what we want thank you
 
02:31:52.630 --> 02:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
thank you doctor and we did touch on
 
02:31:54.710 --> 02:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
that earlier in terms of the value of a
 
02:31:57.550 --> 02:31:57.560 align:start position:0%
resolution versus a bill I have two more
 
02:31:59.670 --> 02:31:59.680 align:start position:0%

02:32:43.510 --> 02:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
talking um about you know how to get
 
02:32:45.030 --> 02:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
universal healthcare I'm going to tell
 
02:32:47.150 --> 02:32:47.160 align:start position:0%
you my story
 
02:32:50.190 --> 02:32:50.200 align:start position:0%
um my husband fell and broke his hip his
 
02:32:52.269 --> 02:32:52.279 align:start position:0%
leg in August of
 
02:32:54.750 --> 02:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
2022 he was back and forth in the
 
02:32:57.429 --> 02:32:57.439 align:start position:0%
nursing home and the hospital for four
 
02:33:00.990 --> 02:33:01.000 align:start position:0%
weeks he was finally released within a
 
02:33:04.830 --> 02:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
week after he got a stomach ache and we
 
02:33:06.469 --> 02:33:06.479 align:start position:0%
rushed him to the hospital to find out
 
02:33:08.590 --> 02:33:08.600 align:start position:0%
that he had appendicitis now my husband
 
02:33:10.630 --> 02:33:10.640 align:start position:0%
had a number of underlining conditions
 
02:33:13.429 --> 02:33:13.439 align:start position:0%
on top of what the
 
02:33:16.950 --> 02:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
appendicitis um we waited in the waiting
 
02:33:21.230 --> 02:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
room for 7 hours 7 hours to see a doctor
 
02:33:22.870 --> 02:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
in an emergency room because they sent
 
02:33:25.269 --> 02:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
us to the emergency room the only ones
 
02:33:27.429 --> 02:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
that are going first in emergency rooms
 
02:33:30.389 --> 02:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
is if you call it um an ambulance and
 
02:33:32.870 --> 02:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
the cost of an ambulance right now is
 
02:33:36.429 --> 02:33:36.439 align:start position:0%
$1,250 to take you 30 minutes to a
 
02:33:39.070 --> 02:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
hospital and then they want a $300
 
02:33:41.230 --> 02:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
co-pay on top of it
 
02:33:46.190 --> 02:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
so needless to say um my husband I was I
 
02:33:47.950 --> 02:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
was told that night to go home because
 
02:33:49.630 --> 02:33:49.640 align:start position:0%
of my husband's underlying conditions
 
02:33:50.990 --> 02:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
they were going to keep in the hospital
 
02:33:53.910 --> 02:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
for several days or for a few days
 
02:33:57.269 --> 02:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
anyways um I was awoken at 5:30 that
 
02:33:59.950 --> 02:33:59.960 align:start position:0%
morning by a nurse asking me what his
 
02:34:02.750 --> 02:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
meds were and all kinds of stuff and
 
02:34:04.429 --> 02:34:04.439 align:start position:0%
they told me how the surgery went and
 
02:34:06.550 --> 02:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
everything and as far as I knew they
 
02:34:11.309 --> 02:34:11.319 align:start position:0%
were keeping him I got woken up at 9:30
 
02:34:14.150 --> 02:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
by my husband to tell me that they were
 
02:34:18.030 --> 02:34:18.040 align:start position:0%
discharging him eight hours after the
 
02:34:22.590 --> 02:34:22.600 align:start position:0%
surgery was over he was still under
 
02:34:26.230 --> 02:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
anesthesia and he he was told to sign
 
02:34:29.550 --> 02:34:29.560 align:start position:0%
paperwork while I was at home I I I
 
02:34:31.790 --> 02:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
wasn't there to protect him because
 
02:34:33.790 --> 02:34:33.800 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of people who really need
 
02:34:35.830 --> 02:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
to protect protection from hospitals
 
02:34:35.840 --> 02:34:37.389 align:start position:0%
to protect protection from hospitals
insurance

02:34:37.389 --> 02:34:37.399 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
02:34:39.670 --> 02:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
companies my husband came home and
 
02:34:43.070 --> 02:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
within a week he was rushed to CMC with
 
02:34:43.080 --> 02:34:44.550 align:start position:0%
within a week he was rushed to CMC with
an

02:34:44.550 --> 02:34:44.560 align:start position:0%
an
 
02:34:47.269 --> 02:34:47.279 align:start position:0%
infection this had section eventually
 
02:34:49.510 --> 02:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
killed my husband after 2 months he was
 
02:34:51.309 --> 02:34:51.319 align:start position:0%
63 years
 
02:34:51.319 --> 02:34:54.710 align:start position:0%
63 years
old

02:34:54.710 --> 02:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:58.150 --> 02:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
um I had to fight he
 
02:35:02.230 --> 02:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
um was in the hospital for 10 days going
 
02:35:03.510 --> 02:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
back and forth with the insurance
 
02:35:06.110 --> 02:35:06.120 align:start position:0%
company to find out that um he had a
 
02:35:09.150 --> 02:35:09.160 align:start position:0%
bleed in his heart and they were looking
 
02:35:10.910 --> 02:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
for it everywhere else and he ended up
 
02:35:13.790 --> 02:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
having open heart surgery and having his
 
02:35:18.190 --> 02:35:18.200 align:start position:0%
um one of his his
 
02:35:21.309 --> 02:35:21.319 align:start position:0%
um pipes replaced I forget what it is
 
02:35:25.230 --> 02:35:25.240 align:start position:0%
exactly I'm sorry and um but the
 
02:35:27.110 --> 02:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
infection continued because no one can
 
02:35:32.790 --> 02:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
get it so um he finally was able to get
 
02:35:35.150 --> 02:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
discharged it was a Sunday they told me
 
02:35:38.110 --> 02:35:38.120 align:start position:0%
that we're going to discharge him but we
 
02:35:40.830 --> 02:35:40.840 align:start position:0%
haven't found a place for him and I
 
02:35:43.269 --> 02:35:43.279 align:start position:0%
wanted him to be in a place that had a
 
02:35:45.309 --> 02:35:45.319 align:start position:0%
Hos that was in a hospital and I was
 
02:35:46.990 --> 02:35:47.000 align:start position:0%
asking them to to send him to St
 
02:35:51.190 --> 02:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
Joseph's Hospital for the rehab because
 
02:35:53.190 --> 02:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
they had a he had a pick in him and they
 
02:35:54.950 --> 02:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
would still had to give him medications
 
02:35:59.510 --> 02:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that so I went home that
 
02:36:01.950 --> 02:36:01.960 align:start position:0%
day thinking that my husband was finally
 
02:36:03.030 --> 02:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
going to
 
02:36:06.910 --> 02:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
rehab um I called him the next morning
 
02:36:08.790 --> 02:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
he was
 
02:36:12.630 --> 02:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
fine um I so I said to him I'm staying
 
02:36:15.070 --> 02:36:15.080 align:start position:0%
home it been two months of driving from
 
02:36:18.110 --> 02:36:18.120 align:start position:0%
Temple to to Manchester twice what back
 
02:36:23.990 --> 02:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
and forth twice a day um so I came back
 
02:36:24.000 --> 02:36:25.030 align:start position:0%
and forth twice a day um so I came back
on

02:36:25.030 --> 02:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:36:28.710 --> 02:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
Tuesday and my husband had no idea who I
 
02:36:33.389 --> 02:36:33.399 align:start position:0%
was and I got a message from and I was
 
02:36:35.429 --> 02:36:35.439 align:start position:0%
screaming at what the heck
 
02:36:39.230 --> 02:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
happened um what's going on nobody knew
 
02:36:41.429 --> 02:36:41.439 align:start position:0%
um found out but that one of the nurses
 
02:36:43.190 --> 02:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
there said that they had given him a
 
02:36:46.510 --> 02:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
medication that was already already ad
 
02:36:48.750 --> 02:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
he had an adverse reaction to and they
 
02:36:51.550 --> 02:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
just thought maybe they tried it again
 
02:36:54.990 --> 02:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
so my husband ended up um back in the
 
02:36:58.349 --> 02:36:58.359 align:start position:0%
ICU this was the day before
 
02:37:00.670 --> 02:37:00.680 align:start position:0%
Thanksgiving so Thanksgiving morning
 
02:37:03.110 --> 02:37:03.120 align:start position:0%

ICU when I got there the doctors was
 
02:37:13.349 --> 02:37:13.359 align:start position:0%

02:37:15.190 --> 02:37:15.200 align:start position:0%
I said to them I have no idea what
 
02:37:18.110 --> 02:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
happened we left him he was fine he was
 
02:37:19.790 --> 02:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
ready to go to
 
02:37:24.950 --> 02:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
rehab and he um ended up in the
 
02:37:27.710 --> 02:37:27.720 align:start position:0%
ICU it was the weekend after
 
02:37:29.750 --> 02:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
Thanksgiving his birthday was on
 
02:37:33.030 --> 02:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
November 26th and I was so excited I
 
02:37:35.150 --> 02:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
went out to get a cake and to bring it
 
02:37:38.550 --> 02:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
back and I found out that he wasn't
 
02:37:40.309 --> 02:37:40.319 align:start position:0%
breathing correctly and they had to put
 
02:37:42.389 --> 02:37:42.399 align:start position:0%
him on B they had him on BiPAP for a
 
02:37:44.150 --> 02:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
while but his breathing was getting
 
02:37:46.309 --> 02:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
worse and worse and his his
 
02:37:49.510 --> 02:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
body was shutting down so that next
 
02:37:53.269 --> 02:37:53.279 align:start position:0%
morning they said to me um he's coming
 
02:37:57.550 --> 02:37:57.560 align:start position:0%
in here um we his his body is shutting
 
02:38:00.469 --> 02:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
down but we think if we go and have do
 
02:38:05.070 --> 02:38:05.080 align:start position:0%
surgery that he has a 50% chance of
 
02:38:07.389 --> 02:38:07.399 align:start position:0%
surviving well they were waiting for a
 
02:38:11.389 --> 02:38:11.399 align:start position:0%
vascular surgeon to come in that day um
 
02:38:12.870 --> 02:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
it was on November
 
02:38:16.750 --> 02:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
27th and um she came in she checked him
 
02:38:19.990 --> 02:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
out she came back in and she looked at
 
02:38:21.750 --> 02:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
me through the door and she just went
 
02:38:21.760 --> 02:38:23.110 align:start position:0%
me through the door and she just went
like

02:38:23.110 --> 02:38:23.120 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:38:25.830 --> 02:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
this my husband would have had to have
 
02:38:29.630 --> 02:38:29.640 align:start position:0%
his leg cut off and his arm cut off and
 
02:38:32.670 --> 02:38:32.680 align:start position:0%
he had a 10% chance of surviving surgery
 
02:38:35.070 --> 02:38:35.080 align:start position:0%
so having to make a decision to shut the
 
02:38:37.269 --> 02:38:37.279 align:start position:0%
machines off for your husband is the
 
02:38:39.630 --> 02:38:39.640 align:start position:0%
worst thing you ever had to do but
 
02:38:42.190 --> 02:38:42.200 align:start position:0%
having to hear doctors and nurses at the
 
02:38:44.710 --> 02:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
hospital tell me that they had their
 
02:38:47.550 --> 02:38:47.560 align:start position:0%
hands tied in their feet tied because
 
02:38:49.870 --> 02:38:49.880 align:start position:0%
they couldn't do anything unless they
 
02:38:52.269 --> 02:38:52.279 align:start position:0%
got the okay from an insurance
 
02:38:55.750 --> 02:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
company I have Medicare Advantage I
 
02:38:58.389 --> 02:38:58.399 align:start position:0%
don't want Medicare Advantage anymore I
 
02:39:00.469 --> 02:39:00.479 align:start position:0%
want regular Medicare and they will not
 
02:39:03.469 --> 02:39:03.479 align:start position:0%
allow us to get off a Medicare
 
02:39:06.870 --> 02:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
Advantage our 3% increase this year for
 
02:39:09.910 --> 02:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
our social security I didn't get it
 
02:39:13.990 --> 02:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
because my dental went from $60 to $90 a
 
02:39:17.030 --> 02:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
month so there goes my 3% of my
 
02:39:20.630 --> 02:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
race it's getting ridiculous I started
 
02:39:24.349 --> 02:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
with Medicare at $84 it's now
 
02:39:28.349 --> 02:39:28.359 align:start position:0%
$174 a month so out of my measley social
 
02:39:30.910 --> 02:39:30.920 align:start position:0%
security check they're taking out almost
 
02:39:33.670 --> 02:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
$300 a month and this is what I'm trying
 
02:39:38.630 --> 02:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
to survive on we need Universal Medicare
 
02:39:40.550 --> 02:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
we need universal
 
02:39:43.349 --> 02:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
healthcare people like I cannot afford
 
02:39:45.950 --> 02:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
it I have a subscription right now for
 
02:39:48.990 --> 02:39:49.000 align:start position:0%
PT and I can't go because it's
 
02:39:51.990 --> 02:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
$45 an appointment and if you're doing
 
02:39:55.710 --> 02:39:55.720 align:start position:0%
three appointments a week it's over $120
 
02:39:59.630 --> 02:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
out of my $1,800 a month Social Security
 
02:40:02.309 --> 02:40:02.319 align:start position:0%
check Lord thank you for personalizing
 
02:40:04.710 --> 02:40:04.720 align:start position:0%
and for sharing that when folks are able
 
02:40:08.230 --> 02:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
to do that it it helps us to to on a
 
02:40:10.910 --> 02:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
personal level to see how circumstances
 
02:40:13.150 --> 02:40:13.160 align:start position:0%
affect people I think it's pretty clear
 
02:40:16.630 --> 02:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
why you mark down that you support the
 
02:40:18.349 --> 02:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
uh would you take a question if there if
 
02:40:20.910 --> 02:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
there is any I would love to answer any
 
02:40:20.920 --> 02:40:22.190 align:start position:0%
there is any I would love to answer any
questions

02:40:22.190 --> 02:40:22.200 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:40:26.590 --> 02:40:26.600 align:start position:0%
um not seeing any uh thank you again for
 
02:40:30.110 --> 02:40:30.120 align:start position:0%
coming here from Temple and sharing
 
02:40:33.030 --> 02:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
that we have one representative Horan
 
02:40:40.830 --> 02:40:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:43.630 --> 02:40:43.640 align:start position:0%
Horgan so as probably everybody knows
 
02:40:45.750 --> 02:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
I'm president Timothy Horgan from from
 
02:40:47.790 --> 02:40:47.800 align:start position:0%
uh straford County District 10 the town
 
02:40:50.190 --> 02:40:50.200 align:start position:0%
of Durham and um I'm current I've been
 
02:40:53.469 --> 02:40:53.479 align:start position:0%
on a um single-payer government plan for
 
02:40:56.910 --> 02:40:56.920 align:start position:0%
two years uh Medicare which uh you heard
 
02:41:00.389 --> 02:41:00.399 align:start position:0%
about before uh and I have the regular
 
02:41:02.870 --> 02:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
traditional Medicare plus a supplement
 
02:41:04.830 --> 02:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
with by a private insurance company so
 
02:41:06.710 --> 02:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
that that works uh that works well I
 
02:41:08.349 --> 02:41:08.359 align:start position:0%
don't consider that a bur of of
 
02:41:10.630 --> 02:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
government mandate one thing about
 
02:41:11.990 --> 02:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
before that for several years I had an
 
02:41:13.910 --> 02:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act policy sometimes
 
02:41:16.429 --> 02:41:16.439 align:start position:0%
called Obamacare which is a positive
 
02:41:18.110 --> 02:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
dictate for some people and negative for
 
02:41:20.349 --> 02:41:20.359 align:start position:0%
others and that also was certainly
 
02:41:22.230 --> 02:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
better than anything that was available
 
02:41:24.150 --> 02:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
to me through like the employer provided
 
02:41:26.750 --> 02:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
and certainly forget about the indidual
 
02:41:29.190 --> 02:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
insurance Market is pretty much uh
 
02:41:30.750 --> 02:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
pretty much worthless for some point me
 
02:41:32.750 --> 02:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
I was bit aged but still in good health
 
02:41:35.550 --> 02:41:35.560 align:start position:0%
so I think um certainly the Medicare
 
02:41:37.389 --> 02:41:37.399 align:start position:0%
system is not perfect but as others have
 
02:41:40.230 --> 02:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
pointed it is uh very predictable and of
 
02:41:41.790 --> 02:41:41.800 align:start position:0%
course get the supplement plans there's
 
02:41:43.349 --> 02:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
also the advantage plan which is sort of
 
02:41:46.469 --> 02:41:46.479 align:start position:0%
a free market solution which uh
 
02:41:48.389 --> 02:41:48.399 align:start position:0%
it didn't work well for the previous uh
 
02:41:48.399 --> 02:41:49.630 align:start position:0%
it didn't work well for the previous uh
witness

02:41:49.630 --> 02:41:49.640 align:start position:0%
witness
 
02:41:52.910 --> 02:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
I I I I just evaluate them they seem
 
02:41:54.670 --> 02:41:54.680 align:start position:0%
like a bad idea even though they are a
 
02:41:57.030 --> 02:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
free market solution they weren't good
 
02:42:00.389 --> 02:42:00.399 align:start position:0%
but um so I think I mean so I think we
 
02:42:02.030 --> 02:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
should send the delegation this letter
 
02:42:03.510 --> 02:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
obviously the four people who the
 
02:42:05.070 --> 02:42:05.080 align:start position:0%
members of our delegation all pretty
 
02:42:09.230 --> 02:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
much uh on that side of the issue um but
 
02:42:12.150 --> 02:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
still it's it's a it's useful to rein
 
02:42:13.550 --> 02:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
reinforce it and we don't know if those
 
02:42:14.870 --> 02:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
four members of the Congressional
 
02:42:16.710 --> 02:42:16.720 align:start position:0%
Delegation will be there forever so I
 
02:42:20.309 --> 02:42:20.319 align:start position:0%
think um and then well rent gagne's out
 
02:42:21.349 --> 02:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
here but he's complaining about
 
02:42:22.590 --> 02:42:22.600 align:start position:0%
government mandates I think the
 
02:42:24.429 --> 02:42:24.439 align:start position:0%
insurance companies are also a level of
 
02:42:25.910 --> 02:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
government they're just not a level of
 
02:42:27.830 --> 02:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
government that is not accountable to
 
02:42:31.110 --> 02:42:31.120 align:start position:0%
anybody but their own uh sh stockholders
 
02:42:33.590 --> 02:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
I think probably we should use something
 
02:42:35.030 --> 02:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
we should have a federal program that's
 
02:42:37.790 --> 02:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
along the line of Medicare and then um
 
02:42:40.309 --> 02:42:40.319 align:start position:0%
president L montin handed out that
 
02:42:42.070 --> 02:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
handed out that document you've all seen
 
02:42:43.510 --> 02:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
they also mentioned there's Tri care was
 
02:42:45.309 --> 02:42:45.319 align:start position:0%
the military ones so I think um you know
 
02:42:48.150 --> 02:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
it's not just veterans who have health
 
02:42:50.429 --> 02:42:50.439 align:start position:0%
issues it's not even just old people I
 
02:42:52.230 --> 02:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
know um there's many young people who
 
02:42:55.030 --> 02:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
have serious medical issues um
 
02:42:57.790 --> 02:42:57.800 align:start position:0%
so so I would just say vote Yes in this
 
02:42:59.790 --> 02:42:59.800 align:start position:0%
resolution and we go ahead and send go
 
02:43:01.550 --> 02:43:01.560 align:start position:0%
and go ahead and send the the letter on
 
02:43:03.630 --> 02:43:03.640 align:start position:0%
nice probably some nice formal
 
02:43:06.309 --> 02:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
stationary to the delegation and it's
 
02:43:07.710 --> 02:43:07.720 align:start position:0%
not going to make a huge difference but
 
02:43:09.309 --> 02:43:09.319 align:start position:0%
it'll make a small positive difference
 
02:43:11.910 --> 02:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
so um I would urge you to vote Yes I
 
02:43:13.550 --> 02:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
suppose that quite possibly may be voted
 
02:43:15.469 --> 02:43:15.479 align:start position:0%
yes because I'm going to be for here for
 
02:43:17.870 --> 02:43:17.880 align:start position:0%

get Congress to to support uh through
 
02:44:48.550 --> 02:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
this resolution the title that I had
 
02:44:50.950 --> 02:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
submitted to OS was the dignity through
 
02:44:53.630 --> 02:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
Prosperity act but the new title of the
 
02:44:56.790 --> 02:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
legislation is the defi uh the patent
 
02:45:00.990 --> 02:45:01.000 align:start position:0%
extend terminate the extended patent act
 
02:45:02.790 --> 02:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
um which is being passed around now so
 
02:45:04.429 --> 02:45:04.439 align:start position:0%
it's a simple Amendment it just replaces
 
02:45:07.070 --> 02:45:07.080 align:start position:0%
the word the name of the legislation uh
 
02:45:08.349 --> 02:45:08.359 align:start position:0%
from what's in the house resolution
 
02:45:11.070 --> 02:45:11.080 align:start position:0%
currently to what is now in front of you
 
02:45:14.510 --> 02:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
uh as the as the title of the bill um so
 
02:45:17.349 --> 02:45:17.359 align:start position:0%

02:45:19.910 --> 02:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
into exec session and we will do you
 
02:45:23.110 --> 02:45:23.120 align:start position:0%
have a member of the committee to uh
 
02:45:24.670 --> 02:45:24.680 align:start position:0%

02:45:27.070 --> 02:45:27.080 align:start position:0%
to exec S I don't I don't currently know
 
02:45:28.670 --> 02:45:28.680 align:start position:0%

02:45:32.830 --> 02:45:32.840 align:start position:0%
on me yet okay so sorry I do uh I
 
02:45:35.030 --> 02:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
believe this is it but uh go ahead carry
 
02:45:37.630 --> 02:45:37.640 align:start position:0%
on we we just need somebody to introduce
 
02:45:40.670 --> 02:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
and uh second the amendment but sure
 
02:45:42.550 --> 02:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
please continue to describe I I want to
 
02:45:44.710 --> 02:45:44.720 align:start position:0%
say so this bill this resolution I filed
 
02:45:47.030 --> 02:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
is on behalf of my constituent Earl Cobb
 
02:45:49.910 --> 02:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
who's over here uh in his wheelchair um
 
02:45:52.269 --> 02:45:52.279 align:start position:0%
he's a patent owner and and the the goal
 
02:45:54.630 --> 02:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
of the legislation is to urge Congress
 
02:45:56.790 --> 02:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
to to provide more security more
 
02:45:59.750 --> 02:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
flexibility uh to disabled patent owners
 
02:46:01.510 --> 02:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
um that are that hold patents within the
 
02:46:03.790 --> 02:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
country um and it's just suggest it's
 
02:46:05.870 --> 02:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
just proposing to Congress and asking
 
02:46:08.150 --> 02:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
them to support the legislation that he
 
02:46:10.630 --> 02:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
is he has drafted and he's pushing for
 
02:46:12.670 --> 02:46:12.680 align:start position:0%
um that's really the sum of it the the
 
02:46:15.269 --> 02:46:15.279 align:start position:0%
one-page resolution that we have not
 
02:46:17.630 --> 02:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't touch Medicaid Medicare any any
 
02:46:19.670 --> 02:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
of the Hot Topic issues it's just in
 
02:46:23.269 --> 02:46:23.279 align:start position:0%
support of proposing this legislation to
 
02:46:26.389 --> 02:46:26.399 align:start position:0%
Congress okay representative Sweeney um
 
02:46:28.110 --> 02:46:28.120 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask that you get with
 
02:46:32.590 --> 02:46:32.600 align:start position:0%
representative Manion because he is uh a
 
02:46:34.910 --> 02:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
a go-to guy with with for amendments
 
02:46:37.469 --> 02:46:37.479 align:start position:0%
perfect um so we want to make sure that
 
02:46:39.510 --> 02:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
the wording you want us to take up
 
02:46:41.070 --> 02:46:41.080 align:start position:0%
during our exec session which we're
 
02:46:45.230 --> 02:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
getting into um is properly uh
 
02:46:48.269 --> 02:46:48.279 align:start position:0%
understood and introduced so um we are
 
02:46:50.590 --> 02:46:50.600 align:start position:0%
going to recess and come back to exec
 
02:46:53.150 --> 02:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
session um so if you can get with reps
 
02:46:55.550 --> 02:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
some Manion on that so that we make sure
 
02:46:58.110 --> 02:46:58.120 align:start position:0%
we have the amendment now this what I'm
 
02:46:59.870 --> 02:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
looking at here is not an approved
 
02:47:03.070 --> 02:47:03.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh no it is not so and that
 
02:47:05.950 --> 02:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
and that is simply that is a copy of the
 
02:47:08.790 --> 02:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
act that we want to go for congress it's
 
02:47:10.389 --> 02:47:10.399 align:start position:0%
the title of it is the only thing that's
 
02:47:12.429 --> 02:47:12.439 align:start position:0%
changing in this resolution so the
 
02:47:13.870 --> 02:47:13.880 align:start position:0%
resolution is staying the same except
 
02:47:17.070 --> 02:47:17.080 align:start position:0%
the title through Prosperity Act is
 
02:47:19.950 --> 02:47:19.960 align:start position:0%
changing to the extended patent term act
 
02:47:22.230 --> 02:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
that's on that bill that's on that paper
 
02:47:26.750 --> 02:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
okay now we can't we we can't um we
 
02:47:31.070 --> 02:47:31.080 align:start position:0%
need a formal amendment I no an OS is is
 
02:47:32.469 --> 02:47:32.479 align:start position:0%
getting it drafted I just don't have the
 
02:47:34.389 --> 02:47:34.399 align:start position:0%
copy of it yet from all us okay that
 
02:47:36.230 --> 02:47:36.240 align:start position:0%

02:47:39.990 --> 02:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
though U to get with representative

02:47:45.510 --> 02:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
can't take it up
 
02:47:45.520 --> 02:47:48.110 align:start position:0%

Mr chairman um the first line of the

bill says the World Health Organization
 
03:47:57.790 --> 03:47:57.800 align:start position:0%
shall have no jurisdiction in New
 
03:47:59.590 --> 03:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire do they currently have
 
03:48:01.750 --> 03:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction in New
 
03:48:05.070 --> 03:48:05.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh currently no uh the idea
 
03:48:07.309 --> 03:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
here is in case we enter into any kind
 
03:48:09.030 --> 03:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
of treaties or something in the future
 
03:48:11.790 --> 03:48:11.800 align:start position:0%
that may give them Supremacy over the
 
03:48:14.550 --> 03:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
state okay thank you thank you Mr
 
03:48:16.750 --> 03:48:16.760 align:start position:0%
chairman so this is preemptive language
 
03:48:18.309 --> 03:48:18.319 align:start position:0%
kind of to representative shortless
 
03:48:20.389 --> 03:48:20.399 align:start position:0%
Point preemptive
 
03:48:20.399 --> 03:48:22.110 align:start position:0%
Point preemptive
yes

03:48:22.110 --> 03:48:22.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:48:22.120 --> 03:48:35.990 align:start position:0%
yes
okay

03:48:35.990 --> 03:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:39.510 --> 03:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh R man what uh what else would you
 
03:48:41.110 --> 03:48:41.120 align:start position:0%
like to say with regard to your
 
03:48:43.149 --> 03:48:43.159 align:start position:0%
Amendment so this the amendment is
 
03:48:44.349 --> 03:48:44.359 align:start position:0%
pretty much the same bill that we've
 
03:48:46.469 --> 03:48:46.479 align:start position:0%
already seen except it removes all the
 
03:48:48.389 --> 03:48:48.399 align:start position:0%
uh references to the central Centers for
 
03:48:50.510 --> 03:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
Disease Control and specifically focuses
 
03:48:52.710 --> 03:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
on the World Health Organization uh the
 
03:48:55.469 --> 03:48:55.479 align:start position:0%
idea here is that uh trying to limit the
 
03:48:57.510 --> 03:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
CDC there are arguments especially some
 
03:48:58.990 --> 03:48:59.000 align:start position:0%
of the emails we've seen from nurses and
 
03:49:00.269 --> 03:49:00.279 align:start position:0%
such saying that there could be
 
03:49:02.030 --> 03:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
potential problems with the even uh you
 
03:49:03.830 --> 03:49:03.840 align:start position:0%
know rudimentary things that we use
 
03:49:06.030 --> 03:49:06.040 align:start position:0%
every day that cite the CDC it wouldn't
 
03:49:07.110 --> 03:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
be great but the World Health
 
03:49:12.830 --> 03:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:14.910 --> 03:49:14.920 align:start position:0%
Organization represent LE anything to
 
03:49:16.710 --> 03:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
your second I'll concur with that I
 
03:49:21.030 --> 03:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:24.590 --> 03:49:24.600 align:start position:0%
man okay I have just a quick comment on
 
03:49:28.469 --> 03:49:28.479 align:start position:0%
the amendment um the original measure
 
03:49:32.750 --> 03:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
the resolution uh basically specifically
 
03:49:35.910 --> 03:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned the CDC and the wh and
 
03:49:38.309 --> 03:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
concerns about overreach by them
 
03:49:41.149 --> 03:49:41.159 align:start position:0%
obviously related to the uh Co
 
03:49:44.830 --> 03:49:44.840 align:start position:0%
pandemic um the
 
03:49:48.870 --> 03:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
amendment takes out the CDC part and
 
03:49:53.790 --> 03:49:53.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:57.030 --> 03:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
wh uh Mr chairman I think it's as you
 
03:49:57.040 --> 03:49:58.510 align:start position:0%
wh uh Mr chairman I think it's as you
were

03:49:58.510 --> 03:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
were
 
03:50:02.269 --> 03:50:02.279 align:start position:0%
it's I think um the amendment takes out
 
03:50:04.510 --> 03:50:04.520 align:start position:0%
the World Health Organization and no no
 
03:50:07.149 --> 03:50:07.159 align:start position:0%
no it removes the CDC and relieves world
 
03:50:08.790 --> 03:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
where the idea is that we're trying to
 
03:50:11.189 --> 03:50:11.199 align:start position:0%
uh keep the World Health Organization
 
03:50:13.030 --> 03:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
out of influencing the state politics
 
03:50:15.229 --> 03:50:15.239 align:start position:0%
things along those nature so like we we
 
03:50:16.990 --> 03:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
left the CDC we we removed it from the
 
03:50:18.870 --> 03:50:18.880 align:start position:0%
bill so that it no longer affects them
 
03:50:20.030 --> 03:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
it only affects World Health
 
03:50:23.550 --> 03:50:23.560 align:start position:0%
Organization I sit corrected so I
 
03:50:25.990 --> 03:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
understand the animist the concerns we
 
03:50:29.149 --> 03:50:29.159 align:start position:0%
we heard a lot a lot a lot of testimony
 
03:50:31.870 --> 03:50:31.880 align:start position:0%
about uh perceived real or imagined uh
 
03:50:35.149 --> 03:50:35.159 align:start position:0%
overreach by the CDC during the uh
 
03:50:38.030 --> 03:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic and subsequent to the Bas when
 
03:50:41.710 --> 03:50:41.720 align:start position:0%
the pandemic ended or or petered out
 
03:50:43.630 --> 03:50:43.640 align:start position:0%
however you want to put it uh in
 
03:50:46.510 --> 03:50:46.520 align:start position:0%
retrospect a lot of the CDC uh policies
 
03:50:49.309 --> 03:50:49.319 align:start position:0%
recommendations mandates in some cases
 
03:50:51.790 --> 03:50:51.800 align:start position:0%
uh were found to be faulty at least in
 
03:50:53.950 --> 03:50:53.960 align:start position:0%
the minds of uh many people healthc Care
 
03:50:57.429 --> 03:50:57.439 align:start position:0%
Professionals and or not so
 
03:50:59.670 --> 03:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
understandably the the folks who thought
 
03:51:01.990 --> 03:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
that the CDC overreached uh that was
 
03:51:04.269 --> 03:51:04.279 align:start position:0%
part of the reason for the resolution
 
03:51:07.630 --> 03:51:07.640 align:start position:0%
the the problem in terms of sovereignty
 
03:51:11.630 --> 03:51:11.640 align:start position:0%
um for me is the CDC is part of our
 
03:51:14.550 --> 03:51:14.560 align:start position:0%
Sovereign government uh it's it's
 
03:51:17.870 --> 03:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
American it's part of our government the
 
03:51:21.469 --> 03:51:21.479 align:start position:0%
wh uh is not the who as we heard uh
 
03:51:23.550 --> 03:51:23.560 align:start position:0%
someone testified there was it was a
 
03:51:25.510 --> 03:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
communist who was the head of it I you
 
03:51:27.670 --> 03:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
know that was some of the testimony that
 
03:51:29.030 --> 03:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
we heard on the
 
03:51:32.030 --> 03:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
who so I support the amendment I
 
03:51:33.990 --> 03:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
understand the problems with the CDC but
 
03:51:37.750 --> 03:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
I support the amendment because the who
 
03:51:40.189 --> 03:51:40.199 align:start position:0%
clearly clearly
 
03:51:42.550 --> 03:51:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh does does not and in my opinion
 
03:51:45.070 --> 03:51:45.080 align:start position:0%
should not have sovereignty the who
 
03:51:48.070 --> 03:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
should not be dictating uh medical
 
03:51:53.510 --> 03:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
policy to uh States or organizations in
 
03:51:55.030 --> 03:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
the United States so I support the
 
03:51:59.309 --> 03:51:59.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:01.910 --> 03:52:01.920 align:start position:0%

representative spear thank you
 
03:52:43.710 --> 03:52:43.720 align:start position:0%
uh my understanding is and of course I'm
 
03:52:45.990 --> 03:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
not an expert but I've been around the
 
03:52:48.790 --> 03:52:48.800 align:start position:0%
block on this a little bit states are
 
03:52:52.429 --> 03:52:52.439 align:start position:0%
not allowed to enter into any kind of
 
03:52:54.990 --> 03:52:55.000 align:start position:0%
treaty with a foreign government nor are
 
03:52:58.269 --> 03:52:58.279 align:start position:0%
they allowed to cancel a treaty that the
 
03:53:01.070 --> 03:53:01.080 align:start position:0%
federal government makes with a foreign
 
03:53:05.590 --> 03:53:05.600 align:start position:0%
government so the basis for claiming
 
03:53:09.269 --> 03:53:09.279 align:start position:0%
that we can't that we can Outlaw a
 
03:53:11.630 --> 03:53:11.640 align:start position:0%
treaty that may have been set up that
 
03:53:15.110 --> 03:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
has a an hwo component to it I'm not
 
03:53:17.229 --> 03:53:17.239 align:start position:0%
sure you can do
 
03:53:20.110 --> 03:53:20.120 align:start position:0%
that and this is an HB this is not a
 
03:53:22.910 --> 03:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
resolution it is a house bill so that
 
03:53:24.389 --> 03:53:24.399 align:start position:0%
would be
 
03:53:27.070 --> 03:53:27.080 align:start position:0%
statutory that that is a fair
 
03:53:29.670 --> 03:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
observation other
 
03:53:32.510 --> 03:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
thoughts rent shortliffe
 
03:53:35.229 --> 03:53:35.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh with all due
 
03:53:38.389 --> 03:53:38.399 align:start position:0%
respect to the bill sponsor the World
 
03:53:40.750 --> 03:53:40.760 align:start position:0%
Health organiz oration was created in
 
03:53:45.269 --> 03:53:45.279 align:start position:0%
1946 or 48 and that past 76 years there
 
03:53:47.070 --> 03:53:47.080 align:start position:0%
never been a problem and I think this is
 
03:53:49.189 --> 03:53:49.199 align:start position:0%
kind of a little bit of overreach if
 
03:53:50.750 --> 03:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
there's an issue then address it but
 
03:53:52.189 --> 03:53:52.199 align:start position:0%
there hasn't been and I don't
 
03:53:57.070 --> 03:53:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:00.269 --> 03:54:00.279 align:start position:0%
chairman there was a lot of uh again
 
03:54:02.229 --> 03:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
this is exact session there was a great
 
03:54:06.910 --> 03:54:06.920 align:start position:0%
deal of testimony um from people the uh
 
03:54:09.229 --> 03:54:09.239 align:start position:0%
the doctor who spoke at Great l about
 
03:54:11.309 --> 03:54:11.319 align:start position:0%
the who
 
03:54:15.349 --> 03:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
uh seemed to cite some specific concerns
 
03:54:18.030 --> 03:54:18.040 align:start position:0%
that that she had with the who in
 
03:54:20.990 --> 03:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
particular that that did resonate with
 
03:54:21.000 --> 03:54:21.670 align:start position:0%
particular that that did resonate with
with

03:54:21.670 --> 03:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:54:24.269 --> 03:54:24.279 align:start position:0%
me any uh other other thoughts
 
03:54:27.429 --> 03:54:27.439 align:start position:0%
representive Lloyd um I'm just uh thank
 
03:54:29.590 --> 03:54:29.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um I'm just thinking
 
03:54:31.990 --> 03:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
back to some of the testimony that she
 
03:54:34.950 --> 03:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
actually gave and in one of those uh one
 
03:54:37.149 --> 03:54:37.159 align:start position:0%
of those lines it did claim that there
 
03:54:40.630 --> 03:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
was still sovereignty for our government
 
03:54:42.830 --> 03:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
um within that treaty that would be
 
03:54:44.790 --> 03:54:44.800 align:start position:0%
going through I thought that's one of
 
03:54:46.630 --> 03:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
the lines that we had picked out when we
 
03:54:48.429 --> 03:54:48.439 align:start position:0%
were going through
 
03:54:52.070 --> 03:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:59.030 --> 03:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:02.189 --> 03:55:02.199 align:start position:0%
up thank you I'm to a guest here so I
 
03:55:04.590 --> 03:55:04.600 align:start position:0%
take too long but I'm concerned although
 
03:55:07.030 --> 03:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
I think the bill stops doesn't go quite
 
03:55:08.910 --> 03:55:08.920 align:start position:0%
far enough for this problem to crop up
 
03:55:10.710 --> 03:55:10.720 align:start position:0%
but that may be still part of the intent
 
03:55:13.750 --> 03:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
of it which is this would prevent um
 
03:55:15.790 --> 03:55:15.800 align:start position:0%
public this would prent certain uh
 
03:55:17.389 --> 03:55:17.399 align:start position:0%
public entities in the state from you
 
03:55:19.670 --> 03:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
know collaborating or contributing to
 
03:55:22.070 --> 03:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
research in which the who is required of
 
03:55:23.750 --> 03:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
which there is always a lot especially
 
03:55:27.149 --> 03:55:27.159 align:start position:0%
during during the pandemic which uh
 
03:55:28.590 --> 03:55:28.600 align:start position:0%
which I think is still going on but
 
03:55:30.630 --> 03:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
that's just my opinion um certainly
 
03:55:34.149 --> 03:55:34.159 align:start position:0%
specifically for example the uh HHS also
 
03:55:36.429 --> 03:55:36.439 align:start position:0%
the secretary the vital records unit
 
03:55:37.830 --> 03:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
which is under the Secretary of State's
 
03:55:39.950 --> 03:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
office um lacks a lot of data and then
 
03:55:42.229 --> 03:55:42.239 align:start position:0%
also quazi public entities would
 
03:55:45.790 --> 03:55:45.800 align:start position:0%
certainly include the uh member the
 
03:55:47.590 --> 03:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
member institutions of the University
 
03:55:50.030 --> 03:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
system in both UNH and Plymouth state in
 
03:55:53.469 --> 03:55:53.479 align:start position:0%
particular had extensive research uh
 
03:55:55.389 --> 03:55:55.399 align:start position:0%
programs and other programs connected
 
03:55:58.110 --> 03:55:58.120 align:start position:0%
with the pandemic so I think uh I mean I
 
03:55:59.429 --> 03:55:59.439 align:start position:0%
don't think this would actually prevent
 
03:55:59.439 --> 03:56:01.229 align:start position:0%
don't think this would actually prevent
them

03:56:01.229 --> 03:56:01.239 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:56:04.070 --> 03:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
from from doing doing that sort of work
 
03:56:06.030 --> 03:56:06.040 align:start position:0%
but I still think I would not want to
 
03:56:07.750 --> 03:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
take the chance of somehow we forbidden
 
03:56:09.349 --> 03:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
them from you know
 
03:56:11.149 --> 03:56:11.159 align:start position:0%
collaborating in other health issues
 
03:56:13.630 --> 03:56:13.640 align:start position:0%
that crop up in the future so
 
03:56:15.830 --> 03:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you representative uh
 
03:56:15.840 --> 03:56:16.750 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you representative uh
representative

03:56:16.750 --> 03:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:56:20.349 --> 03:56:20.359 align:start position:0%
levit I feel this is a preemptive bill I
 
03:56:23.670 --> 03:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
mean our states were Sovereign um I
 
03:56:25.550 --> 03:56:25.560 align:start position:0%
don't think that
 
03:56:33.429 --> 03:56:33.439 align:start position:0%
um you know what the who um fears or how
 
03:56:39.510 --> 03:56:39.520 align:start position:0%
about um a dictates would um be
 
03:56:43.149 --> 03:56:43.159 align:start position:0%
um divulged into or mandated by the
 
03:56:44.710 --> 03:56:44.720 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire so I just think
 
03:56:48.030 --> 03:56:48.040 align:start position:0%
it's a pre preemptive Bill and I'm going
 
03:56:50.950 --> 03:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:53.030 --> 03:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
one other
 
03:56:56.550 --> 03:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
comments we have a motion on the floor
 
03:56:56.560 --> 03:56:58.349 align:start position:0%
comments we have a motion on the floor
to

03:56:58.349 --> 03:56:58.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:57:02.349 --> 03:57:02.359 align:start position:0%
amend and before we call the role on the
 
03:57:04.510 --> 03:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
amendment I do want to point out as I
 
03:57:07.229 --> 03:57:07.239 align:start position:0%
pointed out at the last exec session
 
03:57:09.790 --> 03:57:09.800 align:start position:0%
oftentimes amendments
 
03:57:11.790 --> 03:57:11.800 align:start position:0%
uh every amendment is intended to
 
03:57:13.189 --> 03:57:13.199 align:start position:0%
approve the measure whether you agree
 
03:57:16.349 --> 03:57:16.359 align:start position:0%
with or not most cases uh a good case is
 
03:57:18.269 --> 03:57:18.279 align:start position:0%
made for the amendment the the case made
 
03:57:20.309 --> 03:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
here was in terms of sovereignty there's
 
03:57:23.269 --> 03:57:23.279 align:start position:0%
a stronger case to be made for focusing
 
03:57:26.910 --> 03:57:26.920 align:start position:0%
on the who in terms of sovereignty
 
03:57:28.750 --> 03:57:28.760 align:start position:0%
issues as opposed to the
 
03:57:33.030 --> 03:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
CDC so taking the CDC out uh as the
 
03:57:36.550 --> 03:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
amendment does uh should should address
 
03:57:38.189 --> 03:57:38.199 align:start position:0%
I think some of the concerns that raised
 
03:57:41.590 --> 03:57:41.600 align:start position:0%
so whether or not the ultimate you can
 
03:57:45.189 --> 03:57:45.199 align:start position:0%
ultimately support otpa if it is amended
 
03:57:46.950 --> 03:57:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh I hope I hope that they can be some
 
03:57:49.149 --> 03:57:49.159 align:start position:0%
support for this amendment moving
 
03:57:52.070 --> 03:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
forward last call for comments before we
 
03:57:54.030 --> 03:57:54.040 align:start position:0%

discussion on the amendment as a whole
 
04:00:26.870 --> 04:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
but uh R man would you like to speak to
 
04:00:28.710 --> 04:00:28.720 align:start position:0%
your a lot of the stuff that we already
 
04:00:30.389 --> 04:00:30.399 align:start position:0%
covered I thought there was it covered
 
04:00:32.070 --> 04:00:32.080 align:start position:0%
very well one of the mentioning of
 
04:00:33.990 --> 04:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
treaties like uh if we move into a
 
04:00:35.349 --> 04:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
situation where the United States starts
 
04:00:37.389 --> 04:00:37.399 align:start position:0%
entering into these treaties that
 
04:00:38.870 --> 04:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
adversely affect the the population of
 
04:00:40.550 --> 04:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
the United States we should we should as
 
04:00:42.630 --> 04:00:42.640 align:start position:0%
a state do everything in our power to
 
04:00:44.910 --> 04:00:44.920 align:start position:0%
restrict that not only Federal overreach
 
04:00:46.670 --> 04:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
but it's International overreach into
 
04:00:50.189 --> 04:00:50.199 align:start position:0%
the very you know day-to-day lives of us
 
04:00:51.830 --> 04:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
and we should be pushing back against
 
04:00:53.229 --> 04:00:53.239 align:start position:0%
that and you know if we have to call on
 
04:00:56.630 --> 04:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
Article Five to uh revoke our uh treaty
 
04:00:58.790 --> 04:00:58.800 align:start position:0%
binding to the state so be it but I
 
04:01:01.670 --> 04:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
think this is a good start
 
04:01:03.910 --> 04:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
here thank you representative I I share
 
04:01:06.189 --> 04:01:06.199 align:start position:0%
your sentiments uh representative Lev to
 
04:01:06.199 --> 04:01:07.229 align:start position:0%
your sentiments uh representative Lev to
your

04:01:07.229 --> 04:01:07.239 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:01:10.630 --> 04:01:10.640 align:start position:0%
second I concur I mean we you know again
 
04:01:12.429 --> 04:01:12.439 align:start position:0%
this is preemptive but I think it works
 
04:01:19.070 --> 04:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:22.229 --> 04:01:22.239 align:start position:0%
State other thoughts re CRA your red
 
04:01:24.870 --> 04:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
lights on oh yeah oh I'm sorry I kind of
 
04:01:27.670 --> 04:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
left it on yeah I do have a thought it
 
04:01:29.870 --> 04:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
was brought up during the hearing about
 
04:01:32.030 --> 04:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement of this
 
04:01:34.429 --> 04:01:34.439 align:start position:0%
legislation and we were told that it
 
04:01:38.229 --> 04:01:38.239 align:start position:0%
would be the people and um yeah I'm not
 
04:01:40.229 --> 04:01:40.239 align:start position:0%
going to vote for this cuz I believe
 
04:01:43.550 --> 04:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
that's a dangerous precedent to or I
 
04:01:45.510 --> 04:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
mean it's yeah it's a dangerous
 
04:01:48.510 --> 04:01:48.520 align:start position:0%
precedent to set yeah being a house bill
 
04:01:50.229 --> 04:01:50.239 align:start position:0%
so thank
 
04:01:53.349 --> 04:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative uh
 
04:01:55.710 --> 04:01:55.720 align:start position:0%
representative Lloyd I just feel like
 
04:01:58.790 --> 04:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
rejecting the guidance of the who in New
 
04:02:00.790 --> 04:02:00.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire really undermines Public
 
04:02:02.750 --> 04:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
Health efforts and promotes in
 
04:02:04.630 --> 04:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
misinformation during a potentially
 
04:02:07.630 --> 04:02:07.640 align:start position:0%
troubling time and confusing time um if
 
04:02:11.149 --> 04:02:11.159 align:start position:0%
we look back at the covid uh pandemic
 
04:02:14.189 --> 04:02:14.199 align:start position:0%
like hindsight is 2020 you know we're
 
04:02:16.950 --> 04:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
finding out things that yeah you know I
 
04:02:19.630 --> 04:02:19.640 align:start position:0%
may regret disinfecting all of my
 
04:02:20.870 --> 04:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
groceries that were brought into the
 
04:02:23.990 --> 04:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
house but I mean we science changes as
 
04:02:26.550 --> 04:02:26.560 align:start position:0%
things go on and this jeopardizes the
 
04:02:29.990 --> 04:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
safety and well-being of residents and
 
04:02:32.349 --> 04:02:32.359 align:start position:0%
collaboration with um reputable health
 
04:02:35.429 --> 04:02:35.439 align:start position:0%
organizations is essential for
 
04:02:37.790 --> 04:02:37.800 align:start position:0%
effectively addressing Health crises and
 
04:02:39.830 --> 04:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
Protec in the population from infectious
 
04:02:42.910 --> 04:02:42.920 align:start position:0%
diseases I mean it's just it it we need
 
04:02:45.309 --> 04:02:45.319 align:start position:0%
that guidance sometimes especially when
 
04:02:47.630 --> 04:02:47.640 align:start position:0%
people are really nervous and really
 
04:02:49.710 --> 04:02:49.720 align:start position:0%
upset I'm sure that when a woman walked
 
04:02:51.229 --> 04:02:51.239 align:start position:0%
into my doctor's appointment wearing
 
04:02:54.670 --> 04:02:54.680 align:start position:0%
trash bags you know um she probably
 
04:02:56.670 --> 04:02:56.680 align:start position:0%
regrets that decision now but hindsight
 
04:02:58.950 --> 04:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
is 2020 and you know everybody was
 
04:03:00.550 --> 04:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
nervous and everybody was
 
04:03:03.309 --> 04:03:03.319 align:start position:0%
scared thank you represent of I don't I
 
04:03:08.349 --> 04:03:08.359 align:start position:0%
don't as I read this uh amended measure
 
04:03:11.349 --> 04:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
I don't see it as rejecting The Who per
 
04:03:14.550 --> 04:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
se I I think it's a sovereignty issue I
 
04:03:18.830 --> 04:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
I see it as a statement that the who
 
04:03:21.630 --> 04:03:21.640 align:start position:0%
does not have uh you know the power to
 
04:03:26.349 --> 04:03:26.359 align:start position:0%
mandate policies in this country um I I
 
04:03:29.149 --> 04:03:29.159 align:start position:0%
agree that there there is some Services
 
04:03:31.670 --> 04:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
some information they can provide it it
 
04:03:34.030 --> 04:03:34.040 align:start position:0%
for us to take at our discretion so I
 
04:03:37.309 --> 04:03:37.319 align:start position:0%
don't see it as us rejecting the who I
 
04:03:39.910 --> 04:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
do see it as an affirmation of our
 
04:03:42.990 --> 04:03:43.000 align:start position:0%
sovereignty um rep Manan does that is
 
04:03:45.309 --> 04:03:45.319 align:start position:0%
that square with your yeah and the one
 
04:03:46.910 --> 04:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
thing I would say is like so we have uh
 
04:03:48.910 --> 04:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
like first order uh when the infection
 
04:03:50.070 --> 04:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
spreads everybody's going to get sick
 
04:03:51.110 --> 04:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
and all that but then a lot of these
 
04:03:52.670 --> 04:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
countries were especially coming from
 
04:03:55.149 --> 04:03:55.159 align:start position:0%
China they had these uh as I think it
 
04:03:57.590 --> 04:03:57.600 align:start position:0%
was representative um beler was talking
 
04:04:00.189 --> 04:04:00.199 align:start position:0%
about how they uh amped up the fear to
 
04:04:02.510 --> 04:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
get us to change our policies and the
 
04:04:04.309 --> 04:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
World Health Organization went along
 
04:04:06.429 --> 04:04:06.439 align:start position:0%
with like these Chinese demonstrated
 
04:04:08.870 --> 04:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
policies that were very damaging to like
 
04:04:10.790 --> 04:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
families livelihoods and second order
 
04:04:12.070 --> 04:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
effects where people were just too
 
04:04:14.070 --> 04:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
scared to go to the doctor because they
 
04:04:15.389 --> 04:04:15.399 align:start position:0%
were afraid they were going to drop dead
 
04:04:16.790 --> 04:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
in the street so there there's going to
 
04:04:18.510 --> 04:04:18.520 align:start position:0%
be people now as we're seeing as the
 
04:04:19.870 --> 04:04:19.880 align:start position:0%
years go on that are going to die of
 
04:04:21.950 --> 04:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
preventable diseases that they didn't go
 
04:04:23.389 --> 04:04:23.399 align:start position:0%
get treated because they were terrified
 
04:04:25.149 --> 04:04:25.159 align:start position:0%
out of their minds that they were going
 
04:04:27.429 --> 04:04:27.439 align:start position:0%
to drop dead in the streets but
 
04:04:28.990 --> 04:04:29.000 align:start position:0%
represent Manion to representative
 
04:04:31.030 --> 04:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
Lloyd's point do do you see this as a
 
04:04:34.510 --> 04:04:34.520 align:start position:0%
rejection of the wh wh per se I wouldn't
 
04:04:36.389 --> 04:04:36.399 align:start position:0%
say no I wouldn't say it's a rejection
 
04:04:38.269 --> 04:04:38.279 align:start position:0%
of the who the individual people people
 
04:04:40.750 --> 04:04:40.760 align:start position:0%
like whoever wants to go and listen
 
04:04:42.189 --> 04:04:42.199 align:start position:0%
their guidance that you know that
 
04:04:43.229 --> 04:04:43.239 align:start position:0%
information is going to be published on
 
04:04:44.790 --> 04:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
the internet every individual's uh
 
04:04:46.750 --> 04:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
ability to make their own choice is not
 
04:04:48.389 --> 04:04:48.399 align:start position:0%
restricted here it just restricts
 
04:04:51.269 --> 04:04:51.279 align:start position:0%
government from uh and listening to the
 
04:04:53.590 --> 04:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
World Health World Health World health
 
04:04:55.189 --> 04:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
organizations recommendations and
 
04:04:57.349 --> 04:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
implementing uh MK mandates vaccine
 
04:04:59.149 --> 04:04:59.159 align:start position:0%
mandates whatever it may be following
 
04:05:01.070 --> 04:05:01.080 align:start position:0%
their guidance which can't be
 
04:05:03.990 --> 04:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
trusted Lloyd did you have a a finger up
 
04:05:06.189 --> 04:05:06.199 align:start position:0%
um yeah just to point out again that
 
04:05:09.550 --> 04:05:09.560 align:start position:0%
this is a bill and not a resolution and
 
04:05:10.830 --> 04:05:10.840 align:start position:0%
that's my that's one of my biggest
 
04:05:13.389 --> 04:05:13.399 align:start position:0%
concerns with all of this here um is
 
04:05:17.389 --> 04:05:17.399 align:start position:0%
that there are legally binding uh things
 
04:05:19.189 --> 04:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
that happen with this
 
04:05:21.510 --> 04:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
so yes there is that distinction which
 
04:05:25.070 --> 04:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
we pointed out representative uh cot as
 
04:05:28.110 --> 04:05:28.120 align:start position:0%
we've kind of established today it seems
 
04:05:30.469 --> 04:05:30.479 align:start position:0%
this would affect the VA then I'm saying
 
04:05:32.670 --> 04:05:32.680 align:start position:0%
like my husband went to the VA to get
 
04:05:33.990 --> 04:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
his covid
 
04:05:36.750 --> 04:05:36.760 align:start position:0%
shot um instead of doing the National
 
04:05:38.950 --> 04:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
Guard thing he was able to go to the VA
 
04:05:40.790 --> 04:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
he always puts things off anyway doesn't
 
04:05:43.590 --> 04:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
work but he went to the VA and got it
 
04:05:45.550 --> 04:05:45.560 align:start position:0%
done like immediately and it was very
 
04:05:48.429 --> 04:05:48.439 align:start position:0%
effect of so would he not be able to do
 
04:05:50.910 --> 04:05:50.920 align:start position:0%
that then that's that's a government
 
04:05:52.670 --> 04:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
entity well this says specifically for
 
04:05:54.110 --> 04:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire and our the state and
 
04:05:55.670 --> 04:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
its political subdivision so like the
 
04:05:57.910 --> 04:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
the VA would be a federal uh healthc
 
04:06:00.149 --> 04:06:00.159 align:start position:0%
care facility that we can't really do
 
04:06:03.790 --> 04:06:03.800 align:start position:0%
much about okay represent
 
04:06:06.469 --> 04:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
spear thank you uh not having heard the
 
04:06:09.469 --> 04:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
hearing and I so I would appreciate a
 
04:06:11.750 --> 04:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
clarification it doesn't quite read like
 
04:06:14.750 --> 04:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
a bill and in a bill if you mandate
 
04:06:16.870 --> 04:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
something then you're supposed to see a
 
04:06:19.030 --> 04:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
penalty if you don't do that and so I
 
04:06:22.750 --> 04:06:22.760 align:start position:0%
don't see any enforcement capability in
 
04:06:22.760 --> 04:06:23.670 align:start position:0%
don't see any enforcement capability in
this

04:06:23.670 --> 04:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:06:26.189 --> 04:06:26.199 align:start position:0%
bill and so therefore it really doesn't
 
04:06:29.429 --> 04:06:29.439 align:start position:0%
Define itself as a as a legal bill
 
04:06:32.950 --> 04:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
format so do you have any comment about
 
04:06:35.870 --> 04:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
that yeah thank you repres that's a fair
 
04:06:38.590 --> 04:06:38.600 align:start position:0%
observation uh the the language is what
 
04:06:42.030 --> 04:06:42.040 align:start position:0%
it is uh that question has come up
 
04:06:44.710 --> 04:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
before we did look at the language we
 
04:06:47.389 --> 04:06:47.399 align:start position:0%
did amend it but the the extent of the
 
04:06:49.870 --> 04:06:49.880 align:start position:0%
amending process that we did or that was
 
04:06:53.590 --> 04:06:53.600 align:start position:0%
done uh focused on uh The Who as opposed
 
04:06:55.830 --> 04:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
to the CDC so the enforcement mechanism
 
04:06:59.590 --> 04:06:59.600 align:start position:0%
issue still is is uh is obviously an
 
04:07:00.790 --> 04:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
issue for some folks like you just
 
04:07:03.229 --> 04:07:03.239 align:start position:0%
pointed out so what do we do about that
 
04:07:04.830 --> 04:07:04.840 align:start position:0%
I mean can you pass something that isn't
 
04:07:08.309 --> 04:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
really a bill exactly we have a uh a
 
04:07:09.990 --> 04:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor and it's been
 
04:07:11.590 --> 04:07:11.600 align:start position:0%
amended once so at this point in the
 
04:07:15.269 --> 04:07:15.279 align:start position:0%
process uh we have to uh go yay or nay
 
04:07:19.309 --> 04:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
on on the motion which is uh
 
04:07:24.309 --> 04:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
otpa anything else representative uh
 
04:07:27.149 --> 04:07:27.159 align:start position:0%
Lane thank you Mr chair I just wanted to
 
04:07:29.750 --> 04:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
Echo some of the other concerns because
 
04:07:32.510 --> 04:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
the last P the last sentence is is
 
04:07:35.830 --> 04:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
troubles me in the sense it says no
 
04:07:40.189 --> 04:07:40.199 align:start position:0%
shall not be used there's no option and
 
04:07:41.910 --> 04:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
I thought I heard several people
 
04:07:45.229 --> 04:07:45.239 align:start position:0%
indicate well you can the state has the
 
04:07:48.349 --> 04:07:48.359 align:start position:0%
option and the word shell leaves no
 
04:07:53.710 --> 04:07:53.720 align:start position:0%
option so we the the state cannot use
 
04:07:56.710 --> 04:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
any of the World Health Organization
 
04:08:01.429 --> 04:08:01.439 align:start position:0%
data information to justify any mask
 
04:08:04.469 --> 04:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
vaccine or medical testing requirements
 
04:08:06.229 --> 04:08:06.239 align:start position:0%
I mean they're drawing data from all
 
04:08:08.910 --> 04:08:08.920 align:start position:0%
over the world and and science does
 
04:08:11.070 --> 04:08:11.080 align:start position:0%
change and I guess I and it says and
 
04:08:13.389 --> 04:08:13.399 align:start position:0%
shall have no force or effect in New
 
04:08:16.309 --> 04:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I think it was
 
04:08:19.229 --> 04:08:19.239 align:start position:0%
representative Oregon who indicated that
 
04:08:21.590 --> 04:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
you know Public Health probably over
 
04:08:23.349 --> 04:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
over in new H the University of New
 
04:08:25.870 --> 04:08:25.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire probably use that data and use
 
04:08:28.790 --> 04:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
it to support a lot of things that they
 
04:08:31.710 --> 04:08:31.720 align:start position:0%
come up with so are we restricting them
 
04:08:33.670 --> 04:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
because reading this I would say we're
 
04:08:35.790 --> 04:08:35.800 align:start position:0%
telling them they cannot use that
 
04:08:38.750 --> 04:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
because it says shell
 
04:08:40.510 --> 04:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
I take that as a bit of a rhetorical
 
04:08:47.189 --> 04:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:50.109 --> 04:08:50.119 align:start position:0%
this someone had a a hand uh
 
04:08:53.030 --> 04:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative lren yeah my my point on
 
04:08:55.550 --> 04:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
that is if you read it is World Health
 
04:08:58.670 --> 04:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
Organization will mandate that we have
 
04:09:03.990 --> 04:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
to wear a mask vaccine or medical tests
 
04:09:07.229 --> 04:09:07.239 align:start position:0%
um that's why I think I'm definitely
 
04:09:09.070 --> 04:09:09.080 align:start position:0%
against said I don't want World Health
 
04:09:12.510 --> 04:09:12.520 align:start position:0%
Organization telling me what I should do
 
04:09:18.070 --> 04:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
um and follow the CDC um uh guidelines
 
04:09:20.630 --> 04:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
thank you and you say that is a medical
 
04:09:22.070 --> 04:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
professional you're you're in the
 
04:09:28.389 --> 04:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
business right yes sir uh Reon
 
04:09:30.790 --> 04:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
bogert turn
 
04:09:34.349 --> 04:09:34.359 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman uh and
 
04:09:37.630 --> 04:09:37.640 align:start position:0%
following up on that uh line8 nine and
 
04:09:41.269 --> 04:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
10 it says further more any requirements
 
04:09:43.510 --> 04:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
mandates and instructions by this
 
04:09:46.349 --> 04:09:46.359 align:start position:0%
organization shall not be used but it
 
04:09:49.670 --> 04:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
does not say that we cannot use the test
 
04:09:54.030 --> 04:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
data in order to further the research
 
04:09:56.269 --> 04:09:56.279 align:start position:0%
that is done here by
 
04:10:02.070 --> 04:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
rcdc it just states that if the uh
 
04:10:05.830 --> 04:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
wh the World Health Organization says
 
04:10:07.830 --> 04:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
you will get your shots and that's the
 
04:10:10.389 --> 04:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
end of the subject we don't have to
 
04:10:13.149 --> 04:10:13.159 align:start position:0%
follow it it says we're going to mandate
 
04:10:15.070 --> 04:10:15.080 align:start position:0%
y'all to do it we don't have to follow
 
04:10:18.469 --> 04:10:18.479 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't say we cannot take their
 
04:10:22.189 --> 04:10:22.199 align:start position:0%
research and validate it with our
 
04:10:25.189 --> 04:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
research being done at UNH and stuff
 
04:10:27.149 --> 04:10:27.159 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in here saying you can't
 
04:10:30.510 --> 04:10:30.520 align:start position:0%
take the data it just says you do not
 
04:10:33.990 --> 04:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
take the Mandate from them that you do
 
04:10:36.429 --> 04:10:36.439 align:start position:0%
what we tell you to do that's all it's
 
04:10:36.439 --> 04:10:37.950 align:start position:0%
what we tell you to do that's all it's
stated

04:10:37.950 --> 04:10:37.960 align:start position:0%
stated
 
04:10:39.510 --> 04:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
thank you represent B yes to
 
04:10:42.149 --> 04:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
representative Lane Lane's Point uh I
 
04:10:46.149 --> 04:10:46.159 align:start position:0%
read this is simply saying that
 
04:10:50.269 --> 04:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
W mandates um shall not be used in the
 
04:10:52.910 --> 04:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
state to justify in other words if
 
04:10:56.030 --> 04:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
you're a a school or a business or any
 
04:10:58.149 --> 04:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
entity and you want to put in a mask
 
04:11:00.429 --> 04:11:00.439 align:start position:0%
mandate that I think is a local decision
 
04:11:02.670 --> 04:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
but you can't according to this you
 
04:11:06.389 --> 04:11:06.399 align:start position:0%
can't use the Who as a sole
 
04:11:09.790 --> 04:11:09.800 align:start position:0%
justification a wh mandate is a sole
 
04:11:15.389 --> 04:11:15.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:19.229 --> 04:11:19.239 align:start position:0%
mandate okay uh representive Horgan yes
 
04:11:22.309 --> 04:11:22.319 align:start position:0%
we mentioned um we mentioned China I
 
04:11:24.389 --> 04:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
think China has three times the
 
04:11:26.070 --> 04:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
population of the US so they're even
 
04:11:27.429 --> 04:11:27.439 align:start position:0%
even though we're a very large country
 
04:11:29.790 --> 04:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
they're even bigger and I'm just from
 
04:11:31.950 --> 04:11:31.960 align:start position:0%
what I I tried to keep up I was going
 
04:11:33.429 --> 04:11:33.439 align:start position:0%
there as best I could which not very
 
04:11:35.670 --> 04:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
well they I think whatever they did was
 
04:11:38.229 --> 04:11:38.239 align:start position:0%
primarily directed at what was going on
 
04:11:41.030 --> 04:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
in China trying to uh stop the pandemic
 
04:11:42.590 --> 04:11:42.600 align:start position:0%
in China so I don't think they were
 
04:11:44.950 --> 04:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily trying to scare us as far as
 
04:11:46.590 --> 04:11:46.600 align:start position:0%
I know they the Chinese people pretty
 
04:11:49.109 --> 04:11:49.119 align:start position:0%
much Chinese government pretty much
 
04:11:51.910 --> 04:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
ignores us as long as we you know send
 
04:11:53.149 --> 04:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
as long as we like send them their
 
04:11:54.750 --> 04:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturing plants money I don't think
 
04:11:56.590 --> 04:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
they well that's not relevant to the no
 
04:11:58.830 --> 04:11:58.840 align:start position:0%
exactly fair enough yes but something is
 
04:12:00.550 --> 04:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
more relevant the lot the mass we got
 
04:12:03.149 --> 04:12:03.159 align:start position:0%
remember uh Dean Cayman flying the
 
04:12:06.070 --> 04:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
Manchester airport with all those ppes
 
04:12:07.790 --> 04:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
um those were all made in China and then
 
04:12:10.429 --> 04:12:10.439 align:start position:0%
a lot of the M devices are in fact made
 
04:12:12.870 --> 04:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
in China because they're a big part of a
 
04:12:15.710 --> 04:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
global economy and um and of course
 
04:12:17.910 --> 04:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
those masks are not 100% effective I bit
 
04:12:21.469 --> 04:12:21.479 align:start position:0%
that as for the vaccines okay again the
 
04:12:23.510 --> 04:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
the efficacy of The Masks is not the
 
04:12:25.830 --> 04:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
issue the issue is whether we want to
 
04:12:30.429 --> 04:12:30.439 align:start position:0%
allow or we want to uh have wh mandates
 
04:12:34.910 --> 04:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
uh subject to use to employ and enforce
 
04:12:37.229 --> 04:12:37.239 align:start position:0%
policies here yeah the V and the VAC
 
04:12:39.429 --> 04:12:39.439 align:start position:0%
vacines they've been blamed for every
 
04:12:41.830 --> 04:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
adverse Health thing that's happened to
 
04:12:43.510 --> 04:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
anybody in the United States or the
 
04:12:45.189 --> 04:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
world since the vaccines were started
 
04:12:47.269 --> 04:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
circulating I guess it was two years ago
 
04:12:49.469 --> 04:12:49.479 align:start position:0%
but those events happened during the
 
04:12:51.030 --> 04:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
pandemic and before and of course
 
04:12:52.149 --> 04:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
something we did have during the
 
04:12:53.990 --> 04:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic was a billion extra deaths just
 
04:12:56.469 --> 04:12:56.479 align:start position:0%
in the US from respiratory disease which
 
04:12:58.710 --> 04:12:58.720 align:start position:0%
is uh actually is much bigger than
 
04:13:01.229 --> 04:13:01.239 align:start position:0%
anything that's been tied rightly or
 
04:13:03.469 --> 04:13:03.479 align:start position:0%
wrongly to the basks or the vaccines but
 
04:13:06.229 --> 04:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
um so okay but anyway thank thank you
 
04:13:08.550 --> 04:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
for that reprentative
 
04:13:12.309 --> 04:13:12.319 align:start position:0%
other other uh representative Lloyd I'm
 
04:13:14.550 --> 04:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
just trying to recall everything during
 
04:13:17.710 --> 04:13:17.720 align:start position:0%
Co because um I mean for me it was very
 
04:13:19.510 --> 04:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
different than a lot of you I was in and
 
04:13:21.469 --> 04:13:21.479 align:start position:0%
out of the hospital constantly I had
 
04:13:24.910 --> 04:13:24.920 align:start position:0%
five surgeries throughout 20120 and um
 
04:13:27.389 --> 04:13:27.399 align:start position:0%
because you all masked because you all
 
04:13:29.830 --> 04:13:29.840 align:start position:0%
took precautions I was able to go into
 
04:13:32.349 --> 04:13:32.359 align:start position:0%
surgeries and not have to worry about
 
04:13:35.550 --> 04:13:35.560 align:start position:0%
whether or not I contracted covid so um
 
04:13:37.710 --> 04:13:37.720 align:start position:0%
there are positive effects for things
 
04:13:41.229 --> 04:13:41.239 align:start position:0%
but I'm kind of curious back during
 
04:13:44.550 --> 04:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
those days it wasn't just The Who that
 
04:13:48.229 --> 04:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
we were using for mandates it was a
 
04:13:51.950 --> 04:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
combination of um of people and of
 
04:13:54.070 --> 04:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
organizations that we were using in
 
04:13:57.309 --> 04:13:57.319 align:start position:0%
order to create mandates so it's not
 
04:14:01.429 --> 04:14:01.439 align:start position:0%
like doing this is not in my opinion
 
04:14:03.429 --> 04:14:03.439 align:start position:0%
going to help anything or further
 
04:14:05.469 --> 04:14:05.479 align:start position:0%
anything it it may potentially harm
 
04:14:08.269 --> 04:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
things by taking information away from
 
04:14:08.279 --> 04:14:09.710 align:start position:0%
things by taking information away from
the

04:14:09.710 --> 04:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:14:11.510 --> 04:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
public thank you
 
04:14:16.710 --> 04:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
representative uh representative b u you
 
04:14:16.720 --> 04:14:17.630 align:start position:0%
representative uh representative b u you
something

04:14:17.630 --> 04:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:14:21.269 --> 04:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:24.910 --> 04:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
and our society here in America depends
 
04:14:26.109 --> 04:14:26.119 align:start position:0%
on our
 
04:14:29.429 --> 04:14:29.439 align:start position:0%
CDC to give us directions and stuff so
 
04:14:33.070 --> 04:14:33.080 align:start position:0%
when the mass mandate came down it
 
04:14:36.189 --> 04:14:36.199 align:start position:0%
wasn't as the World Health Organization
 
04:14:39.990 --> 04:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
was pushing their their agenda the CDC
 
04:14:44.189 --> 04:14:44.199 align:start position:0%
was by an act of the presidents have
 
04:14:46.630 --> 04:14:46.640 align:start position:0%
given us that direction we should wear
 
04:14:49.870 --> 04:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
the mask and so the whole country as a
 
04:14:53.830 --> 04:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
whole following CDC not the World Health
 
04:14:58.750 --> 04:14:58.760 align:start position:0%
Organization wore masks then the Advent
 
04:15:02.429 --> 04:15:02.439 align:start position:0%
of the shots came into play and then
 
04:15:04.149 --> 04:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
that's where things started falling
 
04:15:05.990 --> 04:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
apart because the research
 
04:15:10.070 --> 04:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't being forthright and does and so
 
04:15:12.070 --> 04:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
now we having to follow something from
 
04:15:15.550 --> 04:15:15.560 align:start position:0%
the CDC mandate based on the World
 
04:15:18.590 --> 04:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
Health Organization mandate that says
 
04:15:21.309 --> 04:15:21.319 align:start position:0%
you're going to go do this when now it
 
04:15:24.750 --> 04:15:24.760 align:start position:0%
divided the society because there wasn't
 
04:15:31.429 --> 04:15:31.439 align:start position:0%
no data and and the FDC had did not uh
 
04:15:34.149 --> 04:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
qualify this drug that we were told to
 
04:15:37.990 --> 04:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
go take as a vaccine so
 
04:15:40.349 --> 04:15:40.359 align:start position:0%
this place here does not take any of
 
04:15:42.229 --> 04:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
that away it's the point I'm trying to
 
04:15:45.469 --> 04:15:45.479 align:start position:0%
say as long as our CDC stays
 
04:15:49.189 --> 04:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
intact then it gives direction for the
 
04:15:52.229 --> 04:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
American people to do so it doesn't
 
04:15:55.830 --> 04:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
undercut any medical situation it
 
04:15:58.590 --> 04:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't undercut any
 
04:16:01.550 --> 04:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
research because research is not a
 
04:16:03.910 --> 04:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
mandate that you have to do something it
 
04:16:07.070 --> 04:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
is just there so that you have the
 
04:16:10.309 --> 04:16:10.319 align:start position:0%
ability to incorporate that data into
 
04:16:13.710 --> 04:16:13.720 align:start position:0%
all the different data sets that are
 
04:16:16.189 --> 04:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
available this bill does not take that
 
04:16:19.510 --> 04:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
away it just says if the World Health
 
04:16:21.750 --> 04:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
Organization dictates you to do
 
04:16:24.189 --> 04:16:24.199 align:start position:0%
something we don't have to follow it
 
04:16:25.630 --> 04:16:25.640 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative and
 
04:16:27.710 --> 04:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
again to your point the CDC has been the
 
04:16:29.469 --> 04:16:29.479 align:start position:0%
amendment removed the CDC from the
 
04:16:32.070 --> 04:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
equation here representative shortle
 
04:16:33.710 --> 04:16:33.720 align:start position:0%
believe me Mr chairman I don't want to
 
04:16:35.750 --> 04:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
prolong this I'm getting older by the
 
04:16:38.590 --> 04:16:38.600 align:start position:0%
minute but uh uh I have now have a
 
04:16:40.469 --> 04:16:40.479 align:start position:0%
question that the other members of this
 
04:16:42.950 --> 04:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
committee made me think about what hav't
 
04:16:45.149 --> 04:16:45.159 align:start position:0%
forbid if we have another pandemic and
 
04:16:46.429 --> 04:16:46.439 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:16:48.550 --> 04:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
enologist recommends to the governor
 
04:16:51.630 --> 04:16:51.640 align:start position:0%
mandatory mass and a reporter says to
 
04:16:53.269 --> 04:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:16:56.189 --> 04:16:56.199 align:start position:0%
enologist what did you base this idea of
 
04:16:59.349 --> 04:16:59.359 align:start position:0%
Mass on and he or she says on the
 
04:17:03.269 --> 04:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
information provided by the wh and CDC
 
04:17:05.389 --> 04:17:05.399 align:start position:0%
because he said those three awful words
 
04:17:07.830 --> 04:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
wh does that
 
04:17:11.429 --> 04:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
nullify the ability to wear masks uh
 
04:17:12.910 --> 04:17:12.920 align:start position:0%
that's a good question and that's why I
 
04:17:17.189 --> 04:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
asked it and my take on that is that the
 
04:17:19.510 --> 04:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
entm I'm saying not saying it right
 
04:17:21.189 --> 04:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
entomologist studies something else but
 
04:17:24.429 --> 04:17:24.439 align:start position:0%
the uh the Benjamin the Dr Chan the Dr
 
04:17:27.710 --> 04:17:27.720 align:start position:0%
Chan type person uh if this happens
 
04:17:30.950 --> 04:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
again should not mention the who because
 
04:17:32.790 --> 04:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
if he wants to justify a mask mandate he
 
04:17:34.830 --> 04:17:34.840 align:start position:0%
would need to justify some other
 
04:17:37.550 --> 04:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
entity anything else
 
04:17:40.309 --> 04:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman Mr yeses gag oh thank you

04:19:26.710 --> 04:19:26.720 align:start position:0%
chair it would when we exhaust the uh
 
04:19:28.950 --> 04:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
amendments or not the Amendments but the
 
04:19:31.790 --> 04:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
uh alter alternative motions it would go
 
04:19:35.229 --> 04:19:35.239 align:start position:0%
to the floor 9 to9 uh depending upon
 
04:19:37.349 --> 04:19:37.359 align:start position:0%

heard so many concerns about this bill
 
04:19:55.269 --> 04:19:55.279 align:start position:0%
and how it would affect us that I really
 
04:19:58.149 --> 04:19:58.159 align:start position:0%
think we need to um itl it for now if it
 
04:20:01.109 --> 04:20:01.119 align:start position:0%
was a resolution maybe something
 
04:20:05.550 --> 04:20:05.560 align:start position:0%

covid study committee do I have a motion
 
04:22:11.910 --> 04:22:11.920 align:start position:0%

04:22:17.030 --> 04:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
interim study on
 
04:22:19.349 --> 04:22:19.359 align:start position:0%
1485 motion is interim study to have a
 
04:22:21.269 --> 04:22:21.279 align:start position:0%

04:22:23.269 --> 04:22:23.279 align:start position:0%
lungren seconds representative gagy to
 
04:22:23.279 --> 04:22:23.990 align:start position:0%
lungren seconds representative gagy to

04:22:23.990 --> 04:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:22:27.830 --> 04:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
motion uh thank you Mr chairman uh
 
04:22:29.630 --> 04:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher who is the Prime
 
04:22:32.349 --> 04:22:32.359 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill came to us and it
 
04:22:35.429 --> 04:22:35.439 align:start position:0%
said that perhaps instead of passing
 
04:22:37.630 --> 04:22:37.640 align:start position:0%
this bill looks like there might be some
 
04:22:40.229 --> 04:22:40.239 align:start position:0%
work needed to it so he would he
 
04:22:42.830 --> 04:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
recommended that uh we move it to
 
04:22:46.070 --> 04:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
interim study and we agreed so I would
 
04:22:48.469 --> 04:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
ask you to vote Yes on interim
 
04:22:50.750 --> 04:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
study pres
 
04:22:52.950 --> 04:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
lren I
 
04:22:56.309 --> 04:22:56.319 align:start position:0%
agree any other comment Mr chairman uh
 
04:22:57.870 --> 04:22:57.880 align:start position:0%
represent sherff yeah I think it's a
 
04:22:59.510 --> 04:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
move point is I think it was brought up
 
04:23:00.990 --> 04:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
at one of our chairs meetings the
 
04:23:02.670 --> 04:23:02.680 align:start position:0%
speaker told us he has formed a
 
04:23:04.710 --> 04:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
committee uh that he's already appointed
 
04:23:07.269 --> 04:23:07.279 align:start position:0%
people to to study the same time topic
 
04:23:10.750 --> 04:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
um and so it's like uh I don't think
 
04:23:12.269 --> 04:23:12.279 align:start position:0%
there's any need even even for an
 
04:23:14.030 --> 04:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
interim study where speakers already got
 
04:23:16.229 --> 04:23:16.239 align:start position:0%
this emotion and it could cause
 
04:23:18.189 --> 04:23:18.199 align:start position:0%
confusion to what he's trying to do and
 
04:23:21.389 --> 04:23:21.399 align:start position:0%
accomplish I would suggest we move
 
04:23:23.910 --> 04:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
itl thank you representative
 
04:23:26.189 --> 04:23:26.199 align:start position:0%
schliff other
 
04:23:28.870 --> 04:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
comments to representative Sheriff's uh
 
04:23:31.950 --> 04:23:31.960 align:start position:0%
comment um I am not sure of the status
 
04:23:35.189 --> 04:23:35.199 align:start position:0%
of the uh I know the prime sponsor
 
04:23:37.469 --> 04:23:37.479 align:start position:0%
himself as as represent gag he said ask
 
04:23:41.510 --> 04:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
for he recommended interim study himself
 
04:23:44.550 --> 04:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not sure where things stand uh
 
04:23:47.830 --> 04:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
elsewhere so to to be safe and course we
 
04:23:50.269 --> 04:23:50.279 align:start position:0%
can do an interim study and then uh if

04:26:33.389 --> 04:26:33.399 align:start position:0%
gives an excuse and actually
 
04:26:34.910 --> 04:26:34.920 align:start position:0%
incentivizes the government to keep

04:28:58.710 --> 04:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
Judy uh seconds the OTP motion on HR
 
04:29:02.349 --> 04:29:02.359 align:start position:0%
27 uh so as I started to say earlier
 
04:29:04.830 --> 04:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
I've already spoken to it uh in essence
 
04:29:09.109 --> 04:29:09.119 align:start position:0%
this simply asks that in forming climate
 
04:29:13.870 --> 04:29:13.880 align:start position:0%
policy that everyone's voices are heard
 
04:29:16.189 --> 04:29:16.199 align:start position:0%
my the concern of myself and others are
 
04:29:18.670 --> 04:29:18.680 align:start position:0%
that some voices are being suppressed
 
04:29:22.429 --> 04:29:22.439 align:start position:0%
and I think for us to make good uh
 
04:29:24.950 --> 04:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
policy uh here in this house and
 
04:29:28.510 --> 04:29:28.520 align:start position:0%
elsewhere we need to listen to and
 
04:29:32.469 --> 04:29:32.479 align:start position:0%
engage everyone uh in an inclusive
 
04:29:35.229 --> 04:29:35.239 align:start position:0%
fashion uh represent Judy you you second

04:29:47.429 --> 04:29:47.439 align:start position:0%
view we really need a climate uh
 
04:29:51.149 --> 04:29:51.159 align:start position:0%

04:29:54.670 --> 04:29:54.680 align:start position:0%

04:32:50.590 --> 04:32:50.600 align:start position:0%
united but it goes back to the railroad
 
04:32:53.070 --> 04:32:53.080 align:start position:0%
incident that she brought up and I just
 
04:32:56.910 --> 04:32:56.920 align:start position:0%
think that um since citizens
 
04:33:00.590 --> 04:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
united uh A lot's taken place that uh
 
04:33:04.349 --> 04:33:04.359 align:start position:0%
disrupts our politics so
 
04:33:04.359 --> 04:33:06.109 align:start position:0%
disrupts our politics so
that's

04:33:06.109 --> 04:33:06.119 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:33:09.670 --> 04:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
representative sh I can with those
 
04:33:12.189 --> 04:33:12.199 align:start position:0%
comments I have a a comment and I'm
 
04:33:14.189 --> 04:33:14.199 align:start position:0%
certainly looking for other comments um
 
04:33:16.789 --> 04:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
I have to say in all cander that I I
 
04:33:19.429 --> 04:33:19.439 align:start position:0%
agree with the Supreme Court rulings on
 
04:33:23.109 --> 04:33:23.119 align:start position:0%
on speech uh Buckley versus valo is
 
04:33:27.269 --> 04:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh citizens united I I I agree
 
04:33:29.670 --> 04:33:29.680 align:start position:0%
uh with those uh with all due respect to
 
04:33:32.390 --> 04:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
the uh Prime sponsor of the
 
04:33:32.400 --> 04:33:34.189 align:start position:0%
the uh Prime sponsor of the
resolution

04:33:34.189 --> 04:33:34.199 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
04:33:37.029 --> 04:33:37.039 align:start position:0%
um with the resolution specifically says
 
04:33:39.990 --> 04:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
money is not speech uh but the Supreme
 
04:33:42.070 --> 04:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
Court has essentially said in Sim in
 
04:33:46.629 --> 04:33:46.639 align:start position:0%
wording similar to to money Visa V
 
04:33:49.230 --> 04:33:49.240 align:start position:0%
speech that money is part of the First
 
04:33:53.750 --> 04:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh in terms of you can't stop
 
04:33:55.590 --> 04:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
someone from spending money on something
 
04:33:58.109 --> 04:33:58.119 align:start position:0%
that they want to promote uh whether
 
04:34:01.590 --> 04:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
it's a candidate or a cause uh so money
 
04:34:05.349 --> 04:34:05.359 align:start position:0%
does equate in my view to to First
 
04:34:07.429 --> 04:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
Amendment speech rights and that so I I
 
04:34:09.429 --> 04:34:09.439 align:start position:0%
agree with the the U supreme court on
 
04:34:13.590 --> 04:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
that and I I could not support this uh
 
04:34:13.600 --> 04:34:14.830 align:start position:0%
that and I I could not support this uh
this

04:34:14.830 --> 04:34:14.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:34:14.840 --> 04:34:16.789 align:start position:0%
this
resolution

04:34:16.789 --> 04:34:16.799 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
04:34:21.029 --> 04:34:21.039 align:start position:0%
other thoughts um represent Manion yeah

Liberty is your property and your money
 
04:34:26.750 --> 04:34:26.760 align:start position:0%

04:34:28.869 --> 04:34:28.879 align:start position:0%
be allowed to use your property to speak
 
04:34:31.590 --> 04:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
freely protected

sorry
 
04:34:38.150 --> 04:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question or
 
04:34:42.590 --> 04:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
comment um so I believe this was more I
 
04:34:44.869 --> 04:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
took it to be more and what I read is to
 
04:34:49.029 --> 04:34:49.039 align:start position:0%
be more about corporations not being
 
04:34:52.750 --> 04:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
people not necessarily about the money
 
04:34:55.551 --> 04:34:55.561 align:start position:0%
and people it's about the corporations
 
04:35:02.230 --> 04:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:04.910 --> 04:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
yeah ripson carry your lights on did you
 
04:35:07.390 --> 04:35:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:10.830 --> 04:35:10.840 align:start position:0%
speak yes I I must be two people I'm a
 
04:35:12.590 --> 04:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
corporation and I'm a person so
 
04:35:17.590 --> 04:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:20.510 --> 04:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
right is that a rhetorical question
 
04:35:21.570 --> 04:35:21.580 align:start position:0%
would you
 
04:35:21.580 --> 04:35:23.150 align:start position:0%
would you
[Laughter]

04:35:23.150 --> 04:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:35:27.551 --> 04:35:27.561 align:start position:0%
believe this is exact session so um you
 
04:35:29.590 --> 04:35:29.600 align:start position:0%
you can just say what you want to say
 
04:35:32.629 --> 04:35:32.639 align:start position:0%
and u r CA makes a good point I was
 
04:35:34.670 --> 04:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
focing focusing on the speech which is
 
04:35:37.590 --> 04:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
part of the resolution the uh the notion
 
04:35:40.910 --> 04:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
of Corporations being persons uh in law
 
04:35:42.709 --> 04:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
that's the way it it currently is and I
 
04:35:45.510 --> 04:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
I think uh that I don't have as strong a
 
04:35:47.109 --> 04:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
feeling about as I do with the spee
 
04:35:50.269 --> 04:35:50.279 align:start position:0%
issue um but that is another that's a
 
04:35:52.269 --> 04:35:52.279 align:start position:0%
second part of this that the prime
 
04:35:55.390 --> 04:35:55.400 align:start position:0%
sponsor wanted to change that part of it
 
04:35:58.949 --> 04:35:58.959 align:start position:0%
is not as Paramount to me as the speech
 
04:36:03.429 --> 04:36:03.439 align:start position:0%
part anything else rip from the lane um
 
04:36:07.429 --> 04:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um coming from uh
 
04:36:09.789 --> 04:36:09.799 align:start position:0%
election law which is my regular
 
04:36:12.310 --> 04:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
committee uh we hear a lot
 
04:36:16.990 --> 04:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
of uh bills and uh dialogue about
 
04:36:20.029 --> 04:36:20.039 align:start position:0%
Citizens United and the effect that it
 
04:36:25.990 --> 04:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
has had on participation by people um in
 
04:36:29.230 --> 04:36:29.240 align:start position:0%
law a corporation is a person and I
 
04:36:31.949 --> 04:36:31.959 align:start position:0%
think the testimony made it very clear
 
04:36:34.269 --> 04:36:34.279 align:start position:0%
that corporates corporations may be
 
04:36:36.869 --> 04:36:36.879 align:start position:0%
persons for legal reasons but they are
 
04:36:39.429 --> 04:36:39.439 align:start position:0%
not human and they are not endowed with
 
04:36:42.269 --> 04:36:42.279 align:start position:0%
the same rights that we have under the
 
04:36:44.910 --> 04:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution and they've also been a lot
 
04:36:46.910 --> 04:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
of evidence and I can't cite it I'm
 
04:36:50.070 --> 04:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
sorry but there's been a lot of evidence
 
04:36:54.269 --> 04:36:54.279 align:start position:0%
that um citizens united has really
 
04:36:57.269 --> 04:36:57.279 align:start position:0%
harmed our constitutional democracy to
 
04:36:59.029 --> 04:36:59.039 align:start position:0%
the point where
 
04:37:01.789 --> 04:37:01.799 align:start position:0%
corporations rather than the people are
 
04:37:03.830 --> 04:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
making a lot more of the decisions
 
04:37:06.070 --> 04:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
because they have a lot more of money
 
04:37:08.230 --> 04:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
and they buy ads and they can afford to
 
04:37:11.109 --> 04:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
do things that frankly I can't do and
 
04:37:14.230 --> 04:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
maybe many of you could but I can't do
 
04:37:17.990 --> 04:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
it and I think that my vote and my voice
 
04:37:22.070 --> 04:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
should count more than a corporations so
 
04:37:25.349 --> 04:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
that's just my opinion so thank you
 
04:37:27.189 --> 04:37:27.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:37:29.869 --> 04:37:29.879 align:start position:0%
Lane anything
 
04:37:33.670 --> 04:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
else saying no more yes repr Sebert I
 
04:37:35.189 --> 04:37:35.199 align:start position:0%
make a comment that I'm not going to
 
04:37:38.510 --> 04:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
vote on um I'm going to vote in favor of
 
04:37:42.189 --> 04:37:42.199 align:start position:0%
this um largely because I believe that
 
04:37:44.029 --> 04:37:44.039 align:start position:0%
too many politicians are being bought
 
04:37:46.869 --> 04:37:46.879 align:start position:0%
out at the state federal level local
 
04:37:50.429 --> 04:37:50.439 align:start position:0%
level just everything and um yeah so
 
04:37:52.429 --> 04:37:52.439 align:start position:0%
corporations are pretty much buying out
 
04:37:55.349 --> 04:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
politicians that shouldn't be allowed so
 
04:37:55.359 --> 04:37:56.750 align:start position:0%
politicians that shouldn't be allowed so
thank

04:37:56.750 --> 04:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:37:59.789 --> 04:37:59.799 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
04:38:02.230 --> 04:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
representative yeah yes R
 
04:38:05.150 --> 04:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
lels yes a question to the committee I
 
04:38:09.189 --> 04:38:09.199 align:start position:0%
wasn't here when uh the bill was uh uh
 
04:38:12.789 --> 04:38:12.799 align:start position:0%
was introduced but are labor unions
 
04:38:12.799 --> 04:38:17.150 align:start position:0%
was introduced but are labor unions
considered

04:38:17.150 --> 04:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:19.109 --> 04:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
corporations uh I'm going to go to
 
04:38:21.551 --> 04:38:21.561 align:start position:0%
representative shirtliff on that
 
04:38:25.070 --> 04:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
one if call the wrong person you don't
 
04:38:26.830 --> 04:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
have to say I don't know if they are or
 
04:38:29.429 --> 04:38:29.439 align:start position:0%
not I don't know if they if they're
 
04:38:31.230 --> 04:38:31.240 align:start position:0%
Incorporated well they could be they
 
04:38:33.910 --> 04:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
could be I don't
 
04:38:36.670 --> 04:38:36.680 align:start position:0%
know L I had the same thought actually
 
04:38:38.029 --> 04:38:38.039 align:start position:0%
when I was listening to some some of the
 
04:38:40.629 --> 04:38:40.639 align:start position:0%
comments I I suppressed that question
 
04:38:43.551 --> 04:38:43.561 align:start position:0%
that you brought forth I think that is
 
04:38:48.349 --> 04:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
is relevant but uh the again back to the
 
04:38:52.269 --> 04:38:52.279 align:start position:0%
the motion the motion is OTP on on the
 
04:38:55.429 --> 04:38:55.439 align:start position:0%
measure uh does anyone else want to
 
04:38:57.109 --> 04:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
touch represent Lane do you want to
 
04:38:59.750 --> 04:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
touch on that one I don't know the exact
 
04:39:03.310 --> 04:39:03.320 align:start position:0%
answer but I can in the sense that labor
 
04:39:06.189 --> 04:39:06.199 align:start position:0%
unions and corporations have different
 
04:39:08.670 --> 04:39:08.680 align:start position:0%
rules that apply to them on how they can
 
04:39:12.150 --> 04:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
give to campaigns for labor unions it
 
04:39:14.910 --> 04:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
has to come from the members and be
 
04:39:17.349 --> 04:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
specifically segregated for a
 
04:39:19.629 --> 04:39:19.639 align:start position:0%
corporation the corporation can make
 
04:39:22.390 --> 04:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
that decision on its own regardless of
 
04:39:24.670 --> 04:39:24.680 align:start position:0%
what the shareholders or regardless and
 
04:39:26.629 --> 04:39:26.639 align:start position:0%
they don't have to have it as a separate
 
04:39:26.639 --> 04:39:28.269 align:start position:0%
they don't have to have it as a separate
thing

04:39:28.269 --> 04:39:28.279 align:start position:0%
thing
 
04:39:31.510 --> 04:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
so I I don't know in some context I bet
 
04:39:33.429 --> 04:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
labor unions are considered to be a
 
04:39:36.750 --> 04:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
person it purely in a corporate
 
04:39:39.070 --> 04:39:39.080 align:start position:0%
sense and I don't use corporate to mean
 
04:39:40.788 --> 04:39:40.798 align:start position:0%
Corporation I just mean like in a
 
04:39:42.670 --> 04:39:42.680 align:start position:0%
business sense like a limited liability
 
04:39:45.350 --> 04:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
company or something like that but
 
04:39:47.510 --> 04:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
that's just my opinion and I'm no longer
 
04:39:50.030 --> 04:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
practicing law
 
04:39:54.230 --> 04:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
so that's it note to self representative
 
04:39:57.628 --> 04:39:57.638 align:start position:0%
Lane used to practice law I need to know
 
04:40:00.868 --> 04:40:00.878 align:start position:0%
who are potential resources anything uh
 
04:40:00.878 --> 04:40:02.350 align:start position:0%
who are potential resources anything uh
representative

04:40:02.350 --> 04:40:02.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:40:04.990 --> 04:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
Horgan just getting to the the Union
 
04:40:06.830 --> 04:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
when they they're not allowed to give
 
04:40:09.150 --> 04:40:09.160 align:start position:0%
campaign donations directly but they all
 
04:40:11.390 --> 04:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
have packs that are associated with them
 
04:40:14.270 --> 04:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
and the members can choose to contribute
 
04:40:16.590 --> 04:40:16.600 align:start position:0%
to the pack or not I it's is full
 
04:40:18.510 --> 04:40:18.520 align:start position:0%
disclosure I got a few couple of checks
 
04:40:20.750 --> 04:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
from labor union packs during my last
 
04:40:22.030 --> 04:40:22.040 align:start position:0%
campaign I don't think I've ever gotten
 
04:40:24.310 --> 04:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
one from a corporation per se
 
04:40:25.670 --> 04:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
corporations actually are allowed to
 
04:40:28.590 --> 04:40:28.600 align:start position:0%
write checks directly to candidates and
 
04:40:30.350 --> 04:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
campaign committees here here in New
 
04:40:32.750 --> 04:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and federally but um I mean
 
04:40:34.510 --> 04:40:34.520 align:start position:0%
they are a corporate entity that there
 
04:40:36.150 --> 04:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
some somewhat different from a
 
04:40:38.230 --> 04:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
corporation though but they're type
 
04:40:39.868 --> 04:40:39.878 align:start position:0%
they're type of corporate entities but I
 
04:40:41.350 --> 04:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
think we're thinking of Corporations or
 
04:40:43.590 --> 04:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
like you know Private Business
 
04:40:45.110 --> 04:40:45.120 align:start position:0%
corporations who are organized very
 
04:40:47.788 --> 04:40:47.798 align:start position:0%
differently from a labor union
 
04:40:50.910 --> 04:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
but I I will resist the temptation to
 
04:40:53.190 --> 04:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
ask for you to elaborate on on the uh
 
04:40:56.750 --> 04:40:56.760 align:start position:0%

uh in for the uh for the other just a
 
04:44:21.750 --> 04:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
comment Mr chairman I think you meant to
 
04:44:23.510 --> 04:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
say it'll go to the house with a
 
04:44:26.590 --> 04:44:26.600 align:start position:0%
recommendation of octop pass uh correct
 
04:44:29.750 --> 04:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
that technically if it's a Tai vote uh
 
04:44:32.670 --> 04:44:32.680 align:start position:0%
the OTP motion takes precedent uh thank
 
04:44:34.910 --> 04:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
you rep represent Sher
 
04:44:38.990 --> 04:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
so it'll go to the house uh starting
 
04:44:42.150 --> 04:44:42.160 align:start position:0%
with an OTP Rec recommendation even
 
04:44:46.830 --> 04:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
though it was a tight 9 to9 vote uh and
 
04:44:49.150 --> 04:44:49.160 align:start position:0%
still looking for another report
 
04:44:56.270 --> 04:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:00.110 --> 04:45:00.120 align:start position:0%
you that brings us to hr23 with regard
 
04:45:02.110 --> 04:45:02.120 align:start position:0%
to uh universal health insurance we
 
04:45:05.030 --> 04:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time on that today we
 
04:45:07.150 --> 04:45:07.160 align:start position:0%
talked about it in our caucuses and
 
04:45:10.350 --> 04:45:10.360 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about it again and and uh and
 
04:45:12.750 --> 04:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
vote on it uh is the plan do I have a
 
04:45:15.550 --> 04:45:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:17.990 --> 04:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
hr23 I'd like to make a motion
 
04:45:20.708 --> 04:45:20.718 align:start position:0%
representative Lloyd um I'd like to
 
04:45:23.430 --> 04:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
motion ought to pass representative
 
04:45:26.830 --> 04:45:26.840 align:start position:0%
Lloyd motions OTP ought to pass on hr23
 
04:45:29.310 --> 04:45:29.320 align:start position:0%
do we have a second I'll second that
 
04:45:31.110 --> 04:45:31.120 align:start position:0%
representative cbrt seconds uh
 
04:45:32.830 --> 04:45:32.840 align:start position:0%
representative Lloyd would you like to
 
04:45:34.910 --> 04:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
speak to that I think I think that we've
 
04:45:37.628 --> 04:45:37.638 align:start position:0%
reached a point in American Healthcare
 
04:45:41.230 --> 04:45:41.240 align:start position:0%
where we need some solutions um it's
 
04:45:43.990 --> 04:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
kind of as was evidenced by all of the
 
04:45:46.430 --> 04:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
testimony that we heard we only heard
 
04:45:49.788 --> 04:45:49.798 align:start position:0%
testimony in support of this um and that
 
04:45:53.550 --> 04:45:53.560 align:start position:0%
just speaks to how bad the situation is
 
04:45:55.430 --> 04:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
right now for the everyday individual
 
04:45:57.350 --> 04:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
just last week I was yelled at by my
 
04:45:59.350 --> 04:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
surgeon because I went for a little
 
04:46:00.708 --> 04:46:00.718 align:start position:0%
while without health insurance and
 
04:46:02.510 --> 04:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
couldn't go see him when I reinjured my
 
04:46:07.670 --> 04:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
knee um and so there are things that
 
04:46:10.750 --> 04:46:10.760 align:start position:0%
affect us on a day-to-day basis I was 37
 
04:46:13.390 --> 04:46:13.400 align:start position:0%
years old I had a skiing accident and I
 
04:46:15.948 --> 04:46:15.958 align:start position:0%
was in the hospital and had to go
 
04:46:18.110 --> 04:46:18.120 align:start position:0%
through three four years almost four
 
04:46:21.430 --> 04:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
years now of physical therapy um and so
 
04:46:25.868 --> 04:46:25.878 align:start position:0%
one situation can change your luck um so
 
04:46:27.430 --> 04:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
I just really think that it's important
 
04:46:29.788 --> 04:46:29.798 align:start position:0%
for all Americans to have some sort of
 
04:46:31.830 --> 04:46:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh health coverage um so that they don't
 
04:46:33.190 --> 04:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
have to
 
04:46:33.200 --> 04:46:35.310 align:start position:0%
have to
worry

04:46:35.310 --> 04:46:35.320 align:start position:0%
worry
 
04:46:38.788 --> 04:46:38.798 align:start position:0%
repr seber I just um Concur and I want
 
04:46:43.548 --> 04:46:43.558 align:start position:0%
to add that this is really um about the
 
04:46:46.788 --> 04:46:46.798 align:start position:0%
doctor your doctor being able to make
 
04:46:49.628 --> 04:46:49.638 align:start position:0%
your health care or to you know guide
 
04:46:51.590 --> 04:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
your health care decisions without
 
04:46:53.788 --> 04:46:53.798 align:start position:0%
having to go through a middleman which
 
04:46:55.990 --> 04:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
is currently the way it
 
04:47:00.110 --> 04:47:00.120 align:start position:0%
stands and um yeah so I I'm completely
 
04:47:02.830 --> 04:47:02.840 align:start position:0%
in support thank you thank you
 
04:47:05.190 --> 04:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
representative Sebert you mentioned that
 
04:47:09.310 --> 04:47:09.320 align:start position:0%
this is about the doctors and we have a
 
04:47:11.510 --> 04:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
a doctor type of person on the committee
 
04:47:12.670 --> 04:47:12.680 align:start position:0%
uh he is a
 
04:47:18.110 --> 04:47:18.120 align:start position:0%
doctor do do honest to God do Dr is it
 
04:47:21.708 --> 04:47:21.718 align:start position:0%
Dr lren it it's fine U I'm against this
 
04:47:23.070 --> 04:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
and I'll give you the reason why I've
 
04:47:26.548 --> 04:47:26.558 align:start position:0%
been in healthc care field for 47 years
 
04:47:30.990 --> 04:47:31.000 align:start position:0%
um I've I've seen uh I'll be very brief
 
04:47:32.628 --> 04:47:32.638 align:start position:0%
because I'd like to get out of here as
 
04:47:35.310 --> 04:47:35.320 align:start position:0%
well um
 
04:47:39.110 --> 04:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
I've seen people come from Canada two

04:48:34.788 --> 04:48:34.798 align:start position:0%
his status as a senator where whereas
 
04:48:37.990 --> 04:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
same people had to wait 6 to 8 months to
 
04:48:41.628 --> 04:48:41.638 align:start position:0%
get that care so I just I I'm just I'm
 
04:48:44.910 --> 04:48:44.920 align:start position:0%
against it and I hope I came across okay
 
04:48:49.430 --> 04:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:53.350 --> 04:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
dog thank you Dr lungren uh
 
04:48:55.310 --> 04:48:55.320 align:start position:0%
representative Manion who is not a
 
04:48:58.830 --> 04:48:58.840 align:start position:0%
doctor not a doctor so uh my fears for
 
04:49:00.070 --> 04:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
any kind of universal healthc care
 
04:49:01.788 --> 04:49:01.798 align:start position:0%
system came from the one question I did
 
04:49:03.350 --> 04:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
ask like uh during the pandemic and
 
04:49:05.030 --> 04:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
shortly there after when the vaccine
 
04:49:06.230 --> 04:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
mandates were coming down there were
 
04:49:07.910 --> 04:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
many many Talking Heads on late night
 
04:49:09.750 --> 04:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
talk shows saying uh well if you don't
 
04:49:11.708 --> 04:49:11.718 align:start position:0%
get jabbed you don't get health care and
 
04:49:13.030 --> 04:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
those kind of people would be the voting
 
04:49:15.110 --> 04:49:15.120 align:start position:0%
individuals that would end up trying
 
04:49:18.190 --> 04:49:18.200 align:start position:0%
they would end up uh carving the the
 
04:49:20.190 --> 04:49:20.200 align:start position:0%
procedures and the rules and such like
 
04:49:22.390 --> 04:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
that from the top down so like this oh
 
04:49:24.830 --> 04:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
it's going to be Universal unless if you
 
04:49:26.190 --> 04:49:26.200 align:start position:0%
didn't get the jab you don't get
 
04:49:27.948 --> 04:49:27.958 align:start position:0%
anything and that's the kind of system
 
04:49:31.310 --> 04:49:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:35.430 --> 04:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
support other hands represent
 
04:49:38.190 --> 04:49:38.200 align:start position:0%
yes I think I think it's important when
 
04:49:42.510 --> 04:49:42.520 align:start position:0%
you look at the health care situation
 
04:49:45.708 --> 04:49:45.718 align:start position:0%
and I think we can all agree that Health
 
04:49:49.548 --> 04:49:49.558 align:start position:0%
Care is in crisis today we have people
 
04:49:54.030 --> 04:49:54.040 align:start position:0%
who go to emergency rooms and sit there
 
04:49:58.430 --> 04:49:58.440 align:start position:0%
for hours and hours and hours to get
 
04:50:00.590 --> 04:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
care I
 
04:50:05.868 --> 04:50:05.878 align:start position:0%
I am frustrated by people who who
 
04:50:09.390 --> 04:50:09.400 align:start position:0%
are afraid of going to the doctor
 
04:50:12.670 --> 04:50:12.680 align:start position:0%
because they're they're afraid of
 
04:50:16.430 --> 04:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
bankrupting themselves so we we
 
04:50:19.030 --> 04:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
definitely have a crisis one of the
 
04:50:22.830 --> 04:50:22.840 align:start position:0%
advantages of being as old as I am is
 
04:50:25.390 --> 04:50:25.400 align:start position:0%
that you have the benefit of looking in
 
04:50:30.110 --> 04:50:30.120 align:start position:0%
the past and if you plot healthc care in
 
04:50:34.030 --> 04:50:34.040 align:start position:0%
this country and the overall cost of of
 
04:50:37.270 --> 04:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
health care and if you plot it you'll
 
04:50:42.430 --> 04:50:42.440 align:start position:0%
see that the line stays fairly level
 
04:50:45.590 --> 04:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
until it goes zooming
 
04:50:49.670 --> 04:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
up and that zooming up was the
 
04:50:52.470 --> 04:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
implementation of Medicare in this
 
04:50:55.510 --> 04:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
country and with
 
04:50:58.910 --> 04:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
Medicare the overall cost of medicine
 
04:51:04.788 --> 04:51:04.798 align:start position:0%
went way up now I'm not sure if you look
 
04:51:04.798 --> 04:51:06.030 align:start position:0%
went way up now I'm not sure if you look
at

04:51:06.030 --> 04:51:06.040 align:start position:0%
at
 
04:51:09.910 --> 04:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
that whether the quality of Health Care
 
04:51:13.590 --> 04:51:13.600 align:start position:0%
in this country has kept pace with the
 
04:51:16.430 --> 04:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
cost and I would I
 
04:51:19.670 --> 04:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
would caution people who are looking at
 
04:51:23.150 --> 04:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
this do not
 
04:51:26.948 --> 04:51:26.958 align:start position:0%
equate coverage with
 
04:51:30.948 --> 04:51:30.958 align:start position:0%
quality and I think in in so many cases
 
04:51:34.390 --> 04:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
here very recently we've had changes in
 
04:51:37.110 --> 04:51:37.120 align:start position:0%
our Health Care system and certainly
 
04:51:41.230 --> 04:51:41.240 align:start position:0%
more people now have coverage there's no
 
04:51:42.670 --> 04:51:42.680 align:start position:0%
doubt about
 
04:51:48.270 --> 04:51:48.280 align:start position:0%
that but has overall quality gone up I I
 
04:51:51.270 --> 04:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
don't think that's so much of a slam dck
 
04:51:54.708 --> 04:51:54.718 align:start position:0%
so I'll be voting against that against
 
04:51:58.350 --> 04:51:58.360 align:start position:0%
this measure because I I think it's such
 
04:51:58.360 --> 04:51:59.470 align:start position:0%
this measure because I I think it's such
a

04:51:59.470 --> 04:51:59.480 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:51:59.480 --> 04:52:01.030 align:start position:0%
a
complicated

04:52:01.030 --> 04:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
04:52:05.030 --> 04:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
situation that and I re I Echo
 
04:52:05.040 --> 04:52:06.310 align:start position:0%
situation that and I re I Echo
representative

04:52:06.310 --> 04:52:06.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:52:09.510 --> 04:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
manion's problem is that whenever you
 
04:52:13.948 --> 04:52:13.958 align:start position:0%
have the government and don't don't
 
04:52:16.270 --> 04:52:16.280 align:start position:0%
think that this isn't government health
 
04:52:20.310 --> 04:52:20.320 align:start position:0%
care what this is saying is if you want
 
04:52:23.470 --> 04:52:23.480 align:start position:0%
Universal Health Care it's run by the
 
04:52:25.910 --> 04:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
government and I don't think that's a
 
04:52:28.548 --> 04:52:28.558 align:start position:0%
good thing so I'll be voting against
 
04:52:32.868 --> 04:52:32.878 align:start position:0%
this thank you representative uh I see
 
04:52:35.310 --> 04:52:35.320 align:start position:0%
three hands uh as we head down the home
 
04:52:37.948 --> 04:52:37.958 align:start position:0%
stretch and who who's was first over
 
04:52:43.350 --> 04:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
here uh repes representative lales I you
 
04:52:46.948 --> 04:52:46.958 align:start position:0%
stated that as old as you are so were
 
04:52:48.750 --> 04:52:48.760 align:start position:0%
you treated with herbs when you came
 
04:52:52.470 --> 04:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:54.910 --> 04:52:54.920 align:start position:0%
Mayflower that's a kind of a rhetorical
 
04:52:57.948 --> 04:52:57.958 align:start position:0%
question of sorts represent mamea has
 
04:52:59.868 --> 04:52:59.878 align:start position:0%
her hand
 
04:53:04.910 --> 04:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
up I just wanted to um clarify for Dr
 
04:53:08.868 --> 04:53:08.878 align:start position:0%
lungren that um this is not socialized
 
04:53:11.750 --> 04:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
medicine in which the government runs
 
04:53:13.788 --> 04:53:13.798 align:start position:0%
the health care facilities this is
 
04:53:16.470 --> 04:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
universal and we got a clarification on
 
04:53:19.750 --> 04:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
that when um we had the speakers the
 
04:53:22.670 --> 04:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
other thing is uh this is a reminder
 
04:53:24.830 --> 04:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
that it's a house
 
04:53:28.190 --> 04:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
resolution it will go to the feds if we
 
04:53:31.830 --> 04:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
are likely enough to get it there um so
 
04:53:33.590 --> 04:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
that's the other part and then there are
 
04:53:37.150 --> 04:53:37.160 align:start position:0%
are a couple of um misspellings in the
 
04:53:39.590 --> 04:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
bill if you look
 
04:53:44.868 --> 04:53:44.878 align:start position:0%
on line 30 it says whereas as small
 
04:53:47.948 --> 04:53:47.958 align:start position:0%
state New Hampshire cannot I think it
 
04:53:51.350 --> 04:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
should be whereas a small state like New
 
04:53:52.910 --> 04:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cannot
 
04:53:56.150 --> 04:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
provide okay that's on line
 
04:53:59.948 --> 04:53:59.958 align:start position:0%
30 and then there's one
 
04:54:02.510 --> 04:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
more I thought it was important we're
 
04:54:04.708 --> 04:54:04.718 align:start position:0%
going to pass it we can't change it I'm
 
04:54:07.110 --> 04:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
a teacher she's a teacher I'm a teacher
 
04:54:07.120 --> 04:54:08.030 align:start position:0%
a teacher she's a teacher I'm a teacher
I'm

04:54:08.030 --> 04:54:08.040 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
04:54:12.430 --> 04:54:12.440 align:start position:0%
sorry and then on line 10 on the second
 
04:54:14.750 --> 04:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
page it says that the clerk of New
 
04:54:16.670 --> 04:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire House of Representatives is
 
04:54:19.230 --> 04:54:19.240 align:start position:0%
directed to prepare copies of this
 
04:54:32.470 --> 04:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:32.480 --> 04:54:34.590 align:start position:0%
 
memorandum

04:54:34.590 --> 04:54:34.600 align:start position:0%
memorandum
 
04:54:37.030 --> 04:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for those two catches I read
 
04:54:39.590 --> 04:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
that and I didn't know if Memorial and
 
04:54:40.990 --> 04:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of a word person I didn't know
 
04:54:43.070 --> 04:54:43.080 align:start position:0%
if Memorial was just another way of of
 
04:54:45.830 --> 04:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
another uh synonym for this type of
 
04:54:48.030 --> 04:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
measure that's how I I I just assume
 
04:54:51.628 --> 04:54:51.638 align:start position:0%
that that OS I've seen that before Mr
 
04:54:54.670 --> 04:54:54.680 align:start position:0%
chairman so that wouldn't concern you
 
04:55:00.150 --> 04:55:00.160 align:start position:0%
not in the as versus a uh I one is a
 
04:55:01.788 --> 04:55:01.798 align:start position:0%
little bit better grammatically than the
 
04:55:05.030 --> 04:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
other I think they there's no in the uh
 
04:55:08.390 --> 04:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
in the in the intent or or the
 
04:55:11.430 --> 04:55:11.440 align:start position:0%
message uh I do want to say to your
 
04:55:13.868 --> 04:55:13.878 align:start position:0%
point about uh when you made that
 
04:55:16.310 --> 04:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
question earlier about uh socialized
 
04:55:17.948 --> 04:55:17.958 align:start position:0%
medicine I think I said that was a good
 
04:55:20.430 --> 04:55:20.440 align:start position:0%
question and a good answer uh the
 
04:55:23.548 --> 04:55:23.558 align:start position:0%
doctors I as I understood that would not
 
04:55:25.590 --> 04:55:25.600 align:start position:0%
be working for the government were this
 
04:55:28.548 --> 04:55:28.558 align:start position:0%
to go forward they would still be uh
 
04:55:31.030 --> 04:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
working for themselves or for some other
 
04:55:33.628 --> 04:55:33.638 align:start position:0%
entity I think that's an important
 
04:55:37.030 --> 04:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
useful distinction thank you for that uh
 
04:55:38.548 --> 04:55:38.558 align:start position:0%
reps of
 
04:55:41.990 --> 04:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
bogert thank you for taking uh my
 
04:55:45.670 --> 04:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
comment um in listening to the
 
04:55:48.350 --> 04:55:48.360 align:start position:0%
discussion across here it's a very good
 
04:55:51.628 --> 04:55:51.638 align:start position:0%
discussion on this and it seemed to keep
 
04:55:54.150 --> 04:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
coming up with the fact that people go
 
04:55:57.070 --> 04:55:57.080 align:start position:0%
to have long weight periods to see their
 
04:56:00.350 --> 04:56:00.360 align:start position:0%
doctor and they have long weight periods
 
04:56:02.670 --> 04:56:02.680 align:start position:0%
as they go to the emergency room and
 
04:56:06.750 --> 04:56:06.760 align:start position:0%
stuff but not knowing because I was not
 
04:56:10.750 --> 04:56:10.760 align:start position:0%
privileged to be here for the uh public
 
04:56:14.708 --> 04:56:14.718 align:start position:0%
hearing um I do not understand how
 
04:56:17.590 --> 04:56:17.600 align:start position:0%
Universal Health Care will solve any of
 
04:56:17.600 --> 04:56:18.670 align:start position:0%
Universal Health Care will solve any of
those

04:56:18.670 --> 04:56:18.680 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:56:22.510 --> 04:56:22.520 align:start position:0%
problems uh we currently have that
 
04:56:25.470 --> 04:56:25.480 align:start position:0%
problem today and a majority of the
 
04:56:29.788 --> 04:56:29.798 align:start position:0%
people have insurance and like as myself
 
04:56:32.788 --> 04:56:32.798 align:start position:0%
and as I make a doctor appointment it's
 
04:56:35.190 --> 04:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
3 months mons out they don't care if I
 
04:56:37.708 --> 04:56:37.718 align:start position:0%
have insurance no insurance or whatever
 
04:56:40.110 --> 04:56:40.120 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get in to the doctor
 
04:56:42.110 --> 04:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
because we don't have enough
 
04:56:45.110 --> 04:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
doctors if you go try and go see one of
 
04:56:47.670 --> 04:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
your Specialists you're three four
 
04:56:50.350 --> 04:56:50.360 align:start position:0%
months out from seeing a specialist they
 
04:56:53.948 --> 04:56:53.958 align:start position:0%
didn't ask if you had insurance or not
 
04:56:56.270 --> 04:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
and they don't care at that moment when
 
04:56:58.430 --> 04:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
they're making the appointment they go
 
04:57:02.030 --> 04:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
there's too many people calling for too
 
04:57:03.708 --> 04:57:03.718 align:start position:0%
little of service
 
04:57:06.948 --> 04:57:06.958 align:start position:0%
availability so once again I have to ask
 
04:57:10.868 --> 04:57:10.878 align:start position:0%
how does Universal Health Care remedy
 
04:57:13.190 --> 04:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
your weight period in order to see a
 
04:57:15.470 --> 04:57:15.480 align:start position:0%
doctor it has nothing to do with your
 
04:57:18.548 --> 04:57:18.558 align:start position:0%
ability to pay it just has the ability
 
04:57:20.548 --> 04:57:20.558 align:start position:0%
that we don't have enough doctors we
 
04:57:23.868 --> 04:57:23.878 align:start position:0%
don't have enough specialists in the
 
04:57:26.708 --> 04:57:26.718 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire to cover all the
 
04:57:29.470 --> 04:57:29.480 align:start position:0%
medical needs that people want to go to
 
04:57:34.070 --> 04:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
see their doctor for now if we want to
 
04:57:34.080 --> 04:57:35.990 align:start position:0%
see their doctor for now if we want to
look

04:57:35.990 --> 04:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
look
 
04:57:42.270 --> 04:57:42.280 align:start position:0%
at governments taken over
 
04:57:47.510 --> 04:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
a our our health care um all one has to
 
04:57:50.708 --> 04:57:50.718 align:start position:0%
say is VA hospital and the VA medical
 
04:57:54.390 --> 04:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
thing and then tell me how well the
 
04:57:58.788 --> 04:57:58.798 align:start position:0%
government works with that and do the
 
04:58:01.788 --> 04:58:01.798 align:start position:0%
comparison and answer that question for
 
04:58:04.150 --> 04:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
yourself thank you
 
04:58:05.868 --> 04:58:05.878 align:start position:0%
uh represent sherff you I think you're
 
04:58:07.110 --> 04:58:07.120 align:start position:0%
going to say what I was about to say
 
04:58:08.990 --> 04:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
about the VA maybe yes I've gone through
 
04:58:11.670 --> 04:58:11.680 align:start position:0%
VA for counseling and other things and
 
04:58:13.948 --> 04:58:13.958 align:start position:0%
the VA is second to none I got
 
04:58:16.030 --> 04:58:16.040 align:start position:0%
tremendous respect uh for the people
 
04:58:19.270 --> 04:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
I've dealt with and with all due respect
 
04:58:20.708 --> 04:58:20.718 align:start position:0%
and my other comment of course was about
 
04:58:22.430 --> 04:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
the long white beard were you looking at
 
04:58:25.510 --> 04:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
me when you said that uh no no I'm only
 
04:58:27.628 --> 04:58:27.638 align:start position:0%
kidding on that part but as far as the
 
04:58:30.590 --> 04:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
VA goes it's a really is an excellent
 
04:58:32.788 --> 04:58:32.798 align:start position:0%
and gets a lot of knock but I defer to
 
04:58:34.628 --> 04:58:34.638 align:start position:0%
the chair
 
04:58:37.708 --> 04:58:37.718 align:start position:0%
thank you B and thank you oh you you
 
04:58:39.708 --> 04:58:39.718 align:start position:0%
weren't you were still go ahead and and
 
04:58:39.718 --> 04:58:41.708 align:start position:0%
weren't you were still go ahead and and
finish

04:58:41.708 --> 04:58:41.718 align:start position:0%
finish
 
04:58:44.310 --> 04:58:44.320 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not trying to discredit the
 
04:58:48.230 --> 04:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
VA I'm based mine on the the what I hear
 
04:58:51.830 --> 04:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
in the news uh that there's long wait
 
04:58:54.230 --> 04:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
periods and times for people to get to
 
04:58:58.230 --> 04:58:58.240 align:start position:0%
go see the VA and and so I was using
 
04:59:01.470 --> 04:59:01.480 align:start position:0%
that parallel not the quality not the
 
04:59:04.270 --> 04:59:04.280 align:start position:0%
quality of the service because no matter
 
04:59:05.948 --> 04:59:05.958 align:start position:0%
where you go you're going to get high
 
04:59:08.030 --> 04:59:08.040 align:start position:0%
quality service it had nothing to do
 
04:59:10.670 --> 04:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
with that it was in relationship to the
 
04:59:13.548 --> 04:59:13.558 align:start position:0%
amount of time it takes to see a
 
04:59:15.708 --> 04:59:15.718 align:start position:0%
qualified person you may be right I can
 
04:59:17.590 --> 04:59:17.600 align:start position:0%
only speak to New Hampshire and they've
 
04:59:19.548 --> 04:59:19.558 align:start position:0%
been excellent here in New Hampshire
 
04:59:22.750 --> 04:59:22.760 align:start position:0%
thank you repres bogert uh I was going
 
04:59:24.510 --> 04:59:24.520 align:start position:0%
to make the same comment uh
 
04:59:26.070 --> 04:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
representative Sher be me to I'll just
 
04:59:28.708 --> 04:59:28.718 align:start position:0%
I'll just uh support what he said I have
 
04:59:30.750 --> 04:59:30.760 align:start position:0%
had some wonderful firsthand experiences
 
04:59:32.830 --> 04:59:32.840 align:start position:0%
with VA and I am grateful for what they
 
04:59:35.430 --> 04:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
do do I also know that many people
 
04:59:37.350 --> 04:59:37.360 align:start position:0%
historically over time have had some bad
 
04:59:39.150 --> 04:59:39.160 align:start position:0%
experiences which have been highly
 
04:59:41.390 --> 04:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
public I think they in recent years they
 
04:59:43.948 --> 04:59:43.958 align:start position:0%
have really worked in to improve their
 
04:59:46.470 --> 04:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
their uh performance so I I just want to
 
04:59:49.510 --> 04:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
Echo representative Sheriff's uh comment
 
04:59:54.548 --> 04:59:54.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:56.510 --> 04:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
representative in uh the Commerce
 
04:59:58.310 --> 04:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
Committee which is my regular committee
 
05:00:00.430 --> 05:00:00.440 align:start position:0%
we hear a lot about insurance we live
 
05:00:03.590 --> 05:00:03.600 align:start position:0%
and die by Insurance over there among
 
05:00:05.750 --> 05:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
other things
 
05:00:09.030 --> 05:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh 6 and 1 12% of the people in New
 
05:00:11.150 --> 05:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are totally uninsured cannot
 
05:00:14.948 --> 05:00:14.958 align:start position:0%
afford insurance 24% of people in New
 
05:00:16.830 --> 05:00:16.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire are under underinsured in
 
05:00:18.310 --> 05:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
other words they can get insurance for
 
05:00:20.430 --> 05:00:20.440 align:start position:0%
part of the year but they can't get
 
05:00:21.708 --> 05:00:21.718 align:start position:0%
insurance for the rest of the year
 
05:00:24.548 --> 05:00:24.558 align:start position:0%
because they're Farm Workers or they are
 
05:00:28.350 --> 05:00:28.360 align:start position:0%
in uh multiple different kinds of uh
 
05:00:30.070 --> 05:00:30.080 align:start position:0%
employment in order to make enough money
 
05:00:31.590 --> 05:00:31.600 align:start position:0%
to live in a house or whatever they're
 
05:00:34.590 --> 05:00:34.600 align:start position:0%
going to live in so this state happens
 
05:00:38.788 --> 05:00:38.798 align:start position:0%
to be worse than the middle as to
 
05:00:41.910 --> 05:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
Insurance in this country and
 
05:00:44.230 --> 05:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
insurance we we make we don't make much
 
05:00:46.110 --> 05:00:46.120 align:start position:0%
of an effort to get them insured outside
 
05:00:49.670 --> 05:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
of Medicaid which is a federal uh plan
 
05:00:51.070 --> 05:00:51.080 align:start position:0%
of a federal
 
05:00:54.270 --> 05:00:54.280 align:start position:0%
policy we have too many people that have
 
05:00:57.590 --> 05:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely no access to Medical Care and
 
05:01:00.070 --> 05:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
this is not a cheap State this is a
 
05:01:03.270 --> 05:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
state with a pretty good uh mean medium
 
05:01:06.470 --> 05:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
income and that's kind of sad so if we
 
05:01:09.030 --> 05:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
can't do it ourselves maybe we need some
 
05:01:09.040 --> 05:01:09.948 align:start position:0%
can't do it ourselves maybe we need some
federal

05:01:09.948 --> 05:01:09.958 align:start position:0%
federal
 
05:01:11.830 --> 05:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
help thank
 
05:01:14.030 --> 05:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
you other
 
05:01:17.390 --> 05:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
hand um representative Lloyd I was just
 
05:01:19.788 --> 05:01:19.798 align:start position:0%
going to comment that um a lot of places
 
05:01:22.150 --> 05:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
now do require your insurance when you
 
05:01:24.830 --> 05:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
log in and sign up at for a doctor and
 
05:01:27.270 --> 05:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
they do check before they allow you to
 
05:01:30.190 --> 05:01:30.200 align:start position:0%
have that care or that pres that
 
05:01:32.910 --> 05:01:32.920 align:start position:0%
appointment with your doctor made um I
 
05:01:35.910 --> 05:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
also can say that while I was on my
 
05:01:38.270 --> 05:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
employer insurance they decided to
 
05:01:41.628 --> 05:01:41.638 align:start position:0%
switch plans and I went from a plan
 
05:01:44.030 --> 05:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
where as you've heard I've had to have
 
05:01:46.310 --> 05:01:46.320 align:start position:0%
years of physical therapy to be able to
 
05:01:50.788 --> 05:01:50.798 align:start position:0%
walk and and function again um and uh
 
05:01:52.310 --> 05:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
they switched from a plan that had
 
05:01:54.110 --> 05:01:54.120 align:start position:0%
Physical Therapy covered unlimited
 
05:01:57.230 --> 05:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
numbers $10 a visit that was great they
 
05:02:00.310 --> 05:02:00.320 align:start position:0%
moved to a new plan next week I go into
 
05:02:02.910 --> 05:02:02.920 align:start position:0%
my office I show my new card and it's
 
05:02:07.390 --> 05:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
now $82 a visit and on top of that I I
 
05:02:09.788 --> 05:02:09.798 align:start position:0%
get it capped at 60
 
05:02:14.070 --> 05:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
visits so I think really we need to have
 
05:02:18.788 --> 05:02:18.798 align:start position:0%
some sort of like overreaching um uh or
 
05:02:21.230 --> 05:02:21.240 align:start position:0%
overarching uh policy in place that
 
05:02:23.350 --> 05:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
covers these types of things and and
 
05:02:25.670 --> 05:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
also gaps in employment um I had to stay
 
05:02:27.390 --> 05:02:27.400 align:start position:0%
with an employer that I did not want to
 
05:02:30.590 --> 05:02:30.600 align:start position:0%
continue working for anymore because I
 
05:02:32.190 --> 05:02:32.200 align:start position:0%
you know I I didn't want to work in that
 
05:02:34.868 --> 05:02:34.878 align:start position:0%
environment anymore and I had to stay on
 
05:02:36.788 --> 05:02:36.798 align:start position:0%
longer than I wanted to because I needed
 
05:02:38.110 --> 05:02:38.120 align:start position:0%
that insurance so that I could have
 
05:02:39.510 --> 05:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
another knee surgery which is what
 
05:02:41.510 --> 05:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
happened in March
 
05:02:44.310 --> 05:02:44.320 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
05:02:47.628 --> 05:02:47.638 align:start position:0%
representative representative Lane thank
 
05:02:53.110 --> 05:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
you um um two two points one personal um
 
05:02:56.350 --> 05:02:56.360 align:start position:0%
my my son uh was working various jobs
 
05:02:58.830 --> 05:02:58.840 align:start position:0%
and his employer did not really provide
 
05:03:01.910 --> 05:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
health care and he was not making enough
 
05:03:04.868 --> 05:03:04.878 align:start position:0%
money to afford to buy in so he went a
 
05:03:08.590 --> 05:03:08.600 align:start position:0%
long time in a fairly risky profession
 
05:03:10.830 --> 05:03:10.840 align:start position:0%
um without insurance which of course did
 
05:03:14.548 --> 05:03:14.558 align:start position:0%
not make his mother very happy um but I
 
05:03:17.910 --> 05:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
mean he he's you know in the 30s so I
 
05:03:19.788 --> 05:03:19.798 align:start position:0%
think there's a lot of people out there
 
05:03:21.910 --> 05:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
that we assume have health insurance
 
05:03:23.948 --> 05:03:23.958 align:start position:0%
that really do not and they're not
 
05:03:27.190 --> 05:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
covered he was above the amount to get
 
05:03:30.350 --> 05:03:30.360 align:start position:0%
full coverage but then he he was in that
 
05:03:32.470 --> 05:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
Gap and there was nothing really he
 
05:03:35.270 --> 05:03:35.280 align:start position:0%
could could do so fortunately um he was
 
05:03:37.070 --> 05:03:37.080 align:start position:0%
able to borrow some
 
05:03:41.030 --> 05:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
money from from from the mom ATM but I
 
05:03:44.470 --> 05:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
just it was very unsettling and and most
 
05:03:45.948 --> 05:03:45.958 align:start position:0%
of there were a lot of people and it
 
05:03:49.548 --> 05:03:49.558 align:start position:0%
really opened my eyes um to the issue
 
05:03:52.910 --> 05:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
secondly I spent um 10 years working as
 
05:03:55.948 --> 05:03:55.958 align:start position:0%
a legal aid attorney and I can say that
 
05:03:58.628 --> 05:03:58.638 align:start position:0%
legal bills you know strap because when
 
05:04:00.948 --> 05:04:00.958 align:start position:0%
you go in without insurance there's a
 
05:04:03.708 --> 05:04:03.718 align:start position:0%
different rate that you pay and that
 
05:04:07.270 --> 05:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
you're expected to pay and the bills are
 
05:04:10.150 --> 05:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
crippling and most people just don't
 
05:04:13.990 --> 05:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
have that kind of money and while
 
05:04:17.070 --> 05:04:17.080 align:start position:0%
nationalization may not be the answer I
 
05:04:20.628 --> 05:04:20.638 align:start position:0%
have not heard any other solution that
 
05:04:23.470 --> 05:04:23.480 align:start position:0%
seems to make sense so for that reason
 
05:04:27.110 --> 05:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
I'll support this but we definitely need
 
05:04:29.470 --> 05:04:29.480 align:start position:0%
to do something and I know it's beyond
 
05:04:32.948 --> 05:04:32.958 align:start position:0%
the purview of this committee but um and
 
05:04:34.590 --> 05:04:34.600 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire is too small to do it
 
05:04:39.190 --> 05:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
on our own we can't do it so thank you
 
05:04:40.910 --> 05:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:04:44.750 --> 05:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
representative um seeing no more oh I
 
05:04:47.430 --> 05:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
see two hands going up and down uh who's
 
05:04:51.310 --> 05:04:51.320 align:start position:0%
in them represent Horgan yes of course
 
05:04:53.230 --> 05:04:53.240 align:start position:0%
you of course I filled out a pink card
 
05:04:54.590 --> 05:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
during the hearing which was two and a
 
05:04:57.510 --> 05:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
half hours ago but um just to reiterate
 
05:04:59.788 --> 05:04:59.798 align:start position:0%
I've been on a single-payer federal
 
05:05:02.708 --> 05:05:02.718 align:start position:0%
government Health Plan Medicare for
 
05:05:05.868 --> 05:05:05.878 align:start position:0%
years and it's um worked out fairly well
 
05:05:08.430 --> 05:05:08.440 align:start position:0%
for well for me the uh and you can get
 
05:05:11.390 --> 05:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
supplement plans go on top of it um
 
05:05:12.990 --> 05:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
because they only pay a certain
 
05:05:14.350 --> 05:05:14.360 align:start position:0%
percentage but then it's up to you to
 
05:05:15.830 --> 05:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
either pay for it out of your own funds
 
05:05:17.868 --> 05:05:17.878 align:start position:0%
or get a supplemental insurance plan by
 
05:05:19.430 --> 05:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
private insurance companies I think that
 
05:05:22.310 --> 05:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
has worked well um also all the care of
 
05:05:24.590 --> 05:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
getting those EOB forms are pretty
 
05:05:26.030 --> 05:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
bizarre you know especially the number
 
05:05:29.548 --> 05:05:29.558 align:start position:0%
in the leand of the column is way out of
 
05:05:31.470 --> 05:05:31.480 align:start position:0%
is always like several orders of
 
05:05:33.070 --> 05:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
magnitude more than what I actually have
 
05:05:35.628 --> 05:05:35.638 align:start position:0%
to pay but um the
 
05:05:38.628 --> 05:05:38.638 align:start position:0%
Medicare and um but I think the Medicare
 
05:05:40.190 --> 05:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
has been good for that in fact a lot of
 
05:05:41.470 --> 05:05:41.480 align:start position:0%
times when you're paying for something
 
05:05:43.350 --> 05:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
out of your own pocket because you don't
 
05:05:45.750 --> 05:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
have insurance they often like if it's
 
05:05:47.470 --> 05:05:47.480 align:start position:0%
something relatively inexpensive they'll
 
05:05:48.990 --> 05:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
just say well we'll charge you the
 
05:05:50.910 --> 05:05:50.920 align:start position:0%
Medicare rate and if you have the money
 
05:05:53.190 --> 05:05:53.200 align:start position:0%
to write a check for that that's usually
 
05:05:55.910 --> 05:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
how they handle it and before that I was
 
05:05:57.390 --> 05:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
for several years I planned for the
 
05:06:00.628 --> 05:06:00.638 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act um that worked
 
05:06:02.470 --> 05:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
better than anything I did before parti
 
05:06:03.708 --> 05:06:03.718 align:start position:0%
and one of the reasons fary because that
 
05:06:05.708 --> 05:06:05.718 align:start position:0%
also set a standard certain standards
 
05:06:07.510 --> 05:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
that the providers and the patients
 
05:06:10.030 --> 05:06:10.040 align:start position:0%
understood so before that it was total
 
05:06:12.670 --> 05:06:12.680 align:start position:0%
chaos you know especially with find R
 
05:06:15.190 --> 05:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
the problem tying Insurance to employers
 
05:06:17.030 --> 05:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
um every plan is different and employers
 
05:06:20.070 --> 05:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
are often quite eager to not let you be
 
05:06:22.590 --> 05:06:22.600 align:start position:0%
eligible for the insurance you know like
 
05:06:24.430 --> 05:06:24.440 align:start position:0%
just there's various ways around that so
 
05:06:26.190 --> 05:06:26.200 align:start position:0%
that and then trying to get something at
 
05:06:27.590 --> 05:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
least if you're older and even
 
05:06:29.350 --> 05:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
apparently even like repr Lane's son
 
05:06:30.590 --> 05:06:30.600 align:start position:0%
through the private Market the free
 
05:06:32.390 --> 05:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
market is really there's a large
 
05:06:33.830 --> 05:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
percentage of people the free market is
 
05:06:35.470 --> 05:06:35.480 align:start position:0%
just not interested in surfing you know
 
05:06:38.310 --> 05:06:38.320 align:start position:0%
so um thank you
 
05:06:40.230 --> 05:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
representative L did you have your hand
 
05:06:44.788 --> 05:06:44.798 align:start position:0%

what my friend representative shirtless
 
05:06:51.910 --> 05:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
said about the VA as a disabled
 
05:06:55.070 --> 05:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
veteran uh I've had literally millions
 
05:06:58.910 --> 05:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
of dollars spent on my body and I it
 
05:07:01.910 --> 05:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
might not look like it but I've I've
 
05:07:04.670 --> 05:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
gotten a lot of good out of that they
 
05:07:08.190 --> 05:07:08.200 align:start position:0%
every time I go into the hospital in
 
05:07:12.270 --> 05:07:12.280 align:start position:0%

done for me uh in this case
 
05:07:30.070 --> 05:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's important that we do
 
05:07:33.830 --> 05:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
something because we are in crisis
 
05:07:36.868 --> 05:07:36.878 align:start position:0%
um but I'd just like to Echo what Steve

05:21:00.040 --> 05:21:32.990 align:start position:0%
 
unanimous

05:21:32.990 --> 05:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:35.708 --> 05:21:35.718 align:start position:0%
thank you Christina okay the the one
 
05:21:38.830 --> 05:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
remaining motion it's a a measure is a
 
05:21:42.430 --> 05:21:42.440 align:start position:0%
little bit complicated it's hr31 we uh
 
05:21:45.430 --> 05:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh initially had it scheduled and the
 
05:21:49.310 --> 05:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
sponsors asked for uh a recess or more
 
05:21:52.110 --> 05:21:52.120 align:start position:0%
time uh and now there's an amendment so
 
05:21:55.590 --> 05:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
we at this time we need to recess on
 
05:21:59.590 --> 05:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
that uh I'm told uh hr31 to a date
 
05:22:02.230 --> 05:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
certain and so what we can do and will
 
05:22:06.110 --> 05:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
do at this time is uh because it's just
 
05:22:09.430 --> 05:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
one simple measure with one sponsor uh
 
05:22:11.830 --> 05:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
we should be able to uh meet as a
 
05:22:15.948 --> 05:22:15.958 align:start position:0%
committee on Thursday immediately after
 
05:22:19.070 --> 05:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
the session and uh deal with it so
 
05:22:21.150 --> 05:22:21.160 align:start position:0%
that's what I am going to do at this
 
05:22:25.190 --> 05:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
time on hr31 and we're going to rece
 
05:22:26.990 --> 05:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
recess it to a date certain that date
 
05:22:30.110 --> 05:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
certain is this coming Thursday the 15th
 
05:22:31.470 --> 05:22:31.480 align:start position:0%
uh and we will
 
05:22:34.190 --> 05:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
gather U IM
 
05:22:36.750 --> 05:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
immediately uh question was can we do it
 
05:22:39.670 --> 05:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
on Monday and we checked on that and
 
05:22:42.788 --> 05:22:42.798 align:start position:0%
there the timelines don't work they they
 
05:22:46.390 --> 05:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
need so uh yes uh we were that would
 
05:22:48.030 --> 05:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
have been preferable if we could have
 
05:22:49.350 --> 05:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
done that but we want to do everything
 
05:22:52.590 --> 05:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
legal around here because this is state
 
05:22:54.990 --> 05:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
federal could just announce that from
 
05:22:58.030 --> 05:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
well correct on session day so those of
 
05:23:01.548 --> 05:23:01.558 align:start position:0%
you most of you pres presumably uh
 
05:23:04.510 --> 05:23:04.520 align:start position:0%
will be here on Thursday so we'll make
 
05:23:06.510 --> 05:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
we'll make the announcement on the floor
 
05:23:10.030 --> 05:23:10.040 align:start position:0%
we will and probably probably come here
 
05:23:12.510 --> 05:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
have have the uh executive session on
 
05:23:14.548 --> 05:23:14.558 align:start position:0%
that one measure which should not take
 
05:23:16.190 --> 05:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
very long and then we'll be done so
 
05:23:19.510 --> 05:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
that's that uh are there any questions
 
05:23:21.830 --> 05:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
for for me or anything else I think we
 
05:23:23.070 --> 05:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
have all the report writers
 
05:23:26.350 --> 05:23:26.360 align:start position:0%

05:23:33.670 --> 05:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
about the VA it had nothing to do with
 
05:23:35.910 --> 05:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
the quality of the service that they
 
05:23:38.190 --> 05:23:38.200 align:start position:0%
were provided and I wanted to make sure
 
05:23:39.390 --> 05:23:39.400 align:start position:0%
I was
 
05:23:42.788 --> 05:23:42.798 align:start position:0%
not making that statement what I was was
 
05:23:45.430 --> 05:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
comparing the length it takes to get an
 
05:23:48.830 --> 05:23:48.840 align:start position:0%

05:23:51.150 --> 05:23:51.160 align:start position:0%
