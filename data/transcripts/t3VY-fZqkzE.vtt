00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 align:start position:0%
and we will be getting into details
 
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
around those
 
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
accounting units and what our sfy 2223
 
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
so as you've seen in previous
 
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.909 align:start position:0%
so as you've seen in previous
presentations

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:39.919 align:start position:0%
presentations
 
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
um the division of long term supports
 
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
and services
 
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
is part of the human services and
 
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
behavioral health
 
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
uh component within the department of
 
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
health and human services
 
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
we work in partnership with medicaid i
 
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
believe henry lippman yesterday
 
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
described medicaid as a team approach
 
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
and you will see that out of that 700
 
00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
um million dollars a good portion of the
 
00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:05.990 align:start position:0%
um million dollars a good portion of the
financing

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
financing
 
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
is medicaid match specific however we do
 
00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:09.430 align:start position:0%
is medicaid match specific however we do
have

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:11.199 align:start position:0%
other funding streams which we will get
 
00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:14.479 align:start position:0%
into and explain in just a moment
 
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the division of
 
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
long-term supports and services
 
00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:20.479 align:start position:0%
the bureaus are brought together because
 
00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:21.110 align:start position:0%
the bureaus are brought together because
essentially

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
we help people from literally the ages
 
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
of zero to three
 
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
with early intervention services all the
 
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
way through
 
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
helping our seniors with nursing
 
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
facility care and
 
00:07:34.629 --> 00:07:34.639 align:start position:0%
home and community-based supports in
 
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
addition we also support those with
 
00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities
 
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
once they exit the school system and go
 
00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
into adult services so it's a wide range
 
00:07:47.749 --> 00:07:47.759 align:start position:0%
of services and we have an opportunity
 
00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
to work with a terrific
 
00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:52.639 align:start position:0%
array of providers and area agencies and
 
00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
case management agencies that we'll be
 
00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
talking about as well a little further
 
00:07:59.670 --> 00:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
down the line
 
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
so within the division of long-term
 
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
supports and services
 
00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
we as i mentioned a good portion of our
 
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
funding comes from medicaid
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
and that medicaid funding helps support
 
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
our 4 1915 c home in community-based
 
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.350 align:start position:0%
our 4 1915 c home in community-based
waivers

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
waivers
 
00:08:15.589 --> 00:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
and our federal partners are the center
 
00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:18.160 align:start position:0%
for medicare and medicaid services
 
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
in addition medicaid helps cover the
 
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
nursing facility costs along with our
 
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
partners from the counties
 
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
and we'll be talking more about that
 
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
when we discuss the bureau of elderly
 
00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:28.879 align:start position:0%
adult services
 
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
we also have four other funding streams
 
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
that are braided
 
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
into providing services for seniors and
 
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
for children and for adults with
 
00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.230 align:start position:0%
for children and for adults with
disabilities

00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:38.240 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
the funding streams include the hrsa
 
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
funding stream which you'll re
 
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
we'll we will be referring to as title 5
 
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
funding so i know that you've got your
 
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
acronyms in front of you so that's hr
 
00:08:52.389 --> 00:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
we also have the federal office for
 
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
special education funding
 
00:08:55.829 --> 00:08:55.839 align:start position:0%
stream which is our part c early
 
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
intervention or early supports and
 
00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.110 align:start position:0%
intervention or early supports and
services

00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
we also receive funding from the
 
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
administration for community living
 
00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:06.560 align:start position:0%
which includes title three two and four
 
00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.590 align:start position:0%
which includes title three two and four
funding

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
and we also receive funding from the
 
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
administration for children and families
 
00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
which is our title
 
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
20 funding so we have a wide variety of
 
00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.269 align:start position:0%
20 funding so we have a wide variety of
partners

00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
partners
 
00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
that we have to meet compliance
 
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
requirements for
 
00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
whether it's through grant funding or
 
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
medicaid funding
 
00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
and we have a terrific team that works
 
00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:29.519 align:start position:0%
very hard to make sure that we
 
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
ensure that we protect those matches and
 
00:09:34.829 --> 00:09:34.839 align:start position:0%
those dollars as they come into the
 
00:09:34.839 --> 00:09:36.630 align:start position:0%
those dollars as they come into the
state

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:38.800 align:start position:0%
so we do have some key challenges and i
 
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
think some of the challenges will be
 
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
reminiscent of the challenges that you
 
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
have heard about to date from
 
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
other divisions within the department of
 
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:48.720 align:start position:0%
health and human services
 
00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
i wanted to focus in on workforce to
 
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
begin with
 
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
um within the workforce i would break it
 
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
up into two different categories
 
00:09:58.310 --> 00:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
category number one would be workforce
 
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
shortages within our bureaus
 
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
which is resulting in challenges for
 
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
operations and oversight
 
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
in the department in the division of
 
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
long-term supports and services we have
 
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
a total of 153 positions
 
00:10:14.949 --> 00:10:14.959 align:start position:0%
131 positions are filled right now and
 
00:10:14.959 --> 00:10:16.150 align:start position:0%
131 positions are filled right now and
occupied

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
occupied
 
00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
and 22 are vacant um
 
00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:21.839 align:start position:0%
so when i take a look at what we need to
 
00:10:21.839 --> 00:10:22.870 align:start position:0%
so when i take a look at what we need to
achieve

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
achieve
 
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
when it comes to transactions operations
 
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
and transformation it makes it rather
 
00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:31.519 align:start position:0%
difficult to move into transformation
 
00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:32.959 align:start position:0%
and building new programs
 
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
and creating partnerships with our
 
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
stakeholder community to advance our
 
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.590 align:start position:0%
stakeholder community to advance our
services

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that we quite
 
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
frankly are understaffed at this point
 
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
in time
 
00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
and we spend a lot of time focusing on
 
00:10:48.389 --> 00:10:48.399 align:start position:0%
our transactions and operations to
 
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
protect our match with medicaid as well
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
as to ensure that we
 
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
continue to get our grant funding from
 
00:10:55.509 --> 00:10:55.519 align:start position:0%
our federal partners
 
00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
um as an example the bureau for family
 
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
centered services has been operating at
 
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:02.240 align:start position:0%
a 41
 
00:11:04.949 --> 00:11:04.959 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate for the past six months
 
00:11:07.509 --> 00:11:07.519 align:start position:0%
this is due to a high retirement rate
 
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
um the division of long-term supports
 
00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
and services like the rest of the
 
00:11:11.519 --> 00:11:12.550 align:start position:0%
and services like the rest of the
department

00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:14.240 align:start position:0%
has seen a significant number of
 
00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
retirements during the covid
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
epidemic and i know that
 
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner weaver spoke
 
00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
to some of the challenges that we've had
 
00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
in terms of staffing
 
00:11:29.829 --> 00:11:29.839 align:start position:0%
another area that uh i know that many of
 
00:11:30.949 --> 00:11:30.959 align:start position:0%
you have heard about
 
00:11:32.949 --> 00:11:32.959 align:start position:0%
especially relative to clovid because
 
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
covet has really put
 
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
a spotlight on workforce capacity issues
 
00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
and that comes to us being able to
 
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
appropriately staff our nursing
 
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.829 align:start position:0%
appropriately staff our nursing
facilities

00:11:43.829 --> 00:11:43.839 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
as well as our home and community-based
 
00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:46.949 align:start position:0%
as well as our home and community-based
services

00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:46.959 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
we continue to have issues in terms of
 
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
attracting individuals to this
 
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
sector or to this segment to be employed
 
00:11:58.389 --> 00:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
and to be able to work with our provider
 
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
community to deliver services
 
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
another area that we have faced key
 
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.160 align:start position:0%
challenges on is relative to inter
 
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
information technology and i'm going to
 
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
get very specific about that in the next
 
00:12:11.829 --> 00:12:11.839 align:start position:0%
couple of slides
 
00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839 align:start position:0%
but the bottom line is that the bureau
 
00:12:16.949 --> 00:12:16.959 align:start position:0%
of elderly and adult services
 
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
is working with the 23 year old system
 
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
to be able to administer on many of our
 
00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
programs including our adult
 
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
protective services programs and this is
 
00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
posing problems moving forward and we
 
00:12:31.509 --> 00:12:31.519 align:start position:0%
have a capital request in that
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
for our bureau of developmental services
 
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:38.480 align:start position:0%
a series of disparate and aged systems
 
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
one of the systems that we work with
 
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
with our area agency system
 
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
is new hampshire leads and that dates
 
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
from 1998
 
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
we also have what's known as a budget
 
00:12:50.829 --> 00:12:50.839 align:start position:0%
tracking system which dates from
 
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
2007. um so both of
 
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
so when you take a look at our bureau
 
00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
supports we are definitely challenged
 
00:12:59.990 --> 00:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
when it comes to
 
00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
processing the work and getting the
 
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
access to data in
 
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
information to inform policy making
 
00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.750 align:start position:0%
information to inform policy making
lastly

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
lastly
 
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
we have multiple funding streams and
 
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
it's a challenge relative to compliance
 
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
and oversight because we need to make
 
00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.110 align:start position:0%
and oversight because we need to make
sure

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
at all costs that we are delivering
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
quality product
 
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:20.240 align:start position:0%
and that we are meeting all the
 
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
requirements set forth in our funded
 
00:13:24.389 --> 00:13:24.399 align:start position:0%
with from our funding partners
 
00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
excuse me i believe representative
 
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
rogers has a question for you
 
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm not sure deb if this is the
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
proper place to ask but when you talk
 
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:33.509 align:start position:0%
proper place to ask but when you talk
about

00:13:33.509 --> 00:13:33.519 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:13:36.069 --> 00:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
the workforce and your shortages is
 
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
there a rate increase
 
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
in this budget i didn't notice or didn't
 
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
know where to find it
 
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
but is there a rate increase for any of
 
00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
your workforce included in here
 
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
and if not did you ask for one okay
 
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
so we did zero in um within the beas
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
budget and we'll get into it a little
 
00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
bit later on but just to give you a
 
00:13:58.629 --> 00:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
preview now
 
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
three areas for rate increases the first
 
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
area is case management
 
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
for our cfi case managers and that will
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
be part of the cfi
 
00:14:10.629 --> 00:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
case management rate increase and
 
00:14:10.639 --> 00:14:11.590 align:start position:0%
case management rate increase and
representative

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
rogers because of the work that you did
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
on the parity committee
 
00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
a couple of years ago you know that that
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
was a commitment that the department
 
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
made to move that
 
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
forward and we are doing so in this
 
00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
budget request
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
a second area is for personal care
 
00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
services in the cfi
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
um waiver and we're looking for our rate
 
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
increase there that we can get into more
 
00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.030 align:start position:0%
increase there that we can get into more
detail

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
detail
 
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
on later on and then the third area is
 
00:14:38.069 --> 00:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
homemaker services where we have put in
 
00:14:40.069 --> 00:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
for a rate increase
 
00:14:42.629 --> 00:14:42.639 align:start position:0%
those went in in the department phase as
 
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
a prioritized need
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
and those are included in the governor's
 
00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:49.430 align:start position:0%
and those are included in the governor's
budget

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:52.629 --> 00:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
is that it you know kathy yep um i also
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
have a question for you
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
just when you when we get to go into the
 
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
accounts would you draw
 
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
our attention to the accounts that
 
00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
relate to these systems you were talking
 
00:15:00.639 --> 00:15:01.750 align:start position:0%
relate to these systems you were talking
about

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
yes um absolutely because they are
 
00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
actually not in the beas budget but they
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
are in the capital budget so i'm going
 
00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:09.519 align:start position:0%
to quickly go through them
 
00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
now representative okay okay
 
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
so moving forward um there are four
 
00:15:17.829 --> 00:15:17.839 align:start position:0%
capital projects
 
00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:19.839 align:start position:0%
and the first one is the bds direct
 
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
billing project
 
00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
and this is a project that is going to
 
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
help us meet
 
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
our corrective action plan with our
 
00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
federal partners for the centers for
 
00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
medicare medicaid services
 
00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
and this ffp is at ninety percent
 
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
and so the net to the state for this
 
00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
project is a hundred thousand dollars
 
00:15:41.189 --> 00:15:41.199 align:start position:0%
and this will allow us to meet our
 
00:15:41.199 --> 00:15:42.389 align:start position:0%
and this will allow us to meet our
requirements

00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
in terms of the corrective action plan
 
00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
the second system
 
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
is the developmental services i.t
 
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
remediation system
 
00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
and again this is a 90 match
 
00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
all right with our federal partners and
 
00:15:59.189 --> 00:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
the net to the state would be 1.3
 
00:15:59.199 --> 00:16:00.150 align:start position:0%
the net to the state would be 1.3
million

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
approximately and this is a project that
 
00:16:03.199 --> 00:16:03.670 align:start position:0%
approximately and this is a project that
is

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
of extreme import because these are the
 
00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:07.720 align:start position:0%
systems that date from
 
00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
1998 and from 2007
 
00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
and we are hard pressed to provide for
 
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
compliance oversight and operations with
 
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
our current
 
00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
systems infrastructure
 
00:16:24.629 --> 00:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
the next uh system that we have put in
 
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
as for part of the capital
 
00:16:29.749 --> 00:16:29.759 align:start position:0%
uh uh budget is the electronic visit
 
00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
verification system
 
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
otherwise known as evv and this
 
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
is required by the 21st century
 
00:16:40.949 --> 00:16:40.959 align:start position:0%
cures act and uh for us to be able to
 
00:16:40.959 --> 00:16:41.590 align:start position:0%
cures act and uh for us to be able to
deliver

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
deliver
 
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
this system it will come once again with
 
00:16:45.189 --> 00:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
a 90
 
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
match in the state net for this one will
 
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
be 566
 
00:16:53.509 --> 00:16:53.519 align:start position:0%
000 and this is a mission critical
 
00:16:53.519 --> 00:16:54.150 align:start position:0%
000 and this is a mission critical
system

00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
in that it allows us to be able to
 
00:16:59.829 --> 00:16:59.839 align:start position:0%
take a look at gaps and services that
 
00:17:01.829 --> 00:17:01.839 align:start position:0%
allows us to affirm that the services
 
00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
are actually being delivered
 
00:17:06.789 --> 00:17:06.799 align:start position:0%
and it also decreases any potential or
 
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity for fraud
 
00:17:11.270 --> 00:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
and right now if we do not deliver this
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
we will be
 
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
receiving a penalty from our partners
 
00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
from medicaid that will
 
00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.079 align:start position:0%
directly hit the state and david wieders
 
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
is available if you have any questions
 
00:17:22.949 --> 00:17:22.959 align:start position:0%
in regards to this
 
00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:26.959 align:start position:0%
any further the two systems that
 
00:17:28.789 --> 00:17:28.799 align:start position:0%
i'd like to call attention to because we
 
00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
have done a lot of requirements work and
 
00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
are literally at a point where we could
 
00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
go out in rfp
 
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
or the evv system because prior to this
 
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
we worked with mercer we had an rfp that
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
was put out
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
and we have defined the systems
 
00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
requirements and we
 
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
can move on this very very quickly and
 
00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:49.919 align:start position:0%
hopefully put ourselves into compliance
 
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
so we are not looking at a penalty
 
00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
for the developmental services i.t
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
remediation system we have been working
 
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
with public consulting group and we've
 
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:01.990 align:start position:0%
with public consulting group and we've
completed

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
completed
 
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh systems requirements for this as well
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
and we are at a point where we could
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
move this forward rapidly to get
 
00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
into actual system builds and to see
 
00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:14.720 align:start position:0%
some relief when it comes to
 
00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
compliance oversight operations
 
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
the last system is the beas
 
00:18:25.029 --> 00:18:25.039 align:start position:0%
modernization and this is
 
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
a different system in that it is not a
 
00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
medicaid based system but it falls
 
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
under a 60 40 so it would be a 40
 
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
match so the net to the state would be a
 
00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.150 align:start position:0%
match so the net to the state would be a
little

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
little
 
00:18:38.549 --> 00:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
over 4 million and again it's a
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
different math
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
matching uh approach so is the slide
 
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
incorrect or
 
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
are you talking a different system that
 
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
slide is correct it should indicate
 
00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
40 not 90 representative irf and i will
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
make sure that that's adjusted when we
 
00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:51.510 align:start position:0%
make sure that that's adjusted when we
submit

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
submit
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
i'll resubmit that to kevin so that you
 
00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
have it
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
know that we have done some extensive
 
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
work here as well we've done a full lean
 
00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
analysis where we've defined measured
 
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
analyzed and figured out what needs to
 
00:19:06.549 --> 00:19:06.559 align:start position:0%
be improved and what controls
 
00:19:09.029 --> 00:19:09.039 align:start position:0%
need to be put in place using the
 
00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
demaiock model
 
00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
and um it's important to note that if we
 
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
do not get this system
 
00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
we believe that we we would be looking
 
00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
at hiring an additional four and a half
 
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.029 align:start position:0%
at hiring an additional four and a half
people

00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:21.039 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
to do this work manually and
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
quite honestly it would still not help
 
00:19:28.789 --> 00:19:28.799 align:start position:0%
us in terms of getting
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
improved service authorizations taking a
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
look at case loads
 
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
helping make sure that we can process
 
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
registry requests
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
for background checks so that nursing
 
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
facilities can move
 
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
quickly to be able to hire people so we
 
00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
can process things more effectively
 
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of human intensive
 
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
data entry right now which comes with
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
thick thumbs and can pose issues down
 
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
the line
 
00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.039 align:start position:0%
and we believe that there is a far more
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
effective approach that we can take
 
00:20:02.149 --> 00:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
relative to our systems in the division
 
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
of long-term supports and services
 
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
deborah i believe representative wallner
 
00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:08.559 align:start position:0%
has a question for you
 
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
i do yeah but you um
 
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
refer to these as capital projects are
 
00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.669 align:start position:0%
refer to these as capital projects are
these

00:20:15.669 --> 00:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
in the operating budget or are do we
 
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
are they in the capital budget these are
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
in the capital budget
 
00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so really they're not
 
00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
before this committee they're before
 
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
the public works committee they are and
 
00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
i wanted to call your attention to it
 
00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:33.669 align:start position:0%
i wanted to call your attention to it
because

00:20:33.669 --> 00:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
for us to be able to be effective in our
 
00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
transactions and operations we need
 
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
these systems
 
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
but for us to be able to transform
 
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
work that results in better services
 
00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the way that we deliver
 
00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.909 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the way that we deliver
services

00:20:53.909 --> 00:20:53.919 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
our information technology is a
 
00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.510 align:start position:0%
our information technology is a
foundation

00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
foundation
 
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
to be able to do that so when i talk to
 
00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:01.029 align:start position:0%
to be able to do that so when i talk to
you

00:21:01.029 --> 00:21:01.039 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
about our operations and our budgets
 
00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
here within division three
 
00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:07.919 align:start position:0%
i wanted to call attention and connect
 
00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
to the fact that we need an
 
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
infrastructure built
 
00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
within long-term supports and services
 
00:21:14.470 --> 00:21:14.480 align:start position:0%
to be able to
 
00:21:17.350 --> 00:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
deliver better services to be able to
 
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
work more effectively with our providers
 
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
and to consider new ways of delivering
 
00:21:23.909 --> 00:21:23.919 align:start position:0%
services that will result in better
 
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
quality for the people we serve
 
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
and efficiencies right thank you for
 
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
clearing that up
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
thanks just one question later that
 
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
deborah um
 
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
are any aspects of these systems these
 
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
installation of these systems
 
00:21:39.669 --> 00:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
including the operational budget
 
00:21:42.870 --> 00:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh no this is entirely capital
 
00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you all right and i just want
 
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
reach out to david weiters to see if he
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
is on the line kevin
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
and if you would like to add anything
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
relative to this
 
00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
representative bean has note that
 
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:25.029 --> 00:22:25.039 align:start position:0%
he would need to meet himself he wants
 
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
to talk but he is there
 
00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
i apologize yes i was just trying to
 
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
find that mute button
 
00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
um my name is david weeders information
 
00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
services director for health and human
 
00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.070 align:start position:0%
services director for health and human
services

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:39.200 align:start position:0%
and deb sheets actually covered it very
 
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
very well
 
00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
the only the only addition i have is the
 
00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
bureau of elderly and adult services
 
00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:46.549 align:start position:0%
bureau of elderly and adult services
modernization

00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
modernization
 
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
was brought up at the capitol project
 
00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
hearing with the public works committee
 
00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
that that project was not in the
 
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
governor's submittal
 
00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
it was one of the items that we
 
00:22:59.750 --> 00:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
suggested that the committee consider
 
00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
moving that forward as well so that we
 
00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:03.430 align:start position:0%
moving that forward as well so that we
could

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
really address the the deferred
 
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
maintenance that we've had on systems
 
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
across the board in dhhs but
 
00:23:11.909 --> 00:23:11.919 align:start position:0%
specifically in long-term supports and
 
00:23:11.919 --> 00:23:12.870 align:start position:0%
specifically in long-term supports and
services

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:23:15.029 --> 00:23:15.039 align:start position:0%
these systems are critical for for them
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
to be able to provide the
 
00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:19.039 align:start position:0%
ongoing operations and maintenance so
 
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
without these systems
 
00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
the operations um expenditures are
 
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
dependent upon them so we really
 
00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
we wanted to tie them together and
 
00:23:29.029 --> 00:23:29.039 align:start position:0%
that's why you're hearing about them
 
00:23:29.039 --> 00:23:30.070 align:start position:0%
that's why you're hearing about them
today

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
i don't have anything else to add just
 
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
to clarify you're saying that none of
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
these projects were included in the
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
governor's capital
 
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh for clarification the the first three
 
00:23:40.630 --> 00:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
that she referred to
 
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
the electronic visit verification system
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
the bd
 
00:23:46.789 --> 00:23:46.799 align:start position:0%
the um i t the developmental services i
 
00:23:46.799 --> 00:23:47.510 align:start position:0%
the um i t the developmental services i
t

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
t
 
00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
remediation and i'm going to get the
 
00:23:52.549 --> 00:23:52.559 align:start position:0%
name wrong on the other one
 
00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
electronic visitor verification the
 
00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:55.919 align:start position:0%
third one
 
00:23:58.390 --> 00:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
filling the development or the bds track
 
00:23:59.590 --> 00:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
the remediation
 
00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
and the electronic visit verification
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
were included it
 
00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
was not was the bureau of elderly and
 
00:24:08.789 --> 00:24:08.799 align:start position:0%
adult services modernization but i do
 
00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:10.559 align:start position:0%
want to call attention to this because i
 
00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
do see this as a mission critical system
 
00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
that is 23 years old and
 
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
i think that when you get right down to
 
00:24:21.029 --> 00:24:21.039 align:start position:0%
it we need the infrastructure to be able
 
00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
to operate beas
 
00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
and be able to ensure that we can
 
00:24:30.549 --> 00:24:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's any other
 
00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
all right so i'm going to move forward
 
00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:45.029 align:start position:0%
all right so i'm going to move forward
and

00:24:45.029 --> 00:24:45.039 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
i'm also going to talk a little bit
 
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
about the alvarez and marcel
 
00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
report that will be published shortly
 
00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.110 align:start position:0%
report that will be published shortly
and

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
there were some very specific uh
 
00:24:57.269 --> 00:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
recommendations for the developmental
 
00:24:59.110 --> 00:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
services system
 
00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
the first uh was the recommendation that
 
00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:02.789 align:start position:0%
the first uh was the recommendation that
the

00:25:02.789 --> 00:25:02.799 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
bureau of developmental services take a
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
look at a
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
waiver redesign and right now the
 
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
developmental disability waiver is a
 
00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
single comprehensive waiver
 
00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:16.640 align:start position:0%
and the a m report indicates that the
 
00:25:19.029 --> 00:25:19.039 align:start position:0%
state should consider taking a tiered
 
00:25:19.039 --> 00:25:19.669 align:start position:0%
state should consider taking a tiered
weaver

00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
weaver
 
00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
approach which is something that when it
 
00:25:23.909 --> 00:25:23.919 align:start position:0%
is published you can
 
00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
take a look at and get some additional
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
information on
 
00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
and the report also asks us to consider
 
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:33.360 align:start position:0%
developing tiered reimbursement rates
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
now um i think it's important to note
 
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
that the dd
 
00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:41.320 align:start position:0%
waiver uh in sfy 20 was about
 
00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
280.2 million um
 
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
and uh it's also interesting to note
 
00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:47.750 align:start position:0%
and uh it's also interesting to note
there

00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
that point seven percent of the dd
 
00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.269 align:start position:0%
that point seven percent of the dd
population

00:25:51.269 --> 00:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
account for five percent of the total
 
00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
dd waiver budget and those individuals
 
00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:58.230 align:start position:0%
dd waiver budget and those individuals
that

00:25:58.230 --> 00:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559 align:start position:0%
account for that higher percentage of
 
00:26:00.559 --> 00:26:01.669 align:start position:0%
account for that higher percentage of
spend

00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
spend
 
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
are individuals that receive intensive
 
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
treatment services and residential
 
00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:10.240 align:start position:0%
options right now we have quite a few
 
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
out-of-state placements and
 
00:26:16.549 --> 00:26:16.559 align:start position:0%
related to the waiver redesign and the
 
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates
 
00:26:21.029 --> 00:26:21.039 align:start position:0%
is the recommendation that a m has made
 
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
that we develop
 
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
in-state intensive treatment services
 
00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:25.350 align:start position:0%
in-state intensive treatment services
and

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
i believe that that is an important
 
00:26:29.029 --> 00:26:29.039 align:start position:0%
factor moving forward
 
00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
because it will allow us to keep
 
00:26:31.679 --> 00:26:32.390 align:start position:0%
because it will allow us to keep
individuals

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
in state with their natural supports it
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
will allow
 
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
us to develop this high higher level
 
00:26:39.029 --> 00:26:39.039 align:start position:0%
high need
 
00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
service and hopefully do so at a cost
 
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
that is less
 
00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:46.720 align:start position:0%
than sending people out of state for
 
00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:47.430 align:start position:0%
than sending people out of state for
services

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
as well it will also help
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
the bureau develop in cooperation with
 
00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
the area agencies and providers
 
00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
a continuum of care that takes into
 
00:26:58.559 --> 00:26:59.110 align:start position:0%
a continuum of care that takes into
account

00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
account
 
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
serving the highest level of highest
 
00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:02.470 align:start position:0%
serving the highest level of highest
need

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
and again i'm going to circle back to
 
00:27:06.230 --> 00:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
the fact that the a
 
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
m recommendation really emphasizes the
 
00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:10.870 align:start position:0%
m recommendation really emphasizes the
import

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
import
 
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
of having an information technology
 
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
system to support
 
00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:18.559 align:start position:0%
our operations so that we in turn can
 
00:27:18.559 --> 00:27:19.029 align:start position:0%
our operations so that we in turn can
support

00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:27:21.669 --> 00:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
transformation which would include a
 
00:27:21.679 --> 00:27:22.310 align:start position:0%
transformation which would include a
waiver

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
waiver
 
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
redesigned to tiered waivers as well as
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
tiered reimbursement rates
 
00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
so all of these are directly connected
 
00:27:33.909 --> 00:27:33.919 align:start position:0%
and when the report comes out you will
 
00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
be able to read that which will tie
 
00:27:39.830 --> 00:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
into the hb2 10 million dollar figure
 
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
that representative walner was asking
 
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
about yesterday
 
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
with director lipman can you provide any
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
insight as to why
 
00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
we don't have that report when we're
 
00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
expected to
 
00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
fund 10 million dollars to implement
 
00:27:56.789 --> 00:27:56.799 align:start position:0%
that report
 
00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:01.039 align:start position:0%
um just being posted but i'd ask karen
 
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
rounds to
 
00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh just give an update on where that is
 
00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
it there was some finalization that
 
00:28:09.029 --> 00:28:09.039 align:start position:0%
needed to happen to it
 
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
and so it is um just about finalized
 
00:28:14.789 --> 00:28:14.799 align:start position:0%
i really hope that it will be public
 
00:28:16.789 --> 00:28:16.799 align:start position:0%
this week okay i mean i don't know what
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
you what you mean by public hearing
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
because we're not really the public
 
00:28:23.669 --> 00:28:23.679 align:start position:0%
um you are you are the public any
 
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
anything i provide to you is public
 
00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.389 align:start position:0%
anything i provide to you is public
information

00:28:26.389 --> 00:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:28:28.149 --> 00:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
okay i mean it's a little frustrating to
 
00:28:29.909 --> 00:28:29.919 align:start position:0%
us that we have to consider a 10 million
 
00:28:29.919 --> 00:28:30.789 align:start position:0%
us that we have to consider a 10 million
dollar

00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:30.799 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
00:28:32.789 --> 00:28:32.799 align:start position:0%
expense and we can't see what's behind
 
00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:34.880 align:start position:0%
it i understand
 
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
okay uh mr representative weiler has a
 
00:28:41.909 --> 00:28:41.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:45.029 --> 00:28:45.039 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman from experience in
 
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
the past with reports
 
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
that are slow in being published and
 
00:28:51.909 --> 00:28:51.919 align:start position:0%
sometimes not totally available
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
and what i've discovered is that you're
 
00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
negotiating with people to change what
 
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
was written
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
because it was too critical or it might
 
00:28:59.909 --> 00:28:59.919 align:start position:0%
have done
 
00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
something might have said something like
 
00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
you've got too many middle
 
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
managers or you paying your people too
 
00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
much so those are the kind of things
 
00:29:09.029 --> 00:29:09.039 align:start position:0%
that we don't want to see
 
00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
exposed this may not be the case at all
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
but it's
 
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
what my experience in the past has told
 
00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:15.360 align:start position:0%
me when there's a report
 
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
that is slow to come to those of us that
 
00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
paid for it
 
00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
it's because of these reasons that
 
00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
there's negotiations going on to change
 
00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
and that's i'm sorry that's my
 
00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:27.430 align:start position:0%
and that's i'm sorry that's my
suspicions

00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
suspicions
 
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
and i can i can certainly appreciate
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
that representative but
 
00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
i can assure you that that's not what's
 
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
happening um
 
00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
there there's definitely not any
 
00:29:40.149 --> 00:29:40.159 align:start position:0%
negotiation around what the report says
 
00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
so to summarize um what we have
 
00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
is a case of my apologies
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
what we have is the report indicating
 
00:29:54.070 --> 00:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
inadequate information technology to
 
00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
collect and analyze data
 
00:30:00.870 --> 00:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
and that we have inadequate controls for
 
00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
aligning services to assess need
 
00:30:05.909 --> 00:30:05.919 align:start position:0%
which means that there may be instances
 
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
where we may be over serving somebody
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
or underserving somebody and what we
 
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
want to do is make sure that every
 
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
individual gets the services that they
 
00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:14.630 align:start position:0%
individual gets the services that they
need

00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
based on their level of care and the
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
recommendations from alvarez and marcel
 
00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
are very very specific
 
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
in terms of what the department can do
 
00:30:26.789 --> 00:30:26.799 align:start position:0%
to address those issues
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
and we do have some gaps in system
 
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
controls that are outlined in the report
 
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
and again the information technology
 
00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.510 align:start position:0%
and again the information technology
foundation

00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
foundation
 
00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:38.240 align:start position:0%
the waiver redesign and the tiered
 
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates will go a long way
 
00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:45.039 align:start position:0%
to try and remediate some of this and
 
00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of a continuum of care we
 
00:30:51.909 --> 00:30:51.919 align:start position:0%
are unable to deliver a lot of necessary
 
00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
intensive treatment services
 
00:30:56.950 --> 00:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
in state so a question related to
 
00:30:58.789 --> 00:30:58.799 align:start position:0%
the 10 million dollars for the alvarez
 
00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
and marcel and the
 
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
fact that the governor didn't include
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
the more expensive of your capital
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
projects the most expensive i guess
 
00:31:09.669 --> 00:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
which one would you prioritize the
 
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
infrared stuff or the
 
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
federal or the um the bureau of elderly
 
00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
adult services modernization
 
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
technology so representative earth i'd
 
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
like to
 
00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
just um go back and indicate that the
 
00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
governor did prioritize
 
00:31:28.509 --> 00:31:28.519 align:start position:0%
um bds developmental services i.t
 
00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
remediation which is noted here by
 
00:31:32.789 --> 00:31:32.799 align:start position:0%
alvarez and marcel
 
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
an electronic visit verification
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the beas
 
00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
modernization was not included
 
00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:42.559 align:start position:0%
and um i would just like to lean into
 
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
david to see if he has anything to add
 
00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:46.640 align:start position:0%
well just to clarify so you're saying
 
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
that all four of those systems were part
 
00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:55.269 --> 00:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
but the okay so i'm not quite sure what
 
00:31:55.279 --> 00:31:56.630 align:start position:0%
but the okay so i'm not quite sure what
your

00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0%
comment how your comment is my question
 
00:32:00.149 --> 00:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
let me rephrase my question
 
00:32:03.669 --> 00:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
okay the the a m is budgeted at about 10
 
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
million dollars in
 
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
hb2 the beas
 
00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
which i understand the bureau of elect
 
00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
of elderly and adult services
 
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
modernization which i understand
 
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:17.039 align:start position:0%
not in the governor's budget capital
 
00:32:18.549 --> 00:32:18.559 align:start position:0%
budget appropriation
 
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
and that's roughly what forty percent
 
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
sixty percent of eight million dollars
 
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
so it's several million dollars
 
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
it's not insubstantial i'm just
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
wondering which you prioritize more
 
00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.070 align:start position:0%
wondering which you prioritize more
highly

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
highly
 
00:32:31.029 --> 00:32:31.039 align:start position:0%
the things that the a m report is
 
00:32:33.029 --> 00:32:33.039 align:start position:0%
talking about or this particular
 
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
system that was not included in the
 
00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
so the a m report calls attention to
 
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
and prioritizes the developmental
 
00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
services i.t
 
00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
remediation all right and
 
00:32:50.950 --> 00:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
points that out as being essential to to
 
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
conduct system transformation
 
00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
that is included in the capital projects
 
00:32:57.750 --> 00:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
i got that
 
00:32:59.750 --> 00:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
what about the elderly adult services
 
00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:02.799 align:start position:0%
modernization system
 
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
are you asking me to choose which one of
 
00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
oh the the one so that's the
 
00:33:12.149 --> 00:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
developmental height
 
00:33:13.669 --> 00:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
the first one is not a 10 million dollar
 
00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
system it is like a million bucks
 
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
bds direct billing has a stat a state
 
00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
net of 100k
 
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
right it developmental services i t
 
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
remediation has
 
00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
a state net of 1.3 million right so
 
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's inconsistent not
 
00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
inconsequential but it's way less than
 
00:33:30.789 --> 00:33:30.799 align:start position:0%
10 million dollars
 
00:33:34.789 --> 00:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
so of the other 9 million dollars
 
00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
of the a m report is is the other nine
 
00:33:40.070 --> 00:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
million or most of it a higher priority
 
00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.190 align:start position:0%
million or most of it a higher priority
than

00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:33:44.310 --> 00:33:44.320 align:start position:0%
the for you then for your department my
 
00:33:45.909 --> 00:33:45.919 align:start position:0%
understanding and correct me if i'm
 
00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
wrong and i'll yield to karen on this
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
is that the operations of the 10 million
 
00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
does not include
 
00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:59.509 --> 00:33:59.519 align:start position:0%
i believe that's correct and if you were
 
00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
asking the department to prioritize we
 
00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
would say that
 
00:34:05.669 --> 00:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
the uh implementation of what is in the
 
00:34:05.679 --> 00:34:05.990 align:start position:0%
the uh implementation of what is in the
a

00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
m report is a priority for the
 
00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:09.030 align:start position:0%
m report is a priority for the
department

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
okay so this is not in the a m report
 
00:34:13.829 --> 00:34:13.839 align:start position:0%
the the this particular system
 
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
no so the what's in the report is is the
 
00:34:18.629 --> 00:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities piece
 
00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
and that is within the capital budget i
 
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
got that but the
 
00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
bureau of elderly and assault services
 
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
modernization piece is not in the report
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
no it is not in the a m report okay
 
00:34:30.869 --> 00:34:30.879 align:start position:0%
thank you and uh representative weiler
 
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
has a question
 
00:34:35.349 --> 00:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman so
 
00:34:37.349 --> 00:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
the we have a department of like
 
00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
information technology
 
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
were they involved all in any of these
 
00:34:42.149 --> 00:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
decisions of
 
00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
not funding this
 
00:34:47.109 --> 00:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
i guess mr wieders i don't know whether
 
00:34:49.349 --> 00:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
he's directly employed by them or he's
 
00:34:49.359 --> 00:34:49.669 align:start position:0%
he's directly employed by them or he's
just

00:34:49.669 --> 00:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
their coordinator or how it works
 
00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:55.919 align:start position:0%
the full department of i.t were they any
 
00:34:57.589 --> 00:34:57.599 align:start position:0%
support or were they any
 
00:34:59.910 --> 00:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh advice on this um thank you
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
representative weiler
 
00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
and mr chair that's a good question we
 
00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:04.790 align:start position:0%
and mr chair that's a good question we
certainly

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:35:07.109 --> 00:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
we coordinate with information the
 
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
department of information technology and
 
00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
we create what's an a
 
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
what's called an agency information
 
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
technology strategic plan
 
00:35:16.230 --> 00:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
with them and then what happens is
 
00:35:17.270 --> 00:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner goulet
 
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
actually works to prioritize those
 
00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:21.349 align:start position:0%
actually works to prioritize those
projects

00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:23.200 align:start position:0%
with the department as well as across
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
the whole state and then submits those
 
00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:25.990 align:start position:0%
the whole state and then submits those
projects

00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
for for review by the governor's office
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
we certainly have prioritizing as
 
00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
as representative irf indicated which
 
00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
one would we do first which one would do
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
we do second bds direct billing was
 
00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
not at the top of the list so we
 
00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
basically got
 
00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
the top 11 projects moved forward
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
through the governor's process
 
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
for the house to review in the public
 
00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:53.430 align:start position:0%
for the house to review in the public
works

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
works
 
00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
committee and commissioner goulet and
 
00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
myself presented
 
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
on this past friday on those projects
 
00:36:03.829 --> 00:36:03.839 align:start position:0%
together so they certainly we we
 
00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
integrate we
 
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
we leverage doit we can't live without
 
00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:08.310 align:start position:0%
we leverage doit we can't live without
them

00:36:08.310 --> 00:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
my role for the department is to
 
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
coordinate our strategic plan
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
as well as our security data warehousing
 
00:36:15.910 --> 00:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
and overall
 
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
application life cycle management thank
 
00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
you mr wieders
 
00:36:23.109 --> 00:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
representative walner your question yes
 
00:36:24.069 --> 00:36:24.079 align:start position:0%
i do
 
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
um i was wondering how was
 
00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
the disabilities community
 
00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
and uh maybe the area agencies involved
 
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
so uh the report uh calls for um
 
00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
extreme comprehensive stakeholder
 
00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
engagement over at least a one year
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
period with the area agency system
 
00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
and with providers and most importantly
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
with the individuals that receive
 
00:36:57.510 --> 00:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
these services as many of you are aware
 
00:36:59.670 --> 00:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
that the disability community
 
00:37:01.750 --> 00:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
has long maintained nothing about us
 
00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
without us
 
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
and part of the a m report takes that
 
00:37:08.069 --> 00:37:08.079 align:start position:0%
into consideration
 
00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
and we have a one-year stakeholder
 
00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
engagement period which will help with
 
00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
systems requirements which will help
 
00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:15.510 align:start position:0%
systems requirements which will help
with

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
the way that we redesign the waivers we
 
00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
want input
 
00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
we want to work collaboratively to bring
 
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
the system to the next level
 
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
and that is the intent and that is
 
00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
clearly outlined in the a
 
00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
m report and it's something the
 
00:37:30.630 --> 00:37:30.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner felt very strongly about
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
thank you deb i appreciate that
 
00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry feel free to go on no i'm i'm
 
00:37:41.829 --> 00:37:41.839 align:start position:0%
that was my question oh no i was talking
 
00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
all right so what i wanted to do is
 
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
give you this um landscape approach
 
00:37:52.790 --> 00:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
look at where we are within the division
 
00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
of long-term supports and services and
 
00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
then i'm going to go through each of the
 
00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:57.190 align:start position:0%
then i'm going to go through each of the
bureaus

00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
bureaus
 
00:37:59.190 --> 00:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
and ask my bureau chiefs to join us
 
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
during that
 
00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
during those presentations but again
 
00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
what i wanted to do
 
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
is to give you context for the a m
 
00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
recommendation and how that fits
 
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
with our budgeting approach in sfy 2223
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
and also the need for information
 
00:38:17.349 --> 00:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
technology and infrastructure builds and
 
00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
how that fits in
 
00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:21.440 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your patience and as
 
00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
soon as the report
 
00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
is up i'm sure that there will be a lot
 
00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
of people reviewing that to see the good
 
00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079 align:start position:0%
that can come out of that
 
00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
those recommendations so thank you just
 
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
let me
 
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
excuse myself for one moment how
 
00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
representative editors you want to um
 
00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:39.440 align:start position:0%
step into the driver's seat no no you're
 
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
doing great
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
okay so next what i would like to do
 
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
is review the bureau of elderly and
 
00:38:48.790 --> 00:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
adult services
 
00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
and what i'd like to do is ask kevin if
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
he could bring
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
wendy altman in as well as
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
medicaid director henry lippman as well
 
00:39:01.829 --> 00:39:01.839 align:start position:0%

00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
of the presentation so the bureau of
 
00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
elderly and adult services
 
00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
has a responsibility and a mission to
 
00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:15.030 align:start position:0%
has a responsibility and a mission to
help

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
help
 
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
provide comprehensive and coordinated
 
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
services for older adults
 
00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
60 plus as well as adults with
 
00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
disabilities that range in age from 18
 
00:39:25.349 --> 00:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
to 59.
 
00:39:27.910 --> 00:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
the state serves as the designated state
 
00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:28.710 align:start position:0%
the state serves as the designated state
agency

00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
agency
 
00:39:31.190 --> 00:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
on aging under the under uh under the
 
00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
older americans act
 
00:39:35.109 --> 00:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
and what we do is we work very hard in
 
00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
partnership with case management
 
00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
agencies and providers to ensure the
 
00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:39.190 align:start position:0%
agencies and providers to ensure the
right

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
safety independence and dignity of
 
00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:42.630 align:start position:0%
safety independence and dignity of
adults

00:39:42.630 --> 00:39:42.640 align:start position:0%
adults
 
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
and we do our absolute best to support
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
people and prevent
 
00:39:49.829 --> 00:39:49.839 align:start position:0%
abuse neglect and exploitation we
 
00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:52.240 align:start position:0%
administer the choices for independence
 
00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
home and community-based 1915
 
00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
c waiver that you will recall is one of
 
00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:57.640 align:start position:0%
the four
 
00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:00.320 align:start position:0%
1915 c waivers within the division of
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
long-term supports and services
 
00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
and we work very hard to set policy
 
00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
and program implementation for other
 
00:40:10.309 --> 00:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
funding streams that we discussed
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
earlier on i think it is very important
 
00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
to take a look at where we are as a
 
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
state and our changing demographics
 
00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
i think that right now when you take a
 
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
look at this in front of you you can see
 
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire is growing and by
 
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
2030 over one third of new hampshire's
 
00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:30.630 align:start position:0%
2030 over one third of new hampshire's
population

00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
will be over 65 years of age and
 
00:40:35.109 --> 00:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
and when you take a look at the
 
00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
demographics the number of 85 plus
 
00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
increases significantly as well so
 
00:40:42.950 --> 00:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
between now and 2050
 
00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
we are looking at an older new hampshire
 
00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
and what we want to do
 
00:40:48.870 --> 00:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
is we want to ensure that people have
 
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
the right to choose the types of
 
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
services they want and how they want to
 
00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
live their lives whether it be in the
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
home in community
 
00:40:57.430 --> 00:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
or whether eventually it be through
 
00:40:59.430 --> 00:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
assisted living or nursing facilities as
 
00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
i wanted to explain a little bit about
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
um bea
 
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
operations and how we are organized and
 
00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
this gives you an
 
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
idea of the lift that we have as an
 
00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:15.109 align:start position:0%
idea of the lift that we have as an
operation

00:41:15.109 --> 00:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
operation
 
00:41:17.589 --> 00:41:17.599 align:start position:0%
we have a long-term care policy unit
 
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
which has seven
 
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
staff and they provide contract
 
00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
oversight for 53 contracts
 
00:41:25.589 --> 00:41:25.599 align:start position:0%
they do grant management they provide
 
00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:27.520 align:start position:0%
oversight for the care path and service
 
00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
link programs which i will discuss
 
00:41:32.069 --> 00:41:32.079 align:start position:0%
very briefly moving forward and they are
 
00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:34.240 align:start position:0%
responsible for program coordination
 
00:41:37.109 --> 00:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
training and technical assistance we
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
also have
 
00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
the state unit on aging which includes
 
00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
two staff
 
00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
the bureau chief wendy altman and an
 
00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
administrative assistants and we are
 
00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
responsible for
 
00:41:48.630 --> 00:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
ensuring that we have a state plan on
 
00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
aging we are responsible for cfi waiver
 
00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:52.710 align:start position:0%
aging we are responsible for cfi waiver
management

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
management

and things like that that we'll get into
 
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
a little bit further
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
later on representative rogers has a
 
00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
question for you
 
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
yeah deb you told us what your vacancy
 
00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
was before
 
00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
um but what kind of vacancy do you have
 
00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
with the adult protective services
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
is that full or do you have vacancies
 
00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:26.470 align:start position:0%
is that full or do you have vacancies
there

00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
adult protective services is full and
 
00:45:31.829 --> 00:45:31.839 align:start position:0%
during the hiring freeze that was
 
00:45:34.069 --> 00:45:34.079 align:start position:0%
prioritized for maintaining keeping that
 
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
in place
 
00:45:37.109 --> 00:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
we needed that safety net especially
 
00:45:38.230 --> 00:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
during covid so
 
00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:40.720 align:start position:0%
they are fully staffed and on the
 
00:45:42.309 --> 00:45:42.319 align:start position:0%
delivery service um
 
00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
with your providers do you know what
 
00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
kind of vacancy rate the providers have
 
00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:47.349 align:start position:0%
kind of vacancy rate the providers have
or

00:45:47.349 --> 00:45:47.359 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
is that something you're not aware of um
 
00:45:53.349 --> 00:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
i i don't know if i would refer to it as
 
00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
a vacancy rate but i would
 
00:45:57.510 --> 00:45:57.520 align:start position:0%
refer to it as a workforce fulfillment
 
00:45:57.520 --> 00:45:58.309 align:start position:0%
refer to it as a workforce fulfillment
right

00:45:58.309 --> 00:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
okay and so for example i'm sure that my
 
00:46:03.589 --> 00:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
colleagues and partners
 
00:46:05.349 --> 00:46:05.359 align:start position:0%
at the nursing facilities are going to
 
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
be very clear about the fact that they
 
00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:09.599 align:start position:0%
are having difficulty getting staff to
 
00:46:11.750 --> 00:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
be able to deliver services
 
00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
just as i think if you spoke with gsil
 
00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
or other personal care service providers
 
00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
or home health agencies they too are
 
00:46:23.589 --> 00:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
having trouble attracting
 
00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
workforce in the home and community
 
00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
based setting as well
 
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
but you don't have any quantitative
 
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
numbers on what how bad it is do you
 
00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
um i can take a look at that but i think
 
00:46:36.319 --> 00:46:36.630 align:start position:0%
um i can take a look at that but i think
that

00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:36.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
they would definitely have it yeah they
 
00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:40.309 align:start position:0%
they would definitely have it yeah they
think

00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
so moving forward i mentioned that we
 
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
had nine major program areas
 
00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to go through these pretty
 
00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:52.950 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to go through these pretty
quickly

00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
the first is the choices for
 
00:46:56.069 --> 00:46:56.079 align:start position:0%
independence waiver and
 
00:46:58.550 --> 00:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
these are people that are found eligible
 
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
for waiver services
 
00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
and the services include case management
 
00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:03.920 align:start position:0%
personal care
 
00:47:05.829 --> 00:47:05.839 align:start position:0%
you can get a mid-level range of care
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
which is your assisted living facilities
 
00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
supported housing non-medical
 
00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
transportation all of these are listed
 
00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:12.630 align:start position:0%
transportation all of these are listed
here

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:12.640 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
and these are older adults and adults
 
00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
with disabilities that choose to remain
 
00:47:19.349 --> 00:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
at home and in their community rather
 
00:47:20.309 --> 00:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
than getting
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
nursing facility care and that is an
 
00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:24.640 align:start position:0%
option that we provide
 
00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:27.760 align:start position:0%
as a waiver to our state plan services
 
00:47:29.829 --> 00:47:29.839 align:start position:0%
and it's something that many many many
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
people choose to do they choose to stay
 
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
in their home in their community

and these are the programs that you've
 
00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
heard a lot about
 
00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
um during the kovic crisis these are the
 
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
home delivered meals
 
00:47:54.549 --> 00:47:54.559 align:start position:0%

but are not medicaid eligible and these
 
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
are individuals that have to demonstrate
 
00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
a need for
 
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
services and are in social and economic
 
00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:15.030 align:start position:0%

need
 
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
then we have what's known as social
 
00:48:18.309 --> 00:48:18.319 align:start position:0%

00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
i think representative while there's a
 
00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:42.309 align:start position:0%
i think representative while there's a
question

00:48:42.309 --> 00:48:42.319 align:start position:0%

00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:21.839 align:start position:0%
um moving forward we also have the
 
00:49:24.549 --> 00:49:24.559 align:start position:0%
service uh link resource centers again
 
00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh they serve statewide in various
 
00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:28.390 align:start position:0%
uh they serve statewide in various
regions

00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
regions
 
00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
and they are responsible for information
 
00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
referral they do
 
00:49:34.549 --> 00:49:34.559 align:start position:0%
person-centered options counseling they
 
00:49:34.559 --> 00:49:35.030 align:start position:0%
person-centered options counseling they
provide

00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:49:37.109 --> 00:49:37.119 align:start position:0%
oversight for the new hampshire family
 
00:49:38.790 --> 00:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
caregiver program
 
00:49:41.349 --> 00:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
they do senior medicare patrol which
 
00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:42.640 align:start position:0%
helps prevent fraud
 
00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
and make sure that our medicare
 
00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries are aware
 
00:49:49.829 --> 00:49:49.839 align:start position:0%
of what their um
 
00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
benefits are and then we also do direct
 
00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
veteran directed home and
 
00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
community-based services as well
 
00:49:57.829 --> 00:49:57.839 align:start position:0%
through our service link resource
 
00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
centers it's important to know that
 
00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
people of all
 
00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
ages disabilities and income levels can
 
00:50:04.309 --> 00:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
come through
 
00:50:06.790 --> 00:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
our service link resource centers as
 
00:50:09.510 --> 00:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
this is a no wrong door approach
 
00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
and lastly we have our nursing facility
 
00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
level of care
 
00:50:16.549 --> 00:50:16.559 align:start position:0%
and again 71 nursing facilities 11 are
 
00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
our approach here is to make sure that
 
00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
those who need a nursing facility level
 
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
of care
 
00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:27.839 align:start position:0%
and are unable to remain safely at home
 
00:50:29.270 --> 00:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
or in the community
 
00:50:31.349 --> 00:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
gain admittance and we partner very
 
00:50:32.790 --> 00:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
closely with the counties
 
00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:34.640 align:start position:0%
on assuring that these services are
 
00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:35.990 align:start position:0%
on assuring that these services are
delivered

00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
delivered
 
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
um i also think it's important to note
 
00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
here that this is a
 
00:50:43.349 --> 00:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
team approach here at dltss the division
 
00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
of medicaid services
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
two times per year sets the nursing
 
00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
facility rates
 
00:50:51.829 --> 00:50:51.839 align:start position:0%
and also our health facilities
 
00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
administration and program integrity
 
00:50:57.430 --> 00:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
also play a role relative to licensing
 
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
and during the covid crisis there was an
 
00:51:02.069 --> 00:51:02.079 align:start position:0%
awful lot of support and movement
 
00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
forward from all parts of the department
 
00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:06.640 align:start position:0%
for our nursing facilities
 
00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
representative edwards has a question
 
00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:12.790 align:start position:0%
representative edwards has a question
dave

00:51:12.790 --> 00:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
i'm used to leaving it off commute uh
 
00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
okay so thank you mr chairman
 
00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
mike my question is on the
 
00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
nursing facilities uh earlier on we saw
 
00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
a slide
 
00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
that showed a tremendous growth rate in
 
00:51:31.109 --> 00:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
the number of people
 
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
85 plus and and so
 
00:51:38.309 --> 00:51:38.319 align:start position:0%
it just makes me curious to what extent
 
00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
you have a 10-year plan for the number
 
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
of beds we need in a nursing home
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
and to what extent that 10-year plan is
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
coordinated and owned at the county
 
00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:51.430 align:start position:0%
coordinated and owned at the county
level

00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:51:53.430 --> 00:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
and and i asked that because our most
 
00:51:55.109 --> 00:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
recent administrator
 
00:51:58.069 --> 00:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
and rockingham did not have a 10-year
 
00:51:58.079 --> 00:51:58.710 align:start position:0%
and rockingham did not have a 10-year
plan

00:51:58.710 --> 00:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:52:02.309 --> 00:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
and uh and just so it seems to me like
 
00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
we're falling behind
 
00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:06.640 align:start position:0%
on capital requests and i'm i'd like you
 
00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:08.069 align:start position:0%
on capital requests and i'm i'd like you
to

00:52:08.069 --> 00:52:08.079 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
tell me if i'm i'm missing something or
 
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
or if we are in fact falling behind
 
00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
okay so representative edwards that's a
 
00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
very good question and thank you for
 
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
bringing it up
 
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
i think what we're doing now is we have
 
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
we are meeting on a regular basis once
 
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
again with our nursing facilities and
 
00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
county partners i know that
 
00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
representative weiler has joined
 
00:52:32.309 --> 00:52:32.319 align:start position:0%
that committee meeting and i think that
 
00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
shall be part of the discussion moving
 
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
forward um i think during the covid
 
00:52:39.030 --> 00:52:39.040 align:start position:0%
crisis we are actually looking and i
 
00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:39.510 align:start position:0%
crisis we are actually looking and i
think

00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:52:41.109 --> 00:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
you know the nursing facilities would
 
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
definitely be able to speak to you
 
00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
about this is that we're looking at
 
00:52:47.190 --> 00:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
potentially a lower census because of
 
00:52:49.829 --> 00:52:49.839 align:start position:0%
outbreaks and the coveted units had
 
00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
higher intensity of care and things like
 
00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:52.790 align:start position:0%
higher intensity of care and things like
that

00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:54.549 --> 00:52:54.559 align:start position:0%
all of this will need to be considered
 
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
moving forward in cooperation with the
 
00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:57.270 align:start position:0%
moving forward in cooperation with the
counties

00:52:57.270 --> 00:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
counties
 
00:52:59.750 --> 00:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
and with the nursing facilities and i
 
00:53:01.349 --> 00:53:01.359 align:start position:0%
know that we're for example we have a
 
00:53:01.359 --> 00:53:01.829 align:start position:0%
know that we're for example we have a
meeting

00:53:01.829 --> 00:53:01.839 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
this friday the 12th where all some of
 
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
this will be discussed and this can be a
 
00:53:08.069 --> 00:53:08.079 align:start position:0%
partnership moving forward
 
00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
so follow up if i may um so
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
so i think what i hear you say is to the
 
00:53:15.119 --> 00:53:15.430 align:start position:0%
so i think what i hear you say is to the
to

00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
in response to my question is there
 
00:53:20.470 --> 00:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
isn't currently a 10-year plan with a
 
00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
fixed head bed count that we know that
 
00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
we should be planning on
 
00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
but that you anticipate a process to
 
00:53:29.109 --> 00:53:29.119 align:start position:0%
arrive at one
 
00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
and i i would like to think in a 10-year
 
00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
plan we we've sort of moved
 
00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
um what i would say is i don't want to
 
00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
over commit but i think that that has
 
00:53:42.549 --> 00:53:42.559 align:start position:0%
got to be part of the dialogue we have
 
00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:53.349 --> 00:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
so with that i'd like to give henry
 
00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
lippman an opportunity to walk us
 
00:53:56.880 --> 00:53:57.430 align:start position:0%
lippman an opportunity to walk us
through

00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:00.640 align:start position:0%
nfqa mqip
 
00:54:02.549 --> 00:54:02.559 align:start position:0%
and proshare which are three acronyms
 
00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
that have a
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
deep impact on where we are with our
 
00:54:07.829 --> 00:54:07.839 align:start position:0%
work with the counties and with the
 
00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
county share
 
00:54:14.549 --> 00:54:14.559 align:start position:0%
um thank you deb and thank you for
 
00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to present again to the
 
00:54:18.069 --> 00:54:18.079 align:start position:0%
committee um
 
00:54:21.109 --> 00:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
so the nfqa tax is sort of the beginning
 
00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
point of
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
trying to bring um additional monies to
 
00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:27.290 align:start position:0%
support um
 
00:54:27.290 --> 00:54:29.670 align:start position:0%
support um
[Music]

00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
nursing facilities and uh um
 
00:54:35.589 --> 00:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
the the question actually before i start
 
00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
though just in
 
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
where we ended up last time i i had a
 
00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
trying to recall whether the moratorium
 
00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
on nursing home beds
 
00:54:46.150 --> 00:54:46.160 align:start position:0%
um which was have historically been a
 
00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:47.030 align:start position:0%
um which was have historically been a
legislative

00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh action is still in place i
 
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
i know if karen if you uh um can
 
00:54:56.069 --> 00:54:56.079 align:start position:0%
refresh my memory on that or not but i
 
00:54:57.910 --> 00:54:57.920 align:start position:0%
just believe that it is
 
00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
but i believe edwards going back
 
00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
to the 1990s has been a moratorium on
 
00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:04.950 align:start position:0%
to the 1990s has been a moratorium on
adding

00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
adding
 
00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
new beds and i think the the demographic
 
00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
pressures are
 
00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
are getting um that to be considered
 
00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
in terms of for long-term planning
 
00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
because it's been a while since that's
 
00:55:17.190 --> 00:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
been considered
 
00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:20.559 align:start position:0%
um but you know the excuse me before you
 
00:55:20.559 --> 00:55:21.270 align:start position:0%
um but you know the excuse me before you
continue

00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
continue
 
00:55:23.589 --> 00:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
didn't you just approve new beds out on
 
00:55:23.599 --> 00:55:25.109 align:start position:0%
didn't you just approve new beds out on
the seacoast

00:55:25.109 --> 00:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
the seacoast
 
00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
um i don't mean you necessarily but the
 
00:55:27.359 --> 00:55:29.910 align:start position:0%
um i don't mean you necessarily but the
state

00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not that project representative
 
00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
so um thank you for educating me that
 
00:55:43.589 --> 00:55:43.599 align:start position:0%
the legislatures imposed
 
00:55:47.190 --> 00:55:47.200 align:start position:0%
a bed count moratorium um
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
do you need anything in hb2 to
 
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
empower you to do planning because i
 
00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:54.390 align:start position:0%
empower you to do planning because i
think

00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
planning for beds 10 years out is maybe
 
00:55:58.710 --> 00:55:58.720 align:start position:0%
different than building them
 
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
and it starts with a plan so do you need
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
anything from us and hb2
 
00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
to allow you to plan so i guess i would
 
00:56:07.750 --> 00:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
like to
 
00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
um work through karen to consult with
 
00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and
 
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
um circle back to you on that if that's
 
00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
um so in terms of the nfqa tax it's it's
 
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
sort of a beginning point
 
00:56:24.069 --> 00:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
to be able to uh draw additional funds
 
00:56:26.470 --> 00:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
to fill in the gap between what medicaid
 
00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:27.589 align:start position:0%
to fill in the gap between what medicaid
pays

00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
pays
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
and um the costs uh that
 
00:56:33.589 --> 00:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
nursing facilities incur and so there is
 
00:56:33.599 --> 00:56:34.630 align:start position:0%
nursing facilities incur and so there is
a

00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
a tax that of five and a half percent
 
00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:38.720 align:start position:0%
that is applied to
 
00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
patient service revenues and and that
 
00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:41.910 align:start position:0%
patient service revenues and and that
tax

00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
is then um paid to
 
00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:48.160 align:start position:0%
the dra it is transferred to the
 
00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:49.349 align:start position:0%
the dra it is transferred to the
department

00:56:49.349 --> 00:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
and the department draws down a federal
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
match typically it's 50 50.
 
00:56:57.510 --> 00:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic it is
 
00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
56.2 federal match that extra 6.2
 
00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:02.549 align:start position:0%
56.2 federal match that extra 6.2
percent

00:57:02.549 --> 00:57:02.559 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:57:05.829 --> 00:57:05.839 align:start position:0%
on the federal portion um starting i
 
00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
believe it was
 
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
in the first quarter of the pandemic
 
00:57:12.309 --> 00:57:12.319 align:start position:0%
the state passed that money directly
 
00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
back to the nursing facilities didn't
 
00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
retain any of
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
that but that tax if you could go to the
 
00:57:23.829 --> 00:57:23.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
funds what is the payment which is known
 
00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
as the
 
00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
medicaid quality assessment program
 
00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:30.549 align:start position:0%
medicaid quality assessment program
payment

00:57:30.549 --> 00:57:30.559 align:start position:0%
payment
 
00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
and um the uh
 
00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
this this program has been in place for
 
00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
for quite a w
 
00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
uh a long time there's been refinements
 
00:57:42.069 --> 00:57:42.079 align:start position:0%
to it as
 
00:57:44.630 --> 00:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
cms has reviewed and refined their
 
00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
regulations the
 
00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
most recent refinement happened in last
 
00:57:50.789 --> 00:57:50.799 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
it didn't change the amount that was um
 
00:57:57.910 --> 00:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
collected or or paid out it basically
 
00:57:57.920 --> 00:57:58.710 align:start position:0%
collected or or paid out it basically
just

00:57:58.710 --> 00:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:58:01.109 --> 00:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
made sure that the the tax and the
 
00:58:03.270 --> 00:58:03.280 align:start position:0%
payment was made by the state before the
 
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
the federal match was drawn and so that
 
00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
had a bit of a timing
 
00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
impact on nursing facilities but but not
 
00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
a lot
 
00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
but it was needed to be addressed in
 
00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
order to
 
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
be current with current regulations
 
00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
let me stop there if there's any
 
00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
questions on those two pieces that sort
 
00:58:22.950 --> 00:58:22.960 align:start position:0%
of come together to
 
00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
fill in part of the gap now the this
 
00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:28.240 align:start position:0%
particular payment goes to both
 
00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
private nursing homes and to the county
 
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
nursing facilities
 
00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
is there this payment timing related to
 
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
the pro share payment timing transfers
 
00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh no okay thank you
 
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any questions looks
 
00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
like you're okay hand me to go ahead
 
00:58:49.589 --> 00:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
okay um if if not
 
00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
um i think we've kind of covered
 
00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
both the tax and this this particular
 
00:58:56.630 --> 00:58:56.640 align:start position:0%
payment and
 
00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
i think again um to the benefit of the
 
00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
nursing facilities
 
00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
the public health emergency to the
 
00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
extent it
 
00:59:08.069 --> 00:59:08.079 align:start position:0%
continues as expected those additional
 
00:59:08.079 --> 00:59:09.030 align:start position:0%
continues as expected those additional
payments

00:59:09.030 --> 00:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
payments
 
00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
have amounted to about 1.3 million a
 
00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:13.190 align:start position:0%
have amounted to about 1.3 million a
quarter

00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
quarter
 
00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
to the nursing facilities those will
 
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
continue um to the
 
00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
uh if the public health emergency runs
 
00:59:20.309 --> 00:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
the end of
 
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
those calendar years as expected um
 
00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:23.430 align:start position:0%
those calendar years as expected um
would

00:59:23.430 --> 00:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:59:26.470 --> 00:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
um also mean that the the uh enhanced
 
00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
federal match would continue to go to
 
00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
the nursing facilities
 
00:59:33.910 --> 00:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
um the the next um
 
00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
slide here talks about pro share one and
 
00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
pro share two
 
00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
i know from having been to various
 
00:59:43.109 --> 00:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
county meetings over the years
 
00:59:47.349 --> 00:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
um that this is a really important part
 
00:59:49.230 --> 00:59:49.240 align:start position:0%
when i first came to the department in
 
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
2017 there was some
 
00:59:54.309 --> 00:59:54.319 align:start position:0%
restructuring of pro share one and pro
 
00:59:56.230 --> 00:59:56.240 align:start position:0%
pro share that had to be done
 
00:59:59.430 --> 00:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
so that there would not be a reduction
 
00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
in the amount
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
of money being able to draw historically
 
01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:08.240 align:start position:0%
the transaction was generated
 
01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
first from the state providing money
 
01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
to the counties and the counties keeping
 
01:00:14.950 --> 01:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
a portion and then sending
 
01:00:19.549 --> 01:00:19.559 align:start position:0%
a portion back the feds came around in
 
01:00:21.829 --> 01:00:21.839 align:start position:0%
2018 and 19
 
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
allowed us to restructure it to um
 
01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
to draw down additional monies but with
 
01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:29.030 align:start position:0%
to draw down additional monies but with
the

01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
caveat that we eventually the caveat
 
01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
that came through that we had to
 
01:00:37.109 --> 01:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
um have the federal um i mean the
 
01:00:38.549 --> 01:00:38.559 align:start position:0%
non-federal share
 
01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
come from the counties itself with
 
01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:42.640 align:start position:0%
respect to pro share one
 
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
and that pro share two counties were
 
01:00:46.069 --> 01:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
converted to
 
01:00:48.069 --> 01:00:48.079 align:start position:0%
um what they call a certified public
 
01:00:48.079 --> 01:00:49.349 align:start position:0%
um what they call a certified public
expenditure

01:00:49.349 --> 01:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
expenditure
 
01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
but from a big picture standpoint what
 
01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
pro shares intended to do
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
is after you've made the per diem
 
01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:57.030 align:start position:0%
is after you've made the per diem
payment

01:00:57.030 --> 01:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
payment
 
01:00:59.829 --> 01:00:59.839 align:start position:0%
after you've made the m quip payment is
 
01:01:01.109 --> 01:01:01.119 align:start position:0%
to fill in the gap
 
01:01:04.309 --> 01:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
between um in the case of pro share one
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
what medicare would otherwise pay
 
01:01:08.789 --> 01:01:08.799 align:start position:0%
and what those payments are so if you
 
01:01:09.990 --> 01:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
will the process
 
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
intended to try to fill in that last bit
 
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
of gap
 
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
um for proshare 2 it's essentially the
 
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
same kind of concept but not that
 
01:01:21.510 --> 01:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
instance we're comparing
 
01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:24.640 align:start position:0%
medicaid costs to medicaid payments
 
01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
and again this the difference that
 
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
you're trying to fill in is
 
01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
the each year that we do a pro share
 
01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
transaction we go through a process of
 
01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
state plan amendments
 
01:01:46.309 --> 01:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
we're currently in that phase right now
 
01:01:49.349 --> 01:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
cms has
 
01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
identified some changes that they want
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
in the calculation we're still on
 
01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:57.190 align:start position:0%
in the calculation we're still on
negotiating

01:01:57.190 --> 01:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
negotiating
 
01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:02.309 --> 01:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
i know a number of counties have
 
01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:04.240 align:start position:0%
approached us about getting a sense of
 
01:02:05.589 --> 01:02:05.599 align:start position:0%
kind of where things stand and later
 
01:02:07.589 --> 01:02:07.599 align:start position:0%
this week we're going to be
 
01:02:10.950 --> 01:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
sharing what we know of by county
 
01:02:14.150 --> 01:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
in terms of the the calculations but the
 
01:02:15.829 --> 01:02:15.839 align:start position:0%
the issues that they've raised in the
 
01:02:18.549 --> 01:02:18.559 align:start position:0%
current pro share
 
01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
that they hadn't raised in prior years
 
01:02:22.870 --> 01:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
is you know i said that the
 
01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
in both pro share 1 and pro share 2
 
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
you're comparing
 
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
um cost or payments to what
 
01:02:32.069 --> 01:02:32.079 align:start position:0%
met what medicaid or medicare would
 
01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise pay
 
01:02:35.589 --> 01:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
and so what they're saying now is with
 
01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
respect to
 
01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:39.760 align:start position:0%
what medicare or medicaid pays that in
 
01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:41.990 align:start position:0%
what medicare or medicaid pays that in
particular

01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
particular
 
01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
the there is a portion when medicare
 
01:02:45.990 --> 01:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
determines what a facility should be
 
01:02:47.349 --> 01:02:47.359 align:start position:0%
paid that the patient
 
01:02:50.069 --> 01:02:50.079 align:start position:0%
also contributes and they're saying that
 
01:02:51.670 --> 01:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
with respect to
 
01:02:55.510 --> 01:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
um to proshare that the payments
 
01:02:58.549 --> 01:02:58.559 align:start position:0%
that that patients make towards their
 
01:02:58.559 --> 01:02:59.109 align:start position:0%
that that patients make towards their
care

01:02:59.109 --> 01:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:03:02.150 --> 01:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
that that has to be counted uh towards
 
01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
what payments the the facilities are
 
01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:06.630 align:start position:0%
what payments the the facilities are
being

01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
being
 
01:03:09.990 --> 01:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
credited for receiving historically last
 
01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:17.029 --> 01:03:17.039 align:start position:0%
was based on what just the state paid
 
01:03:18.710 --> 01:03:18.720 align:start position:0%
and or what medicare would have
 
01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:19.839 align:start position:0%
otherwise paid
 
01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
as a direct payment not not taking into
 
01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:23.109 align:start position:0%
as a direct payment not not taking into
account

01:03:23.109 --> 01:03:23.119 align:start position:0%
account
 
01:03:26.230 --> 01:03:26.240 align:start position:0%
the patient payment they've also um
 
01:03:30.789 --> 01:03:30.799 align:start position:0%
asked us to um look at um
 
01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
a different methodology for the upper
 
01:03:33.990 --> 01:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
payment limit
 
01:03:37.270 --> 01:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
we've been working um with
 
01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
cms on looking at some different ways to
 
01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
compensate for
 
01:03:45.670 --> 01:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
what um what changes they're looking to
 
01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
make and
 
01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
um are continuing to to work on that
 
01:03:50.069 --> 01:03:50.079 align:start position:0%
again i think
 
01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
what i can do at this point and what we
 
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
intend to do is
 
01:03:56.069 --> 01:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
um based on where we are in the process
 
01:03:57.029 --> 01:03:57.039 align:start position:0%
is to share
 
01:03:59.670 --> 01:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
um with the county nursing facilities
 
01:04:01.349 --> 01:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
where we stand at the moment and that
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to continue to work over the
 
01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:03.750 align:start position:0%
we're going to continue to work over the
next

01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
next
 
01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
several months to try to improve upon
 
01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:07.119 align:start position:0%
where um
 
01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:08.720 align:start position:0%
they're sort of directing us at this
 
01:04:10.870 --> 01:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
point let me pause there i know
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
representative you and i have had some
 
01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
conversations so hopefully this a little
 
01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:15.680 align:start position:0%
this is ringing true to you
 
01:04:18.309 --> 01:04:18.319 align:start position:0%
um it's a little bit complicated but i
 
01:04:19.349 --> 01:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
think if you keep the
 
01:04:21.029 --> 01:04:21.039 align:start position:0%
simple thing in mind here that this
 
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
payment's intended to fill in that last
 
01:04:23.910 --> 01:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
gap between
 
01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
either what medicaid paid or what
 
01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
medicare paid and
 
01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
um what's going on right now is is
 
01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
a redefinition of what ethan medicare
 
01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
medicaid paid from the standpoint of the
 
01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
feds in terms of looking at what's
 
01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:37.750 align:start position:0%
feds in terms of looking at what's
matchable

01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
matchable
 
01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
the positive news here i guess in terms
 
01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:42.640 align:start position:0%
of um
 
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
the f enhanced fmap is that with respect
 
01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
to the pro share one counties that
 
01:04:50.549 --> 01:04:50.559 align:start position:0%
um assuming the public health emergency
 
01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
is still in effect which i think it will
 
01:04:53.349 --> 01:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
be for sure
 
01:04:55.349 --> 01:04:55.359 align:start position:0%
um when it comes to the june payment
 
01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
that it won't be 50
 
01:04:58.349 --> 01:04:58.359 align:start position:0%
that has to be raised it will be the
 
01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
43.8 percent
 
01:05:04.390 --> 01:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
so let me stop there that was a lot to
 
01:05:05.670 --> 01:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
put into that slide
 
01:05:09.029 --> 01:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
um see if there are questions
 
01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any questions henry's
 
01:05:12.789 --> 01:05:12.799 align:start position:0%
been kind enough to answer a lot of mine
 
01:05:12.799 --> 01:05:16.789 align:start position:0%
been kind enough to answer a lot of mine
previously

01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:20.829 --> 01:05:20.839 align:start position:0%
i guess you're good to go mr lipman okay
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
um deb i think that's the last slide
 
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
or right um the only thing that i'd just
 
01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
like to call an attention to before i
 
01:05:31.349 --> 01:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
advance to uh caseloads is that
 
01:05:34.150 --> 01:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
um as we go through the accounting units
 
01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:34.630 align:start position:0%
um as we go through the accounting units
um

01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:34.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
in 2154 and 504
 
01:05:40.630 --> 01:05:40.640 align:start position:0%
programmatically what we have done is we
 
01:05:41.589 --> 01:05:41.599 align:start position:0%
have worked with a
 
01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
nursing facility to repurpose 27 beds
 
01:05:49.270 --> 01:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
to create a jerry psychiatric unit
 
01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
and our intent in repurposing these 27
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
beds is that this will allow us to be
 
01:05:57.990 --> 01:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
able to create a continuum of care
 
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
where we will be able to move people
 
01:06:01.829 --> 01:06:01.839 align:start position:0%
from new hampshire hospital
 
01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
into this unit and thereby provide
 
01:06:06.390 --> 01:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
additional capacity to move people out
 
01:06:07.349 --> 01:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
of the ed
 
01:06:09.990 --> 01:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
into new hampshire hospital and this way
 
01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
we'll make ensure that people are
 
01:06:13.190 --> 01:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
getting the right level of care and
 
01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:13.829 align:start position:0%
getting the right level of care and
support

01:06:13.829 --> 01:06:13.839 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
in the jury psychiatric unit that will
 
01:06:18.870 --> 01:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
be established with the repurposing of
 
01:06:20.789 --> 01:06:20.799 align:start position:0%
these 27 beds
 
01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
and we are hoping to have that uh up and
 
01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
running and
 
01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
operational at the start of uh the the
 
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
upcoming fiscal year
 
01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
and that is included in 504 in the
 
01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:33.029 align:start position:0%
and that is included in 504 in the
atypicals

01:06:33.029 --> 01:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
atypicals
 
01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
so just make a note of that so moving
 
01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:36.309 align:start position:0%
so just make a note of that so moving
forward

01:06:36.309 --> 01:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
is that what i might have heard about
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
are you out on the c cones
 
01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
yep i am i am assuming that is that is
 
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
what you are speaking to but
 
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
it's a very important capacity build for
 
01:06:47.910 --> 01:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
a continuum of care
 
01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
and uh that is noted in 504
 
01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
i think representative edwards has a
 
01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
question for you
 
01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
so i think uh ms sheets may have just
 
01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
answered it i i was just curious of the
 
01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
physical location where those 27 beds
 
01:07:04.309 --> 01:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
will be
 
01:07:08.309 --> 01:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
um i it's ocean side
 
01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
that is the nursing facility that we are
 
01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:12.640 align:start position:0%
partnering with
 
01:07:15.750 --> 01:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
and that's a i'm sorry i'm unfamiliar so
 
01:07:19.109 --> 01:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
oceanside is a a private
 
01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
nursing home and and they are
 
01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:22.789 align:start position:0%
nursing home and and they are
constructing

01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
constructing
 
01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
actually constructing expanding their
 
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
facility to create
 
01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
physical space for 27 beds and then
 
01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
they're going to worry about staffing it
 
01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
um what they are doing is they have the
 
01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
27 beds there
 
01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
and are repurposing those 27 beds
 
01:07:42.549 --> 01:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
and they have brought in on a jerry
 
01:07:43.829 --> 01:07:43.839 align:start position:0%
spike specialist
 
01:07:46.150 --> 01:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
and are getting the staffing lined up to
 
01:07:49.029 --> 01:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
support that approach
 
01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:52.079 align:start position:0%
and what what town is oceanside
 
01:07:54.789 --> 01:07:54.799 align:start position:0%
um i believe it is hampton or
 
01:07:57.190 --> 01:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
northampton wendy can you confirm for
 
01:07:59.109 --> 01:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
me i know i drove i drive by it
 
01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
frequently yes it's in hampden
 
01:08:10.710 --> 01:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
hampton yep
 
01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
good to go thank you all right so
 
01:08:16.229 --> 01:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
um next i just wanted to review some
 
01:08:17.110 --> 01:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
basic uh
 
01:08:20.309 --> 01:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
case load figures on duplicated um as
 
01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
you can tell with aps
 
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
um we had seen an upward trend with the
 
01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:26.309 align:start position:0%
um we had seen an upward trend with the
exception

01:08:26.309 --> 01:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
exception
 
01:08:30.229 --> 01:08:30.239 align:start position:0%
of uh 2020. um the case reporting is
 
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
down we attribute this to covid
 
01:08:34.950 --> 01:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
just to be aware that we have done a
 
01:08:36.550 --> 01:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
tremendous outreach effort
 
01:08:39.189 --> 01:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
uh to try and get communities neighbors
 
01:08:41.110 --> 01:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
helping neighbors partnering to be able
 
01:08:42.149 --> 01:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
to keep
 
01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
the case reporting up and on
 
01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
our website you will see a weekly
 
01:08:49.110 --> 01:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
account we track this regularly to make
 
01:08:49.990 --> 01:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
sure that we
 
01:08:53.349 --> 01:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
are getting as much eyes on and as much
 
01:08:56.229 --> 01:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
uh community collaboration to ensure
 
01:08:58.470 --> 01:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
that nobody is at risk despite
 
01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
um kovid and despite the fact that
 
01:09:02.470 --> 01:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
people have been in their homes and not
 
01:09:03.669 --> 01:09:03.679 align:start position:0%
as many people
 
01:09:05.189 --> 01:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
in and out of the homes of the people
 
01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
that we support in the community
 
01:09:10.950 --> 01:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
the cfi shows an upward trend and
 
01:09:11.829 --> 01:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
enrollment trend
 
01:09:14.709 --> 01:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
which we would expect with or without
 
01:09:17.030 --> 01:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
covid based on the growing population
 
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire of seniors
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
nursing facilities you'll see that the
 
01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
census is down in 2019 from 2019 to 20.
 
01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
we could uh contribute that to covid all
 
01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:28.870 align:start position:0%
we could uh contribute that to covid all
right

01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of the fact that there are
 
01:09:32.309 --> 01:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
outbreaks and the inability to place
 
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
people there
 
01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
and i think that you know as things move
 
01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:37.590 align:start position:0%
and i think that you know as things move
forward

01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
we would be taking a good hard look at
 
01:09:41.349 --> 01:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
that relative to rate setting
 
01:09:44.229 --> 01:09:44.239 align:start position:0%
and a number of other factors when you
 
01:09:46.229 --> 01:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
take a look at our title three and title
 
01:09:46.239 --> 01:09:46.829 align:start position:0%
take a look at our title three and title
20

01:09:46.829 --> 01:09:46.839 align:start position:0%
20
 
01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
programs you will see that um
 
01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:52.799 align:start position:0%
this is down and i believe the reason
 
01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
that this is down is because of
 
01:09:55.750 --> 01:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
primarily workforce
 
01:09:58.229 --> 01:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
issues in terms of the delivery of these
 
01:09:58.239 --> 01:09:59.669 align:start position:0%
issues in terms of the delivery of these
services

01:09:59.669 --> 01:09:59.679 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:10:02.709 --> 01:10:02.719 align:start position:0%
and um when you have issues getting
 
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
individuals to deliver those services
 
01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
it means that you're going to see a
 
01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:10.400 align:start position:0%
reducing census there
 
01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
and then for our service link our census
 
01:10:13.199 --> 01:10:13.910 align:start position:0%
and then for our service link our census
is

01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
is expectedly growing because new
 
01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire's population is growing
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
and we're seeing a growth in everything
 
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
from medicare counseling to veterans
 
01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:24.470 align:start position:0%
from medicare counseling to veterans
programs

01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:34.790 --> 01:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
our key accomplishments um i think that
 
01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
what you'll do is you'll see a trend
 
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
throughout this as well as the next two
 
01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:39.830 align:start position:0%
throughout this as well as the next two
bureaus

01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
bureaus
 
01:10:42.870 --> 01:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
for beas we have worked very very much
 
01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
so on a state plan on aging
 
01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
and we continue to work very
 
01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with the governor state
 
01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
commission on aging
 
01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
the idea is to help prepare the state
 
01:10:57.350 --> 01:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
for this growing population of seniors
 
01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
and uh to be prepared for 2030
 
01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
and to be prepared for 2050 and the
 
01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
governor's state commission on aging has
 
01:11:06.310 --> 01:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
a leadership position there and the
 
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
state plan on aging is housed on the
 
01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
department's website
 
01:11:11.669 --> 01:11:11.679 align:start position:0%
and if you would like to look at that
 
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
it's easily accessible
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
the other key accomplishments we have
 
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
are specific to covid
 
01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
19. we have worked very cooperatively
 
01:11:21.669 --> 01:11:21.679 align:start position:0%
and collaboratively
 
01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
with our providers in the community
 
01:11:27.030 --> 01:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
as well as our cms partners in the
 
01:11:29.350 --> 01:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
submission of an appendix k
 
01:11:32.310 --> 01:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
which allows us to get federal approval
 
01:11:34.229 --> 01:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
for greater flexibilities during the
 
01:11:36.229 --> 01:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
public health emergency
 
01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
and most importantly we worked with new
 
01:11:40.390 --> 01:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire employment security and the
 
01:11:42.229 --> 01:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
provider community to stand up the
 
01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
long-term care stabilization program
 
01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
which provided stipends to ensure that
 
01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
people stayed
 
01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
in place in their positions during the
 
01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
height of the covenant emergency
 
01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
we have received a tremendous amount of
 
01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:56.550 align:start position:0%
we have received a tremendous amount of
funding

01:11:56.550 --> 01:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:11:59.910 --> 01:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
through our title programs
 
01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
that we have made numerous contract
 
01:12:06.229 --> 01:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
amendments to to push out dollars to
 
01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
help support meals
 
01:12:10.229 --> 01:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
on wheels adult day services and service
 
01:12:11.110 --> 01:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
links program
 
01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
as an example and previously i mentioned
 
01:12:15.910 --> 01:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
the adult protective services outreach
 
01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:19.270 align:start position:0%
the adult protective services outreach
campaign

01:12:19.270 --> 01:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
for key challenges i i go back to
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
the information technology it's critical
 
01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
for us to be able to
 
01:12:30.550 --> 01:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
conduct our business at a transaction
 
01:12:32.310 --> 01:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
and operational level
 
01:12:33.990 --> 01:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
and it's critical for us to be able to
 
01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
do system transformation moving forward
 
01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
workforce we continue to struggle with
 
01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.110 align:start position:0%
workforce we continue to struggle with
capacity

01:12:41.110 --> 01:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
01:12:43.510 --> 01:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
in both our nursing facilities and in
 
01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
home and community based services
 
01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
and in terms of system transformation
 
01:12:51.270 --> 01:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult for us to move
 
01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
system transformation forward
 
01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
unless we have the the staff
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
in place and we filled up the vacancy
 
01:13:00.870 --> 01:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
rates moving forward within the bureau
 
01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
of elderly and adult services
 
01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
and this is terribly important because
 
01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
we need to prepare
 
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:18.070 align:start position:0%
 
services

01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
i believe that i'm sorry sharon go ahead
 
01:13:25.030 --> 01:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um so the last uh
 
01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
box here public health emergency funding
 
01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
and the services outreach um
 
01:13:35.590 --> 01:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
do we have a time frame for that
 
01:13:37.669 --> 01:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
the public health emergency funding has
 
01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
been coming through
 
01:13:42.630 --> 01:13:42.640 align:start position:0%
through our federal partners
 
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
and as you for example if you were to
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
look at the gnc
 
01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh agenda you'll see that a lot of them
 
01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
went through as informational
 
01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
and we've been pushing that funding out
 
01:13:55.669 --> 01:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
as we receive it to our providers in the
 
01:13:55.679 --> 01:13:57.270 align:start position:0%
as we receive it to our providers in the
community

01:13:57.270 --> 01:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:13:59.830 --> 01:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
but do we know heard me so do we know
 
01:14:02.950 --> 01:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
when it ends is there a time frame
 
01:14:05.189 --> 01:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
uh anything that we have received we
 
01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
have pushed through in contracting
 
01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
um as you know uh our federal partners
 
01:14:12.149 --> 01:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
have put through
 
01:14:14.790 --> 01:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
um are in the process of putting through
 
01:14:15.830 --> 01:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
additional relief
 
01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh packages we will need to examine that
 
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
and see if there's any further aid that
 
01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
will be coming our way
 
01:14:27.669 --> 01:14:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:30.630 --> 01:14:30.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much president
 
01:14:32.310 --> 01:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
edwards you have a question
 
01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
um meals thank you mr chairman um
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
meals on wheels in manchester uh
 
01:14:40.630 --> 01:14:40.640 align:start position:0%
i assume that there's a kitchen
 
01:14:43.350 --> 01:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
somewhere that supports the
 
01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
cooking and preparation of the meals
 
01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
puts them into some sort of vehicle
 
01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
and then drops them off is that
 
01:14:53.910 --> 01:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
basically the way that works
 
01:14:56.310 --> 01:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
uh i'm going to ask wendy altman to
 
01:14:58.149 --> 01:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
speak to that because i am not real
 
01:14:59.189 --> 01:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
familiar with the
 
01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
manchester approach and what's going on
 
01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:03.030 align:start position:0%
manchester approach and what's going on
there

01:15:03.030 --> 01:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:15:05.270 --> 01:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
okay and just just to foreshadow where
 
01:15:06.310 --> 01:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
i'm going
 
01:15:08.709 --> 01:15:08.719 align:start position:0%
i in this new new center there's a
 
01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
kitchen that
 
01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
seems to be able to produce a lot more
 
01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
meals than what they actually are
 
01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
and i'm just wondering if there's a way
 
01:15:18.630 --> 01:15:18.640 align:start position:0%
to leverage existing resources
 
01:15:21.430 --> 01:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
i'd like to know where manchester based
 
01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
meals and wheels
 
01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
are getting their meals wendy can you
 
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
speak to this please
 
01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
yes so good afternoon um
 
01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
chair and committee um again my name is
 
01:15:34.390 --> 01:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
wendy altman
 
01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
i'm the bureau chief at the bureau of
 
01:15:37.830 --> 01:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
elderly and adult services
 
01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
and in relation to your question mr
 
01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:42.080 align:start position:0%
edwards i am
 
01:15:43.990 --> 01:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
in manchester there are several
 
01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
different sites and in the
 
01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
surrounding area around manchester many
 
01:15:49.270 --> 01:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
of them
 
01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
do have kitchens where they either prep
 
01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
home delivered meals or they actually
 
01:15:59.270 --> 01:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
cook and prepare the meals so some of
 
01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
our nutrition providers use
 
01:16:05.030 --> 01:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
vendors who bring in
 
01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
prepared food and they heat it and and
 
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
prepare it
 
01:16:11.910 --> 01:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
for delivery or for what we call
 
01:16:15.189 --> 01:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
congregant meals and the congregant
 
01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
meals has been
 
01:16:17.830 --> 01:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
suspended since the public health
 
01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
emergency but they still utilize the
 
01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
kitchen and the area and the workers to
 
01:16:24.709 --> 01:16:24.719 align:start position:0%
to prepare those meals and put them in
 
01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
the in the
 
01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
in the warmers that they need um to
 
01:16:32.950 --> 01:16:32.960 align:start position:0%
go out on the road and deliver the meals
 
01:16:34.870 --> 01:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
to people's homes
 
01:16:37.110 --> 01:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
thank you so so we're using vendors in
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
manchester now
 
01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
and not state assets we're contracting
 
01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:49.510 align:start position:0%
 
correct

01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:52.400 align:start position:0%
i can't hear you there you go you know
 
01:16:58.149 --> 01:16:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:00.229 --> 01:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
i think you're going good to go deb all
 
01:17:01.510 --> 01:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
right thank you
 
01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
um so i did take a look at the workload
 
01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:04.709 align:start position:0%
um so i did take a look at the workload
benchmarks

01:17:04.709 --> 01:17:04.719 align:start position:0%
benchmarks
 
01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
and i just want to share a little bit
 
01:17:08.630 --> 01:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
here um
 
01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
i focused on adult protective services
 
01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
because it is so terribly
 
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
critical to the way that we process and
 
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
protect people
 
01:17:18.790 --> 01:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
so um the workload is that we act
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
process all accurately completed
 
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
registry requests
 
01:17:25.110 --> 01:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
on a timely basis per rule and as you
 
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
know before somebody hires somebody to
 
01:17:28.870 --> 01:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
bring them into a nursing facility for
 
01:17:30.709 --> 01:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
example they would need to do the
 
01:17:33.189 --> 01:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
background check against the registry
 
01:17:35.830 --> 01:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
so our quality standard is that we
 
01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
respond within five days to registry
 
01:17:39.189 --> 01:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
requests 100
 
01:17:41.669 --> 01:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
of the time and right now with the
 
01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
exception of a few periods during the
 
01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:45.189 align:start position:0%
exception of a few periods during the
covid

01:17:45.189 --> 01:17:45.199 align:start position:0%
covid
 
01:17:48.310 --> 01:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
crisis we were hitting that as well as
 
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
we could
 
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
and we will continue to work towards
 
01:17:54.790 --> 01:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
that quality standard moving forward
 
01:17:57.030 --> 01:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
the second one is that adult protective
 
01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:57.830 align:start position:0%
the second one is that adult protective
services

01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:18:00.310 --> 01:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
initiates an investigation within 72
 
01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:02.159 align:start position:0%
hours of a report
 
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
um and i just wanted to share that in
 
01:18:06.630 --> 01:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year 20 our time frame was
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
at 100
 
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
our intent is always to be able to
 
01:18:12.149 --> 01:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
respond within a hundred percent
 
01:18:15.189 --> 01:18:15.199 align:start position:0%
um on this one please know that
 
01:18:17.430 --> 01:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
level one is the highest risk these come
 
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
in as a level one or a level two
 
01:18:22.310 --> 01:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
and if it's a level one we aim to get in
 
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
the home within 24 hours
 
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
or less moving on that and then the
 
01:18:31.350 --> 01:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
uh last one is the workload
 
01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
relative to the level of care
 
01:18:34.630 --> 01:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
determination process
 
01:18:37.030 --> 01:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
we look to determine and complete a
 
01:18:39.510 --> 01:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
level of care determination within 60
 
01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:41.189 align:start position:0%
level of care determination within 60
days

01:18:41.189 --> 01:18:41.199 align:start position:0%
days
 
01:18:44.070 --> 01:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
and right now we are working within a 95
 
01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:45.350 align:start position:0%
and right now we are working within a 95
benchmark

01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
benchmark
 
01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
our quality standard is to get a 100 of
 
01:18:50.070 --> 01:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
the level of care determinations
 
01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
processed within 60 days of
 
01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
intake um the eligibility
 
01:18:59.189 --> 01:18:59.199 align:start position:0%
unit and the kovic crisis
 
01:19:02.149 --> 01:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
made that difficult at times but we are
 
01:19:03.669 --> 01:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
working towards getting back
 
01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
up to 100 in terms of our benchmarking
 
01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
and that is something that we are
 
01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
constantly looking at
 
01:19:17.189 --> 01:19:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
um so we took a look at the incremental
 
01:19:21.030 --> 01:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
and decremented
 
01:19:24.790 --> 01:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
a budget outcome if we were to receive a
 
01:19:27.030 --> 01:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
five percent increase
 
01:19:28.950 --> 01:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
we would apply that five percent
 
01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
increase to
 
01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
uh cfr waiver rates for the adult day
 
01:19:33.910 --> 01:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
service program
 
01:19:36.630 --> 01:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
and home health which could potentially
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
assist with improving workforce capacity
 
01:19:41.430 --> 01:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
development and would ensure greater
 
01:19:44.550 --> 01:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
consumer satisfaction in sports we would
 
01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
look to hire three additional staff
 
01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:47.750 align:start position:0%
look to hire three additional staff
positions

01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
positions
 
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
to one work on cfi waiver administration
 
01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
and improve customer service for the
 
01:19:55.350 --> 01:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
eligibility processing i had mentioned
 
01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
where we're at a 95 percent rate
 
01:19:59.510 --> 01:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
and we would also use it for grant
 
01:20:01.590 --> 01:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
management and oversight
 
01:20:05.189 --> 01:20:05.199 align:start position:0%
and lastly we would look at hiring two
 
01:20:05.199 --> 01:20:05.830 align:start position:0%
and lastly we would look at hiring two
additional

01:20:05.830 --> 01:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
additional
 
01:20:08.229 --> 01:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
aps staff adult protective services
 
01:20:08.239 --> 01:20:09.189 align:start position:0%
aps staff adult protective services
staff

01:20:09.189 --> 01:20:09.199 align:start position:0%
staff
 
01:20:11.430 --> 01:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
to improve the intake and registry
 
01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:13.189 align:start position:0%
to improve the intake and registry
processing

01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
processing
 
01:20:16.229 --> 01:20:16.239 align:start position:0%
because we are beginning to closely bump
 
01:20:16.950 --> 01:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
up against
 
01:20:19.110 --> 01:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
what our current staffing can handle and
 
01:20:21.030 --> 01:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
if i had that five percent i'd be
 
01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
planning now for it um and
 
01:20:25.189 --> 01:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
representative wallner has a question
 
01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
for you yeah i deb i just wondered if
 
01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
any of these are were in your
 
01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs
 
01:20:36.070 --> 01:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh they were not in the prioritized
 
01:20:38.070 --> 01:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
needs but the prioritized needs
 
01:20:40.390 --> 01:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
clearly indicated the rate increases for
 
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
case management
 
01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
for personal care services and for
 
01:20:48.550 --> 01:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
homemaker services
 
01:20:51.270 --> 01:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
thank you could i ask one more question
 
01:20:52.390 --> 01:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
of course
 
01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
i wondered what is the what a kind of a
 
01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:55.669 align:start position:0%
i wondered what is the what a kind of a
caseload

01:20:55.669 --> 01:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
caseload
 
01:20:58.790 --> 01:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
are your adult protective service um
 
01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
staff caring wendy do you have that
 
01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:11.189 --> 01:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
hi we we'd have to get back to you
 
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
that's those are numbers that we're
 
01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:13.830 align:start position:0%
that's those are numbers that we're
running

01:21:13.830 --> 01:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
running
 
01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
this week typically in the past
 
01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:20.719 align:start position:0%
on average depending on
 
01:21:22.870 --> 01:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
the area of the state and the intakes
 
01:21:24.149 --> 01:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
01:21:27.669 --> 01:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
um could it could run between
 
01:21:32.149 --> 01:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
10 to 10 to 20 cases per worker
 
01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
thank you and it varies again by
 
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
area of the state based on where i'm
 
01:21:38.880 --> 01:21:39.910 align:start position:0%
area of the state based on where i'm
from

01:21:39.910 --> 01:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:21:43.270 --> 01:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
if the budget were decreased um
 
01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
we would have to reduce non-medicaid
 
01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
billable services
 
01:21:53.110 --> 01:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
and we would run into a risk of
 
01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
non-compliance for grant waiver and
 
01:21:56.550 --> 01:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
other federal funding
 
01:21:59.430 --> 01:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
which could result in a loss of medicaid
 
01:22:00.550 --> 01:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
federal funds or
 
01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:10.070 --> 01:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
and with that i'm going to hand it over
 
01:22:15.350 --> 01:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:18.550 --> 01:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
great thank you dad i'm going to go
 
01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:19.350 align:start position:0%
great thank you dad i'm going to go
ahead

01:22:19.350 --> 01:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
01:22:19.360 --> 01:22:23.270 align:start position:0%
ahead
and

01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:26.629 --> 01:22:26.639 align:start position:0%
take over sharing okay um so
 
01:22:29.270 --> 01:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
this budget as you can see here is quite
 
01:22:30.229 --> 01:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
a large budget
 
01:22:33.430 --> 01:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
most of it um being related
 
01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
to a nursing home
 
01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
and accounting unit 2152 which we will
 
01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
get to in just a moment
 
01:22:44.070 --> 01:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
so that's most of what you are seeing
 
01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:49.030 align:start position:0%
so that's most of what you are seeing
there

01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:50.790 --> 01:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
and then we can move right into the
 
01:22:53.030 --> 01:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
accounting units for this bureau
 
01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
which start on page 997 with accounting
 
01:22:56.400 --> 01:23:04.830 align:start position:0%
which start on page 997 with accounting
unit

01:23:04.830 --> 01:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:14.550 align:start position:0%
 
92.50

01:23:14.550 --> 01:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:18.229 --> 01:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
okay and accounting unit 9250
 
01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
is adult protective service worker apsw
 
01:23:22.709 --> 01:23:22.719 align:start position:0%
for short operations
 
01:23:25.750 --> 01:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
this is where the employees
 
01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
who are adult protective service workers
 
01:23:46.830 --> 01:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:56.310 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:23:56.310 --> 01:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:59.430 --> 01:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
okay not hearing
 
01:24:04.390 --> 01:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
any questions so the next one is 78.72
 
01:24:06.629 --> 01:24:06.639 align:start position:0%
the admin on aging which is at the
 
01:24:08.310 --> 01:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
bottom of page 998
 
01:24:14.709 --> 01:24:14.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:18.629 --> 01:24:18.639 align:start position:0%
this is where the meals on wheels
 
01:24:26.950 --> 01:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
what is the governor's it's not a lot of
 
01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
money but it's a big jump in um
 
01:24:35.030 --> 01:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
line is that
 
01:24:38.310 --> 01:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
so um that i believe that i've provided
 
01:24:43.270 --> 01:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
the information from department of
 
01:24:44.950 --> 01:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
administrative services
 
01:24:50.149 --> 01:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:54.550 --> 01:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
okay we don't we don't control what that
 
01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:54.870 align:start position:0%
okay we don't we don't control what that
line

01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:24:58.229 --> 01:24:58.239 align:start position:0%
ends up being is that true of all your
 
01:24:59.510 --> 01:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
accounts sometimes they're in there and
 
01:25:01.110 --> 01:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes they're not
 
01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
because it's right it's true of line 40
 
01:25:07.990 --> 01:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
line 41. no no i
 
01:25:09.189 --> 01:25:09.199 align:start position:0%
understand that it's two of those lines
 
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
what i meant was some
 
01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
accounts have indirect class some
 
01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
accounts don't sometimes have
 
01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
yes that is true and i don't i don't
 
01:25:19.030 --> 01:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
remember the formula off the top of my
 
01:25:20.470 --> 01:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
head as to why some of them have them
 
01:25:21.669 --> 01:25:21.679 align:start position:0%
and some of them don't
 
01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
okay it's based on a formula i'm sure
 
01:25:28.229 --> 01:25:28.239 align:start position:0%
44 well class all of the personnel
 
01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
class lines plus 40 41 and 42 are all
 
01:25:33.910 --> 01:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
um determined by administrative services
 
01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:34.709 align:start position:0%
um determined by administrative services
okay

01:25:34.709 --> 01:25:34.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:25:35.910 --> 01:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
did someone else have a question there i
 
01:25:39.030 --> 01:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
thought it's a game but i guess not
 
01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
watch out okay
 
01:25:45.030 --> 01:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
the next accounting unit is 8917 which
 
01:25:46.310 --> 01:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
is health promotion
 
01:25:50.149 --> 01:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:53.030 --> 01:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
representative raised her hand ah go
 
01:25:54.550 --> 01:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
ahead website
 
01:25:58.390 --> 01:25:58.400 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry it's further on my question
 
01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:03.350 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry it's further on my question
okay

01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:06.149 --> 01:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
all right the next one is 9255 which is
 
01:26:06.159 --> 01:26:06.790 align:start position:0%
all right the next one is 9255 which is
social

01:26:06.790 --> 01:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
social
 
01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
social services block grant also known
 
01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:22.070 --> 01:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
if i can continue all right the next one
 
01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:22.669 align:start position:0%
if i can continue all right the next one
is

01:26:22.669 --> 01:26:22.679 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
8925 which is medicaid services grants
 
01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:32.310 align:start position:0%
8925 which is medicaid services grants
ship

01:26:32.310 --> 01:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
i'd say you can probably continue okay
 
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
the next accounting unit
 
01:26:39.430 --> 01:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
is no wrong door uh which is a grant
 
01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:40.229 align:start position:0%
is no wrong door uh which is a grant
that

01:26:40.229 --> 01:26:40.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
um is an all likelihood ending but we
 
01:26:47.990 --> 01:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
have budgeted a dollar just in case that
 
01:26:55.830 --> 01:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:57.590 --> 01:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
and as i've mentioned those should all
 
01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
be federal dollars when we do that
 
01:27:05.110 --> 01:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
and it is yes um the next one
 
01:27:08.629 --> 01:27:08.639 align:start position:0%
is 3317 admin on aging services grant
 
01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:20.550 --> 01:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
i don't see any hands okay
 
01:27:23.189 --> 01:27:23.199 align:start position:0%
uh the next one 89 20 money follows the
 
01:27:25.189 --> 01:27:25.199 align:start position:0%
person this is also a grant
 
01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
that has uh pretty much ended but
 
01:27:31.750 --> 01:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
has the potential of continuing forward
 
01:27:32.870 --> 01:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
01:27:36.870 --> 01:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
two dollars there okay uh
 
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
90 10 is volunteer activities
 
01:27:50.790 --> 01:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
that is our senior companion program
 
01:27:57.270 --> 01:27:57.280 align:start position:0%
okay so the volunteers obviously they're
 
01:27:58.070 --> 01:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
not getting paid
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
just to run it is that it's a volunteer
 
01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:02.070 align:start position:0%
just to run it is that it's a volunteer
program

01:28:02.070 --> 01:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
where um we work collaboratively
 
01:28:07.990 --> 01:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
with the counties belknap grafton
 
01:28:10.149 --> 01:28:10.159 align:start position:0%

01:28:14.629 --> 01:28:14.639 align:start position:0%
partnership where we're
 
01:28:17.590 --> 01:28:17.600 align:start position:0%

contractor
 
01:28:21.270 --> 01:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
and we put in a certain percentage of
 
01:28:23.110 --> 01:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
money so that we can keep that program
 
01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:24.070 align:start position:0%
money so that we can keep that program
going

01:28:24.070 --> 01:28:24.080 align:start position:0%

01:31:24.950 --> 01:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
8915 which is congregate housing
 
01:31:26.790 --> 01:31:26.800 align:start position:0%
this is very similar to the program i
 
01:31:28.470 --> 01:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
just talked about here the new hampshire
 
01:31:30.550 --> 01:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
foster grandparents
 
01:31:33.430 --> 01:31:33.440 align:start position:0%
we did not implement the program and the
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
agency did not request
 
01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh funds for it for 22 23.
 
01:31:42.070 --> 01:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:44.470 --> 01:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
no karen just answered my question thank
 
01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:45.110 align:start position:0%
no karen just answered my question thank
you

01:31:45.110 --> 01:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:31:46.470 --> 01:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
you're welcome i thought you might ask
 
01:31:48.390 --> 01:31:48.400 align:start position:0%
again so
 
01:31:51.510 --> 01:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
your mind reader sharon only
 
01:31:53.510 --> 01:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
occasionally it's a hard skill to use
 
01:31:57.350 --> 01:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
um the next accounting unit is 8943
 
01:31:59.030 --> 01:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
which is alzheimer's and
 
01:32:10.830 --> 01:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
okay continuing down
 
01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh the next accounting unit is uh 21.52
 
01:32:20.790 --> 01:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
this is the accounting unit where uh the
 
01:32:21.910 --> 01:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
nursing home payments
 
01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
and the um the cfi
 
01:32:28.629 --> 01:32:28.639 align:start position:0%
waiver are paid out of this is also
 
01:32:28.639 --> 01:32:29.030 align:start position:0%
waiver are paid out of this is also
where

01:32:29.030 --> 01:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:32:31.830 --> 01:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
the county participation is which is
 
01:32:34.310 --> 01:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
also known as the county cap
 
01:32:37.270 --> 01:32:37.280 align:start position:0%
uh so what i i'm just going to preempt i
 
01:32:38.470 --> 01:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
know some of the questions that i'm
 
01:32:39.990 --> 01:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
going to get and talk about it a little
 
01:32:43.189 --> 01:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
bit more um so one of the things that
 
01:32:44.310 --> 01:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
you're going to see here
 
01:32:45.750 --> 01:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
or that you do see here is that the
 
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
general funds are budgeted
 
01:32:51.430 --> 01:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
at 5 million dollars for 22 and 23.
 
01:32:55.590 --> 01:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
the reason for that is that the statute
 
01:32:58.390 --> 01:32:58.400 align:start position:0%
the statute for county cap requires that
 
01:32:58.400 --> 01:32:59.030 align:start position:0%
the statute for county cap requires that
the

01:32:59.030 --> 01:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:33:01.830 --> 01:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
state uh provide a five million dollar
 
01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:02.629 align:start position:0%
state uh provide a five million dollar
credit

01:33:02.629 --> 01:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
credit
 
01:33:04.870 --> 01:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
to counties so that's what we have
 
01:33:06.550 --> 01:33:06.560 align:start position:0%
budgeted which is the statutory
 
01:33:08.070 --> 01:33:08.080 align:start position:0%
requirement of the five million
 
01:33:12.070 --> 01:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
dollar credit to counties there has been
 
01:33:15.350 --> 01:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
a a history
 
01:33:17.669 --> 01:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
of additional general funds being added
 
01:33:19.830 --> 01:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
here however they
 
01:33:21.669 --> 01:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
would not be considered a credit under
 
01:33:23.189 --> 01:33:23.199 align:start position:0%
statute they were just additional
 
01:33:24.629 --> 01:33:24.639 align:start position:0%
general funds that reduced
 
01:33:28.390 --> 01:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
the county contribution
 
01:33:30.629 --> 01:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
you'll also notice that the overall
 
01:33:31.430 --> 01:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
budget is
 
01:33:34.550 --> 01:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:38.229 --> 01:33:38.239 align:start position:0%
what 15 million dollars from 21 to 22
 
01:33:41.510 --> 01:33:41.520 align:start position:0%
um and then it's even funded in 23. uh
 
01:33:44.070 --> 01:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
and i think deb spoke to some of that
 
01:33:45.110 --> 01:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
reason but she
 
01:33:47.669 --> 01:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
she can also um talk about it more if
 
01:33:49.510 --> 01:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
need be
 
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
there is the 3.1 percent rate increase
 
01:33:56.229 --> 01:33:56.239 align:start position:0%
that happened in one one of um 20 and
 
01:33:58.070 --> 01:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
then again on one one of 21
 
01:33:59.750 --> 01:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
and of course that rate increase would
 
01:34:02.550 --> 01:34:02.560 align:start position:0%
not be would only be reflected in fiscal
 
01:34:04.629 --> 01:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
year 21 for part of the year
 
01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
and i wouldn't even say half of the year
 
01:34:07.990 --> 01:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
because payments don't happen
 
01:34:11.189 --> 01:34:11.199 align:start position:0%
immediately for that month um
 
01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
so that is part of that increase
 
01:34:16.149 --> 01:34:16.159 align:start position:0%
additionally there are some rate
 
01:34:18.229 --> 01:34:18.239 align:start position:0%
increases which i know deb to talk about
 
01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
built in
 
01:34:23.110 --> 01:34:23.120 align:start position:0%
for cfi um on the the four cfi lines
 
01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:23.910 align:start position:0%
for cfi um on the the four cfi lines
there

01:34:23.910 --> 01:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:34:27.510 --> 01:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
um so that is also part of that increase
 
01:34:29.270 --> 01:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
that you're seeing there so i'll stop
 
01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:29.830 align:start position:0%
that you're seeing there so i'll stop
there

01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:34:31.110 --> 01:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
i'm sure there are some additional
 
01:34:32.950 --> 01:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
questions so karen one of the questions
 
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
i got related to that
 
01:34:36.390 --> 01:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
everything you just said made sense but
 
01:34:38.709 --> 01:34:38.719 align:start position:0%
it you didn't mention the fact that
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
the bad occupancy rates are down and i'm
 
01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
not anticipated to jump
 
01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
at least as fine as far as i understand
 
01:34:47.189 --> 01:34:47.199 align:start position:0%
back up to where they were pre-covered
 
01:34:47.990 --> 01:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
for a while
 
01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
did you account for that or can you
 
01:34:51.510 --> 01:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
account for that in those in the total
 
01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:53.189 align:start position:0%
account for that in those in the total
number

01:34:53.189 --> 01:34:53.199 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:34:55.189 --> 01:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
deb can you talk about that a little bit
 
01:34:56.950 --> 01:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
i know there's a couple of factors like
 
01:35:00.709 --> 01:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
the cost report that we use already
 
01:35:03.109 --> 01:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
um i'm actually going to let henry speak
 
01:35:04.950 --> 01:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
to that because he's actually spoken to
 
01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:05.430 align:start position:0%
to that because he's actually spoken to
the

01:35:05.430 --> 01:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:35:08.629 --> 01:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
uh counties about that i think henry
 
01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
actually had to jump
 
01:35:13.189 --> 01:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
so okay alrighty um
 
01:35:15.030 --> 01:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
what happens is when we when we
 
01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
determine the rates
 
01:35:19.430 --> 01:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
there's a lag on when the rates are um
 
01:35:22.229 --> 01:35:22.239 align:start position:0%
on when the occupancy rate is calculated
 
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
in there so for the time being we are
 
01:35:26.070 --> 01:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
good but moving forward
 
01:35:28.310 --> 01:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
the census is going to have to be taken
 
01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
into consideration and it will be lower
 
01:35:32.470 --> 01:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
and we need to take a look at that
 
01:35:34.709 --> 01:35:34.719 align:start position:0%
and um i know that henry has been
 
01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
talking uh
 
01:35:37.910 --> 01:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
to the counties about that and has been
 
01:35:39.830 --> 01:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
a point of dialogue and will be again
 
01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
most likely as part of friday's meeting
 
01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:43.830 align:start position:0%
most likely as part of friday's meeting
perhaps

01:35:43.830 --> 01:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
01:35:46.950 --> 01:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
okay representative walnut
 
01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
yes so karen in this proposed
 
01:35:55.030 --> 01:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
budget for 2223 the governor's budget
 
01:35:58.149 --> 01:35:58.159 align:start position:0%
there are no rate increases on for any
 
01:35:59.270 --> 01:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
of these
 
01:36:02.070 --> 01:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
any of these lines is that correct no so
 
01:36:03.590 --> 01:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
there are rate increases
 
01:36:06.870 --> 01:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
for um the cfi lines which
 
01:36:12.229 --> 01:36:12.239 align:start position:0%
uh deb i believe that's 505 506 and 529.
 
01:36:14.790 --> 01:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
okay so representative walner in line
 
01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:16.229 align:start position:0%
okay so representative walner in line
506

01:36:16.229 --> 01:36:16.239 align:start position:0%
506
 
01:36:19.350 --> 01:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
home support waiver services that is
 
01:36:22.390 --> 01:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
where you will find the case management
 
01:36:24.470 --> 01:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
rate increase and the personal care
 
01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
services rate increase
 
01:36:29.590 --> 01:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
and how much are those step okay for
 
01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
case management you will see
 
01:36:37.590 --> 01:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
a total fund increase of 2956
 
01:36:41.669 --> 01:36:41.679 align:start position:0%
nine zero and for personal care
 
01:36:45.030 --> 01:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
four six six two one zero
 
01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
two and five can you tell me what
 
01:36:52.149 --> 01:36:52.159 align:start position:0%
percentage they are
 
01:36:55.350 --> 01:36:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:57.510 --> 01:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
like how much how what percentage will
 
01:36:58.470 --> 01:36:58.480 align:start position:0%
the rate be
 
01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:02.159 align:start position:0%
increasing um i can tell you that
 
01:37:03.430 --> 01:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
i can give you the amount i don't know
 
01:37:05.510 --> 01:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
the percentage offhand unless wendy does
 
01:37:06.790 --> 01:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
but with personal care
 
01:37:10.470 --> 01:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
3.1 percent brought it to 489
 
01:37:13.750 --> 01:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
and we increased it to 562 which puts it
 
01:37:16.310 --> 01:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
in parity with the state plan
 
01:37:21.109 --> 01:37:21.119 align:start position:0%
and for the homemaker the 3.1 percent
 
01:37:24.790 --> 01:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
brought it to 509 and we increased it to
 
01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:26.310 align:start position:0%
brought it to 509 and we increased it to
540

01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
540
 
01:37:28.709 --> 01:37:28.719 align:start position:0%
using a cost-based methodology for this
 
01:37:28.719 --> 01:37:30.149 align:start position:0%
using a cost-based methodology for this
service

01:37:30.149 --> 01:37:30.159 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:37:32.709 --> 01:37:32.719 align:start position:0%
okay so those two services case
 
01:37:32.719 --> 01:37:33.510 align:start position:0%
okay so those two services case
management

01:37:33.510 --> 01:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
management
 
01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
and personal care thank you and in five
 
01:37:42.229 --> 01:37:42.239 align:start position:0%

oh thank you okay 529 is homie thank you
 
01:37:48.470 --> 01:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
all right and homemaker is 84 thousand
 
01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:53.040 align:start position:0%

okay great thank you representative
weiler

01:37:59.189 --> 01:37:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:01.510 --> 01:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you i thought i heard you say like
 
01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
back with service link that it was not
 
01:38:04.709 --> 01:38:04.719 align:start position:0%
in the agency budget
 
01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
it's not in the governor's budget yet we
 
01:38:08.310 --> 01:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
see a couple million dollars
 
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
in this um this budget document are
 
01:38:12.629 --> 01:38:12.639 align:start position:0%
there other
 
01:38:14.870 --> 01:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
agencies or other areas in this budget
 
01:38:17.189 --> 01:38:17.199 align:start position:0%
document that were not
 
01:38:20.229 --> 01:38:20.239 align:start position:0%
included in the governor's budget or
 
01:38:22.310 --> 01:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
in the agency budget yet are still in
 
01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:23.430 align:start position:0%
in the agency budget yet are still in
this

01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:38:26.709 --> 01:38:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't know that i understand
 
01:38:30.070 --> 01:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
the question
 
01:38:31.990 --> 01:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
when i said that there was something not
 
01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
in the agency or the governor's budget
 
01:38:37.590 --> 01:38:37.600 align:start position:0%
it was new hampshire foster grandparents
 
01:38:38.790 --> 01:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:38:40.870 --> 01:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
not showing you know not budgeted
 
01:38:42.950 --> 01:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
anything in 2223
 
01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
and maybe maybe i missed her i think i
 
01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%
was looking at service link when i heard
 
01:38:47.679 --> 01:38:48.470 align:start position:0%
was looking at service link when i heard
that

01:38:48.470 --> 01:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:38:50.629 --> 01:38:50.639 align:start position:0%
oh okay yeah no that's referring to the
 
01:38:52.149 --> 01:38:52.159 align:start position:0%
foster grandparent
 
01:38:55.669 --> 01:38:55.679 align:start position:0%
yes i was okay so i guess there
 
01:38:57.669 --> 01:38:57.679 align:start position:0%
that's why it's zeroed out all right so
 
01:38:57.679 --> 01:38:58.950 align:start position:0%
that's why it's zeroed out all right so
yes

01:38:58.950 --> 01:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:39:00.629 --> 01:39:00.639 align:start position:0%
that was my curiosity was looking at
 
01:39:02.070 --> 01:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
service lincoln
 
01:39:03.990 --> 01:39:04.000 align:start position:0%
thinking it wasn't funded and yet it was
 
01:39:07.830 --> 01:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:09.590 --> 01:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
looks like you might be good to go again
 
01:39:12.709 --> 01:39:12.719 align:start position:0%
that wasn't too bad was it
 
01:39:16.390 --> 01:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
no none of it's too bad uh
 
01:39:21.590 --> 01:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
the next one is 29.29 21.54
 
01:39:24.390 --> 01:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
which is nursing services this is not
 
01:39:25.990 --> 01:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
funded with county funds this is
 
01:39:29.669 --> 01:39:29.679 align:start position:0%
50 50 general funds 50
 
01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:38.790 --> 01:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
so just comparing to
 
01:39:41.189 --> 01:39:41.199 align:start position:0%
the last well the current biennium it
 
01:39:43.109 --> 01:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
looks like it went down
 
01:39:45.430 --> 01:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
it did so uh part of what's going on
 
01:39:46.470 --> 01:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
here um
 
01:39:48.070 --> 01:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
so the oh the other thing that i should
 
01:39:50.709 --> 01:39:50.719 align:start position:0%
have mentioned going back to 2152
 
01:39:52.390 --> 01:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
you've just pointed out what i forgot to
 
01:39:55.830 --> 01:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
talk about just
 
01:39:59.189 --> 01:39:59.199 align:start position:0%
eight atypicals um
 
01:40:02.229 --> 01:40:02.239 align:start position:0%
which are uh nursing home residents
 
01:40:06.070 --> 01:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh that require some kind of specialized
 
01:40:08.229 --> 01:40:08.239 align:start position:0%
level of care like deb was talking about
 
01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
earlier with the new beds on the
 
01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:10.390 align:start position:0%
earlier with the new beds on the
seacoast

01:40:10.390 --> 01:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
seacoast
 
01:40:15.030 --> 01:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
those are considered atypical beds um
 
01:40:18.149 --> 01:40:18.159 align:start position:0%
during the legislative session in 20 and
 
01:40:18.159 --> 01:40:18.870 align:start position:0%
during the legislative session in 20 and
21

01:40:18.870 --> 01:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
21
 
01:40:20.950 --> 01:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
and i will take full responsibility for
 
01:40:22.629 --> 01:40:22.639 align:start position:0%
not fully understanding the budget at
 
01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
that time
 
01:40:25.990 --> 01:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
um i had been no no excuse but i'd only
 
01:40:27.990 --> 01:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
been with the department about a year
 
01:40:30.790 --> 01:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
and so this was an area that i was still
 
01:40:32.629 --> 01:40:32.639 align:start position:0%
definitely learning
 
01:40:35.669 --> 01:40:35.679 align:start position:0%
and during the legislative phase 2152
 
01:40:35.679 --> 01:40:35.990 align:start position:0%
and during the legislative phase 2152
was

01:40:35.990 --> 01:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:40:39.270 --> 01:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
changed and we moved to the atypicals
 
01:40:42.709 --> 01:40:42.719 align:start position:0%
to 2154 and we shouldn't have
 
01:40:46.149 --> 01:40:46.159 align:start position:0%
um they are part of the
 
01:40:48.470 --> 01:40:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh statute of what the counties are
 
01:40:50.229 --> 01:40:50.239 align:start position:0%
responsible for
 
01:40:52.790 --> 01:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
paying um and so they should not have
 
01:40:53.750 --> 01:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
been moved
 
01:40:56.870 --> 01:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
so these expenses actually um
 
01:41:00.950 --> 01:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
this class 504 and fiscally it took me a
 
01:41:03.030 --> 01:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
year to figure out that i messed that up
 
01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
and so fiscal year 21 um we did not
 
01:41:08.709 --> 01:41:08.719 align:start position:0%
we will not expend any of this 3.5
 
01:41:12.149 --> 01:41:12.159 align:start position:0%
million it will be paid out of 21.52
 
01:41:14.830 --> 01:41:14.840 align:start position:0%
and going forward we have budgeted it in
 
01:41:14.840 --> 01:41:17.430 align:start position:0%
and going forward we have budgeted it in
21.52

01:41:17.430 --> 01:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
21.52
 
01:41:21.189 --> 01:41:21.199 align:start position:0%
so that's the half that was
 
01:41:23.590 --> 01:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
reduced in this coming biennium is that
 
01:41:25.030 --> 01:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
what you're saying
 
01:41:27.590 --> 01:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
um yes that's what was reduced that was
 
01:41:30.390 --> 01:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
what was removed that classline 504.
 
01:41:33.750 --> 01:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
so um and fiscal year 20 the actuals
 
01:41:35.990 --> 01:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
were about 7.6 million
 
01:41:39.750 --> 01:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
so this increase here the 204 to 221
 
01:41:42.149 --> 01:41:42.159 align:start position:0%
about seven or eight million of that is
 
01:41:44.629 --> 01:41:44.639 align:start position:0%
that atypicals
 
01:41:47.270 --> 01:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
so your mother are you on the line 505
 
01:41:47.750 --> 01:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:41:50.870 --> 01:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:54.950 --> 01:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh 504 is in both 505 is not
 
01:41:56.550 --> 01:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
okay 504 is a nursing home that's where
 
01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:58.080 align:start position:0%
the typicals would be in
 
01:42:00.629 --> 01:42:00.639 align:start position:0%
yes okay and that's the one that we
 
01:42:00.639 --> 01:42:03.109 align:start position:0%
yes okay and that's the one that we
moved

01:42:03.109 --> 01:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:05.430 --> 01:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
that's when you add it back into yes
 
01:42:07.669 --> 01:42:07.679 align:start position:0%
that's the one we put back into 2152
 
01:42:10.070 --> 01:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
which is where it has historically been
 
01:42:12.870 --> 01:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
um like i said it was i completely owned
 
01:42:13.510 --> 01:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
that that
 
01:42:15.990 --> 01:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
was a mistake so yeah that's i'm not
 
01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
worried about the mistake
 
01:42:19.510 --> 01:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
um so so that accounts are part of the
 
01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
increase as well
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
yes lines there budget number line 504
 
01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
and 21.52 yes
 
01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
and what we can do um uh created a nice
 
01:42:30.470 --> 01:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
little chart of
 
01:42:32.790 --> 01:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
what the increases are attributed to
 
01:42:33.750 --> 01:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
here um
 
01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
on 2152 and we can provide that to the
 
01:42:38.070 --> 01:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
committee we have already provided it to
 
01:42:39.189 --> 01:42:39.199 align:start position:0%
the counties
 
01:42:41.830 --> 01:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
okay that'd be great so then does
 
01:42:44.310 --> 01:42:44.320 align:start position:0%
atypical come out of 2154
 
01:42:46.870 --> 01:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
going forward um so going forward
 
01:42:49.510 --> 01:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
atypicals will be in 2152.
 
01:42:51.830 --> 01:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
okay okay so that accounts are part of
 
01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:53.109 align:start position:0%
okay okay so that accounts are part of
the

01:42:53.109 --> 01:42:53.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:42:55.350 --> 01:42:55.360 align:start position:0%
product and then the next year the next
 
01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:56.149 align:start position:0%
product and then the next year the next
biennium

01:42:56.149 --> 01:42:56.159 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
01:42:59.189 --> 01:42:59.199 align:start position:0%
yep editing yes okay
 
01:43:01.510 --> 01:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
yes just just so you know folks have
 
01:43:03.030 --> 01:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
told me that atypicals in both anyway so
 
01:43:04.550 --> 01:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
apparently it didn't do too much damage
 
01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:05.350 align:start position:0%
apparently it didn't do too much damage
or

01:43:05.350 --> 01:43:05.360 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:43:07.590 --> 01:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
moving it around they all figured it out
 
01:43:08.709 --> 01:43:08.719 align:start position:0%
i think i think we
 
01:43:11.510 --> 01:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
figured it out hopefully i know jane
 
01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
represented walmart
 
01:43:15.189 --> 01:43:15.199 align:start position:0%
yeah so um i just want to go through the
 
01:43:17.030 --> 01:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
numbers just a little bit so
 
01:43:20.070 --> 01:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
uh under 2152
 
01:43:24.070 --> 01:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
um five 504 nursing home payments
 
01:43:27.750 --> 01:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
the number on that that line is 221
 
01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:31.030 align:start position:0%
the number on that that line is 221
million

01:43:31.030 --> 01:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
and what you're saying is about
 
01:43:39.229 --> 01:43:39.239 align:start position:0%
10 million of that is from
 
01:43:43.510 --> 01:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
2154. seven or eight million yes
 
01:43:46.470 --> 01:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
yes okay but i i'm i'm just basing that
 
01:43:49.189 --> 01:43:49.199 align:start position:0%
based on actuals from 2154.
 
01:43:51.910 --> 01:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
we'll get you what was actually budgeted
 
01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:52.390 align:start position:0%
we'll get you what was actually budgeted
okay

01:43:52.390 --> 01:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:43:55.910 --> 01:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
so we'll see uh we'll see how that yeah
 
01:43:59.910 --> 01:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
now that line went how line 504
 
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
went up and fivo and down here
 
01:44:08.229 --> 01:44:08.239 align:start position:0%
um in 2154
 
01:44:11.990 --> 01:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
the line went down okay yes okay
 
01:44:17.189 --> 01:44:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:23.669 --> 01:44:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:27.270 --> 01:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
okay the next accounting unit is 2157
 
01:44:27.669 --> 01:44:27.679 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:44:30.390 --> 01:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
mquip payments which uh was one of the
 
01:44:33.189 --> 01:44:33.199 align:start position:0%
payments that henry spoke about earlier
 
01:44:36.149 --> 01:44:36.159 align:start position:0%
and like i said he he is no longer able
 
01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
to join us this afternoon so
 
01:44:39.750 --> 01:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
if there are questions we may need to
 
01:44:44.310 --> 01:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:46.470 --> 01:44:46.480 align:start position:0%
so the agency income that's the tax is
 
01:44:47.350 --> 01:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
01:44:49.030 --> 01:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
that's correct and then it gets matched
 
01:44:51.030 --> 01:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
by the feds yes
 
01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
okay and the nursing homes are paying
 
01:44:55.510 --> 01:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
the tax on their
 
01:44:57.990 --> 01:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
occupancy on their revenue yeah net
 
01:45:00.550 --> 01:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
patient service revenue
 
01:45:02.709 --> 01:45:02.719 align:start position:0%
okay so i'm a revenue source of sound
 
01:45:04.470 --> 01:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
yes okay yes
 
01:45:05.669 --> 01:45:05.679 align:start position:0%
uh and representative wallner you have
 
01:45:07.830 --> 01:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
another question or
 
01:45:11.830 --> 01:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
no i'm sorry put my hand down sorry
 
01:45:15.109 --> 01:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
no problem i think you can go on karen
 
01:45:16.870 --> 01:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
honestly in your hands
 
01:45:20.149 --> 01:45:20.159 align:start position:0%
all right the next one is uh 2161
 
01:45:22.870 --> 01:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
which is pro share payments um you can
 
01:45:24.629 --> 01:45:24.639 align:start position:0%
see that we've essentially level funded
 
01:45:24.639 --> 01:45:25.270 align:start position:0%
see that we've essentially level funded
this

01:45:25.270 --> 01:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:45:28.470 --> 01:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
as henry spoke about uh we
 
01:45:30.629 --> 01:45:30.639 align:start position:0%
go back to cms every year and amend the
 
01:45:31.590 --> 01:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
state plan
 
01:45:33.510 --> 01:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
and so we typically come to fiscal
 
01:45:35.109 --> 01:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
committee every year
 
01:45:38.149 --> 01:45:38.159 align:start position:0%
and change the budget as well so can you
 
01:45:39.590 --> 01:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
begin to explain the relationship
 
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
between the numbers
 
01:45:42.709 --> 01:45:42.719 align:start position:0%
that are here and the numbers of the
 
01:45:46.149 --> 01:45:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:50.149 --> 01:45:50.159 align:start position:0%
um like why
 
01:45:52.550 --> 01:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
well so for instance over the last few
 
01:45:54.310 --> 01:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
years and this is what one of the things
 
01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:55.510 align:start position:0%
years and this is what one of the things
that

01:45:55.510 --> 01:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:45:57.669 --> 01:45:57.679 align:start position:0%
henry's been negotiating with the change
 
01:45:58.550 --> 01:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
is this
 
01:46:00.709 --> 01:46:00.719 align:start position:0%
sort of the well the amount the amount
 
01:46:02.310 --> 01:46:02.320 align:start position:0%
of money is going to come down
 
01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:10.709 --> 01:46:10.719 align:start position:0%
they go to the state and get doubled and
 
01:46:12.629 --> 01:46:12.639 align:start position:0%
then half well traditionally half comes
 
01:46:14.550 --> 01:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
back that that that part's going away
 
01:46:16.149 --> 01:46:16.159 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering is is this the part
 
01:46:18.229 --> 01:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
that goes
 
01:46:20.550 --> 01:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
up to the county and then gets doubled
 
01:46:21.510 --> 01:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
or is this the double
 
01:46:24.629 --> 01:46:24.639 align:start position:0%
not well you know what's the you know
 
01:46:26.070 --> 01:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to ask
 
01:46:29.109 --> 01:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
i do and i forget because
 
01:46:31.590 --> 01:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
every year i have to relearn exactly how
 
01:46:33.270 --> 01:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
it goes through the accounting system
 
01:46:35.109 --> 01:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
how pro share one and pro share two go
 
01:46:37.030 --> 01:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
through because it's two different ways
 
01:46:40.870 --> 01:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
right so if you want what i can do um
 
01:46:44.149 --> 01:46:44.159 align:start position:0%
is uh we could
 
01:46:47.510 --> 01:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
we could walk you through that sometime
 
01:46:51.510 --> 01:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
i would need athena gagnon as well um
 
01:46:53.350 --> 01:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
because she's been doing it a couple
 
01:46:55.109 --> 01:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
more years than jane and i have
 
01:46:56.310 --> 01:46:56.320 align:start position:0%
okay i'd love to understand the
 
01:46:58.390 --> 01:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
relationship between what i see in the
 
01:47:00.070 --> 01:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
in the states and what happens in the
 
01:47:02.070 --> 01:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
county level yes
 
01:47:04.149 --> 01:47:04.159 align:start position:0%
we can do that we can set something up
 
01:47:05.189 --> 01:47:05.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:47:09.669 --> 01:47:09.679 align:start position:0%
anybody else i guess not
 
01:47:13.109 --> 01:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
okay uh 2164 is cfi waiver program
 
01:47:13.119 --> 01:47:13.910 align:start position:0%
okay uh 2164 is cfi waiver program
eligibility

01:47:13.910 --> 01:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
01:47:21.590 --> 01:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:24.390 --> 01:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
and the move from 102 to 74 here is is
 
01:47:25.030 --> 01:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
the same as
 
01:47:28.950 --> 01:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:32.870 --> 01:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
okay oh one or two one four
 
01:47:36.229 --> 01:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
this piece right
 
01:47:39.590 --> 01:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
right the next one is 2165 which is
 
01:47:43.669 --> 01:47:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:46.229 --> 01:47:46.239 align:start position:0%
which is the last accounting unit in
 
01:47:49.030 --> 01:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:52.149 --> 01:47:52.159 align:start position:0%
what was that number uh
 
01:47:55.270 --> 01:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
i got it okay okay
 
01:47:59.669 --> 01:47:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:02.310 --> 01:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
100 federal funds it looks like the
 
01:48:03.510 --> 01:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
accounting unit might have closed
 
01:48:04.709 --> 01:48:04.719 align:start position:0%
incorrectly for
 
01:48:06.629 --> 01:48:06.639 align:start position:0%
20 so the actuals look a little funny
 
01:48:10.709 --> 01:48:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:12.310 --> 01:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
the general fund should not be there
 
01:48:14.229 --> 01:48:14.239 align:start position:0%
that that i'm not sure exactly what
 
01:48:14.870 --> 01:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
happened there
 
01:48:16.470 --> 01:48:16.480 align:start position:0%
a mistake that's actually kind of
 
01:48:21.030 --> 01:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:22.629 --> 01:48:22.639 align:start position:0%
all right so i'm going to go ahead and
 
01:48:24.149 --> 01:48:24.159 align:start position:0%
stop sharing and turn things back over
 
01:48:25.990 --> 01:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
to deb to cover the next bureau
 
01:48:58.830 --> 01:48:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:12.830 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:49:12.830 --> 01:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:12.840 --> 01:49:19.669 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:49:19.669 --> 01:49:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:24.950 --> 01:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to ask kevin to bring in
 
01:49:31.750 --> 01:49:31.760 align:start position:0%

alrighty
 
01:50:13.030 --> 01:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
so um to begin with the bureau of
 
01:50:15.030 --> 01:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
developmental services serves as the
 
01:50:17.270 --> 01:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
state's designated agency
 
01:50:19.750 --> 01:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
and we are responsible for administering
 
01:50:20.790 --> 01:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
the developmental
 
01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
disability um acquired brain disorder
 
01:50:27.109 --> 01:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
and in-home supports waivers and
 
01:50:29.030 --> 01:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
what we do is we work very hard to
 
01:50:31.189 --> 01:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
ensure that the right safety and
 
01:50:33.270 --> 01:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
interdependence of the individuals that
 
01:50:34.550 --> 01:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
we support
 
01:50:37.109 --> 01:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
are respected and that we prevent abuse
 
01:50:39.430 --> 01:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
neglect or exploitation
 
01:50:41.830 --> 01:50:41.840 align:start position:0%
and what we do is we work with a
 
01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
comprehensive community based service
 
01:50:45.270 --> 01:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
delivery system
 
01:50:47.669 --> 01:50:47.679 align:start position:0%
our partners for the majority of our
 
01:50:50.070 --> 01:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
work are the area agencies and they are
 
01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
in 10
 
01:50:52.950 --> 01:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
regions throughout the state of new
 
01:50:55.270 --> 01:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire we also work very
 
01:50:56.870 --> 01:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with the bureau of
 
01:50:58.629 --> 01:50:58.639 align:start position:0%
family centered services for the
 
01:51:00.550 --> 01:51:00.560 align:start position:0%
administration of the early supports and
 
01:51:02.709 --> 01:51:02.719 align:start position:0%
services programs which is the early
 
01:51:04.629 --> 01:51:04.639 align:start position:0%
intervention for the children between
 
01:51:07.109 --> 01:51:07.119 align:start position:0%
the ages of zero to three
 
01:51:09.350 --> 01:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
and we provide oversight for the wait
 
01:51:10.870 --> 01:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
list management
 
01:51:13.270 --> 01:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
for the dd wait list which i'm sure most
 
01:51:15.830 --> 01:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
of you are familiar with
 
01:51:17.990 --> 01:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
so the bureau of developmental services
 
01:51:20.149 --> 01:51:20.159 align:start position:0%
has 23 staff
 
01:51:23.109 --> 01:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
and we have 12 state contracts 10 of the
 
01:51:25.030 --> 01:51:25.040 align:start position:0%
state contracts are with the area
 
01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:26.550 align:start position:0%
state contracts are with the area
agencies

01:51:26.550 --> 01:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
01:51:28.870 --> 01:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
one is with the institute new hampshire
 
01:51:30.870 --> 01:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
institute on disability which is with
 
01:51:33.589 --> 01:51:33.599 align:start position:0%
university of new hampshire and then the
 
01:51:33.599 --> 01:51:33.990 align:start position:0%
university of new hampshire and then the
final

01:51:33.990 --> 01:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
final
 
01:51:35.830 --> 01:51:35.840 align:start position:0%
contract is with the brain injury
 
01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:37.430 align:start position:0%
contract is with the brain injury
association

01:51:37.430 --> 01:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
association
 
01:51:39.750 --> 01:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
and again what we do is we work on the
 
01:51:39.760 --> 01:51:40.790 align:start position:0%
and again what we do is we work on the
administration

01:51:40.790 --> 01:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
administration
 
01:51:44.470 --> 01:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
of the three 1915 c waivers
 
01:51:46.229 --> 01:51:46.239 align:start position:0%
for acquired brain disorder
 
01:51:48.149 --> 01:51:48.159 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities and then
 
01:51:50.149 --> 01:51:50.159 align:start position:0%
in-home supports which is for the
 
01:51:50.159 --> 01:51:51.830 align:start position:0%
in-home supports which is for the
children

01:51:51.830 --> 01:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:51:54.629 --> 01:51:54.639 align:start position:0%
our ten regional area agencies are
 
01:51:57.189 --> 01:51:57.199 align:start position:0%
designated by 171a
 
01:51:59.669 --> 01:51:59.679 align:start position:0%
to provide these services they do a
 
01:52:01.830 --> 01:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
tremendous job in heavy lifting for the
 
01:52:03.669 --> 01:52:03.679 align:start position:0%
financial management and monitoring and
 
01:52:04.950 --> 01:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
the program
 
01:52:07.910 --> 01:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
and they work directly with the bureau
 
01:52:09.109 --> 01:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
on evaluation
 
01:52:12.070 --> 01:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
and quality assurance and they are
 
01:52:13.189 --> 01:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
responsible for
 
01:52:15.109 --> 01:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
ensuring that every individual that's
 
01:52:17.350 --> 01:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
found eligible for waiver services
 
01:52:19.990 --> 01:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
receives their services and they are
 
01:52:21.109 --> 01:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
responsible for
 
01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
ensuring for service coordination
 
01:52:24.790 --> 01:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
personal care service delivery
 
01:52:27.270 --> 01:52:27.280 align:start position:0%
in-home support specialty services
 
01:52:29.030 --> 01:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
independent living
 
01:52:32.149 --> 01:52:32.159 align:start position:0%
and they do independent vendor contracts
 
01:52:37.510 --> 01:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:40.790 --> 01:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
so again um we count on a regional
 
01:52:43.910 --> 01:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
system of 10 non-profit 501 c 501c3s
 
01:52:44.870 --> 01:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
these are the area
 
01:52:48.070 --> 01:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
agencies they are designated per
 
01:52:52.709 --> 01:52:52.719 align:start position:0%
rsa 171a and hem 505.
 
01:52:55.350 --> 01:52:55.360 align:start position:0%
the area agencies are responsible for
 
01:52:55.360 --> 01:52:56.149 align:start position:0%
the area agencies are responsible for
leadership

01:52:56.149 --> 01:52:56.159 align:start position:0%
leadership
 
01:52:58.070 --> 01:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
in planning providing and overseeing the
 
01:53:00.149 --> 01:53:00.159 align:start position:0%
services in their communities
 
01:53:03.270 --> 01:53:03.280 align:start position:0%
and each agency has attachment areas of
 
01:53:05.830 --> 01:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
towns that they support and serve
 
01:53:08.470 --> 01:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
each area agency exercises their own
 
01:53:10.310 --> 01:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
local control they're governed by a
 
01:53:12.310 --> 01:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
local board of directors
 
01:53:14.310 --> 01:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
and one-third of the board membership
 
01:53:16.390 --> 01:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
must be recipients of bds
 
01:53:19.910 --> 01:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
services so this is a very very solid
 
01:53:21.990 --> 01:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
system that has been in place for well
 
01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
over 30 years
 
01:53:26.950 --> 01:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
and it continues to evolve as the needs
 
01:53:28.149 --> 01:53:28.159 align:start position:0%
of the people
 
01:53:31.030 --> 01:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
that we serve evolve as well as the
 
01:53:33.189 --> 01:53:33.199 align:start position:0%
complexity of the types of services we
 
01:53:33.199 --> 01:53:33.750 align:start position:0%
complexity of the types of services we
provide

01:53:33.750 --> 01:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:53:36.790 --> 01:53:36.800 align:start position:0%
evolve the area
 
01:53:40.390 --> 01:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
agencies work directly with providers
 
01:53:41.189 --> 01:53:41.199 align:start position:0%
for services
 
01:53:42.870 --> 01:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
through a subcontractor service
 
01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:44.310 align:start position:0%
through a subcontractor service
provision

01:53:44.310 --> 01:53:44.320 align:start position:0%
provision
 
01:53:47.350 --> 01:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
the area agencies work with the provider
 
01:53:49.109 --> 01:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
organizations to deliver the home and
 
01:53:50.870 --> 01:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
community-based care
 
01:53:53.750 --> 01:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
and there are approximately 70 private
 
01:53:53.760 --> 01:53:54.950 align:start position:0%
and there are approximately 70 private
providers

01:53:54.950 --> 01:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
providers
 
01:53:56.870 --> 01:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
throughout the state that work with the
 
01:53:57.990 --> 01:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
area agency
 
01:54:01.030 --> 01:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
system to deliver services so this is a
 
01:54:02.390 --> 01:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
public private
 
01:54:05.189 --> 01:54:05.199 align:start position:0%
partnership with local nonprofit area
 
01:54:05.199 --> 01:54:06.390 align:start position:0%
partnership with local nonprofit area
agencies

01:54:06.390 --> 01:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
01:54:09.430 --> 01:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
the services are community-based and
 
01:54:10.709 --> 01:54:10.719 align:start position:0%
it's important to note
 
01:54:12.629 --> 01:54:12.639 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire is under a corrective
 
01:54:14.709 --> 01:54:14.719 align:start position:0%
action plan for the three waivers with
 
01:54:16.629 --> 01:54:16.639 align:start position:0%
the center for medicare and medicaid
 
01:54:16.639 --> 01:54:18.070 align:start position:0%
the center for medicare and medicaid
services

01:54:18.070 --> 01:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:54:20.709 --> 01:54:20.719 align:start position:0%
and what we discovered in our waiver
 
01:54:20.719 --> 01:54:21.510 align:start position:0%
and what we discovered in our waiver
renewal

01:54:21.510 --> 01:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
renewal
 
01:54:24.870 --> 01:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
for the dd waiver is that
 
01:54:27.510 --> 01:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
we were in violation of conflict of
 
01:54:29.430 --> 01:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
interest regarding the provision of case
 
01:54:29.440 --> 01:54:30.550 align:start position:0%
interest regarding the provision of case
management

01:54:30.550 --> 01:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
management
 
01:54:35.270 --> 01:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
and essentially cms frowns upon
 
01:54:38.070 --> 01:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
the agencies delivering case management
 
01:54:40.310 --> 01:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
as well as the services
 
01:54:43.510 --> 01:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
at a systemic level so we were able to
 
01:54:45.109 --> 01:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
work with cms
 
01:54:47.589 --> 01:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
to provide that our area agencies can
 
01:54:47.599 --> 01:54:48.550 align:start position:0%
to provide that our area agencies can
provide

01:54:48.550 --> 01:54:48.560 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:54:50.629 --> 01:54:50.639 align:start position:0%
service coordination and case management
 
01:54:51.589 --> 01:54:51.599 align:start position:0%
at um not
 
01:54:53.990 --> 01:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
at the individual level but they are
 
01:54:55.109 --> 01:54:55.119 align:start position:0%
able to
 
01:54:57.830 --> 01:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
at the systemic level and we have been
 
01:54:59.189 --> 01:54:59.199 align:start position:0%
working with the area
 
01:55:02.070 --> 01:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
agencies and a stakeholder group um to
 
01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:02.870 align:start position:0%
agencies and a stakeholder group um to
evolve

01:55:02.870 --> 01:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
evolve
 
01:55:05.990 --> 01:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
that corrective action plan and we have
 
01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
had to request an extension due to covid
 
01:55:11.350 --> 01:55:11.360 align:start position:0%
to come into full compliance for that
 
01:55:12.910 --> 01:55:12.920 align:start position:0%
plan by july 1
 
01:55:16.310 --> 01:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
2023 if you want to learn more about
 
01:55:18.550 --> 01:55:18.560 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan it's posted on
 
01:55:19.589 --> 01:55:19.599 align:start position:0%
the dhhs
 
01:55:21.750 --> 01:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
website and explains this in greater
 
01:55:21.760 --> 01:55:22.790 align:start position:0%
website and explains this in greater
detail

01:55:22.790 --> 01:55:22.800 align:start position:0%
detail
 
01:55:25.109 --> 01:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
but the state is moving forward with the
 
01:55:27.430 --> 01:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
area agencies and the provider community
 
01:55:29.750 --> 01:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
to come into compliance by july 1
 
01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
2023 and this also includes for direct
 
01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:33.750 align:start position:0%
2023 and this also includes for direct
bill

01:55:33.750 --> 01:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:55:36.709 --> 01:55:36.719 align:start position:0%
and direct pay of services deb could you
 
01:55:36.719 --> 01:55:37.109 align:start position:0%
and direct pay of services deb could you
send

01:55:37.109 --> 01:55:37.119 align:start position:0%
send
 
01:55:45.270 --> 01:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:47.030 --> 01:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
so i wanted to talk a little bit about
 
01:55:49.270 --> 01:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
the services that are provided
 
01:55:52.070 --> 01:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
um for the developmental disability
 
01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:53.030 align:start position:0%
um for the developmental disability
waiver

01:55:53.030 --> 01:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
waiver
 
01:55:55.350 --> 01:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
what we do is as somebody exits the
 
01:55:57.270 --> 01:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
school system or is new to the state of
 
01:55:59.270 --> 01:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire what we do is we work with
 
01:55:59.280 --> 01:55:59.990 align:start position:0%
new hampshire what we do is we work with
them

01:55:59.990 --> 01:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:56:01.830 --> 01:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
to determine what their level of care
 
01:56:03.189 --> 01:56:03.199 align:start position:0%
need is
 
01:56:04.870 --> 01:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
and then what we do is we arrange
 
01:56:07.430 --> 01:56:07.440 align:start position:0%
services through the area agencies and
 
01:56:08.870 --> 01:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
we deliver
 
01:56:13.270 --> 01:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
the services to them and hem 503 defines
 
01:56:14.950 --> 01:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
the eligibility
 
01:56:17.750 --> 01:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
for the developmental disability and
 
01:56:18.470 --> 01:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:56:19.990 --> 01:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
the way that things have been working
 
01:56:22.390 --> 01:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
under a single comprehensive dd waiver
 
01:56:24.470 --> 01:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
for years
 
01:56:26.830 --> 01:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
the next service is acquired brain
 
01:56:29.750 --> 01:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
disorder and this is for an individual
 
01:56:31.510 --> 01:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
that has a brain injury
 
01:56:34.310 --> 01:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
and would require lifelong supports and
 
01:56:35.270 --> 01:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
what we do
 
01:56:37.669 --> 01:56:37.679 align:start position:0%
is we provide the supports in the home
 
01:56:38.870 --> 01:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
in the community setting
 
01:56:42.070 --> 01:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
versus in an institutional setting and
 
01:56:46.310 --> 01:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
hem 22 522 defines eligibility
 
01:56:49.350 --> 01:56:49.360 align:start position:0%
and that's clearly outlined in rule then
 
01:56:50.870 --> 01:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
we have what's known as the in-home
 
01:56:52.149 --> 01:56:52.159 align:start position:0%
supports waiver
 
01:56:54.229 --> 01:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
and these are personal care services for
 
01:56:55.669 --> 01:56:55.679 align:start position:0%
children living at home with their
 
01:56:55.679 --> 01:56:57.109 align:start position:0%
children living at home with their
families

01:56:57.109 --> 01:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
families
 
01:56:59.750 --> 01:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
and the eligibility uh for these
 
01:57:02.310 --> 01:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
services are up through the age of 21
 
01:57:03.430 --> 01:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
and are defined in
 
01:57:06.870 --> 01:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
hem 524 and
 
01:57:09.669 --> 01:57:09.679 align:start position:0%
the final area that we provide support
 
01:57:09.679 --> 01:57:10.550 align:start position:0%
the final area that we provide support
for

01:57:10.550 --> 01:57:10.560 align:start position:0%

01:57:13.030 --> 01:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
is for individual that require
 
01:57:14.950 --> 01:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
individuals that require 24
 
01:57:16.870 --> 01:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
services in a secure setting and are
 
01:57:18.229 --> 01:57:18.239 align:start position:0%
known as
 
01:57:21.350 --> 01:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
a 171 b's and these are defined our agm
 
01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:23.270 align:start position:0%
a 171 b's and these are defined our agm
171b

01:57:23.270 --> 01:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
171b
 
01:57:25.910 --> 01:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
now our forensic services are currently
 
01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:26.709 align:start position:0%
now our forensic services are currently
delivered

01:57:26.709 --> 01:57:26.719 align:start position:0%
delivered
 
01:57:28.709 --> 01:57:28.719 align:start position:0%
through our developmental services
 
01:57:31.270 --> 01:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
designated receiving facility
 
01:57:34.390 --> 01:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
which is located up in laconia on the
 
01:57:34.400 --> 01:57:35.109 align:start position:0%
which is located up in laconia on the
old

01:57:35.109 --> 01:57:35.119 align:start position:0%
old
 
01:57:38.790 --> 01:57:38.800 align:start position:0%
laconia state school property and
 
01:57:41.589 --> 01:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
in this budget cycle what we are doing
 
01:57:44.629 --> 01:57:44.639 align:start position:0%
is we are transitioning these services
 
01:57:47.750 --> 01:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
from the on-site facility at the laconia
 
01:57:48.950 --> 01:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
state school
 
01:57:51.589 --> 01:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
and we are transitioning this to a more
 
01:57:53.350 --> 01:57:53.360 align:start position:0%
community-based approach and we are
 
01:57:54.790 --> 01:57:54.800 align:start position:0%
working with a vendor
 
01:57:57.669 --> 01:57:57.679 align:start position:0%
right now a provider right now to be
 
01:57:59.350 --> 01:57:59.360 align:start position:0%
able to deliver those services
 
01:58:02.709 --> 01:58:02.719 align:start position:0%
effective july 1 under contract
 
01:58:04.870 --> 01:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
so what you will see as karen goes
 
01:58:06.790 --> 01:58:06.800 align:start position:0%
through the accounting units
 
01:58:10.470 --> 01:58:10.480 align:start position:0%
is you will see that all 17 positions
 
01:58:13.669 --> 01:58:13.679 align:start position:0%
for this facility have been unfunded
 
01:58:16.550 --> 01:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
and that we have a contract line item
 
01:58:21.350 --> 01:58:21.360 align:start position:0%
for these services moving forward
 
01:58:27.189 --> 01:58:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:29.189 --> 01:58:29.199 align:start position:0%
thought we had the laconia school was
 
01:58:33.189 --> 01:58:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:35.669 --> 01:58:35.679 align:start position:0%
uh representative weiler um very good
 
01:58:37.910 --> 01:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
question the laconia state school
 
01:58:42.149 --> 01:58:42.159 align:start position:0%
is empty the property still houses
 
01:58:44.870 --> 01:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
a designated receiving facility that is
 
01:58:47.350 --> 01:58:47.360 align:start position:0%
operated by the bureau of developmental
 
01:58:47.360 --> 01:58:48.870 align:start position:0%
operated by the bureau of developmental
services

01:58:48.870 --> 01:58:48.880 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:58:51.669 --> 01:58:51.679 align:start position:0%
that designated receiving facility that
 
01:58:52.310 --> 01:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
just so
 
01:58:55.030 --> 01:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
happens to be on the property of the old
 
01:58:57.270 --> 01:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
laconia state school
 
01:58:59.750 --> 01:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
we are phasing out and transitioning
 
01:59:01.589 --> 01:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
those services
 
01:59:03.830 --> 01:59:03.840 align:start position:0%
to a more homey community based setting
 
01:59:05.990 --> 01:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
but still meets the secure requirements
 
01:59:07.430 --> 01:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
per 171
 
01:59:09.990 --> 01:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
b and we are going to be providing those
 
01:59:12.229 --> 01:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
services under a contract versus through
 
01:59:15.030 --> 01:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
the state moving forward
 
01:59:17.109 --> 01:59:17.119 align:start position:0%
so how much space are you using and how
 
01:59:20.790 --> 01:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:23.109 --> 01:59:23.119 align:start position:0%
um over the past few years the census
 
01:59:25.350 --> 01:59:25.360 align:start position:0%
has dwindled and at this point in time
 
01:59:27.750 --> 01:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
we are looking at potentially contact
 
01:59:30.870 --> 01:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
contracting for between two
 
01:59:34.310 --> 01:59:34.320 align:start position:0%
to three beds moving forward
 
01:59:37.109 --> 01:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i'd also like to advise
 
01:59:38.149 --> 01:59:38.159 align:start position:0%
the members that
 
01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
we are working um very closely with the
 
01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:41.990 align:start position:0%
we are working um very closely with the
staff

01:59:41.990 --> 01:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
staff
 
01:59:43.910 --> 01:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
at the designated receiving facility
 
01:59:46.229 --> 01:59:46.239 align:start position:0%
that are state employees
 
01:59:48.390 --> 01:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
to ensure that they have opportunities
 
01:59:50.390 --> 01:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
for employment elsewhere within the
 
01:59:50.400 --> 01:59:51.430 align:start position:0%
for employment elsewhere within the
state

01:59:51.430 --> 01:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:59:53.510 --> 01:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
because a lot of their skill sets
 
01:59:55.510 --> 01:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
translate very well to new hampshire
 
01:59:55.520 --> 01:59:56.790 align:start position:0%
translate very well to new hampshire
hospital

01:59:56.790 --> 01:59:56.800 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
01:59:59.830 --> 01:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
to glencliff or even to our corrections
 
01:59:59.840 --> 02:00:00.550 align:start position:0%
to glencliff or even to our corrections
system

02:00:00.550 --> 02:00:00.560 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:00:02.950 --> 02:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
moving forward and we have been
 
02:00:02.960 --> 02:00:03.750 align:start position:0%
moving forward and we have been
partnering

02:00:03.750 --> 02:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
partnering
 
02:00:06.390 --> 02:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
with them to determine the best approach
 
02:00:08.390 --> 02:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
on ensuring that they maintain and stay
 
02:00:10.070 --> 02:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
in state service and they're giving full
 
02:00:12.950 --> 02:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
opportunities to apply for positions
 
02:00:16.149 --> 02:00:16.159 align:start position:0%
and of course as we
 
02:00:18.870 --> 02:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
contract with a vendor a vendor may very
 
02:00:19.910 --> 02:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
well be interested
 
02:00:22.070 --> 02:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
in picking up some of the staff there as
 
02:00:23.669 --> 02:00:23.679 align:start position:0%
well so this is
 
02:00:26.709 --> 02:00:26.719 align:start position:0%
very much been a part of our approach to
 
02:00:34.390 --> 02:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair um so i
 
02:00:39.270 --> 02:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
thought the property
 
02:00:41.669 --> 02:00:41.679 align:start position:0%
up there by the laconia state school is
 
02:00:42.629 --> 02:00:42.639 align:start position:0%
being sold
 
02:00:45.430 --> 02:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
is that one of the reasons you're moving
 
02:00:46.709 --> 02:00:46.719 align:start position:0%
or is it
 
02:00:50.550 --> 02:00:50.560 align:start position:0%
totally just a program planning
 
02:00:52.709 --> 02:00:52.719 align:start position:0%
uh programmatically we've seen the
 
02:00:55.589 --> 02:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
census go down and we see an opportunity
 
02:00:58.229 --> 02:00:58.239 align:start position:0%
to develop this as part of a continuum
 
02:00:59.510 --> 02:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
of care
 
02:01:01.430 --> 02:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
all right where this is just another
 
02:01:03.350 --> 02:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
level of care that we want to provide
 
02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:03.750 align:start position:0%
level of care that we want to provide
for

02:01:03.750 --> 02:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:01:07.109 --> 02:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
and we believe that we can do so um in
 
02:01:11.189 --> 02:01:11.199 align:start position:0%
a by transitioning off of that property
 
02:01:15.990 --> 02:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:20.470 --> 02:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:22.310 --> 02:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
so i wanted to talk a little bit about
 
02:01:24.790 --> 02:01:24.800 align:start position:0%
the developmental disability or dd wait
 
02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:26.149 align:start position:0%
the developmental disability or dd wait
list

02:01:26.149 --> 02:01:26.159 align:start position:0%
list
 
02:01:28.310 --> 02:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
and i would like to start by reminding
 
02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:29.270 align:start position:0%
and i would like to start by reminding
um

02:01:29.270 --> 02:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:32.629 --> 02:01:32.639 align:start position:0%
folks that per 171 a1a
 
02:01:35.270 --> 02:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
that the legislature is required to
 
02:01:37.270 --> 02:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
appropriate sufficient funding to meet
 
02:01:38.709 --> 02:01:38.719 align:start position:0%
weightless costs
 
02:01:42.870 --> 02:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:44.629 --> 02:01:44.639 align:start position:0%
and i wanted to explain a little bit
 
02:01:47.030 --> 02:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
about how we manage the developmental
 
02:01:48.870 --> 02:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
disability waitlist which also
 
02:01:52.629 --> 02:01:52.639 align:start position:0%
is outlined in part of our authority
 
02:01:55.430 --> 02:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
so who is typically waiting for services
 
02:01:56.070 --> 02:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
we have
 
02:01:58.070 --> 02:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
um students who are exiting the school
 
02:01:59.669 --> 02:01:59.679 align:start position:0%
system which we refer to as
 
02:02:02.470 --> 02:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
a's then we have people who have never
 
02:02:04.229 --> 02:02:04.239 align:start position:0%
accessed services before
 
02:02:06.790 --> 02:02:06.800 align:start position:0%
but are in need of services and these
 
02:02:09.189 --> 02:02:09.199 align:start position:0%
are what we refer to as bees
 
02:02:10.790 --> 02:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
and then we have individuals who
 
02:02:12.950 --> 02:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
currently have services but require
 
02:02:14.629 --> 02:02:14.639 align:start position:0%
additional services
 
02:02:19.669 --> 02:02:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:23.109 --> 02:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
it's hard to anticipate a b
 
02:02:26.629 --> 02:02:26.639 align:start position:0%
alright because these are individuals
 
02:02:27.350 --> 02:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
that may
 
02:02:30.149 --> 02:02:30.159 align:start position:0%
move with a family member into the state
 
02:02:30.159 --> 02:02:30.470 align:start position:0%
move with a family member into the state
or

02:02:30.470 --> 02:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:02:33.270 --> 02:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
we have even still to this day have
 
02:02:34.629 --> 02:02:34.639 align:start position:0%
families who have
 
02:02:36.950 --> 02:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
um kept their loved one at home with
 
02:02:36.960 --> 02:02:37.750 align:start position:0%
um kept their loved one at home with
them

02:02:37.750 --> 02:02:37.760 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:02:39.510 --> 02:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
and they were concerned about their
 
02:02:41.910 --> 02:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
individual being put in an institution
 
02:02:43.669 --> 02:02:43.679 align:start position:0%
so they have never come forward looking
 
02:02:46.310 --> 02:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
for supports or services and
 
02:02:49.510 --> 02:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
if a parent passes away a sibling or
 
02:02:51.350 --> 02:02:51.360 align:start position:0%
another loved one
 
02:02:53.830 --> 02:02:53.840 align:start position:0%
will contact the state to pray to work
 
02:02:56.470 --> 02:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
with us to get a provision for services
 
02:02:59.990 --> 02:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
so that describes what it be is um for
 
02:03:00.870 --> 02:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
the c's
 
02:03:03.669 --> 02:03:03.679 align:start position:0%
these are people who are typically
 
02:03:05.510 --> 02:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
living with their families
 
02:03:07.990 --> 02:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
and due to a change in circumstance they
 
02:03:10.229 --> 02:03:10.239 align:start position:0%
require a change in services
 
02:03:13.510 --> 02:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
so we might have a
 
02:03:16.709 --> 02:03:16.719 align:start position:0%
79 year old parent who might
 
02:03:19.750 --> 02:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
have medical complexity and have to
 
02:03:22.390 --> 02:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
themselves go into a nursing facility
 
02:03:23.510 --> 02:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
and we need to
 
02:03:25.109 --> 02:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
make arrangements to increase the
 
02:03:26.870 --> 02:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
services for the child that they have
 
02:03:27.990 --> 02:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
been living with and they
 
02:03:30.870 --> 02:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
may look to go into an enhanced family
 
02:03:30.880 --> 02:03:31.510 align:start position:0%
may look to go into an enhanced family
care

02:03:31.510 --> 02:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
care
 
02:03:33.350 --> 02:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
approach or into a residential group
 
02:03:35.189 --> 02:03:35.199 align:start position:0%
home for example
 
02:03:38.390 --> 02:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
right now has a question
 
02:03:46.870 --> 02:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:51.669 --> 02:03:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:53.350 --> 02:03:53.360 align:start position:0%
sorry i didn't even know now the
 
02:03:54.950 --> 02:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
question my hand was still raised
 
02:03:58.790 --> 02:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry i'll try to write that
 
02:04:01.350 --> 02:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
all right and then for seas we also have
 
02:04:02.950 --> 02:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
people who may not live with their
 
02:04:04.229 --> 02:04:04.239 align:start position:0%
families but
 
02:04:06.709 --> 02:04:06.719 align:start position:0%
they have changes and they require
 
02:04:09.270 --> 02:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
additional services so for example
 
02:04:12.709 --> 02:04:12.719 align:start position:0%
we may have somebody who uh is on the
 
02:04:14.390 --> 02:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
autism spectrum
 
02:04:17.189 --> 02:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
and is managing to live independently
 
02:04:19.510 --> 02:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
with supports and services but perhaps
 
02:04:20.790 --> 02:04:20.800 align:start position:0%
they have had
 
02:04:22.550 --> 02:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
some behavioral issues that occur and
 
02:04:24.149 --> 02:04:24.159 align:start position:0%
that requires an increase in the
 
02:04:24.159 --> 02:04:25.830 align:start position:0%
that requires an increase in the
services

02:04:25.830 --> 02:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:04:29.430 --> 02:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
so what we try and do is we work with
 
02:04:31.109 --> 02:04:31.119 align:start position:0%
providing for those services based on
 
02:04:36.950 --> 02:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:38.870 --> 02:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
so i wanted to review where we are at
 
02:04:44.229 --> 02:04:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:46.229 --> 02:04:46.239 align:start position:0%
oops i lost my share let me bring it
 
02:04:50.629 --> 02:04:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:52.470 --> 02:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
while you bringing that back can you
 
02:04:54.069 --> 02:04:54.079 align:start position:0%
when you when we get to the accounts can
 
02:04:54.079 --> 02:04:54.629 align:start position:0%
when you when we get to the accounts can
you

02:04:54.629 --> 02:04:54.639 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:04:56.470 --> 02:04:56.480 align:start position:0%
let us know where the wait list appears
 
02:04:57.669 --> 02:04:57.679 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:05:01.589 --> 02:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:33.510 --> 02:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:36.550 --> 02:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
are you able to see that now
 
02:05:39.910 --> 02:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
02:05:43.030 --> 02:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
around 41 if you yep
 
02:05:58.149 --> 02:05:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:01.270 --> 02:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
here we go my apologies no problem
 
02:06:05.350 --> 02:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
right so for uh this uh biennium
 
02:06:07.189 --> 02:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh we were able to serve a thousand
 
02:06:07.199 --> 02:06:08.550 align:start position:0%
uh we were able to serve a thousand
individuals

02:06:08.550 --> 02:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
02:06:12.470 --> 02:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of funding them we have 455 a's
 
02:06:14.550 --> 02:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
and b's that we funded with the original
 
02:06:16.470 --> 02:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
budget appropriation
 
02:06:19.669 --> 02:06:19.679 align:start position:0%
we have 494 c's
 
02:06:21.270 --> 02:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
that we assisted with the original
 
02:06:23.430 --> 02:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
budget appropriation
 
02:06:27.270 --> 02:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
and then we funded an additional 51 c's
 
02:06:30.870 --> 02:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
with funds due to vacancy dollars um
 
02:06:33.669 --> 02:06:33.679 align:start position:0%
oftentimes uh what will happen is some
 
02:06:33.679 --> 02:06:34.550 align:start position:0%
oftentimes uh what will happen is some
unfortunately

02:06:34.550 --> 02:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately
 
02:06:37.669 --> 02:06:37.679 align:start position:0%
somebody will pass away are um something
 
02:06:39.270 --> 02:06:39.280 align:start position:0%
to that effect and what we try and do
 
02:06:42.310 --> 02:06:42.320 align:start position:0%
is we we we utilize those dollars to
 
02:06:45.830 --> 02:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
affect uh bringing others into services
 
02:06:48.470 --> 02:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
so right now there are zero people
 
02:06:49.750 --> 02:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
waiting for services
 
02:06:52.950 --> 02:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
this biennium and um i think it's
 
02:06:53.910 --> 02:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
important to talk
 
02:06:57.189 --> 02:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
a little bit about some of the
 
02:06:59.030 --> 02:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
issues that we've encountered due to
 
02:06:59.040 --> 02:07:01.350 align:start position:0%
issues that we've encountered due to
covin

02:07:01.350 --> 02:07:01.360 align:start position:0%
covin
 
02:07:04.950 --> 02:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
in december and january we had
 
02:07:08.550 --> 02:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
uh 46 people who were diagnosed covid
 
02:07:08.560 --> 02:07:09.189 align:start position:0%
uh 46 people who were diagnosed covid
positive

02:07:09.189 --> 02:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
positive
 
02:07:12.629 --> 02:07:12.639 align:start position:0%
in the developmental services system and
 
02:07:15.270 --> 02:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
that has an impact on the ability to
 
02:07:16.550 --> 02:07:16.560 align:start position:0%
start services
 
02:07:20.069 --> 02:07:20.079 align:start position:0%
and also for us to be very agile in the
 
02:07:21.109 --> 02:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
way that we serve those
 
02:07:24.790 --> 02:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
individuals so with the kovid crisis
 
02:07:28.310 --> 02:07:28.320 align:start position:0%
we have had to um we've run into issues
 
02:07:30.310 --> 02:07:30.320 align:start position:0%
with getting workforce
 
02:07:32.310 --> 02:07:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh some families have indicated that
 
02:07:33.830 --> 02:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
they did not want people
 
02:07:36.870 --> 02:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
in their homes serving people and
 
02:07:40.790 --> 02:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
um we've also had the consideration of
 
02:07:43.750 --> 02:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
the cratchit mountain closure
 
02:07:45.669 --> 02:07:45.679 align:start position:0%
during the clovic crisis cratchit
 
02:07:47.589 --> 02:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
mountain determined that they no longer
 
02:07:49.430 --> 02:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
would be providing
 
02:07:52.390 --> 02:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
residential services to individuals so
 
02:07:53.990 --> 02:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
we had to work very hard and
 
02:07:56.149 --> 02:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with the area agency
 
02:07:56.159 --> 02:07:57.270 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with the area agency
system

02:07:57.270 --> 02:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:08:00.629 --> 02:08:00.639 align:start position:0%
to find to build programs out for 26
 
02:08:00.639 --> 02:08:01.510 align:start position:0%
to find to build programs out for 26
people

02:08:01.510 --> 02:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:08:04.069 --> 02:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
all right in addition to being able to
 
02:08:05.750 --> 02:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
support people who were bringing into
 
02:08:08.310 --> 02:08:08.320 align:start position:0%
services off of the wait list
 
02:08:10.310 --> 02:08:10.320 align:start position:0%
so beginning in the third quarter of
 
02:08:12.550 --> 02:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year 20
 
02:08:16.790 --> 02:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
we started to see not as many starts
 
02:08:19.430 --> 02:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
at the level that we typically do and
 
02:08:21.350 --> 02:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
that can clearly be attributed to the
 
02:08:23.350 --> 02:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
covid crisis
 
02:08:25.430 --> 02:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
and i wanted to make sure that everyone
 
02:08:27.510 --> 02:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
was situationally aware
 
02:08:31.030 --> 02:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
that that has impacted the spend rate
 
02:08:33.589 --> 02:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
for our waiver services our dd waiver
 
02:08:35.189 --> 02:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
services in particular
 
02:08:37.030 --> 02:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to make everyone aware
 
02:08:40.470 --> 02:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:43.350 --> 02:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
so for the acquired brain disorder
 
02:08:44.470 --> 02:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
waiver we've brought
 
02:08:47.510 --> 02:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
in 33 individuals served
 
02:08:50.149 --> 02:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
and for in-home supports we've brought
 
02:08:52.069 --> 02:08:52.079 align:start position:0%
on an additional 85
 
02:08:54.069 --> 02:08:54.079 align:start position:0%
individuals served and once again there
 
02:08:59.669 --> 02:08:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:02.709 --> 02:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
this is a copy of the trending
 
02:09:05.669 --> 02:09:05.679 align:start position:0%
for the for quite a long period of time
 
02:09:07.830 --> 02:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
all right i believe it begins in 09 and
 
02:09:09.510 --> 02:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
now goes to 20.
 
02:09:13.270 --> 02:09:13.280 align:start position:0%
this is something that uh hhs oversight
 
02:09:15.669 --> 02:09:15.679 align:start position:0%
uh takes a look at on a quarterly basis
 
02:09:17.270 --> 02:09:17.280 align:start position:0%
and this is also part of the
 
02:09:19.109 --> 02:09:19.119 align:start position:0%
department's dashboard
 
02:09:21.990 --> 02:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
and as you can clearly see as of 12 30
 
02:09:22.000 --> 02:09:22.709 align:start position:0%
and as you can clearly see as of 12 30
120

02:09:22.709 --> 02:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
120
 
02:09:24.390 --> 02:09:24.400 align:start position:0%
there are zero people waiting for
 
02:09:24.400 --> 02:09:27.990 align:start position:0%
there are zero people waiting for
services

02:09:27.990 --> 02:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:31.430 --> 02:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
so moving forward and building out
 
02:09:33.830 --> 02:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
the uh budget for the developmental
 
02:09:34.950 --> 02:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
services system
 
02:09:38.310 --> 02:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
and for bds we are anticipating
 
02:09:42.790 --> 02:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
that at a minimum of 200 uh 226
 
02:09:46.229 --> 02:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
uh dd individuals will need services
 
02:09:48.310 --> 02:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
this represents the students known to
 
02:09:49.750 --> 02:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
bds and the area
 
02:09:51.910 --> 02:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
agencies who are exiting the school
 
02:09:51.920 --> 02:09:53.109 align:start position:0%
agencies who are exiting the school
system

02:09:53.109 --> 02:09:53.119 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:09:56.950 --> 02:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
during the fiscal year in 22 and
 
02:09:58.550 --> 02:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
what we do is we take a look at the
 
02:10:00.470 --> 02:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
historic trend
 
02:10:03.270 --> 02:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
on individuals new to the system who may
 
02:10:05.030 --> 02:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
require services
 
02:10:08.470 --> 02:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
and in sfy 23 we anticipate that a
 
02:10:08.480 --> 02:10:09.109 align:start position:0%
and in sfy 23 we anticipate that a
minimum

02:10:09.109 --> 02:10:09.119 align:start position:0%
minimum
 
02:10:16.229 --> 02:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:17.669 --> 02:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
did i ask you a question there is that
 
02:10:19.589 --> 02:10:19.599 align:start position:0%
an unusually large
 
02:10:22.870 --> 02:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
number no it is not that's sort of
 
02:10:25.030 --> 02:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
normal for buying a name
 
02:10:27.910 --> 02:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
yes people ever go off services other
 
02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:28.709 align:start position:0%
yes people ever go off services other
than

02:10:28.709 --> 02:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
than
 
02:10:32.390 --> 02:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
when they pass away obviously um
 
02:10:34.149 --> 02:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
i think it's important to understand
 
02:10:35.910 --> 02:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
that if you are diagnosed with a
 
02:10:37.830 --> 02:10:37.840 align:start position:0%
developmental disability or an
 
02:10:41.189 --> 02:10:41.199 align:start position:0%
intellectual disability the assistance
 
02:10:43.270 --> 02:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
you need with daily living
 
02:10:46.310 --> 02:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
either remains the same or can
 
02:10:49.189 --> 02:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
get more complicated as you age all
 
02:10:49.199 --> 02:10:49.669 align:start position:0%
get more complicated as you age all
right

02:10:49.669 --> 02:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:10:53.750 --> 02:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
um but this is a lifelong uh
 
02:10:56.550 --> 02:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
support service system and it is
 
02:10:57.510 --> 02:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
something that we
 
02:10:59.750 --> 02:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
take very seriously here in the state of
 
02:11:00.709 --> 02:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
new hampshire to
 
02:11:02.390 --> 02:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
ensure that people get the services that
 
02:11:04.470 --> 02:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
they need and it's a very cost
 
02:11:06.390 --> 02:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
effective model because the majority of
 
02:11:07.830 --> 02:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
people are served
 
02:11:10.790 --> 02:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
in the home and the community right so i
 
02:11:12.390 --> 02:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
was asking the context of that
 
02:11:13.669 --> 02:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
right now i said the total 1000
 
02:11:16.069 --> 02:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
individuals correct
 
02:11:17.589 --> 02:11:17.599 align:start position:0%
or is that a separate was that a
 
02:11:18.709 --> 02:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
separate group of people you were
 
02:11:19.510 --> 02:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
02:11:22.830 --> 02:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
back on slide 41 that includes c's as
 
02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:24.310 align:start position:0%
back on slide 41 that includes c's as
well

02:11:24.310 --> 02:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:11:27.350 --> 02:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
those are enhancements as well okay
 
02:11:29.589 --> 02:11:29.599 align:start position:0%
but but nonetheless i guess my questions
 
02:11:30.390 --> 02:11:30.400 align:start position:0%
about it is that
 
02:11:32.709 --> 02:11:32.719 align:start position:0%
one thousand or less individuals are
 
02:11:33.510 --> 02:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
there now
 
02:11:34.550 --> 02:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
and you're talking about adding another
 
02:11:36.709 --> 02:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
400 i'm just wondering roughly that
 
02:11:39.030 --> 02:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
if that many come come in every two
 
02:11:40.550 --> 02:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
years i would expect the number
 
02:11:42.229 --> 02:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
to be much higher total leveling much
 
02:11:43.910 --> 02:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
higher um
 
02:11:46.310 --> 02:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
the a's and b's are generally in the
 
02:11:48.470 --> 02:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
ballpark they can vary a little bit from
 
02:11:50.149 --> 02:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
year to year
 
02:11:52.870 --> 02:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
with the c's it can it can vary based on
 
02:11:54.950 --> 02:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
where somebody is in terms of
 
02:11:56.790 --> 02:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh needing additional supports and
 
02:11:58.709 --> 02:11:58.719 align:start position:0%
services okay
 
02:12:02.390 --> 02:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
thanks and again it's a very
 
02:12:04.390 --> 02:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
individualized service system with
 
02:12:06.390 --> 02:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
individualized service plans that are
 
02:12:08.470 --> 02:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
person centered
 
02:12:11.669 --> 02:12:11.679 align:start position:0%
so in terms of comp accomplishments um
 
02:12:14.229 --> 02:12:14.239 align:start position:0%
for bds uh we are in the process right
 
02:12:16.229 --> 02:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
now of working our way through waiver
 
02:12:16.239 --> 02:12:17.350 align:start position:0%
now of working our way through waiver
renewals

02:12:17.350 --> 02:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
renewals
 
02:12:19.589 --> 02:12:19.599 align:start position:0%
and we just received approval for the
 
02:12:21.669 --> 02:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
in-home supports waiver renewal with our
 
02:12:21.679 --> 02:12:22.229 align:start position:0%
in-home supports waiver renewal with our
partner

02:12:22.229 --> 02:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
partner
 
02:12:25.030 --> 02:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
cms and we are currently working on
 
02:12:27.350 --> 02:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
submitting the developmental disability
 
02:12:29.270 --> 02:12:29.280 align:start position:0%
waiver for renewal
 
02:12:32.550 --> 02:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
um just as with beas we are working very
 
02:12:32.560 --> 02:12:33.510 align:start position:0%
um just as with beas we are working very
proactively

02:12:33.510 --> 02:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
proactively

with the area agencies in the provider
 
02:12:35.840 --> 02:12:37.109 align:start position:0%
with the area agencies in the provider
community

deliver services
 
02:12:44.790 --> 02:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
and just as with beas we took a very
 
02:12:44.800 --> 02:12:45.750 align:start position:0%
and just as with beas we took a very
proactive

02:12:45.750 --> 02:12:45.760 align:start position:0%

as i've mentioned before we also have
 
02:13:04.709 --> 02:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
the corrective action plan with cms that
 
02:13:05.910 --> 02:13:05.920 align:start position:0%

02:13:09.030 --> 02:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
on and have received uh approvals
 
02:13:13.030 --> 02:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
for an extension date until july 23.
 
02:13:15.270 --> 02:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
we also have been working on a federal
 
02:13:16.229 --> 02:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
requirement to
 
02:13:18.069 --> 02:13:18.079 align:start position:0%
ensure that we are in compliance with
 
02:13:19.910 --> 02:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
settings requirements
 
02:13:23.189 --> 02:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
and our compliance uh for our for our
 
02:13:23.199 --> 02:13:23.910 align:start position:0%
and our compliance uh for our for our
system

02:13:23.910 --> 02:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:13:25.510 --> 02:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
here and for the state of new hampshire
 
02:13:28.390 --> 02:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
for the homes is currently at 98 percent
 
02:13:30.229 --> 02:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
and we expect to meet the compliance
 
02:13:32.310 --> 02:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
requirements uh that are
 
02:13:35.910 --> 02:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
required by federal rule 42 cfr 441
 
02:13:37.990 --> 02:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
which is outlined here
 
02:13:40.310 --> 02:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
we have also put in a significant amount
 
02:13:42.149 --> 02:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
of effort of working with
 
02:13:46.229 --> 02:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
um the educational system and the area
 
02:13:49.189 --> 02:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
agencies to collaborate on transition
 
02:13:51.350 --> 02:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
planning for individuals who are exiting
 
02:13:52.390 --> 02:13:52.400 align:start position:0%
the school system
 
02:13:55.109 --> 02:13:55.119 align:start position:0%
and into adult services it's very
 
02:13:57.510 --> 02:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
important that those
 
02:13:59.589 --> 02:13:59.599 align:start position:0%
efforts be done collaboratively so that
 
02:14:01.350 --> 02:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
we can do good
 
02:14:04.550 --> 02:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
first projections on needs all right
 
02:14:07.589 --> 02:14:07.599 align:start position:0%
for our dd waitlist planning and more
 
02:14:09.030 --> 02:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
importantly to ensure
 
02:14:11.109 --> 02:14:11.119 align:start position:0%
that we have an understanding of the
 
02:14:13.270 --> 02:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
individuals that will be exiting and
 
02:14:16.470 --> 02:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
making sure that we have the services
 
02:14:18.950 --> 02:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
clearly planned and outlined and ready
 
02:14:21.270 --> 02:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
to go and have been able to rfp and get
 
02:14:23.669 --> 02:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
the services moving forward
 
02:14:25.910 --> 02:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
wait list management we continue to work
 
02:14:25.920 --> 02:14:27.189 align:start position:0%
wait list management we continue to work
wholeheartedly

02:14:27.189 --> 02:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly
 
02:14:30.149 --> 02:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
with our area agency system to continue
 
02:14:32.790 --> 02:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
to fund and start services but again
 
02:14:34.950 --> 02:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
the agencies have experienced slower
 
02:14:37.669 --> 02:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
starts due to covid19
 
02:14:40.629 --> 02:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
and that's something that we continue to
 
02:14:41.589 --> 02:14:41.599 align:start position:0%
take a look at
 
02:14:45.270 --> 02:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
very actively with the agency system
 
02:14:46.950 --> 02:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
and then of course we continue to look
 
02:14:49.270 --> 02:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
at system capacity
 
02:14:52.550 --> 02:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
this past year we did a lot of work with
 
02:14:54.390 --> 02:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
system capacity builds for
 
02:14:55.830 --> 02:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
the cratchit mountain residential
 
02:15:00.390 --> 02:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:02.229 --> 02:15:02.239 align:start position:0%
so some of the key challenges for the
 
02:15:04.550 --> 02:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
bureau of developmental services
 
02:15:07.109 --> 02:15:07.119 align:start position:0%
as i spoke to earlier is information
 
02:15:07.119 --> 02:15:08.229 align:start position:0%
as i spoke to earlier is information
technology

02:15:08.229 --> 02:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
technology
 
02:15:11.910 --> 02:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
specifically the ability to effectuate
 
02:15:14.310 --> 02:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
system builds for direct billing
 
02:15:16.709 --> 02:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
electronic visit verification
 
02:15:20.149 --> 02:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
and the bds it remediation
 
02:15:22.069 --> 02:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
another key challenge which i spoke to
 
02:15:23.910 --> 02:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
previously that speaks to the a
 
02:15:26.470 --> 02:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
m recommendation is the need to build
 
02:15:28.310 --> 02:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
capacity for intensive treatment
 
02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:29.510 align:start position:0%
capacity for intensive treatment
services

02:15:29.510 --> 02:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:15:31.750 --> 02:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
and make that part of the continuum of
 
02:15:31.760 --> 02:15:32.870 align:start position:0%
and make that part of the continuum of
care

02:15:32.870 --> 02:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
care
 
02:15:35.109 --> 02:15:35.119 align:start position:0%
we continue to work on compliance and
 
02:15:35.119 --> 02:15:36.390 align:start position:0%
we continue to work on compliance and
operations

02:15:36.390 --> 02:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
operations
 
02:15:39.350 --> 02:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
so that we can come into uh compliance
 
02:15:41.830 --> 02:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
with our corrective action plan by 23.
 
02:15:43.189 --> 02:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
that's one specific
 
02:15:46.229 --> 02:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
example of a very big lift but we
 
02:15:47.990 --> 02:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
continue to need to work on
 
02:15:50.390 --> 02:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
ensuring that our waivers are renewed
 
02:15:51.910 --> 02:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
and that we're doing appropriate
 
02:15:51.920 --> 02:15:52.870 align:start position:0%
and that we're doing appropriate
reporting

02:15:52.870 --> 02:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
02:15:55.430 --> 02:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
for financial reporting and quality
 
02:16:00.950 --> 02:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:03.750 --> 02:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
and lastly i just will speak briefly to
 
02:16:07.270 --> 02:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
the bureau of family centered services
 
02:16:09.830 --> 02:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
in our budget the bureau of family
 
02:16:11.830 --> 02:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
centered services and bds
 
02:16:14.470 --> 02:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
are both in the same budget and the same
 
02:16:16.550 --> 02:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
listing of accounting units
 
02:16:18.470 --> 02:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
however the bureau of family centered
 
02:16:21.189 --> 02:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
services works very collaboratively with
 
02:16:23.750 --> 02:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
the bureau of developmental services
 
02:16:25.990 --> 02:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
and the bureau of family center services
 
02:16:27.830 --> 02:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
is responsible for
 
02:16:31.350 --> 02:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
serving as the state's title five agency
 
02:16:33.110 --> 02:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
for children and youth with special
 
02:16:35.270 --> 02:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
health care needs and these are people
 
02:16:35.280 --> 02:16:35.990 align:start position:0%
health care needs and these are people
with

02:16:35.990 --> 02:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:16:37.910 --> 02:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
these are children with complex medical
 
02:16:40.629 --> 02:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
conditions they also provide for family
 
02:16:40.639 --> 02:16:41.589 align:start position:0%
conditions they also provide for family
support

02:16:41.589 --> 02:16:41.599 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:16:43.429 --> 02:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
and the early supports and services
 
02:16:43.439 --> 02:16:45.669 align:start position:0%
and the early supports and services
program

02:16:45.669 --> 02:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:16:48.469 --> 02:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
they are responsible for the contract
 
02:16:48.479 --> 02:16:49.190 align:start position:0%
they are responsible for the contract
management

02:16:49.190 --> 02:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
management
 
02:16:51.990 --> 02:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
and grant oversight for some of the
 
02:16:58.629 --> 02:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:00.870 --> 02:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
the bureau of family centered services
 
02:17:03.030 --> 02:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
employs 18 people
 
02:17:05.190 --> 02:17:05.200 align:start position:0%
and as i pointed out they were the
 
02:17:07.589 --> 02:17:07.599 align:start position:0%
hardest hit with a 41
 
02:17:10.709 --> 02:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
nearly 41 vacancy rate they are in the
 
02:17:10.719 --> 02:17:11.270 align:start position:0%
nearly 41 vacancy rate they are in the
process

02:17:11.270 --> 02:17:11.280 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:17:13.830 --> 02:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
of doing a lot of hiring and onboarding
 
02:17:15.270 --> 02:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:17:17.589 --> 02:17:17.599 align:start position:0%
they are responsible for ensuring that
 
02:17:19.349 --> 02:17:19.359 align:start position:0%
we meet all of our federal grant
 
02:17:21.349 --> 02:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
requirements for the funding entities
 
02:17:22.950 --> 02:17:22.960 align:start position:0%
that i mentioned at the very beginning
 
02:17:24.070 --> 02:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
of the presentation
 
02:17:28.230 --> 02:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
with dltss and they are responsible for
 
02:17:29.750 --> 02:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
working and ensuring that we are
 
02:17:31.830 --> 02:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
complying with state federal statutes
 
02:17:33.669 --> 02:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
and regulations
 
02:17:36.150 --> 02:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
they also work very closely with the
 
02:17:38.389 --> 02:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
state family support councils
 
02:17:40.309 --> 02:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
and the council for youth and chronic
 
02:17:42.389 --> 02:17:42.399 align:start position:0%
conditions to get advice
 
02:17:43.830 --> 02:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
as to how the program should be
 
02:17:46.870 --> 02:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
administered and to get
 
02:17:49.750 --> 02:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
input on how we move things forward
 
02:17:49.760 --> 02:17:50.709 align:start position:0%
input on how we move things forward
systemically

02:17:50.709 --> 02:17:50.719 align:start position:0%
systemically
 
02:17:52.549 --> 02:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
if there are any systemic issues that
 
02:17:53.830 --> 02:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
need to be addressed
 
02:17:56.230 --> 02:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
and these are very important partners as
 
02:17:56.870 --> 02:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
we develop
 
02:17:59.910 --> 02:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
programs and administer programs
 
02:18:02.709 --> 02:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
the bureau of family centered services
 
02:18:05.349 --> 02:18:05.359 align:start position:0%
works with community-based agencies
 
02:18:08.709 --> 02:18:08.719 align:start position:0%
they administer 22 contracts
 
02:18:11.990 --> 02:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
with 14 program sites statewide
 
02:18:14.469 --> 02:18:14.479 align:start position:0%
and you will see a listing here of the
 
02:18:15.589 --> 02:18:15.599 align:start position:0%
programs that they
 
02:18:17.990 --> 02:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
administer at the bottom here under the
 
02:18:20.309 --> 02:18:20.319 align:start position:0%
community-based agencies they do child
 
02:18:21.589 --> 02:18:21.599 align:start position:0%
development clinics
 
02:18:22.870 --> 02:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
which is called watch me grow
 
02:18:25.509 --> 02:18:25.519 align:start position:0%
coordination they are responsible for
 
02:18:27.990 --> 02:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
nutrition feeding swallowing and there
 
02:18:30.070 --> 02:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
are a series of other programs that they
 
02:18:32.230 --> 02:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
administer through these contracts
 
02:18:34.790 --> 02:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
with the express purpose of assisting
 
02:18:37.509 --> 02:18:37.519 align:start position:0%
children that have complex medical needs
 
02:18:41.589 --> 02:18:41.599 align:start position:0%
or are being an early intervention
 
02:18:44.070 --> 02:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
to keep them passed between the ages of
 
02:18:45.669 --> 02:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
zero and three to enter the school
 
02:18:47.270 --> 02:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
system at the developmentally
 
02:18:54.309 --> 02:18:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:57.110 --> 02:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
the bfcs programs again they fall under
 
02:18:59.030 --> 02:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
three primary buckets
 
02:19:00.629 --> 02:19:00.639 align:start position:0%
and that's the system of care for
 
02:19:03.589 --> 02:19:03.599 align:start position:0%
children with special health care needs
 
02:19:05.030 --> 02:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
and you can see here that the
 
02:19:07.830 --> 02:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
eligibility is clearly defined under hem
 
02:19:07.840 --> 02:19:08.870 align:start position:0%
eligibility is clearly defined under hem
520

02:19:08.870 --> 02:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
520
 
02:19:11.910 --> 02:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
and these are funded with title title 5
 
02:19:13.830 --> 02:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
grants which were mentioned very early
 
02:19:16.309 --> 02:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
on they also are responsible for
 
02:19:18.230 --> 02:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
providing family support
 
02:19:20.150 --> 02:19:20.160 align:start position:0%
and they administer the partners in
 
02:19:21.669 --> 02:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
health program
 
02:19:26.469 --> 02:19:26.479 align:start position:0%
as well as this is covered under hem 523
 
02:19:29.589 --> 02:19:29.599 align:start position:0%
and the funding levels for this
 
02:19:32.070 --> 02:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
are through the area agency systems as
 
02:19:34.549 --> 02:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
well as through general state funds
 
02:19:37.110 --> 02:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
they are also responsible for fairly
 
02:19:38.950 --> 02:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
centered early supports and services
 
02:19:40.469 --> 02:19:40.479 align:start position:0%
which speaks to the part c
 
02:19:46.309 --> 02:19:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:49.110 --> 02:19:49.120 align:start position:0%

02:19:52.230 --> 02:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
i cannot express enough the amount of
 
02:19:54.070 --> 02:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
effort that's gone in on the part
 
02:19:56.309 --> 02:19:56.319 align:start position:0%
of the bureaus working with the
 
02:19:56.319 --> 02:19:57.349 align:start position:0%
of the bureaus working with the
community-based

02:19:57.349 --> 02:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
community-based
 
02:19:59.429 --> 02:19:59.439 align:start position:0%
providers and organizations to assure
 
02:20:01.750 --> 02:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
that people get the services they need
 
02:20:04.150 --> 02:20:04.160 align:start position:0%
in a safe manner during cobit
 
02:20:07.830 --> 02:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
and the ability to utilize telehealth
 
02:20:10.630 --> 02:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
and remote services has been extremely
 
02:20:10.640 --> 02:20:11.349 align:start position:0%
and remote services has been extremely
important

02:20:11.349 --> 02:20:11.359 align:start position:0%
important
 
02:20:13.030 --> 02:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
it is something that we are looking to
 
02:20:15.110 --> 02:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
implement moving forward
 
02:20:17.510 --> 02:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
we also have just completed our title v
 
02:20:19.990 --> 02:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
grant application and compliance
 
02:20:21.670 --> 02:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
which means that we just completed a
 
02:20:23.590 --> 02:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
five-year needs assessment and we did
 
02:20:24.950 --> 02:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
this during the covid
 
02:20:28.389 --> 02:20:28.399 align:start position:0%
emergency and we did this poorly staffed
 
02:20:31.190 --> 02:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
during that time period
 
02:20:33.990 --> 02:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
bfcs has also worked with the managed
 
02:20:35.910 --> 02:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
care organizations
 
02:20:38.070 --> 02:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
to ensure that they understand the types
 
02:20:39.990 --> 02:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
of children that we are supporting
 
02:20:41.910 --> 02:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
the needs of their families and so that
 
02:20:43.750 --> 02:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
we get a better cooperation and
 
02:20:45.910 --> 02:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
collaborative approach with the mcos for
 
02:20:49.429 --> 02:20:49.439 align:start position:0%
supporting these individuals
 
02:20:52.870 --> 02:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
in terms of key challenges technology
 
02:20:56.469 --> 02:20:56.479 align:start position:0%
once again the fcs uses in some cases
 
02:20:58.790 --> 02:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
unsupported data systems to manage case
 
02:21:01.990 --> 02:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
records and for program implementation
 
02:21:04.070 --> 02:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
we have workforce issues relative to
 
02:21:06.389 --> 02:21:06.399 align:start position:0%
nursing respite and pediatric specialty
 
02:21:08.150 --> 02:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
provider shortages
 
02:21:10.389 --> 02:21:10.399 align:start position:0%
that are a challenge for the people we
 
02:21:11.670 --> 02:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
serve and for their families
 
02:21:14.710 --> 02:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
and again we had a 41 staff vacancy rate
 
02:21:16.550 --> 02:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
that we are working very hard now to
 
02:21:16.560 --> 02:21:20.309 align:start position:0%
that we are working very hard now to
correct

02:21:20.309 --> 02:21:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:24.630 --> 02:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
in terms of um the unduplicated numbers
 
02:21:28.230 --> 02:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
and for people that we serve and support
 
02:21:30.389 --> 02:21:30.399 align:start position:0%
i wanted to call your attention to a
 
02:21:31.429 --> 02:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
couple of items
 
02:21:35.190 --> 02:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
on this uh table here um
 
02:21:37.750 --> 02:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
first of all under bfcs you're going to
 
02:21:38.550 --> 02:21:38.560 align:start position:0%
note that
 
02:21:42.710 --> 02:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
in sfy 15 the numbers were 4
 
02:21:45.750 --> 02:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
310 and now in sfy
 
02:21:50.710 --> 02:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
20 they're 3 3 244.
 
02:21:57.270 --> 02:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:59.510 --> 02:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
i was our northern guidance thank you
 
02:22:00.550 --> 02:22:00.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:22:03.349 --> 02:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
deb you're doing a great job um could
 
02:22:04.550 --> 02:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
you talk a little bit
 
02:22:06.630 --> 02:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
more about the hiring freeze and what
 
02:22:08.230 --> 02:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
the status of that is
 
02:22:11.429 --> 02:22:11.439 align:start position:0%
and where we think we are within
 
02:22:15.270 --> 02:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
and if it'll end or i mean 41
 
02:22:19.349 --> 02:22:19.359 align:start position:0%
is pretty traumatic it is it is
 
02:22:22.150 --> 02:22:22.160 align:start position:0%
terribly traumatic and um the good news
 
02:22:24.870 --> 02:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
is that the hiring freeze is over
 
02:22:27.510 --> 02:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
and we immediately were prioritized for
 
02:22:29.190 --> 02:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
posting our positions
 
02:22:31.830 --> 02:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
and in on my supervisory with dee dunn
 
02:22:33.190 --> 02:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
today who is the bureau
 
02:22:36.309 --> 02:22:36.319 align:start position:0%
chief we are well on our way
 
02:22:38.710 --> 02:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
to filling those positions and starting
 
02:22:40.630 --> 02:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
the onboarding process
 
02:22:42.550 --> 02:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
we've been fortunate that we've been
 
02:22:45.190 --> 02:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
able to fast-track this because there is
 
02:22:45.200 --> 02:22:45.429 align:start position:0%
able to fast-track this because there is
an

02:22:45.429 --> 02:22:45.439 align:start position:0%
an
 
02:22:47.590 --> 02:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
understanding for the for the vacancy
 
02:22:55.110 --> 02:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:58.950 --> 02:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:00.790 --> 02:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
so um i wanted to talk a little bit
 
02:23:03.349 --> 02:23:03.359 align:start position:0%
about the differential between 15
 
02:23:07.750 --> 02:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
and 20 in the bfcs line here
 
02:23:11.510 --> 02:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
in 2015 we determined that we had a
 
02:23:11.520 --> 02:23:13.030 align:start position:0%
in 2015 we determined that we had a
duplication

02:23:13.030 --> 02:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
duplication
 
02:23:15.190 --> 02:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
in count efforts for our partners in
 
02:23:16.230 --> 02:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
health in our area
 
02:23:18.790 --> 02:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
agencies and we have been working
 
02:23:20.630 --> 02:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
towards correcting that over a three
 
02:23:22.309 --> 02:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
year period
 
02:23:25.030 --> 02:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
and what happens is as children age out
 
02:23:26.710 --> 02:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
that correction is made and people are
 
02:23:29.190 --> 02:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
not getting a duplication and services
 
02:23:32.309 --> 02:23:32.319 align:start position:0%
another contributing factor to this is
 
02:23:32.319 --> 02:23:33.429 align:start position:0%
another contributing factor to this is
that

02:23:33.429 --> 02:23:33.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:23:36.469 --> 02:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
the lack of pediatric specialists
 
02:23:39.030 --> 02:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
for for example for for the nutrition
 
02:23:40.550 --> 02:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
and swallowing clinics
 
02:23:42.230 --> 02:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
makes it difficult to fulfill the
 
02:23:44.389 --> 02:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
services at the levels we were before
 
02:23:46.710 --> 02:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
because the children are complex
 
02:23:49.429 --> 02:23:49.439 align:start position:0%
so that explains why we are looking at
 
02:23:51.190 --> 02:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
lower accounts in sfy
 
02:23:54.389 --> 02:23:54.399 align:start position:0%
20. i'd also like to call your attention
 
02:23:57.830 --> 02:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
to fc ess which is our early supports
 
02:23:59.349 --> 02:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
and services
 
02:24:03.670 --> 02:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
in state fiscal year 19 it was 5038
 
02:24:08.950 --> 02:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
and in sfy 20 it's 4595.
 
02:24:11.349 --> 02:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
our early supports and services programs
 
02:24:12.950 --> 02:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
are delivered in the homes of
 
02:24:12.960 --> 02:24:14.309 align:start position:0%
are delivered in the homes of
individuals

02:24:14.309 --> 02:24:14.319 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
02:24:17.349 --> 02:24:17.359 align:start position:0%
and during the covid crisis
 
02:24:20.389 --> 02:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
many families did not want individuals
 
02:24:23.270 --> 02:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
in their homes delivering those services
 
02:24:23.280 --> 02:24:24.070 align:start position:0%
in their homes delivering those services
so

02:24:24.070 --> 02:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:24:26.870 --> 02:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
because of covid we saw the census
 
02:24:28.630 --> 02:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
numbers go down
 
02:24:31.990 --> 02:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
for this budget cycle i have
 
02:24:36.070 --> 02:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
put in for our fcess services to
 
02:24:40.870 --> 02:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
come in at the previous amount the sfy19
 
02:24:43.750 --> 02:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
amount because at that point in time we
 
02:24:44.950 --> 02:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
had been consumed
 
02:24:47.670 --> 02:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
continuously trending upwards slightly
 
02:24:49.750 --> 02:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
and i do believe that this is an anomaly
 
02:24:51.830 --> 02:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
that is specific to covid
 
02:24:53.670 --> 02:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to call your attention
 
02:24:59.750 --> 02:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:03.429 --> 02:25:03.439 align:start position:0%
in terms of workload benchmarks
 
02:25:07.110 --> 02:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
right now we have uh our requirements
 
02:25:09.110 --> 02:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
in terms of oversight of the waivers
 
02:25:11.830 --> 02:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
that we have to do what's known as a 372
 
02:25:13.510 --> 02:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
report which is a financial report
 
02:25:15.190 --> 02:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
against our waivers
 
02:25:17.349 --> 02:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
and we need to compare the approved
 
02:25:19.670 --> 02:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
waiver services to the costs realized
 
02:25:21.670 --> 02:25:21.680 align:start position:0%
for services and costs
 
02:25:24.309 --> 02:25:24.319 align:start position:0%
and we are responsible for doing this on
 
02:25:24.319 --> 02:25:24.790 align:start position:0%
and we are responsible for doing this on
time

02:25:24.790 --> 02:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:25:26.870 --> 02:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
on a yearly basis and it's an
 
02:25:29.110 --> 02:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
expectation that this is done 100
 
02:25:32.630 --> 02:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
on time and accurate and that is a key
 
02:25:35.349 --> 02:25:35.359 align:start position:0%
bench load uh benchmark and workload
 
02:25:37.110 --> 02:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
that we work towards
 
02:25:40.309 --> 02:25:40.319 align:start position:0%
prior authorization processing um prior
 
02:25:42.710 --> 02:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
authorizations for emergent services are
 
02:25:42.720 --> 02:25:43.429 align:start position:0%
authorizations for emergent services are
processed

02:25:43.429 --> 02:25:43.439 align:start position:0%
processed
 
02:25:46.150 --> 02:25:46.160 align:start position:0%
timely at a hundred percent however we
 
02:25:48.150 --> 02:25:48.160 align:start position:0%
have been short staffed in our prior
 
02:25:49.670 --> 02:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
authorization unit
 
02:25:52.870 --> 02:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
for over three years the good news is
 
02:25:54.950 --> 02:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
with the hiring freeze being lifted we
 
02:25:57.110 --> 02:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
have started the hiring process to be
 
02:25:58.790 --> 02:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
fully staffed again
 
02:26:01.750 --> 02:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
so we do have some authorization syses
 
02:26:02.710 --> 02:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
and hearsts which
 
02:26:05.030 --> 02:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
are essentially evaluations or
 
02:26:05.040 --> 02:26:06.389 align:start position:0%
are essentially evaluations or
assessments

02:26:06.389 --> 02:26:06.399 align:start position:0%
assessments
 
02:26:09.349 --> 02:26:09.359 align:start position:0%
these are completed after the 45-day
 
02:26:11.349 --> 02:26:11.359 align:start position:0%
requirement due and some of them
 
02:26:14.469 --> 02:26:14.479 align:start position:0%
are extremely tardy right now so our
 
02:26:16.070 --> 02:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
objective in terms of prior
 
02:26:18.389 --> 02:26:18.399 align:start position:0%
authorization processing is to approve
 
02:26:20.550 --> 02:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
100 percent of prior authorizations
 
02:26:23.190 --> 02:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
within 45 days of receipt and services
 
02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:24.630 align:start position:0%
within 45 days of receipt and services
beginning

02:26:24.630 --> 02:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
02:26:26.309 --> 02:26:26.319 align:start position:0%
and then the other thing we do is we
 
02:26:28.550 --> 02:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
work very hard to maintain the stability
 
02:26:31.110 --> 02:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
of our area agency system
 
02:26:33.270 --> 02:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
and that we know that we are operating
 
02:26:34.150 --> 02:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
with our area
 
02:26:37.270 --> 02:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
agencies with integrity so what we do
 
02:26:40.950 --> 02:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
is every two years we do a redesignation
 
02:26:43.590 --> 02:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
of our area agencies and we review
 
02:26:43.600 --> 02:26:44.710 align:start position:0%
of our area agencies and we review
governance

02:26:44.710 --> 02:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
governance
 
02:26:46.950 --> 02:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
financial management contractual and
 
02:26:48.630 --> 02:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
regulatory requirements
 
02:26:51.750 --> 02:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
and client and family satisfaction this
 
02:26:52.870 --> 02:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
is outlined for
 
02:26:55.910 --> 02:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
rsa 171 a as well as in
 
02:27:00.389 --> 02:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
hem 505 so every two years
 
02:27:03.190 --> 02:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
um for so every year two agencies
 
02:27:04.710 --> 02:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
undergo this review
 
02:27:07.990 --> 02:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
and the bds staff works to do this on
 
02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:08.950 align:start position:0%
and the bds staff works to do this on
time

02:27:08.950 --> 02:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:27:11.110 --> 02:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
and with the consideration that it is
 
02:27:16.070 --> 02:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
due because it is very very important
 
02:27:18.950 --> 02:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
um what i would what we would do with
 
02:27:20.870 --> 02:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
the bureau of developmental services and
 
02:27:20.880 --> 02:27:21.830 align:start position:0%
the bureau of developmental services and
bfcs

02:27:21.830 --> 02:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
bfcs
 
02:27:24.309 --> 02:27:24.319 align:start position:0%
in terms of incremental and decremented
 
02:27:24.319 --> 02:27:25.750 align:start position:0%
in terms of incremental and decremented
outcomes

02:27:25.750 --> 02:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
outcomes
 
02:27:28.950 --> 02:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
um if we were given a five percent
 
02:27:32.230 --> 02:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
uh increase we would we would build
 
02:27:34.550 --> 02:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
intensive treatment services capacity
 
02:27:36.630 --> 02:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
in state to drive down the cost per
 
02:27:38.710 --> 02:27:38.720 align:start position:0%
client and enhance positive outcomes for
 
02:27:40.630 --> 02:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
community inclusion
 
02:27:43.190 --> 02:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
and what we would do as part of that is
 
02:27:44.230 --> 02:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
we would
 
02:27:47.990 --> 02:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
hire up some
 
02:27:50.070 --> 02:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
two additional staff to help provide
 
02:27:51.910 --> 02:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
oversight for that build
 
02:27:53.590 --> 02:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
and we would look at starting up
 
02:27:55.510 --> 02:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
residential housing and staffing
 
02:27:57.750 --> 02:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
education and specialty hiring
 
02:28:00.309 --> 02:28:00.319 align:start position:0%
with those dollars in addition we would
 
02:28:01.910 --> 02:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
hire one staff
 
02:28:03.830 --> 02:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
to provide oversight for the corrective
 
02:28:07.190 --> 02:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
action plan implementation and oversight
 
02:28:10.389 --> 02:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
if our budget was cut we would
 
02:28:12.790 --> 02:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
that would continue to necessitate
 
02:28:14.870 --> 02:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
continued outplacement
 
02:28:17.910 --> 02:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
of some of our people that we serve
 
02:28:19.429 --> 02:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
which we do not like to send
 
02:28:21.910 --> 02:28:21.920 align:start position:0%
the people that we serve out of state
 
02:28:22.710 --> 02:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
and we would
 
02:28:24.870 --> 02:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
be unable to potentially serve people
 
02:28:27.030 --> 02:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
off of the developmental disability wait
 
02:28:27.040 --> 02:28:27.990 align:start position:0%
off of the developmental disability wait
list

02:28:27.990 --> 02:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
list
 
02:28:30.710 --> 02:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
and in the end if we did not serve
 
02:28:32.790 --> 02:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
people off of the dt wait list and we
 
02:28:34.150 --> 02:28:34.160 align:start position:0%
ran a wait list
 
02:28:36.550 --> 02:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
those individuals would cost more in the
 
02:28:37.270 --> 02:28:37.280 align:start position:0%
long run
 
02:28:39.830 --> 02:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
because the gains that they had made
 
02:28:42.150 --> 02:28:42.160 align:start position:0%
through the school system
 
02:28:44.070 --> 02:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
would be lost because they would be at
 
02:28:46.469 --> 02:28:46.479 align:start position:0%
home without the services that they need
 
02:28:48.230 --> 02:28:48.240 align:start position:0%
and their families would be responsible
 
02:28:49.750 --> 02:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
for caring for them and
 
02:28:54.150 --> 02:28:54.160 align:start position:0%
maintaining them and with that
 
02:28:55.910 --> 02:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
i will hand it over to karen unless
 
02:29:03.990 --> 02:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:08.230 --> 02:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
great okay so
 
02:29:11.429 --> 02:29:11.439 align:start position:0%
uh just doing a time check chair i know
 
02:29:13.030 --> 02:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
you said you wanted to try to wrap up by
 
02:29:13.040 --> 02:29:13.429 align:start position:0%
you said you wanted to try to wrap up by
2

02:29:13.429 --> 02:29:13.439 align:start position:0%
2
 
02:29:15.349 --> 02:29:15.359 align:start position:0%
30. it looks like you still have a
 
02:29:15.359 --> 02:29:16.630 align:start position:0%
30. it looks like you still have a
quorum

02:29:16.630 --> 02:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
quorum
 
02:29:18.469 --> 02:29:18.479 align:start position:0%
we just have these group of accounting
 
02:29:20.070 --> 02:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
units left do we want to try to get
 
02:29:23.030 --> 02:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
through them absolutely care as long as
 
02:29:24.150 --> 02:29:24.160 align:start position:0%
you're willing
 
02:29:26.150 --> 02:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
oh yes that would be great i think it'd
 
02:29:27.910 --> 02:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
be great to not have to bring the group
 
02:29:29.910 --> 02:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
back for a half an hour tomorrow
 
02:29:30.950 --> 02:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
i was actually wondering who you were
 
02:29:33.590 --> 02:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
talking to at first then i really did
 
02:29:35.270 --> 02:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
i believe you were the acting chair at
 
02:29:36.950 --> 02:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
the moment good point
 
02:29:40.790 --> 02:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
thank you so um just going quickly
 
02:29:43.670 --> 02:29:43.680 align:start position:0%
through this 1819 to 2021 the biggest
 
02:29:44.389 --> 02:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
jump here
 
02:29:47.510 --> 02:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
is uh the governor's budget in 2021
 
02:29:49.910 --> 02:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
essentially eliminate the wait list and
 
02:29:51.670 --> 02:29:51.680 align:start position:0%
as you can see from our current numbers
 
02:29:52.950 --> 02:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
the dev reviewed
 
02:29:55.750 --> 02:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
we do not have a wait list so it um did
 
02:29:57.750 --> 02:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
what it was intended to
 
02:29:59.190 --> 02:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
so jumping right into the accounting
 
02:30:02.150 --> 02:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
units the first one is 7100
 
02:30:04.070 --> 02:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
which is developmental services here on
 
02:30:05.830 --> 02:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
page 1132
 
02:30:08.630 --> 02:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
uh chair you asked to point out when we
 
02:30:10.389 --> 02:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
get to the accounting unit that had the
 
02:30:12.230 --> 02:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities wait list it
 
02:30:12.240 --> 02:30:12.870 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities wait list it
is

02:30:12.870 --> 02:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:30:14.950 --> 02:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
included in this accounting unit uh
 
02:30:14.960 --> 02:30:16.950 align:start position:0%
included in this accounting unit uh
historically

02:30:16.950 --> 02:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
historically
 
02:30:18.389 --> 02:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
before my time so at least three
 
02:30:21.030 --> 02:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
bienniums ago waitlist funds were in a
 
02:30:22.630 --> 02:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
separate class line or a separate
 
02:30:24.630 --> 02:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
accounting unit and it actually created
 
02:30:26.630 --> 02:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
more problems than it solved
 
02:30:29.590 --> 02:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
so it is one accounting unit um that has
 
02:30:31.910 --> 02:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
all of the potential dollars to serve
 
02:30:33.670 --> 02:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
the developmental disability
 
02:30:37.190 --> 02:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
community okay so basically between the
 
02:30:38.550 --> 02:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
contracts the program services and the
 
02:30:41.030 --> 02:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
payment providers is your
 
02:30:43.750 --> 02:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
is the funding the 102 and 502 i'm on
 
02:30:44.870 --> 02:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
the right line
 
02:30:46.870 --> 02:30:46.880 align:start position:0%
correct the reason 102 is separate is
 
02:30:48.230 --> 02:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
that that is 100
 
02:30:51.349 --> 02:30:51.359 align:start position:0%
general funds that's for uh board
 
02:30:54.150 --> 02:30:54.160 align:start position:0%
we cannot use federal dollars to pay for
 
02:30:54.160 --> 02:30:55.190 align:start position:0%
we cannot use federal dollars to pay for
um

02:30:55.190 --> 02:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:30:57.030 --> 02:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
for board so that's why that's a
 
02:30:58.230 --> 02:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
separate class line
 
02:30:59.670 --> 02:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
the other thing you'll note is it looks
 
02:31:01.349 --> 02:31:01.359 align:start position:0%
like there's a reduction here from
 
02:31:04.389 --> 02:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
from 21 to 22. and
 
02:31:07.190 --> 02:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
um in the general fund dollar request
 
02:31:08.309 --> 02:31:08.319 align:start position:0%
for 22
 
02:31:11.190 --> 02:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
there is but what is happening is we are
 
02:31:13.110 --> 02:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
anticipating a carry forward
 
02:31:17.349 --> 02:31:17.359 align:start position:0%
from 21 of about 38 million dollars
 
02:31:20.950 --> 02:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
going into 22 and so that 38 million
 
02:31:22.150 --> 02:31:22.160 align:start position:0%
dollars is not
 
02:31:24.309 --> 02:31:24.319 align:start position:0%
reflected in our budget request because
 
02:31:25.670 --> 02:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
it is a carry forward
 
02:31:27.830 --> 02:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
but it will be part of the total budget
 
02:31:30.790 --> 02:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
available for fiscal year 22 and and 23
 
02:31:33.349 --> 02:31:33.359 align:start position:0%
to carry forward as well
 
02:31:36.630 --> 02:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
because this accounting unit in last
 
02:31:36.640 --> 02:31:37.429 align:start position:0%
because this accounting unit in last
biennium

02:31:37.429 --> 02:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
02:31:40.790 --> 02:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
was designated as a
 
02:31:43.510 --> 02:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
revolving account so it is non-lapsing
 
02:31:43.520 --> 02:31:44.389 align:start position:0%
revolving account so it is non-lapsing
um

02:31:44.389 --> 02:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:51.190 --> 02:31:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:55.110 --> 02:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:57.990 --> 02:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
i don't see any okay the next accounting
 
02:31:58.990 --> 02:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
unit is
 
02:32:01.750 --> 02:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
5947 which is program support
 
02:32:03.910 --> 02:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
this is where the staff are for this
 
02:32:03.920 --> 02:32:05.670 align:start position:0%
this is where the staff are for this
area

02:32:05.670 --> 02:32:05.680 align:start position:0%
area
 
02:32:16.469 --> 02:32:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:19.510 --> 02:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
so is more staffing anticipated
 
02:32:23.429 --> 02:32:23.439 align:start position:0%
is that mostly increase or
 
02:32:26.710 --> 02:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
um nope
 
02:32:29.670 --> 02:32:29.680 align:start position:0%
i i actually think the the request from
 
02:32:30.550 --> 02:32:30.560 align:start position:0%
21 to
 
02:32:33.590 --> 02:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
22 is actually a decrease probably
 
02:32:33.600 --> 02:32:35.190 align:start position:0%
22 is actually a decrease probably
because

02:32:35.190 --> 02:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:32:38.070 --> 02:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
of retirements dub's not so they would
 
02:32:39.429 --> 02:32:39.439 align:start position:0%
have been budgeted at step
 
02:32:41.590 --> 02:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
one in 22 because those were vacant
 
02:32:41.600 --> 02:32:43.750 align:start position:0%
one in 22 because those were vacant
positions

02:32:43.750 --> 02:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
positions
 
02:32:45.510 --> 02:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
and probably that's the other thing the
 
02:32:47.030 --> 02:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
other thing to keep in mind
 
02:32:49.270 --> 02:32:49.280 align:start position:0%
is that we're because of the closing of
 
02:32:51.110 --> 02:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire designated receiving
 
02:32:51.120 --> 02:32:55.190 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire designated receiving
facility

02:32:55.190 --> 02:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:57.990 --> 02:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
are zeroed out that's in a different
 
02:32:59.030 --> 02:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
accounting unit though
 
02:33:01.590 --> 02:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
yeah but just to i wanted to clarify
 
02:33:03.190 --> 02:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
because i spoke about that but i wanted
 
02:33:04.950 --> 02:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
to give everyone a heads up
 
02:33:04.960 --> 02:33:08.870 align:start position:0%
to give everyone a heads up
yes

02:33:08.870 --> 02:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:12.710 --> 02:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
don't see any other questions okay
 
02:33:15.590 --> 02:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
moving right along then uh the next one
 
02:33:17.190 --> 02:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
is 5947
 
02:33:19.190 --> 02:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
which is you know that's what i was just
 
02:33:20.469 --> 02:33:20.479 align:start position:0%
doing i'm sorry
 
02:33:24.630 --> 02:33:24.640 align:start position:0%
uh 7016 acquired brain disorder
 
02:33:37.750 --> 02:33:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:40.070 --> 02:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
this similarly is anticipated to have a
 
02:33:41.910 --> 02:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
carry forward which is why this is a
 
02:33:43.990 --> 02:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
reduction here even from the actual
 
02:33:47.030 --> 02:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
expenses in 2020.
 
02:33:50.630 --> 02:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
okay you'll see that 22 or 23 rather is
 
02:33:51.910 --> 02:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
more in line
 
02:33:54.070 --> 02:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
um because that carry forward will be
 
02:33:58.870 --> 02:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:00.870 --> 02:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
yep i don't see any further questions
 
02:34:03.270 --> 02:34:03.280 align:start position:0%
okay the next one is 7110
 
02:34:06.630 --> 02:34:06.640 align:start position:0%
which is the ihf children's ihs
 
02:34:06.640 --> 02:34:11.590 align:start position:0%
which is the ihf children's ihs
waiver

02:34:11.590 --> 02:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:14.870 --> 02:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
that appears to be up a bit is that
 
02:34:18.950 --> 02:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:20.389 --> 02:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry you weren't that appears to be
 
02:34:25.270 --> 02:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:28.630 --> 02:34:28.640 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry so
 
02:34:30.150 --> 02:34:30.160 align:start position:0%
five or two the number the line appears
 
02:34:32.389 --> 02:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
to be up about oh i don't know
 
02:34:34.469 --> 02:34:34.479 align:start position:0%
some between five point six million and
 
02:34:36.870 --> 02:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
seven and a half million
 
02:34:39.030 --> 02:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
i'm reading that right or i'm sorry oh
 
02:34:40.550 --> 02:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the wrong i'm sorry
 
02:34:41.670 --> 02:34:41.680 align:start position:0%
my columns are colored you know
 
02:34:43.910 --> 02:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
different ways it's really level funded
 
02:34:47.750 --> 02:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:51.990 --> 02:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:55.110 --> 02:34:55.120 align:start position:0%
it is it's down from fiscal year 21. yes
 
02:34:58.230 --> 02:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
yeah i was looking at 20 when i never
 
02:34:59.510 --> 02:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
mind keep going
 
02:34:59.520 --> 02:35:03.670 align:start position:0%
mind keep going
okay

02:35:03.670 --> 02:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:07.590 --> 02:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
uh the next one is 70 uh 1-4
 
02:35:15.270 --> 02:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:17.030 --> 02:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
this is not an accounting unit that
 
02:35:18.630 --> 02:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
hasn't allowed carry forward it looks
 
02:35:20.230 --> 02:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
like representative norgren might have a
 
02:35:20.240 --> 02:35:21.510 align:start position:0%
like representative norgren might have a
question

02:35:21.510 --> 02:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:35:24.710 --> 02:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
right john oh yes thank you
 
02:35:28.790 --> 02:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
um so we're seeing differences between
 
02:35:32.070 --> 02:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
21 and 22 and 23
 
02:35:35.349 --> 02:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
and and the the differences
 
02:35:39.429 --> 02:35:39.439 align:start position:0%
in 22 uh are quite a few of them related
 
02:35:39.439 --> 02:35:40.150 align:start position:0%
in 22 uh are quite a few of them related
to

02:35:40.150 --> 02:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:35:43.429 --> 02:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
coven and the changing of
 
02:35:46.550 --> 02:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
the status of people and serving
 
02:35:48.230 --> 02:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
different people or
 
02:35:51.750 --> 02:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
what do you think that is you're are you
 
02:35:53.190 --> 02:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
referring to the developmental
 
02:35:53.200 --> 02:35:54.870 align:start position:0%
referring to the developmental
disabilities

02:35:54.870 --> 02:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
02:35:57.270 --> 02:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
well i see it under children's waiver
 
02:35:59.990 --> 02:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
acquired grade
 
02:36:01.750 --> 02:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
so that that's because of the carry
 
02:36:03.190 --> 02:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
forward um
 
02:36:05.190 --> 02:36:05.200 align:start position:0%
that will be coming forward from 21 into
 
02:36:06.790 --> 02:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
22. those
 
02:36:08.469 --> 02:36:08.479 align:start position:0%
three accounting units are all
 
02:36:10.389 --> 02:36:10.399 align:start position:0%
continuously appropriated non-lapsing
 
02:36:12.230 --> 02:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
accounts and we're anticipating funds
 
02:36:14.469 --> 02:36:14.479 align:start position:0%
that will not be spent in 21
 
02:36:19.670 --> 02:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
that will carry over into 22. so those
 
02:36:22.389 --> 02:36:22.399 align:start position:0%
those funds not spent were those because
 
02:36:23.990 --> 02:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic or just
 
02:36:27.270 --> 02:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
because they were inspect uh so i think
 
02:36:28.710 --> 02:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
it was two things that was the pandemic
 
02:36:29.990 --> 02:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
which deb spoke a lot
 
02:36:32.389 --> 02:36:32.399 align:start position:0%
about earlier also this was the first
 
02:36:32.399 --> 02:36:33.190 align:start position:0%
about earlier also this was the first
biennium

02:36:33.190 --> 02:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
02:36:36.790 --> 02:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
where we fully funded the wait list
 
02:36:38.469 --> 02:36:38.479 align:start position:0%
so i think that it was also level
 
02:36:40.070 --> 02:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
setting um what
 
02:36:43.190 --> 02:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
fully funded might require okay thank
 
02:36:43.200 --> 02:36:44.630 align:start position:0%
fully funded might require okay thank
you

02:36:44.630 --> 02:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:36:46.389 --> 02:36:46.399 align:start position:0%
ken what were the three there were 7016
 
02:36:47.750 --> 02:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
what were the other two that were the
 
02:36:48.550 --> 02:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
carry forward
 
02:36:52.070 --> 02:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
it's 7 100 71
 
02:36:58.469 --> 02:36:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:00.790 --> 02:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
and we are currently on 71.4 which is
 
02:37:02.830 --> 02:37:02.840 align:start position:0%
early intervention
 
02:37:05.830 --> 02:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
yeah i think i think you can go ahead
 
02:37:05.840 --> 02:37:06.469 align:start position:0%
yeah i think i think you can go ahead
ken

02:37:06.469 --> 02:37:06.479 align:start position:0%
ken
 
02:37:09.910 --> 02:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
okay uh this accounting unit 7164 is the
 
02:37:10.630 --> 02:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
one that deb
 
02:37:12.389 --> 02:37:12.399 align:start position:0%
spoke about the designated receiving
 
02:37:14.230 --> 02:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
facility which um
 
02:37:16.710 --> 02:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
does not have a budget for 22-23 as we
 
02:37:19.349 --> 02:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
anticipate closing that
 
02:37:21.990 --> 02:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
so that's the facility up in laconia
 
02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:22.950 align:start position:0%
so that's the facility up in laconia
correct

02:37:22.950 --> 02:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:37:27.110 --> 02:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
okay because nhh is also
 
02:37:31.190 --> 02:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
a d d d r f right
 
02:37:32.870 --> 02:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
so the term designated receiving
 
02:37:34.950 --> 02:37:34.960 align:start position:0%
facility is used in a lot of contexts
 
02:37:35.910 --> 02:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
there are
 
02:37:39.030 --> 02:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
different um types of drfs throughout
 
02:37:40.070 --> 02:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
the state there
 
02:37:41.990 --> 02:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
are mental health drffs this one was
 
02:37:43.190 --> 02:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
specific to
 
02:37:45.750 --> 02:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
the developmental disabilities community
 
02:37:45.760 --> 02:37:46.389 align:start position:0%
the developmental disabilities community
okay

02:37:46.389 --> 02:37:46.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:37:49.190 --> 02:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
so it's a pretty universal term gotcha
 
02:37:51.349 --> 02:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm learning
 
02:37:55.190 --> 02:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
slowly it takes a long time
 
02:38:00.230 --> 02:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
i don't see any other questions
 
02:38:04.070 --> 02:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
okay the next one is 7013 which is
 
02:38:11.590 --> 02:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:13.670 --> 02:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
so this is one of the in-home ones
 
02:38:13.680 --> 02:38:15.670 align:start position:0%
so this is one of the in-home ones
basically

02:38:15.670 --> 02:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
basically
 
02:38:17.910 --> 02:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
dev can you speak to this accounting
 
02:38:19.910 --> 02:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
unit and the family support services
 
02:38:23.270 --> 02:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
so family support services um we find
 
02:38:24.950 --> 02:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
families eligible
 
02:38:27.270 --> 02:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
for waiver services and so this could be
 
02:38:29.429 --> 02:38:29.439 align:start position:0%
somebody who is on the abd
 
02:38:32.389 --> 02:38:32.399 align:start position:0%
ihs or dd waiver but they're also
 
02:38:34.309 --> 02:38:34.319 align:start position:0%
eligible for fss
 
02:38:36.870 --> 02:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
so through the 10 area agencies and the
 
02:38:38.230 --> 02:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
services can include
 
02:38:41.910 --> 02:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
respite um parent-to-parent advocacy
 
02:38:42.870 --> 02:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
referral help
 
02:38:46.469 --> 02:38:46.479 align:start position:0%
etc because one of the mainstays
 
02:38:49.750 --> 02:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
of the developmental services system is
 
02:38:51.510 --> 02:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
the fact that the families
 
02:38:53.349 --> 02:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
in the majority of instances do the
 
02:38:54.710 --> 02:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
heavy lifting
 
02:38:56.309 --> 02:38:56.319 align:start position:0%
they provide the room they provide the
 
02:38:57.910 --> 02:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
board they provide
 
02:39:00.309 --> 02:39:00.319 align:start position:0%
the clothing and the supports and what
 
02:39:01.990 --> 02:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
we try and do is help the families
 
02:39:02.710 --> 02:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
continue to
 
02:39:04.630 --> 02:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
do this and give them the support that
 
02:39:06.469 --> 02:39:06.479 align:start position:0%
they need to get respite and take a
 
02:39:08.309 --> 02:39:08.319 align:start position:0%
break and things like that
 
02:39:11.270 --> 02:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
so this is an adjunct to the waiver
 
02:39:13.429 --> 02:39:13.439 align:start position:0%
services and in some instances people
 
02:39:14.469 --> 02:39:14.479 align:start position:0%
may not be
 
02:39:16.710 --> 02:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
getting waiver services but they do get
 
02:39:18.630 --> 02:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
family support services
 
02:39:20.550 --> 02:39:20.560 align:start position:0%
so so it's in home the family's taking
 
02:39:21.670 --> 02:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
care of someone in home that's why
 
02:39:23.510 --> 02:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
they're getting the support
 
02:39:26.389 --> 02:39:26.399 align:start position:0%
yes but in some instances they could be
 
02:39:28.309 --> 02:39:28.319 align:start position:0%
in an enhanced family care and the
 
02:39:30.469 --> 02:39:30.479 align:start position:0%
and the family continues to get some
 
02:39:31.910 --> 02:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
level of family support because they
 
02:39:32.950 --> 02:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
might be bringing them home on the
 
02:39:34.469 --> 02:39:34.479 align:start position:0%
weekends for example
 
02:39:36.710 --> 02:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
okay what we try and do is we try and
 
02:39:37.990 --> 02:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
take care of
 
02:39:39.590 --> 02:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
the people who provide the natural
 
02:39:43.110 --> 02:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
supports so that we keep them engaged
 
02:39:46.070 --> 02:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
and active in in being part of the
 
02:39:48.070 --> 02:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
continuum of care themselves because
 
02:39:48.630 --> 02:39:48.640 align:start position:0%
they do an
 
02:39:52.389 --> 02:39:52.399 align:start position:0%
awful lot for the people we we support
 
02:39:53.590 --> 02:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
and i probably shouldn't ask this again
 
02:39:54.790 --> 02:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
because i know i heard it many many
 
02:39:55.830 --> 02:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
times two years ago
 
02:39:57.429 --> 02:39:57.439 align:start position:0%
but respite again could you just define
 
02:39:58.870 --> 02:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
that for me
 
02:40:06.550 --> 02:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
uh sandy can you define respite please
 
02:40:08.070 --> 02:40:08.080 align:start position:0%

02:40:13.030 --> 02:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
um the definition of respite is
 
02:40:15.429 --> 02:40:15.439 align:start position:0%
a support service that's used to
 
02:40:15.439 --> 02:40:16.790 align:start position:0%
a support service that's used to
basically

02:40:16.790 --> 02:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
basically
 
02:40:20.230 --> 02:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
relieve the caregiver of providing care
 
02:40:21.990 --> 02:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
to the individual whether that is
 
02:40:22.000 --> 02:40:22.870 align:start position:0%
to the individual whether that is
usually

02:40:22.870 --> 02:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
usually
 
02:40:26.389 --> 02:40:26.399 align:start position:0%
in their home and you may have a respite
 
02:40:27.429 --> 02:40:27.439 align:start position:0%

02:40:29.349 --> 02:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
to the caregiver's home or that
 
02:40:30.870 --> 02:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
individual may go
 
02:40:33.429 --> 02:40:33.439 align:start position:0%
to a respite provider's home but it's to
 
02:40:34.710 --> 02:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
relieve the caregiver
 
02:40:36.630 --> 02:40:36.640 align:start position:0%

02:40:48.150 --> 02:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
the next accounting unit is 78.52 which
 
02:40:51.910 --> 02:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:54.950 --> 02:40:54.960 align:start position:0%

some examples of these services could
 
02:42:47.030 --> 02:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
include health care coordination
 
02:42:49.429 --> 02:42:49.439 align:start position:0%

to specialty appointments we also offer
 
02:43:06.950 --> 02:43:06.960 align:start position:0%

02:43:21.269 --> 02:43:21.279 align:start position:0%
growing or children that are using

feeding tubes
 
02:43:23.910 --> 02:43:23.920 align:start position:0%

02:43:26.870 --> 02:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
evaluations and services that they need
 
02:43:35.269 --> 02:43:35.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:39.190 --> 02:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:40.550 --> 02:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
yeah so i was just going to say i don't
 
02:43:42.550 --> 02:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
think it it's a it is a reduction from
 
02:43:44.309 --> 02:43:44.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21
 
02:43:45.990 --> 02:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
um but it's bringing it more in line
 
02:43:47.590 --> 02:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
with the actual spending that happened
 
02:43:51.269 --> 02:43:51.279 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 20.
 
02:43:57.830 --> 02:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:10.469 --> 02:44:10.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:10.479 --> 02:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:44:10.920 --> 02:44:10.930 align:start position:0%

02:44:10.930 --> 02:44:16.550 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

02:44:16.550 --> 02:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:18.070 --> 02:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
sorry i'm pausing on unemployment
 
02:44:19.830 --> 02:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
compensation because i think
 
02:44:21.110 --> 02:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
that this should have been budgeted
 
02:44:22.790 --> 02:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
department-wide so i'll check on that
 
02:44:24.469 --> 02:44:24.479 align:start position:0%
and submit a change request on that
 
02:44:24.479 --> 02:44:25.830 align:start position:0%
and submit a change request on that
probably

02:44:25.830 --> 02:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
probably
 
02:44:28.230 --> 02:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
um and that is the end of the accounting
 
02:44:28.240 --> 02:44:30.830 align:start position:0%
um and that is the end of the accounting
units

02:44:30.830 --> 02:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:30.840 --> 02:44:36.230 align:start position:0%
