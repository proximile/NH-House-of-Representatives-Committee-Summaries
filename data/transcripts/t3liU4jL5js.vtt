yes Mr chair so this is for the

enclosure to go over the fuel dispensing
 
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
system a couple years ago we replaced
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
the fuel system at the Portsmouth
 
00:11:41.329 --> 00:11:41.339 align:start position:0%
commercial fish Pier on Pierce Island
 
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
Road in Portsmouth it will be the same
 
00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
style a three-sided building to keep the
 
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:49.860 align:start position:0%
system out of the weather out of the
 
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
environment protected well of lighting
 
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
and uh as well as some outlets and other
 
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
features for
 
00:11:59.630 --> 00:11:59.640 align:start position:0%
um our customers to use
 
00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:01.260 align:start position:0%
um so it's just a basic structure to
 
00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:02.820 align:start position:0%
keep the uh the fuel system out of the
 
00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
weather in the elements
 
00:12:05.389 --> 00:12:05.399 align:start position:0%

I know this is for this purpose but
 
00:12:17.329 --> 00:12:17.339 align:start position:0%
since it is planning at this site uh is
 
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
are you beginning to look into it all
 
00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
the capacity for hydrogen Marine fueling
 
00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
station at this location I know there's
 
00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:28.260 align:start position:0%
some interest in Newington and
 
00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:30.660 align:start position:0%
um you know given that that is a way
 
00:12:32.509 --> 00:12:32.519 align:start position:0%
that some of this industry is beginning
 
00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:34.100 align:start position:0%
to go
 
00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:36.839 align:start position:0%
uh is there I mean is this something you
 
00:12:38.329 --> 00:12:38.339 align:start position:0%
think you should look at in the future
 
00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:40.200 align:start position:0%
maybe study
 
00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh yes sir absolutely
 
00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:44.220 align:start position:0%
um it's uh something that has been
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
brought up
 
00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:47.519 align:start position:0%
um I do not have all the knowledge to
 
00:12:49.129 --> 00:12:49.139 align:start position:0%
speak of it and a lot of the information
 
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
I know director Mark Coney and assistant
 
00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:54.180 align:start position:0%
director um Nichols have had that
 
00:12:56.269 --> 00:12:56.279 align:start position:0%
discussion and uh if you would like I
 
00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
can get some information and get back to
 
00:12:59.210 --> 00:12:59.220 align:start position:0%
you with that
 
00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
if I may follow up yes please follow I
 
00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:03.839 align:start position:0%
guess you know I I obviously I Dr Gino
 
00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:05.700 align:start position:0%
but would you bring back just the
 
00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.009 align:start position:0%
but would you bring back just the
question

00:13:07.009 --> 00:13:07.019 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:13:10.009 --> 00:13:10.019 align:start position:0%
um as to whether they would whether
 
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
within your existing budgets you have
 
00:13:14.449 --> 00:13:14.459 align:start position:0%
funds to do a study or whether you need
 
00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
a legislative act to
 
00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
direct to study and provide some money
 
00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
for it so just if you could ask about
 
00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
you know what you think you're going to
 
00:13:26.269 --> 00:13:26.279 align:start position:0%
need in the future in that area
 
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
so that's something you'd like me to
 
00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
pass along and ask director Marconi and
 
00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:31.320 align:start position:0%

morning the university system has not

issued new money bonds since 2016. we
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
rarely issue debt this project though
 
00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:16.980 align:start position:0%
um and Bill will talk about the project
 
00:16:20.329 --> 00:16:20.339 align:start position:0%
itself in just a minute this project We
 
00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:21.660 align:start position:0%
Believe has
 
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
absolute capacity to fund The Debt
 
00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:26.100 align:start position:0%
Service and will also result in
 
00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
additional net operating revenues over
 
00:16:32.449 --> 00:16:32.459 align:start position:0%
the life the prod the petzl hall has
 
00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
been shuttered
 
00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:36.660 align:start position:0%
three years three years
 
00:16:38.329 --> 00:16:38.339 align:start position:0%
um it needs quite a bit of deferred
 
00:16:40.069 --> 00:16:40.079 align:start position:0%
maintenance it needs a lot of upkeep so
 
00:16:41.449 --> 00:16:41.459 align:start position:0%
it's been shuttered by the university
 
00:16:44.269 --> 00:16:44.279 align:start position:0%
for the past three years it's an iconic
 
00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:46.980 align:start position:0%
building it's right in the heart
 
00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
um of campus in Durham and so the the
 
00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:55.620 align:start position:0%
plan is to completely overhaul the
 
00:16:59.150 --> 00:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
layout of the building to remove the
 
00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:00.610 align:start position:0%
layout of the building to remove the
traditional

00:17:00.610 --> 00:17:00.620 align:start position:0%
traditional
 
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
dorms like I had when I was in college
 
00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:07.620 align:start position:0%
and moved toward a
 
00:17:12.049 --> 00:17:12.059 align:start position:0%
a layout that students prefer now we are
 
00:17:15.470 --> 00:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
over subscribed on in our housing now at
 
00:17:18.409 --> 00:17:18.419 align:start position:0%
UNH because covid's over students are
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
back and we are very confident that
 
00:17:24.169 --> 00:17:24.179 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to to fill these beds so
 
00:17:26.030 --> 00:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
if you'd like Bill can walk through the
 
00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:29.220 align:start position:0%
specifics of the project and so I will
 
00:17:32.950 --> 00:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
and you have in your material there's a
 
00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:35.460 align:start position:0%
deck if you will with pictures and
 
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
schematics and the return on investment
 
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
calculations and the like
 
00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:42.780 align:start position:0%

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:52.500 align:start position:0%
um as Kathy said it's one of our iconic
 
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
residence Halls it's on Main Street it's
 
00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:56.100 align:start position:0%
right in the middle of Durham it's
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
currently uh not occupied it was built
 
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
in 1925 so it's about 100 years old
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
um currently has about 154 beds
 
00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:08.220 align:start position:0%
and we're proposing a complete gut
 
00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:10.280 align:start position:0%
renovation of that building
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
including envelope improvements
 
00:18:15.049 --> 00:18:15.059 align:start position:0%
mechanical systems and as Kathy said
 
00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:16.500 align:start position:0%

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
interior layout as well when we're done
 
00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:22.500 align:start position:0%
we're targeting about 140 beds and
 
00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:25.220 align:start position:0%
looking at what we call a semi-sweet
 
00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:29.340 align:start position:0%
configuration project costs are about 29
 
00:18:32.690 --> 00:18:32.700 align:start position:0%
million all in and we're looking at a
 
00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
design build delivery method starting we
 
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
we selected the contractor and have
 
00:18:40.909 --> 00:18:40.919 align:start position:0%
somewhat started already and we're
 
00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
looking for occupancy at the summer of
 
00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:47.590 align:start position:0%
looking for occupancy at the summer of
2024.

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:51.289 --> 00:18:51.299 align:start position:0%
so existing conditions it hasn't seen a
 
00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
comprehensive renovation since it was
 
00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:56.510 align:start position:0%
comprehensive renovation since it was
built

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
built
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
um it's currently vacant as Kathy said
 
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic we saw the need drop
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
for housing on campus and this was is
 
00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
one of our oldest buildings and in the
 
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
toughest shape we've got mold issues
 
00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:11.700 align:start position:0%
other issues within the building so we
 
00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:14.460 align:start position:0%
decided not to occupy it we still spend
 
00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:16.860 align:start position:0%
about 135 000 a year just to heat it
 
00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
maintain it all of those things there's
 
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
significant deferred maintenance in the
 
00:19:24.049 --> 00:19:24.059 align:start position:0%
project we anticipate this will address
 
00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:26.700 align:start position:0%
about 13.6 million in deferred
 
00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
maintenance and when the Project's done
 
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:31.140 align:start position:0%
we see it generating about 1.9 million
 
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
per year in revenue from housing and
 
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
dining we see the project will will
 
00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:38.340 align:start position:0%
increase retention of our students
 
00:19:40.909 --> 00:19:40.919 align:start position:0%
increase graduation and overall
 
00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
satisfaction with the housing experience
 
00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:44.940 align:start position:0%
at unh
 
00:19:47.690 --> 00:19:47.700 align:start position:0%
so on the next slide on on page three
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
this kind of describes what what we're
 
00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:53.220 align:start position:0%
trying to do here in Hetzel in changing
 
00:19:55.789 --> 00:19:55.799 align:start position:0%
the configuration so what we have right
 
00:19:57.529 --> 00:19:57.539 align:start position:0%
now are many
 
00:19:57.539 --> 00:19:58.130 align:start position:0%
now are many
um

00:19:58.130 --> 00:19:58.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:00.409 --> 00:20:00.419 align:start position:0%
double rooms on what we would call
 
00:20:03.169 --> 00:20:03.179 align:start position:0%
Double loaded corridors so same room on
 
00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
each side and they they access a single
 
00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
bathroom say on a floor we have many of
 
00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
those on campus what we'd like to do is
 
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
change the variety in an Ideal World we
 
00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:16.500 align:start position:0%
would this is the progression that you
 
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
see on
 
00:20:19.789 --> 00:20:19.799 align:start position:0%
um slide three where you might first
 
00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
your student might start in that type of
 
00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:23.580 align:start position:0%
a double room but then they would move
 
00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:25.580 align:start position:0%
into more of a semi-sweet
 
00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
configuration and then variations of
 
00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:31.140 align:start position:0%
singles and triples and then eventually
 
00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:34.140 align:start position:0%
into an apartment style unit we don't by
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
no means do we have that on campus some
 
00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:38.039 align:start position:0%
of our competitors have more of those
 
00:20:40.909 --> 00:20:40.919 align:start position:0%
we're just looking to increase
 
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
um that semi-sweet style offering so
 
00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
that's what we're hoping to gain out of
 
00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
00:20:55.390 --> 00:20:55.400 align:start position:0%
construction costs about 29.1 uh sorry
 
00:20:58.610 --> 00:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
21.1 million with additional soft costs
 
00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
loaded in there with subtotal of 26.4
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
million and we're holding a bid
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
contingency of 2.6 million for a total
 
00:21:09.529 --> 00:21:09.539 align:start position:0%
budget of 29. million 29 million dollars
 
00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:12.780 align:start position:0%
sorry for the total project cost
 
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
on Sly on Slide Five
 
00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
we've got some financial information
 
00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:22.140 align:start position:0%
um so on the left hand side here just
 
00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:24.380 align:start position:0%
shows the progression of the project
 
00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
has positive return
 
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
um right off as soon as it's occupied we
 
00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:33.200 align:start position:0%
show a 20-year payback for the project
 
00:21:36.289 --> 00:21:36.299 align:start position:0%
again it's looking at a 100 Year
 
00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
construction life which is kind of what
 
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
we're looking at now so we see
 
00:21:43.130 --> 00:21:43.140 align:start position:0%
significant return in the future here
 
00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:44.330 align:start position:0%
significant return in the future here
um

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
and again addressing about 13.6 million
 
00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
dollars in deferred maintenance and we
 
00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:53.039 align:start position:0%
show a quick return of at least 1.9
 
00:21:53.039 --> 00:21:54.130 align:start position:0%
show a quick return of at least 1.9
million

00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:54.140 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
per year in incremental revenue for the
 
00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:57.950 align:start position:0%
per year in incremental revenue for the
project

00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
project
 
00:21:59.630 --> 00:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
what's shown in the left hand corner of
 
00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:01.740 align:start position:0%
this slide is just a sense of some of
 
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
the other residence Halls that we have
 
00:22:05.529 --> 00:22:05.539 align:start position:0%
in line that need work as well
 
00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:08.340 align:start position:0%
Hetzel is at the top of the list but
 
00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:10.380 align:start position:0%
there's also Babcock Stoke Williamson
 
00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
Christensen many of these Halls that
 
00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
were built you know mid 60s that also
 
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
need attention in the future
 
00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
and then the last slide essentially just
 
00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:23.700 align:start position:0%
shows the schedule again like I
 
00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
previously mentioned started in the fall
 
00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
of last year and we're looking for
 
00:22:31.549 --> 00:22:31.559 align:start position:0%
completion in July of uh 24 for
 
00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:34.100 align:start position:0%
occupancy that fall
 
00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
thank you questions the university Mr
 
00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:40.919 align:start position:0%
chairman if I might um so folks no I do
 
00:22:43.549 --> 00:22:43.559 align:start position:0%
work at the University of New Hampshire
 
00:22:45.169 --> 00:22:45.179 align:start position:0%
um none of the things we're discussing
 
00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:46.740 align:start position:0%
today will benefit me or my department
 
00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
directly I will be participating and
 
00:22:51.529 --> 00:22:51.539 align:start position:0%
voting thank you thank you for that uh
 
00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:52.980 align:start position:0%
representative include here okay thank
 
00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman could you tell
 
00:22:57.230 --> 00:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
me when was herzl because I can't seem
 
00:22:58.850 --> 00:22:58.860 align:start position:0%
to find her you mentioned about the 60s
 
00:23:00.529 --> 00:23:00.539 align:start position:0%
when was it built so as far as we
 
00:23:03.049 --> 00:23:03.059 align:start position:0%
determine exact age it's built in 1925.
 
00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:05.820 align:start position:0%
oh oh 19 I'm sorry 1925 thank you 100
 
00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:11.700 align:start position:0%
yes I'm sorry senator please thank you
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
Mr was there somebody else first or no
 
00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:16.140 align:start position:0%
go right ahead thank you
 
00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:17.270 align:start position:0%
go right ahead thank you
um

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:21.289 --> 00:23:21.299 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking at uh your um
 
00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:23.400 align:start position:0%
credit opinion
 
00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:26.460 align:start position:0%
and um it seems to me that this would be
 
00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:29.220 align:start position:0%
really rather negligible in terms of the
 
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
overall ratios
 
00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:34.380 align:start position:0%
um yes and we met with Moody's in the
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
fall for our annual
 
00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:40.140 align:start position:0%
um surveillance they call it and our
 
00:23:42.049 --> 00:23:42.059 align:start position:0%
board had already had a first look at
 
00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
this project and we shared with Moody's
 
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
that the Investments that we were
 
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
thinking about potential bonding in the
 
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:50.940 align:start position:0%
future that was all included in the
 
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
conversation and Moody's still improved
 
00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
our Outlook from negative to stable and
 
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
I will add two weeks later put the
 
00:24:05.149 --> 00:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
entire higher ed industry on negative
 
00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:07.620 align:start position:0%
outlook after increasing hours from
 
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:13.190 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
so um what in terms of Energy Efficiency
 
00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:17.340 align:start position:0%
what standard are you going to meet in
 
00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
the building
 
00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:22.620 align:start position:0%
uh typically we shoot for a lead silver
 
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
for the project
 
00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
from an Energy Efficiency standpoint
 
00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:28.559 align:start position:0%
from a lead standard we don't actually
 
00:24:30.649 --> 00:24:30.659 align:start position:0%
do the documentation for for the lead
 
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
standard but that's the the level that
 
00:24:35.529 --> 00:24:35.539 align:start position:0%
we shoot for but we are looking at
 
00:24:38.029 --> 00:24:38.039 align:start position:0%
insulating as part of the project as
 
00:24:40.250 --> 00:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
part of the envelope improvements new
 
00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:43.380 align:start position:0%
roof new windows as well
 
00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:47.340 align:start position:0%
if I made one more so um I I just
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
wondering how you're kind of
 
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
conceptualizing and you're planning on
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
this and the other dorms in the future
 
00:24:54.110 --> 00:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
whether you're thinking about any Net
 
00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:56.340 align:start position:0%
Zero attempts
 
00:24:58.789 --> 00:24:58.799 align:start position:0%
um in terms of your energy supplies and
 
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
insulation and you know just the kinds
 
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
of things people are doing to get a
 
00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:04.620 align:start position:0%
higher standard than the one you've just
 
00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:07.620 align:start position:0%
outlined yeah I mean we're looking at
 
00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:10.620 align:start position:0%
that across campus as well I mean this
 
00:25:12.529 --> 00:25:12.539 align:start position:0%
building is served with from our
 
00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:15.240 align:start position:0%
district heating system on campus that's
 
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
this comes from our co-generation
 
00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.669 align:start position:0%
this comes from our co-generation
facility

00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
facility
 
00:25:19.679 --> 00:25:21.110 align:start position:0%
facility
um

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:22.740 align:start position:0%
so yeah we're looking at all those
 
00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:25.740 align:start position:0%
options and we have we plan to do a
 
00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:27.900 align:start position:0%
decarbonization study as part of our
 
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
master plan process that's upcoming soon
 
00:25:33.409 --> 00:25:33.419 align:start position:0%
to take a look at at you know what's the
 
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
road map that we how we get there to Net
 
00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:38.220 align:start position:0%
Zero in the future
 
00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:39.590 align:start position:0%
Zero in the future
um

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:41.460 align:start position:0%
it involves heat but also involves
 
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
energy generation as you I'm sure you
 
00:25:44.810 --> 00:25:44.820 align:start position:0%
know right now we we generate our energy
 
00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:47.220 align:start position:0%
of landfill gas 100 of our energy comes
 
00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:49.620 align:start position:0%
from the the landfill
 
00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:50.630 align:start position:0%
from the the landfill
um

00:25:50.630 --> 00:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.070 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:53.820 align:start position:0%
you know whether we go with heat pumps
 
00:25:56.210 --> 00:25:56.220 align:start position:0%
in the future at our buildings or
 
00:25:59.210 --> 00:25:59.220 align:start position:0%
whether we look at some other fuel at
 
00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:01.860 align:start position:0%
the cogeneration facility that's all
 
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:03.240 align:start position:0%
things that we need to look at as part
 
00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:05.700 align:start position:0%
of that decarbonation decarbonization
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
plans yes thank you thank you Senator
 
00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:13.620 align:start position:0%
Lang please move to approve cap I lost
 
00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:15.320 align:start position:0%
the number
 
00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:17.460 align:start position:0%
23007 for the University of New
 
00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:18.350 align:start position:0%
23007 for the University of New
Hampshire

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:22.620 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang moves seconded by
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:33.529 --> 00:26:33.539 align:start position:0%
thank you let's try to quickly get
 
00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
through the credit opinion but what is
 
00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:40.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:45.049 --> 00:26:45.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
it's uh page 17 I provided a debt
 
00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:50.230 align:start position:0%
it's uh page 17 I provided a debt
overview

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
overview
 
00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:53.460 align:start position:0%
no no problem I provided a debt overview
 
00:26:56.630 --> 00:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
our Total Bonds outstanding are 331
 
00:26:59.810 --> 00:26:59.820 align:start position:0%
million and you'll see that bar chart on
 
00:27:01.970 --> 00:27:01.980 align:start position:0%
how the progression of The Debt Service
 
00:27:06.049 --> 00:27:06.059 align:start position:0%
gets paid down I'll also mention that as
 
00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:08.940 align:start position:0%
part of this new money should it be
 
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
approved this new money bond issue we're
 
00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
looking to refinance those what we call
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
synthetic fixed those variable rate
 
00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:19.549 align:start position:0%
synthetic fixed those variable rate
bonds

00:27:19.549 --> 00:27:19.559 align:start position:0%
bonds
 
00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:22.980 align:start position:0%
um and so our total bond issue would be
 
00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:25.380 align:start position:0%
closer to a hundred million right those
 
00:27:27.649 --> 00:27:27.659 align:start position:0%
are we refund those bonds and get out of
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
those variable rates
 
00:27:32.029 --> 00:27:32.039 align:start position:0%
um we've worked with our financial
 
00:27:34.450 --> 00:27:34.460 align:start position:0%
advisors we think that could provide a
 
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
small Financial benefit to the
 
00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:40.140 align:start position:0%
university system also when we refinance
 
00:27:42.169 --> 00:27:42.179 align:start position:0%
those bonds we will not extend the
 
00:27:45.049 --> 00:27:45.059 align:start position:0%
maturity dates we will refinance those
 
00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
bonds fixed rate to mature at the same
 
00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:48.900 align:start position:0%
time we're not going to go out another
 
00:27:51.049 --> 00:27:51.059 align:start position:0%
30 years so
 
00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:53.220 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I'm sorry yes I'm sorry
 
00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:56.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you
 
00:27:58.450 --> 00:27:58.460 align:start position:0%
can you explain to me
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
so synthetic we have variable rate bonds
 
00:28:04.610 --> 00:28:04.620 align:start position:0%
there the actual bonds here are variable
 
00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:06.900 align:start position:0%
rate they were issued back in 2005 and
 
00:28:09.289 --> 00:28:09.299 align:start position:0%
2011 before my time
 
00:28:11.570 --> 00:28:11.580 align:start position:0%
then what what happened what then what
 
00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:12.900 align:start position:0%
they do is they have these variable rate
 
00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
bonds but they
 
00:28:17.090 --> 00:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
wrap what's called a swap around those
 
00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:19.500 align:start position:0%
bonds so they behave like they're fixed
 
00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.049 align:start position:0%
bonds so they behave like they're fixed
rate

00:28:21.049 --> 00:28:21.059 align:start position:0%
rate
 
00:28:23.149 --> 00:28:23.159 align:start position:0%
believe you me if I could have refunded
 
00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:25.860 align:start position:0%
those bonds
 
00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:28.620 align:start position:0%
three four years ago look at the effects
 
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
of all-in rates are four three and a
 
00:28:33.049 --> 00:28:33.059 align:start position:0%
half and almost five if I could have
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
refunded those bonds when rates were
 
00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:37.740 align:start position:0%
down at two we would have done that but
 
00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:41.940 align:start position:0%
because there it has this synthetic swap
 
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
wrapped around that variable rate they
 
00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:47.100 align:start position:0%
trade weekly
 
00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:49.500 align:start position:0%
I couldn't get out of it now that rates
 
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
are starting to go up I can get out of
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
these we can reduce the risk there's
 
00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
risk involved in having these variable
 
00:28:59.330 --> 00:28:59.340 align:start position:0%
rate bonds we can reduce the risk and
 
00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:01.740 align:start position:0%
maybe get a small pickup for the
 
00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
University system with with um with some
 
00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:07.260 align:start position:0%
of the rates we're modeling right now
 
00:29:09.049 --> 00:29:09.059 align:start position:0%
four to four and a quarter
 
00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:13.140 align:start position:0%
on a fixed 30 rate 30-year rate but
 
00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:14.820 align:start position:0%
again these aren't going to be 30 or
 
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to keep these maturities
 
00:29:21.769 --> 00:29:21.779 align:start position:0%
10 years 12 years so that's what a
 
00:29:24.409 --> 00:29:24.419 align:start position:0%
synthetic fix is it behaves like a fixed
 
00:29:27.289 --> 00:29:27.299 align:start position:0%
because of this swap but it's not really
 
00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
a fixed
 
00:29:32.110 --> 00:29:32.120 align:start position:0%
briefly we're running time
 
00:29:39.649 --> 00:29:39.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
I think that the clerk is trying to tell
 
00:29:43.730 --> 00:29:43.740 align:start position:0%
you that you need to turn your mics on
 
00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:47.460 align:start position:0%
yeah I apologize thank you thank you sir
 
00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:52.140 align:start position:0%
um the as I understand it the
 
00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:52.730 align:start position:0%
um the as I understand it the
um

00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:52.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:56.029 --> 00:29:56.039 align:start position:0%
the revenue well the dining the dining
 
00:29:58.250 --> 00:29:58.260 align:start position:0%
operation and the housing operations are
 
00:29:59.630 --> 00:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
sort of separate sit on their own
 
00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
bottoms is that correct oh yeah so so
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
the funds that will pay off this debt
 
00:30:07.730 --> 00:30:07.740 align:start position:0%
come not from tuition but rather from
 
00:30:10.010 --> 00:30:10.020 align:start position:0%
housing correct absolutely thank you
 
00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for the question a
 
00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
couple important points none of these
 
00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
bonds are guaranteed by the state
 
00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:16.789 align:start position:0%
bonds are guaranteed by the state
whatsoever

00:30:16.789 --> 00:30:16.799 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
00:30:18.649 --> 00:30:18.659 align:start position:0%
the university system does not have
 
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
authority to issue debt for General
 
00:30:25.789 --> 00:30:25.799 align:start position:0%
obligation from tuition and fees it has
 
00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
authority to issue debt that will be
 
00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
paid back solely by what we call
 
00:30:31.389 --> 00:30:31.399 align:start position:0%
auxiliary Revenue
 
00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
self-funded structures and so this will
 
00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:37.980 align:start position:0%
be these bonds will be paid back by room
 
00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
fees if you will so there would be no
 
00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
impact on tuition at all correct okay
 
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:30:48.049 --> 00:30:48.059 align:start position:0%

with a capital project that was
 
00:31:50.690 --> 00:31:50.700 align:start position:0%
appropriated to the Department of
 
00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:52.140 align:start position:0%
administrative services and that
 
00:31:54.409 --> 00:31:54.419 align:start position:0%
building which is Phil Brook building is
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
now housing
 
00:32:01.250 --> 00:32:01.260 align:start position:0%
for HHS clients or customers and the
 
00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
department wanted to raise the question
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
of should we change who's controlling
 
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
that appropriation this is something
 
00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
that would probably should be taken up
 
00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
in the capital budget so I just wanted
 
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
to bring that forward since we have a
 
00:32:15.409 --> 00:32:15.419 align:start position:0%
mix of senators and house members that
 
00:32:17.149 --> 00:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
will be dealing with the capital budget
 
00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
going forward okay
 
00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
thank you an administrative Services
 
00:32:25.669 --> 00:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
here if there's any specific questions
 
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any questions
 
00:32:29.810 --> 00:32:29.820 align:start position:0%
administrative services
 
00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:31.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:35.640 align:start position:0%
the last item here is uh setting a date
 
00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:37.919 align:start position:0%
for the next meeting
 
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
um for the new members it's typically on
 
00:32:42.649 --> 00:32:42.659 align:start position:0%
a quarterly fashion unless some item
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
comes up in an emergency that we need to
 
00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:47.700 align:start position:0%
meet earlier I'm going to suggest at
 
00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
this time that we meet on May 26 with
 
00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
the same times and I believe that's a
 
00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:56.990 align:start position:0%
the same times and I believe that's a
Friday

00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
so unless uh Senators have an issue with
 
00:33:03.430 --> 00:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
the day please get back to us and uh
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
Senator gray the only question is that
 
00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
late in the month whether it interferes
 
00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
with fiscal or rules or whatever
 
00:33:18.409 --> 00:33:18.419 align:start position:0%
so and my calendar doesn't go out that
 
00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:20.940 align:start position:0%
far right now for for those committees
 
00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:21.850 align:start position:0%
far right now for for those committees
so

00:33:21.850 --> 00:33:21.860 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:26.029 --> 00:33:26.039 align:start position:0%
that could be a problem
 
00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:28.620 align:start position:0%
if I might uh chairman McConkey is uh
 
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
with fiscal you probably would be fine
 
00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:31.740 align:start position:0%
because typically that meeting starts at
 
00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:34.559 align:start position:0%
10 if it is on that day fiscal has
 
00:33:36.409 --> 00:33:36.419 align:start position:0%
tended to be scheduled the third Friday
 
00:33:38.509 --> 00:33:38.519 align:start position:0%
of the month
 
00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
yes if I may know yes Mr chairman it is
 
00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
the Friday before Memorial Day weekend
 
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
and uh okay so I'm not I'm with you Mr
 
00:33:54.950 --> 00:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
chair I mean I may be out of town but I
 
00:33:57.710 --> 00:33:57.720 align:start position:0%
know others if others uh sounds like a
 
00:34:00.669 --> 00:34:00.679 align:start position:0%
wonderful day to have that meeting
 
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
it's all good with me if if it becomes
 
00:34:05.389 --> 00:34:05.399 align:start position:0%
an issue
 
00:34:07.009 --> 00:34:07.019 align:start position:0%
um we'll certainly discuss that and if
 
00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:09.599 align:start position:0%
we have to move it we will all right any
 
00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
any further business before this
 
00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:12.770 align:start position:0%
any further business before this
committee

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:12.780 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
seeing none we'll call to a close this
