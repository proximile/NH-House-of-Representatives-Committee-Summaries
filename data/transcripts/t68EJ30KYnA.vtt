this one because we knew we needed
 
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
another amendment okay so uh
 
00:12:52.629 --> 00:12:52.639 align:start position:0%

second by representative batusex moves
 
00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
off the pass
 
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
1606 six
 
00:13:10.949 --> 00:13:10.959 align:start position:0%
this amendment numbers are climbing
 
00:13:14.550 --> 00:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
other committees are really busy okay
 
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
um so in discussion on the amendment
 
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
this is the uh tyler this is the
 
00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:13:31.829 --> 00:13:31.839 align:start position:0%
the other important thing is is that it
 
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
still did what the other amendment did
 
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:35.680 align:start position:0%
which was to remove section one of the
 
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
bill so if you have it in front of you
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
you'll see
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
it says line five says amend the bill by
 
00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:41.990 align:start position:0%
it says line five says amend the bill by
replacing

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
replacing
 
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
all after the enacting clause that's
 
00:13:45.509 --> 00:13:45.519 align:start position:0%
really important because that basically
 
00:13:45.519 --> 00:13:46.150 align:start position:0%
really important because that basically
says

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:48.720 align:start position:0%

everybody understands what we're voting
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%

as representative abramson points out we
 
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
don't like it when the senate does that
 
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
to us
 
00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
no we don't like that but i guess it
 
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
will cope
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:44.240 align:start position:0%

expedient to legislate

um i assume all of you got taylor
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
caswell's letter
 
00:19:55.909 --> 00:19:55.919 align:start position:0%
and that this was obviously a very
 
00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
obscure situation
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
and the way the main street program had
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
to run
 
00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:02.559 align:start position:0%
but going forward there's plenty of
 
00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
money in any business whether you're old
 
00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
new or
 
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
just open can take advantage of the you
 
00:20:09.669 --> 00:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
know whatever the new rules would be
 
00:20:09.679 --> 00:20:10.549 align:start position:0%
know whatever the new rules would be
federal

00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:10.559 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh so representative ben do you have a
 
00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:13.909 align:start position:0%
uh so representative ben do you have a
question

00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:13.919 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
more comment uh actually i have a
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
comment first of all thank you for
 
00:20:19.669 --> 00:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
for reaching out to taylor caswell i
 
00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
realized i had an obscure question that
 
00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
i that i put out to you
 
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
i'm getting a message i've just recently
 
00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
got a message from one of the sponsors
 
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
and it says the bill is still relevant
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
there may be more discretionary fed
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
funds coming
 
00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
and the state may put them in the main
 
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
street program
 
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
in that case we need newer business to
 
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
be eligible for the funds
 
00:20:41.669 --> 00:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
also the business that we created post
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
may 26
 
00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
2019 are now 12 to 18 months older
 
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
when original funds come so they will be
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
in the same position of businesses when
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
the first round of money came
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
so in essence i'm getting a message from
 
00:20:57.430 --> 00:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
the sponsor that this is probably still
 
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
something that we should vote on
 
00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:01.919 align:start position:0%
as one of the co-sponsors i believe let
 
00:21:04.149 --> 00:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
me look who who who is it
 
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
you're getting it from uh representative
 
00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.750 align:start position:0%
you're getting it from uh representative
macbeth

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
macbeth
 
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
macbeth okay well okay
 
00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
um what taylor said i don't have her as
 
00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
a sponsor
 
00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:22.149 --> 00:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry yes are you sorry i believe
 
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
she may be on and since we had a
 
00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
suspended testimony would you like to
 
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
invite her to clarify what i just read
 
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
to you
 
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
oh that'd be great i don't really
 
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
want to do that because then it's then
 
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
when really it's taking testament i i
 
00:21:38.549 --> 00:21:38.559 align:start position:0%
i'm uh rebecca i hope you understand but
 
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
but um i
 
00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
i i this is this is for this exact
 
00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
session this is not appropriate
 
00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:50.870 --> 00:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
well we've had a lot of questions the
 
00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
only time we ever have gone
 
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
to allow someone from the public to
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
speak is usually
 
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
someone from the department or someone
 
00:21:59.830 --> 00:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
who has a specific uh question in terms
 
00:22:00.549 --> 00:22:00.559 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
as a as a co-sponsor of the bill that
 
00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
yeah she wants to see a bill passed and
 
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
i understand that
 
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
but then we're going to get into
 
00:22:09.669 --> 00:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
conversation back and forth about it
 
00:22:12.149 --> 00:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
and i i really i really don't want to do
 
00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:13.039 align:start position:0%
that today
 
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
um i'm in all due respect rebecca i mean
 
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
becky you know i would never
 
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
you know it's not about you it's about
 
00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
it's just the process
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
and um that but taylor cosmo said it
 
00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
very specifically is that
 
00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
in any new money that's coming down is
 
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
it won't be the main street program it
 
00:22:33.830 --> 00:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
will be determined by the
 
00:22:36.149 --> 00:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
the requirements of whatever the federal
 
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
strings and as we've learned already
 
00:22:39.909 --> 00:22:39.919 align:start position:0%
is that there will be a lot of strings
 
00:22:42.149 --> 00:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
attached to any money that's coming down
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
and their business is going to be
 
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
following along that
 
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
but uh but that it's not the main street
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
program is done and over with
 
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
so um you are you all said connie are
 
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
you still have your hand up or
 
00:22:58.470 --> 00:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
um no um i just want to clarify why i
 
00:22:59.909 --> 00:22:59.919 align:start position:0%
asked for that it was because we
 
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
suspended the testimony we didn't
 
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
i thought we had not completed the
 
00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
testimony and that it would be fair
 
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
since we had not completed the testimony
 
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
to allow someone else who wished to
 
00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.430 align:start position:0%
to allow someone else who wished to
testify

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
testify
 
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
so that's hearing from the hearing yeah
 
00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
we defended it
 
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
we were going to follow up on my
 
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
question to taylor and i don't know
 
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
that's the exact session
 
00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
yeah that's not a hearing that was the
 
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
exact session was it yeah you're great
 
00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
ended the exact exact session on that
 
00:23:27.270 --> 00:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
i'm taking action on that bill
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
so that you could hear directly from you
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
know taylor himself and what um
 
00:23:33.909 --> 00:23:33.919 align:start position:0%
whether the main seat program uh would
 
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
ever be used or
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
you know i mean frankly this is just
 
00:23:38.789 --> 00:23:38.799 align:start position:0%
feel-good legislation
 
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
i mean i you know i know people want to
 
00:23:41.909 --> 00:23:41.919 align:start position:0%
pass something i want to know
 
00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
and people want to say oh we did
 
00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
something for but this doesn't this
 
00:23:48.549 --> 00:23:48.559 align:start position:0%
it just it says urges it's not even
 
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
it's not even a mandate it's like a
 
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
you know as you all know what i think of
 
00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:56.630 align:start position:0%
you know as you all know what i think of
resolutions

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
resolutions
 
00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
and this is just a resolution really but
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
anyway representative bart uh bartlett
 
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
you have your hand up yes
 
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:06.240 align:start position:0%
yes um i mean we had 68 in favor of this
 
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
with nobody opposed
 
00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
we passed feel good legislation all the
 
00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:10.870 align:start position:0%
we passed feel good legislation all the
time

00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
i don't see i i don't understand why
 
00:24:17.909 --> 00:24:17.919 align:start position:0%
this would not be a a good bill to pass
 
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
because it does also
 
00:24:22.789 --> 00:24:22.799 align:start position:0%
um signal our intention to those that
 
00:24:22.799 --> 00:24:23.110 align:start position:0%
um signal our intention to those that
are

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:24:24.789 --> 00:24:24.799 align:start position:0%
setting up you know if there is no money
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
left in this program to setting up the
 
00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:28.400 align:start position:0%
next program
 
00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
this this affects constituents
 
00:24:33.909 --> 00:24:33.919 align:start position:0%
it doesn't this this isn't this is a
 
00:24:36.149 --> 00:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
meaningless piece of legislation it did
 
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
all it does is
 
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
urge it doesn't do anything
 
00:24:42.789 --> 00:24:42.799 align:start position:0%
and and and why why do we want to
 
00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
clutter up our statutes with something
 
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
that doesn't do anything
 
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
oh come on we don't have we have lots of
 
00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.350 align:start position:0%
oh come on we don't have we have lots of
cluttered

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
cluttered
 
00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh not not with my vote i have i don't
 
00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
know if you want to pick you'll find
 
00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:53.990 align:start position:0%
know if you want to pick you'll find
somewhere

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
where i voted for clutter but uh you
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
know me personally i
 
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
i i want to see less laws not more
 
00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
and i certainly don't want to see things
 
00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
that urges you know something to happen
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
when when obviously the the governor's
 
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
office and every and
 
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
everybody was conscious of what happened
 
00:25:12.149 --> 00:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
understand that the main street program
 
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
had had a shortcoming
 
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
because it was based upon having to do a
 
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
look back
 
00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
but you know having that ever happen
 
00:25:22.149 --> 00:25:22.159 align:start position:0%
again i just don't think it happened but
 
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
i don't know you can vote
 
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
any way you want to vote so um
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
representative mr chairman
 
00:25:33.029 --> 00:25:33.039 align:start position:0%
mr chairman um i'm i'm confused are we
 
00:25:33.039 --> 00:25:33.750 align:start position:0%
mr chairman um i'm i'm confused are we
effectively

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me like we're reopening
 
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
debate on this or
 
00:25:39.029 --> 00:25:39.039 align:start position:0%
are we or is this just a question of
 
00:25:39.039 --> 00:25:39.909 align:start position:0%
are we or is this just a question of
process

00:25:39.909 --> 00:25:39.919 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
i thought we're in executive session we
 
00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
are an exec session and
 
00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
i i i allow each person to speak
 
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
um and as long as it's speaking towards
 
00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:50.799 align:start position:0%
the bill then then it's appropriate
 
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
it sounds like a substantive discussion
 
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
on the merits of the bill though am i
 
00:25:56.549 --> 00:25:56.559 align:start position:0%
mistaken no that that's what we do in
 
00:25:59.110 --> 00:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
the exact session
 
00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
okay so so thank you good try
 
00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
but uh but no this is this is the merits
 
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
of the bill and if they
 
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
you know if they think that that they
 
00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
want this
 
00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
legislation to pass then they have their
 
00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
entitled to their opinion
 
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
so uh is anybody else who hasn't had a
 
00:26:19.269 --> 00:26:19.279 align:start position:0%
first chance to speak want to speak
 
00:26:21.430 --> 00:26:21.440 align:start position:0%
otherwise i'll go back
 
00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
to the same all right representing van
 
00:26:25.909 --> 00:26:25.919 align:start position:0%
houghton you have your hand up again
 
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
i do and my final comment is simply that
 
00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:29.190 align:start position:0%
i do and my final comment is simply that
um

00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
the pandemic has thrown us such a
 
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
curveball in so many ways
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
that if we leave a door open for
 
00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
potential problems
 
00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
i don't think there's anything wrong
 
00:26:38.390 --> 00:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
with that especially when we're talking
 
00:26:39.269 --> 00:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
about business
 
00:26:41.669 --> 00:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
and we're talking about a whole host of
 
00:26:43.909 --> 00:26:43.919 align:start position:0%
uh of sponsors and co-sponsors

00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:50.230 align:start position:0%

okay and representative bartlett
 
00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i'm a little
 
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
confused about where this part
 
00:27:06.149 --> 00:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
is that you're talking about urging this
 
00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
says to the extent permitted by federal
 
00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:08.310 align:start position:0%
says to the extent permitted by federal
law

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:08.320 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
federal relief funds received by the
 
00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire to assist
 
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
businesses affected by coveted pandemic
 
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
shall be shall be made available to
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
businesses that were not eligible for
 
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
grants in the main street relief
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
fund this this is a shell
 
00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
it's so saying that that it uh well
 
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
again if that if you want to just leave
 
00:27:30.789 --> 00:27:30.799 align:start position:0%
it on that thing
 
00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
that would mean is that
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
there cannot be a main street program
 
00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
if they use the same requirements right
 
00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
so i'm saying is
 
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
the main street program is done it's
 
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
over with it's gone
 
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
the federal government is coming down
 
00:27:48.149 --> 00:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
with new programs so there's no
 
00:27:52.149 --> 00:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:54.789 --> 00:27:54.799 align:start position:0%
it's done it's over with you know you're
 
00:27:56.389 --> 00:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
that's why i mean it's just you know
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
you know urging when i say urging is
 
00:28:00.549 --> 00:28:00.559 align:start position:0%
that you know hopefully
 
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh you know that that you would
 
00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
because i think it's a mistake that they
 
00:28:06.549 --> 00:28:06.559 align:start position:0%
use the word main street they should
 
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
have said
 
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
is that any any programs make sure that
 
00:28:12.549 --> 00:28:12.559 align:start position:0%
to the full extent of the federal
 
00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
statute which is
 
00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
true no matter what now evidently the
 
00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
federal statute didn't make requirements
 
00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
about how we were going to give out that
 
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
main street money
 
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
but under my understanding is now that
 
00:28:27.669 --> 00:28:27.679 align:start position:0%
the new federal program the new federal
 
00:28:27.679 --> 00:28:28.230 align:start position:0%
the new federal program the new federal
money

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
there's tons of strings attached there's
 
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
tons of guidance
 
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
that's being given about what you can
 
00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:35.360 align:start position:0%
spend the money on
 
00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
and so i don't i'm sorry i don't read it
 
00:28:39.750 --> 00:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
that way so i'm going to have to oppose
 
00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
the um otp representative abramson
 
00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
you might want to check your microphone
 
00:28:59.669 --> 00:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
too you're your speaker but yeah i'm
 
00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:00.799 align:start position:0%
right here
 
00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:10.149 --> 00:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:24.149 --> 00:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:28.149 --> 00:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
you have two microphones or just the one
 
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
there's one in the room so it looks like
 
00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:31.590 align:start position:0%
there's one in the room so it looks like

00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%

00:29:59.190 --> 00:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
go over to the computer and unmute
 
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:03.360 align:start position:0%

uh that's an actual question that's a
 
00:31:23.509 --> 00:31:23.519 align:start position:0%

we definitely i know i know we have one
uh

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:45.510 --> 00:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
one of our liquor bills uh oh the uber
 
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
the uber or the doordash bill
 
00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
593 yeah that that one they amended it
 
00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.030 align:start position:0%
593 yeah that that one they amended it
by

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
putting putting it back to 60 days upon
 
00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.030 align:start position:0%
putting putting it back to 60 days upon
passage

00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
passage
 
00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
and and that was by a request of
 
00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
uber eats that they need they need the
 
00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
time to
 
00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
yeah get the contracts out and have
 
00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
contra you know
 
00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
so let's get my violin out yeah
 
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
that's a tiny one yeah
 
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
so i i was just gonna i'd concur with
 
00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:17.750 align:start position:0%
so i i was just gonna i'd concur with
that

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
and there's no reason to to rock the
 
00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
boat on that one um
 
00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
so but what uh when i get
 
00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
bills that um uh will ask for uh
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
if there are senate amendments to them i
 
00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
will send out a notice to everyone to
 
00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
let them know
 
00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
and and for you to you know let me know
 
00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:36.079 align:start position:0%
what you think
 
00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
how does everybody feel about that 593
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
changing it back to 60 days
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
right but it's a it's a new restriction
 
00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:49.430 align:start position:0%
right but it's a it's a new restriction
to

00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
take effect historically we've always
 
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
allowed 60 days when there's any new
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
limitation restrictions
 
00:35:58.069 --> 00:35:58.079 align:start position:0%
you find the the doordash and these
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
others have to respond to that
 
00:36:03.109 --> 00:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
you know the rule has to go out yeah but
 
00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
they're taking it
 
00:36:05.589 --> 00:36:05.599 align:start position:0%
they're taking advantage of these people
 
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
right now and you're giving them 60 more
 
00:36:08.790 --> 00:36:08.800 align:start position:0%
days to do that
 
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
well but they got to get the contracts
 
00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
out so there is theoretically there
 
00:36:13.829 --> 00:36:13.839 align:start position:0%
there's a chicken in the egg problem
 
00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
there with these contracts where we're
 
00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:16.069 align:start position:0%
there with these contracts where we're
mandating

00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:16.079 align:start position:0%
mandating
 
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
and we have a contract you know you know
 
00:36:19.589 --> 00:36:19.599 align:start position:0%
and no contract gets
 
00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
negotiated overnight to have
 
00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
so so but yeah so anita would did you
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
have i see your hands up
 
00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:30.400 align:start position:0%

if that's
 
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
john could you send those those lists

00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:56.400 align:start position:0%
so jason jason do you want to be on one
 
00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
of one of the divisions
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh if you need me go ahead okay i'll
 
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
i'll let me see what i have to do and
 
00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
then the only thing is i have is
 
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:16.160 align:start position:0%
jane's the only one i have left uh loose
 
00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
but um so but so it looks like i'm up
 
00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
i'll put her on liquor
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't have a sense of where her
 
00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
um like her would be
 
00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's good anyways because her
 
00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
her father used to have a license
 
00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
okay uh yeah so that that's
 
00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:32.870 align:start position:0%
okay uh yeah so that that's
representative

00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
yes connie yeah i just have two points
 
00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
one on the concurrence
 
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
for the ubereats um i i still agree i
 
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
mean the situation would not have
 
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
existed without their
 
00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
their doing without their stepping up
 
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
without any kind of a contract
 
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
and so i do object to concurrence and
 
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
secondly am i on
 
00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:53.620 align:start position:0%
laker uh
 
00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:55.270 align:start position:0%
laker uh
[Music]

00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
yes i have you on liquor thank you but
 
00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
again i do want to
 
00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
object to the concurrence right okay
 
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:06.640 align:start position:0%
uh so uh
 
00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
henry vayu is texting me and says that
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
um we are
 
00:39:16.230 --> 00:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
uh that the restaurants are okay well i
 
00:39:18.069 --> 00:39:18.079 align:start position:0%
i i henry i understand that you guys
 
00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
would be okay with the 60 days
 
00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
but but yeah so he's saying that the
 
00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
restaurants are okay with the 68s now i
 
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
get it no
 
00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
dirt okay i gotta understand so he's
 
00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
saying that the people who want this
 
00:39:30.069 --> 00:39:30.079 align:start position:0%
bill which is the restaurants
 
00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
they were okay with the 60 days because
 
00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
they they certainly because you remember
 
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
it takes two sides to negotiate a
 
00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:35.910 align:start position:0%
it takes two sides to negotiate a
contract

00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
contract
 
00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
and the last thing they want to do is
 
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
have the gun to their heads about
 
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
signing that contract
 
00:39:42.069 --> 00:39:42.079 align:start position:0%
sooner than they want to so it makes
 
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
sense that both sides would
 
00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
okay if the restaurants are okay with it
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
yes henry says he's just texting me
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
i'd withdraw my um this is a great real
 
00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:51.109 align:start position:0%
i'd withdraw my um this is a great real
world

00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
world
 
00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
certainly is trying to keep track of it
 
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
all right my objection stands
 
00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
i think it's because i'm thinking of the
 
00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
small restaurants that don't have much
 
00:39:59.349 --> 00:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
