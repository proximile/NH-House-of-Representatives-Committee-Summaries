comments sure so SB the language from SB
 
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
453 was amended by um the Senate that
 
00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
language was put into HB
 
00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 align:start position:0%
463 uh and that ended up dying in
 
00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
Committee of
 
00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 align:start position:0%
conference we did speak to um deputy
 
00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 align:start position:0%
secretary of state Hennessy concerning
 
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
this uh this bill and the funds that are
 
00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
needed for the election portal and she
 
00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 align:start position:0%
stated that they have access to hop Hava
 
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
funds to um build the election portal so
 
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:28.159 align:start position:0%
needed further discussions from the
 
00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 align:start position:0%
committee yes thank you very much Mr
 
00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:35.439 align:start position:0%
chair um so I looked into this some more
 
00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
myself um and I did also talk to um Miss
 
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 align:start position:0%
Hennessy about it they did feel that
 
00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
there was access to have a funds but she
 
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 align:start position:0%
also said that there's going to be a big
 
00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 align:start position:0%
issue with accessible voting machines
 
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
she's not sure how that'll play out
 
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 align:start position:0%
whether they'll have to um whether
 
00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
they'll have to support the towns
 
00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 align:start position:0%
because it's going to be expensive
 
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
and on balance um my conversation with
 
00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
her was that she would be supportive you
 
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
know of course the devil's in the
 
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
details but the secretary of state would
 
00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 align:start position:0%
be supportive of reintroduction of a
 
00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 align:start position:0%
bill to establish the uh the portal and
 
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 align:start position:0%
to make sure that when it's reintroduced
 
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
it's uh combined with the appropriation
 
00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 align:start position:0%
amount that was
 
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 align:start position:0%
$450,000 that was in s453
 
00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
so because the house supported the
 
00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
passage of the electronic portal and
 
00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
basically supported s SP
 
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
453 despite there was confusion about
 
00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 align:start position:0%
funding and amendments I personally
 
00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 align:start position:0%
would like to recommend that we
 
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
recommend this for further legislation
 
00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 align:start position:0%
when combined with the portal and the
 
00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199 align:start position:0%
appropriation in the same Bill thank you
 
00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the committee
 
00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:01.469 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the committee
represent

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:01.479 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
McGuire thank you Mr chairman yeah I'm
 
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
I'm somewhat of the opposite um opinion
 
00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 align:start position:0%
here because the the key thing from the
 
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's point of view is
 
00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
the permission to make these changes to
 
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
the voter registration system and this
 
00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:20.759 align:start position:0%
particular bill is just a straight up
 
00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:22.710 align:start position:0%
particular bill is just a straight up
allocate

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
allocate
 
00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
$450,000 for
 
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
the appropriation it isn't the
 
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
permission to do the job
 
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
because what the Secretary of State's
 
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
office said to me was that they may have
 
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
Hava funds right and and so the key
 
00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:40.759 align:start position:0%
thing to them is just the permission
 
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
from the legislature to do the job which
 
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
was the other bill that didn't pass
 
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 align:start position:0%
right so I would say this one which is
 
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 align:start position:0%
just straight up uh allocating of
 
00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:56.479 align:start position:0%
money um isn't needed at this time
 
00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
and you
 
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
know money's is going to be tight we
 
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
think next next uh year and so um this
 
00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:08.759 align:start position:0%
could easily uh we we really don't need
 
00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 align:start position:0%
this thank
 
00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 align:start position:0%
you Bieber well thank you um I mean we
 
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
don't have to go too far down the road
 
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
on this but I think in the process of
 
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
interim study when you're recommending
 
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
further legislation you don't have to be
 
00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:26.039 align:start position:0%
strictly limited to just what this
 
00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
particular Bill did it doesn't have to
 
00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 align:start position:0%
be the exact language so the the
 
00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
committee could recommend further
 
00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:35.919 align:start position:0%
legislation that included an electronic
 
00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:38.479 align:start position:0%
portal with the necessary um
 
00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
appropriation so that was my thought and
 
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
I would make a motion to that effect
 
00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
okay we have a motion for a further
 
00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:51.639 align:start position:0%

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:55.360 align:start position:0%

the original language that um bring it a
 
00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
little closer to the

sure there was one minor change compared
 
00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:20.920 align:start position:0%

00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
funds essentially into New Hampshire
 
00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:39.240 align:start position:0%

1564 that bill uh was passed and signed
 
00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
into law House Bill 1595 on the other

hand um had an amendment in division

recommended ought to pass with Amendment
 
00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:47.240 align:start position:0%
but on the house floor it was
 
00:14:49.870 --> 00:14:49.880 align:start position:0%
uh uh referred for interim study so
 
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
that's why the bill is before you now so
 
00:14:54.189 --> 00:14:54.199 align:start position:0%

I could make a motion Mr
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
chair representative Mooney I would move
 
00:15:06.990 --> 00:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 1595 that it not be
 
00:15:09.629 --> 00:15:09.639 align:start position:0%

00:15:20.749 --> 00:15:20.759 align:start position:0%

00:15:23.629 --> 00:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative H yes
 
00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:27.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I can't support that motion um
 
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
we had and PID for a report relative to
 
00:15:32.749 --> 00:15:32.759 align:start position:0%
child support guidelines at the New
 
00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:35.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire level the report was issued in
 
00:15:36.749 --> 00:15:36.759 align:start position:0%
December of
 
00:15:39.509 --> 00:15:39.519 align:start position:0%
2022 we spent over $100,000 on that
 
00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:41.800 align:start position:0%
report I have a copy in front of me part
 
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
of this stems
 
00:15:46.829 --> 00:15:46.839 align:start position:0%
from what 1595 attempted to do that the
 
00:15:48.829 --> 00:15:48.839 align:start position:0%
bill that ultimately passed did not
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
which is to set appropriate guidelines
 
00:15:53.189 --> 00:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
and statute relative
 
00:15:53.199 --> 00:15:54.710 align:start position:0%
and statute relative
to

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:15:58.710 --> 00:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
parent parental guidelines over number
 
00:16:00.269 --> 00:16:00.279 align:start position:0%
of hours with the kids and a bunch of
 
00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
other things in statute we need to do
 
00:16:06.189 --> 00:16:06.199 align:start position:0%
that we have allowed the judges um a
 
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
greater degree of um discretion and that
 
00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
has created a bunch of turmoil with
 
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
families I think we need to take a look
 
00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:17.240 align:start position:0%
at these guidelines and follow that so I
 
00:16:19.309 --> 00:16:19.319 align:start position:0%
would recommend that we recommend this
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
bill for further um
 
00:16:25.350 --> 00:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
legislation okay but the motion before
 
00:16:28.309 --> 00:16:28.319 align:start position:0%

239 is the last one we have the use of
 
00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
harm reduction
 
00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:29.480 align:start position:0%
Services it came out
 
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
um Mr Ripple will give us the
 
00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
explanations yes uh Senate Bill 239
 
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
relative to the use of harm reduction
 
00:19:38.669 --> 00:19:38.679 align:start position:0%
Services came to finance uh after
 
00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:39.880 align:start position:0%
passing the house with the floor
 
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
Amendment specifically relative to the
 
00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:44.440 align:start position:0%
definition of harm reduction and after
 
00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
division 3 held several work sessions on
 
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
that definition as well as the scope of
 
00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
the bill uh the finance committee
 
00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
ultimately recommended refer for interim
 
00:19:57.149 --> 00:19:57.159 align:start position:0%
study and that's how it came out of the
 
00:19:59.950 --> 00:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
house okay
 
00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:03.080 align:start position:0%
anybody in division three want to make
 
00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
any further comment representative Hall
 
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
is Rec is that representative Stringham
 
00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:10.559 align:start position:0%
I'm not recognizing whose light is on
 
00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
there yeah if you remember this bill was
 
00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:15.400 align:start position:0%
um um you Advanced from the Senate uh
 
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
did pass with a strong uh majority uh
 
00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:23.480 align:start position:0%
before it came to finance um I think uh
 
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
the the the issues that led to a one
 
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
vote uh uh interim study
 
00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:32.360 align:start position:0%
are are issues that should continue to
 
00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
be uh studied and addressed in in future
 
00:20:39.549 --> 00:20:39.559 align:start position:0%
legislation uh um you know was it was
 
00:20:41.669 --> 00:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
clearly an important issue uh to be
 
00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:44.360 align:start position:0%
addressed by this legislative body and
 
00:20:46.590 --> 00:20:46.600 align:start position:0%
uh one that we should enthusiastically
 
00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:49.400 align:start position:0%
encourage the next uh legislature to
 
00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
address and uh therefore I put forward a
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
motion to uh recommend um legislation uh
 
00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
U be Advanced um with with the next
 
00:21:02.149 --> 00:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
banial recommended for further
 
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
legislation by representative Stringham
 
00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
is there a second second representative
 
00:21:09.909 --> 00:21:09.919 align:start position:0%
priest um my recollection is that it
 
00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:12.440 align:start position:0%
needed a lot of work on what the
 
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
reduction of harm means and it wasn't
 
00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:17.919 align:start position:0%
clearly defined and I think there are
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
several other states each one had a
 
00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
different definition that used that term
 
00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
so it really needs to be more clearly
 
00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
defined so the motion before us is
 
00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:32.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:35.909 --> 00:21:35.919 align:start position:0%
study clerical call any representative
 
00:21:39.029 --> 00:21:39.039 align:start position:0%
Maguire thank you can anybody tell me um
 
00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
is there much of a fiscal note on this
 
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
bill Mr
 
00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
Ripple there should be no general fund
 
00:21:50.029 --> 00:21:50.039 align:start position:0%
impact because the bill requires the
 
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
department to establish and administer
 
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
Statewide access points for substance
 
00:21:56.669 --> 00:21:56.679 align:start position:0%
use Services quote with the availability
 
00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%
of sufficient Federal funding so it's
 
00:22:00.269 --> 00:22:00.279 align:start position:0%
conent upon Federal funding rather than
 
00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
State funding thank you any further
 
00:22:05.549 --> 00:22:05.559 align:start position:0%

that came to testify in our steady
 
00:22:19.269 --> 00:22:19.279 align:start position:0%

00:22:23.230 --> 00:22:23.240 align:start position:0%
subject will come up again um depending
 
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
