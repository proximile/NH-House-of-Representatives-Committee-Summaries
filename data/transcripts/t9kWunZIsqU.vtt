papoi welcome thank you Mr chairman
 
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
Daniel popovic Miller I I represent
 
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 17 and I am a co-sponsor of
 
00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
the Right to Work bill let me start my
 
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
testimony by answering a question that
 
00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 align:start position:0%
I've often heard uh in the previous
 
00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:31.639 align:start position:0%
testimonies why wouldn't everyone want a
 
00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:34.759 align:start position:0%
union job I don't want a union job
 
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 align:start position:0%
because I do not agree that somebody
 
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 align:start position:0%
should be paid more and be given first
 
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
choice of work assignments because
 
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
they've been there for longer and they
 
00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
have seniority I don't want a union job
 
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
because I want to be able to negotiate
 
00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
my own contract to suit my own personal
 
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
preferences instead of having to agree
 
00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 align:start position:0%
to a one-size fits all contract
 
00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:55.479 align:start position:0%
negotiated by the union I was also born
 
00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 align:start position:0%
and raised in a communist country I do
 
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 align:start position:0%
not take it kindly to being forced to do
 
00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 align:start position:0%
something I do not willingly choose to
 
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
do there are other reasons but we only
 
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:06.680 align:start position:0%
have so much
 
00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 align:start position:0%
time now I do not want a union job for
 
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
myself but I also do not want to impose
 
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
my beliefs on others I respect the
 
00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 align:start position:0%
choices of people who want one and would
 
00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:18.199 align:start position:0%
never prevent them from choosing to be
 
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
in a union if that is what is best for
 
00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
them the bill is about protecting
 
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
everyone's right to make their own
 
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:27.880 align:start position:0%
choices we all know what's best for us
 
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:29.880 align:start position:0%
better than a government official or a
 
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
union leader this bill supports the
 
00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:34.919 align:start position:0%
right of workers to voluntarily organize
 
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 align:start position:0%
in Union it just protects each worker
 
00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:39.759 align:start position:0%
civil rights and freedom of Association
 
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
by prohibiting the payment of union dues
 
00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:44.599 align:start position:0%
from being a required condition of
 
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
employment for the record CW CWA versus
 
00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
be diminished but did not eliminate the
 
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
right of unions to collect fees from
 
00:06:55.869 --> 00:06:55.879 align:start position:0%
everyone in the workplace regardless of
 
00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:57.800 align:start position:0%
whether they wanted to join a union or
 
00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:00.039 align:start position:0%
not the court role that the collection
 
00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
and disbursement of agency's fees for
 
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
purposes other than collective
 
00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
bargaining violated the rights but it
 
00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
did allow the unions to collect fees
 
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
from member from non-members from for
 
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
for collective
 
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
bargaining and to come to the core of my
 
00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:17.199 align:start position:0%
testimony one expression that I've heard
 
00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure you'll hear again and again
 
00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:22.120 align:start position:0%
was Free Riders who supposedly take
 
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
advantage of a federal law that forces
 
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
Union to represent all workers at a
 
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
company whether or not they pay union
 
00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 align:start position:0%
dues treat unions unfairly I believe
 
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
that every person who said that believes
 
00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
it is true but unfortunately that is
 
00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:39.919 align:start position:0%
simply not the case federal law does not
 
00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
obligate unions to represent non-members
 
00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:45.080 align:start position:0%
under the National Labor Relations Act
 
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:47.240 align:start position:0%
unions can choose to represent only
 
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
their dues paying members under a
 
00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
members only contract unions are only
 
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
required to represent all workers if
 
00:07:58.029 --> 00:07:58.039 align:start position:0%
unions choose to take on exclusive
 
00:07:59.830 --> 00:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
bargaining representation
 
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
to gain a monopoly and Union
 
00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:03.759 align:start position:0%
representation in that negotiation
 
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
unit they do not do this selflessly they
 
00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:08.360 align:start position:0%
use their bargaining Monopoly to
 
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
eliminate competition from other unions
 
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
they use it to gain more power of the
 
00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:14.440 align:start position:0%
employer by not allowing them to
 
00:08:16.149 --> 00:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
negotiate different contracts with
 
00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
non-union members and they use it to
 
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
make Union contract Staples like
 
00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
seniority possible by preventing Hy
 
00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:25.919 align:start position:0%
performing workers harmed by those
 
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
Provisions from negotiating their own
 
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
contracts with pay based on Merit yes if
 
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
unions opt for exclusive representation
 
00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
Federal Law requires Union to negotiate
 
00:08:39.949 --> 00:08:39.959 align:start position:0%
equally for all workers to protect non
 
00:08:42.469 --> 00:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
non-union workers from being negotiated
 
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
into lower wages or poorer working
 
00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:46.720 align:start position:0%
conditions against their will member
 
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:49.720 align:start position:0%
only unions do not are not required to
 
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:51.560 align:start position:0%
represent nonmembers completely
 
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
eliminating any concern about Free
 
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
Riders to summarize unions choose to
 
00:08:58.990 --> 00:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
negotiate as an exclusive representative
 
00:09:00.829 --> 00:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
in in order to benefit themselves and
 
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:03.160 align:start position:0%
their members and then frankly they have
 
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
the hood spot to call the people they
 
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
coerced into being
 
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
represented by the Union Free Riders to
 
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
falsely suggest that they are somehow to
 
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
blame for a situation the union created
 
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
if Free Riders are a burden to the union
 
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:19.720 align:start position:0%
the union can eliminate them by choosing
 
00:09:21.949 --> 00:09:21.959 align:start position:0%
to be a member's only Union if a union
 
00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:24.200 align:start position:0%
chooses to ask for exclusive bargaining
 
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
in a right to work state they do so
 
00:09:28.509 --> 00:09:28.519 align:start position:0%
knowing full well that their choice is
 
00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:30.920 align:start position:0%
beneficial to them regardless of what
 
00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
they call the Free Rider issue this bill
 
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:35.240 align:start position:0%
respects the right of every worker who
 
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
chooses to be a union member to become
 
00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:39.880 align:start position:0%
one and enjoy the union representation
 
00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:41.800 align:start position:0%
they desire and it eliminates the right
 
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
of unions to force unwilling people to
 
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
pay for services they do not want and
 
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
are coerced into using even when they
 
00:09:51.069 --> 00:09:51.079 align:start position:0%
consider those Services detrimental to
 
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:53.560 align:start position:0%
themselves both are desirable policy
 
00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:56.200 align:start position:0%
goals and worthy of support I would be
 
00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions and I
 
00:09:59.790 --> 00:09:59.800 align:start position:0%
cannot stay here as as long as I would
 
00:10:02.110 --> 00:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
like I have to be an executive session
 
00:10:04.069 --> 00:10:04.079 align:start position:0%
at 10:30 I would encourage anyone who
 
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
wants to talk to me about this bill to
 
00:10:10.829 --> 00:10:10.839 align:start position:0%
call and text me at 603 267
 
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
4142 one last
 
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
note every time I come to a session and
 
00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:19.160 align:start position:0%
I see people with signs in front of the
 
00:10:21.949 --> 00:10:21.959 align:start position:0%
building I stop and talk to them I've
 
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
been this is my first term but I've
 
00:10:27.069 --> 00:10:27.079 align:start position:0%
still done this about 15 times already
 
00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
this is the first time when I stopped to
 
00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
talk to a group of people and they asked
 
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
me whether I support the bill or not and
 
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
when I said I'm a co-sponsor they said I
 
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to talk to you I'd like to
 
00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:39.399 align:start position:0%
think that that was just a few of the
 
00:10:41.269 --> 00:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
members who feel more strongly I would
 
00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
welcome conversations with anybody who
 
00:10:46.269 --> 00:10:46.279 align:start position:0%
disagrees with my testimony I have
 
00:10:48.069 --> 00:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
reconsidered my position when I was
 
00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:50.600 align:start position:0%
shown to be wrong but to do that we got
 
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
to sit down and talk about it and I'm
 
00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:55.480 align:start position:0%
open to being told I'm wrong I just uh
 
00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
you know that takes a conversation so
 
00:10:59.110 --> 00:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
I'm open to that I left some of my
 
00:11:01.269 --> 00:11:01.279 align:start position:0%
business cards in there and I'll be at

uh I'm here on behalf of the New
 
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:53.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire news Guild we represent

1377 as a grow government bill that's
 
00:12:09.069 --> 00:12:09.079 align:start position:0%
going to make more work for the New
 
00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:12.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature um last month I
 
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
attended the round one of this hearing
 
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
and I um heard a lot of people say we
 
00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
have problems when it comes to housing
 
00:12:23.189 --> 00:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
homelessness health care and um I then
 
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
we believe that the best way to address
 
00:12:29.069 --> 00:12:29.079 align:start position:0%
those issues is to encourage and protect
 
00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
strong middle class in this state um I
 
00:12:33.389 --> 00:12:33.399 align:start position:0%
think I have a lot of union members here
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
so if if I can ask them a few questions
 
00:12:37.949 --> 00:12:37.959 align:start position:0%
could you raise your own your hand if
 
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
you own your own house or make rental
 
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
payments on
 
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
time how about are you covered by Health
 
00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
Care um either from your employer or
 
00:12:47.399 --> 00:12:48.550 align:start position:0%
Care um either from your employer or
your

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:12:51.389 --> 00:12:51.399 align:start position:0%
union and after A Hard Day's Work can
 
00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
you go home and find time to help your
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
kids with their homework play ball with
 
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
them take them to dance or music classes
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
right these are stable members of your
 
00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:05.120 align:start position:0%
communities they're responsible
 
00:13:07.509 --> 00:13:07.519 align:start position:0%
individuals they work hard they don't
 
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:09.880 align:start position:0%
come here to ask for a handout they pay
 
00:13:12.509 --> 00:13:12.519 align:start position:0%
their taxes hell once in a while they
 
00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
might even vote
 
00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:17.839 align:start position:0%
Republican um House Bill 1377 will hurt
 
00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
them and the ability of our unions to
 
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:23.720 align:start position:0%
represent us some of us might fall out
 
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
of the middle class have to take a
 
00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:29.240 align:start position:0%

house drugs and alcohol families fall
 
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
apart kids suffer and that means they
 
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
come here to ask not for not to keep
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
protect their jobs but they ask for um
 
00:13:45.949 --> 00:13:45.959 align:start position:0%
for assistance and handouts right um we
 
00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
all know that the biggest problems you
 
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
guys face here isn't abortion or guns or
 
00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
school books it's spending and taxes
 
00:13:54.629 --> 00:13:54.639 align:start position:0%
that's the hard part of your job
 
00:13:57.230 --> 00:13:57.240 align:start position:0%
affordable housing expanded Medicaid
 
00:13:59.389 --> 00:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
food stamps Mental Health Service is
 
00:14:02.189 --> 00:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
drug and alcohol abuse why is that the
 
00:14:03.949 --> 00:14:03.959 align:start position:0%
loss of the middle
 
00:14:08.189 --> 00:14:08.199 align:start position:0%
class from 1983 to the present right the
 
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:10.240 align:start position:0%
number of people represented by unions
 
00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:14.600 align:start position:0%
in the workforce has gone from 20% to
 
00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
10% um and also during that time the
 
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:20.240 align:start position:0%
middle class has shrunk according to
 
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
research from Pew um from pre Pew
 
00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:26.680 align:start position:0%
research to from about 61% to
 
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
50% also during that time time the last
 
00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
40 years federal government spending has
 
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
increased from 1.7 trillion in today's
 
00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
dollars to 51 trillion so it's pretty
 
00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
it's pretty simple unions in the middle
 
00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:43.720 align:start position:0%
class strength government growths if you
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
want to keep your job manageable you
 
00:14:47.829 --> 00:14:47.839 align:start position:0%
want to protect the middle class in the
 
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
state you want to keep government small
 
00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
protect the

and training mechanisms that would
 
00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:22.079 align:start position:0%
ultimately end up costing more to our

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
fored provide these agreements between
 
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
two Private Business entities as well
 
00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
has been in other states have passed
 
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
similar laws which also lower wages and
 
00:18:37.149 --> 00:18:37.159 align:start position:0%
endanger workers and safety uh by
 
00:18:38.870 --> 00:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
destroying the mechanisms we have built
 
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
through our training classes for our
 
00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:42.760 align:start position:0%
highly skilled workers we see no reason
 
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
why the state should be interfering in
 
00:18:45.750 --> 00:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
the business decision of two private
 
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
businesses and cannot think of another
 
00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
situation where in the Live Free or Die
 
00:18:51.870 --> 00:18:51.880 align:start position:0%
State the government feels need to uh
 
00:18:54.789 --> 00:18:54.799 align:start position:0%
get in between employers and employees
 
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
relationship this is not the way we do
 
00:18:58.270 --> 00:18:58.280 align:start position:0%
things in New Hampshire and we respect
 
00:18:59.669 --> 00:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask the committee to vote
 
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
itl on this Bill thank you very much
 
00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:06.200 align:start position:0%
thank you there any questions for the
 
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:15.880 align:start position:0%
McKenzie thank you for appearing before
 
00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:18.640 align:start position:0%
the committee um so the question I have
 
00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:20.360 align:start position:0%
the Building Trades are somewhat
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
different than a than um a plant would
 
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
be for instance so how do they how do
 
00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
they come to be Union members and what
 
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
would it be like if somebody uh who took
 
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:36.360 align:start position:0%
advantage of the apprenticeship program
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
all of those things ended up not being a
 
00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:43.039 align:start position:0%
union member uh after they after they
 
00:19:44.590 --> 00:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
petition to get in the local so how do
 
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
they get in and then what would the
 
00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
impact be uh thank you for your question
 
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so how they get in is to each
 
00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
individual trade if uh you wanted to
 
00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
become an electrician you go to the
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
electricians union apply for their um um
 
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
entrance there same with the iron
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
workers same with I mean all the trades
 
00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
are pretty much the same Carpenters
 
00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
laborers you go you talk to um the
 
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
business managers there you apply for
 
00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
the apprenticeship programs you get sent
 
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
to school you get typically 400 hours
 
00:20:18.549 --> 00:20:18.559 align:start position:0%
worth of training 4,000 uh or so hours
 
00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
on the job training and if you decide
 
00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:24.360 align:start position:0%
not to be a member at that point anymore
 
00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
you simply St paying your dues and you
 
00:20:29.149 --> 00:20:29.159 align:start position:0%
continue to you're still afforded all
 
00:20:30.789 --> 00:20:30.799 align:start position:0%
the training that you got you're still
 
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
afforded any certifications that you
 
00:20:35.230 --> 00:20:35.240 align:start position:0%
have so you can simply not pay your dues
 
00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
and go non-union if that's what you feel
 
00:20:39.549 --> 00:20:39.559 align:start position:0%
like there's no requirement stating that
 
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
you have to say a certain time frame
 
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
nothing that you have to give back or
 
00:20:46.149 --> 00:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
pay back after you decide not to I mean
 
00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:47.799 align:start position:0%
it's a choice you make you either
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
continue to pay your dues and stay a
 
00:20:52.909 --> 00:20:52.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:55.960 align:start position:0%
away any other
 
00:20:59.470 --> 00:20:59.480 align:start position:0%
questions repr love
 
00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question thank
 
00:21:02.950 --> 00:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
00:21:05.510 --> 00:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
um you know you mentioned you have quite
 
00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:07.919 align:start position:0%
a few members and uh and stuff and uh
 
00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:09.320 align:start position:0%
I'm guessing that you you offer good
 
00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
benefits packages and and stuff uh would
 
00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:15.640 align:start position:0%
you expect if this bill passes would you
 
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
be be expecting to for membership to
 
00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:21.640 align:start position:0%
decrease or increase or or stay the same
 
00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
uh I would like to say that I would hope
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
that everybody would maintain their
 
00:21:27.039 --> 00:21:28.710 align:start position:0%
that everybody would maintain their
um

00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
their allegiance to each individual
 
00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
trade that they have and I think that
 
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
that would
 
00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:36.440 align:start position:0%
probably be the case but there would be
 
00:21:38.549 --> 00:21:38.559 align:start position:0%
some people that would absolutely not do
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
it I mean if you no longer had to pay
 
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
for your gym membership but you still
 
00:21:43.870 --> 00:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
got to go to the gym I would see a lot
 
00:21:45.029 --> 00:21:45.039 align:start position:0%
of people that would probably would not
 
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
pay for the gym membership um you know
 
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
if you're getting something for free
 
00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
there's always that aspect of why
 
00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
continue to do this and we would still
 
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
be having to represent all the people
 
00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
that decided not to to pay their dues at
 
00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
a cost to to all of us which would
 
00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
significantly hurt the people that would
 
00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
continue to maintain their
 
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
dues follow up follow up
 
00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
um I've I've read where um you know
 
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
union membership actually goes up and
 
00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
right to work states uh and it's because
 
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
of the the benefit P that's the the
 
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
product that that's offered um you know
 
00:22:21.269 --> 00:22:21.279 align:start position:0%
would you um would you be be wanting to
 
00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:23.720 align:start position:0%
buy a product that you didn't want like
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
say for instance if you were um allergic
 
00:22:28.909 --> 00:22:28.919 align:start position:0%
to wheat bread would you want Market
 
00:22:31.269 --> 00:22:31.279 align:start position:0%
Basket forcing wheat wheat bread on you
 
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
I don't see this as a forcing thing you
 
00:22:35.789 --> 00:22:35.799 align:start position:0%
have a choice to join the union or not
 
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
no one's ever forced to to join a union
 
00:22:41.630 --> 00:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
no one's ever come to me and said hey
 
00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
you need to do this whether you like it
 
00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:48.440 align:start position:0%
or not it's a choice I made um you know
 
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
that's why I don't understand what what
 
00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
this bill is is like you're you're
 
00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
saying that we're like forcing these
 
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
people to join unions and and we never
 
00:23:00.029 --> 00:23:00.039 align:start position:0%
do like anybody who's ever come to me um
 
00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
has come on their own free will I've
 
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
never said hey I'm going to call John
 
00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
Smith and make him come in here for an
 
00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
interview today to join to join my my
 
00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:11.320 align:start position:0%
union um that's never happened in the
 
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
history i' that I've been in I've been
 
00:23:15.789 --> 00:23:15.799 align:start position:0%
in for 25 years um I've never known
 
00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
anybody to be forced to join a union
 
00:23:19.149 --> 00:23:19.159 align:start position:0%
it's something that you do on your own
 
00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:20.559 align:start position:0%
free will because you know that there's
 
00:23:23.149 --> 00:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
benefits that far out way not having a
 
00:23:23.159 --> 00:23:24.149 align:start position:0%
benefits that far out way not having a
union

00:23:24.149 --> 00:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
union
 
00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:27.640 align:start position:0%
membership one more one more would you
 
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
believe I have you have what sir I have
 
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
been forced to join a union or lose my
 
00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
job well uh I don't know what union that
 
00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:37.480 align:start position:0%
would be I would think that' be highly
 
00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:39.919 align:start position:0%
um pretty much unconstitutional at that
 
00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:42.200 align:start position:0%
point it was a while ago so I don't I
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
don't know how anybody could force you
 
00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
to join a union sorry that it happened
 
00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
to obviously because I don't think
 
00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
that's the right way a union should be
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
representing itself but I know of all
 
00:23:53.669 --> 00:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
the trades in the construction union not
 
00:23:56.149 --> 00:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
a single person has been forced to
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
join all right thank you very much for
 
00:23:59.470 --> 00:23:59.480 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you everybody for
 
00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:04.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:26.799 --> 00:24:31.110 align:start position:0%

years in the non-union
 
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
sector um I can honestly state that
 
00:24:57.269 --> 00:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
becoming a union member was the best
 
00:24:59.630 --> 00:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
choice I I made in my career as a
 
00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:00.750 align:start position:0%
choice I I made in my career as a
construction

00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:00.760 align:start position:0%

Bill

00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
1377 the so-call Right to Work bill that
 
00:25:31.269 --> 00:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
is currently under consideration in the
 
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
legislature we believe that right to
 
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
work is bad public policy because it
 
00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:37.880 align:start position:0%
mandates government interference in a
 
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
free market and will adversely impact a
 
00:25:42.789 --> 00:25:42.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire based business if passed
 
00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
by legislator the the right to work will
 
00:25:48.389 --> 00:25:48.399 align:start position:0%
intrude on our businesses ability to
 
00:25:50.909 --> 00:25:50.919 align:start position:0%
freely negotiate contracts that would
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
determine that we determine are in the
 
00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
best interest of our company that isn't
 
00:25:57.710 --> 00:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
a decision the state should be making
 
00:25:59.950 --> 00:25:59.960 align:start position:0%
especially here in New Hampshire houseal
 
00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
Bill 1377 right to work isn't about
 
00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
workers rights instead it's an effort to
 
00:26:07.149 --> 00:26:07.159 align:start position:0%
weaken unions and will ultimately harm
 
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
workers our communities and our
 
00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:12.200 align:start position:0%
businesses our business our business
 
00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
employees more employees more than 2500
 
00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
workers with good pay and competitive
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
benefits as building contractors we
 
00:26:22.669 --> 00:26:22.679 align:start position:0%
consider the Carpenters Union a partner
 
00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
and act success because they help us
 
00:26:27.029 --> 00:26:27.039 align:start position:0%
deliver quality work to our clients and
 
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
the most effici ient
 
00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
manner working Partnerships between the
 
00:26:32.789 --> 00:26:32.799 align:start position:0%
carpenters union and construction
 
00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
employers provide comprehensive reliable
 
00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:37.000 align:start position:0%
skill trained and professionally
 
00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:39.640 align:start position:0%
development that is desperately needed
 
00:26:40.909 --> 00:26:40.919 align:start position:0%
in the construction
 
00:26:43.789 --> 00:26:43.799 align:start position:0%
industry where some where some see
 
00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:45.640 align:start position:0%
construction jobs as a temporary or
 
00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:47.720 align:start position:0%
unattractive we see them as rewarding
 
00:26:50.149 --> 00:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
careers where skills are valued and
 
00:26:52.389 --> 00:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
professionalism grows through mutual
 
00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
respect and
 
00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
cooperation the union shares those
 
00:26:57.870 --> 00:26:57.880 align:start position:0%
principles and that's why our Labor
 
00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
Management apprenticeship model is the
 
00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:01.880 align:start position:0%
most successful recruiting and retention
 
00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:05.080 align:start position:0%
tool available to our our companies by
 
00:27:06.909 --> 00:27:06.919 align:start position:0%
weakening the unions and our training
 
00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:08.440 align:start position:0%
programs Right to Work would make it
 
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
harder for us to find and keep good
 
00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:12.559 align:start position:0%
employees in New Hampshire and that
 
00:27:14.909 --> 00:27:14.919 align:start position:0%
would hurt our companies and the state's
 
00:27:14.919 --> 00:27:16.269 align:start position:0%
would hurt our companies and the state's
overall

00:27:16.269 --> 00:27:16.279 align:start position:0%
overall
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
economy we also believe that passing
 
00:27:20.669 --> 00:27:20.679 align:start position:0%
right to work will also harm our
 
00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:22.840 align:start position:0%
communities because studies
 
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
show that states that have passed Right
 
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
to Work have lower wages and Health Care
 
00:27:31.510 --> 00:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
coverage and higher rates of poverty
 
00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
pushing more people towards Public
 
00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:35.320 align:start position:0%
Assistance is not something we believe
 
00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
is good for our communities and
 
00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
ultimately cost our state more money in
 
00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:41.240 align:start position:0%
the long run states that have so-called
 
00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
right to work laws also have a much
 
00:27:46.149 --> 00:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
higher rate of job site injury and
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
death we encourage you to focus on
 
00:27:51.029 --> 00:27:51.039 align:start position:0%
passing laws to improve workplace safety
 
00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
not Advanced legislation that will make
 
00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
our job sites more
 
00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
dangerous um and on that being a
 
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
taxpaying member of the State of New
 
00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm wondering why this bill
 
00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919 align:start position:0%
keeps coming up every two years when
 
00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
it's been shot down every time this bill
 
00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
would take money it would take money out
 
00:28:16.830 --> 00:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
of my wallet and food off my table I
 
00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
choose voluntarily to pay my dues for
 
00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
representation to make sure that my life
 
00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:26.120 align:start position:0%
and my safety is taken care of on a job
 
00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
site the does that they help us to
 
00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
negotiate that to make sure that that
 
00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:31.720 align:start position:0%
happens that we're taking care of so we
 
00:28:33.149 --> 00:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
can go home every night to spend time
 
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
with our family and we still have
 
00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
something at the end of our career to be
 
00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
able to
 
00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:41.240 align:start position:0%
enjoy I'd appreciate it if you guys
 
00:28:44.029 --> 00:28:44.039 align:start position:0%
really considered not approving this
 
00:28:46.669 --> 00:28:46.679 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you are there any
 
00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:49.640 align:start position:0%

suggestion Mr chair if in if this comes
 
00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:51.640 align:start position:0%
back in another year or two maybe we
 
00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:53.240 align:start position:0%
should ask people to write a number and
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
we'll pick a number just like the deli
 
00:29:58.590 --> 00:29:58.600 align:start position:0%
counter let's hope we don't have to do
 
00:29:58.600 --> 00:29:59.350 align:start position:0%
counter let's hope we don't have to do
it

00:29:59.350 --> 00:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:02.080 align:start position:0%

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
der New Hampshire taxpayer homeowner I'm
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
also a business rep for District Council
 
00:30:22.509 --> 00:30:22.519 align:start position:0%

trades um I represent over 4,000 members
 
00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:27.640 align:start position:0%
in that capacity but um not just a
 
00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
representative of my union I'm also a
 
00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
member um here to speak against right to
 
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
work today um I'll tell you right now I
 
00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:37.640 align:start position:0%
owe everything to this Union right um my
 
00:30:39.549 --> 00:30:39.559 align:start position:0%
generation is having a hard time being
 
00:30:42.110 --> 00:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
able to purchase a home you know having
 
00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:43.720 align:start position:0%
a hard time finding careers as opposed
 
00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:45.640 align:start position:0%
to jobs um and I always say the
 
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
difference between a job and a career is
 
00:30:48.509 --> 00:30:48.519 align:start position:0%
that your career actually has an end
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
point so unions unions provide that for
 
00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:53.320 align:start position:0%
me I know that some point I'm going to
 
00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:54.760 align:start position:0%
be able to stop working and I'm going to
 
00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:57.240 align:start position:0%
be able to retire with dignity um not
 
00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
not only that but I'll tell you right
 
00:31:00.350 --> 00:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
now I'm actually coming back from the
 
00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:01.880 align:start position:0%
state of Florida last week I was down
 
00:31:04.269 --> 00:31:04.279 align:start position:0%
there for an organizing Drive Florida is
 
00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
a right to work state so this last week
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
I've had to listen to the hardships and
 
00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
the horrors of workers in a state that
 
00:31:15.629 --> 00:31:15.639 align:start position:0%
uh have been in uh employed by their
 
00:31:18.509 --> 00:31:18.519 align:start position:0%
employer for going on 10 15 years and
 
00:31:20.830 --> 00:31:20.840 align:start position:0%
they're still making they just broke $15
 
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
an hour on average right to work states
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
employees make 15% less than uh than
 
00:31:29.669 --> 00:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
states without right to work laws I'm
 
00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:31.880 align:start position:0%
asking you to think today about the
 
00:31:33.389 --> 00:31:33.399 align:start position:0%
people that you live with in the state
 
00:31:35.389 --> 00:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and which ones of them
 
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
can take a 15% pay cut um this state is
 
00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
already you know there's a misconception
 
00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:44.440 align:start position:0%
that it's it's a very affordable place
 
00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
to live everybody in here knows that
 
00:31:48.029 --> 00:31:48.039 align:start position:0%
that's not true the the cost of living
 
00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
is not any different than it is in any
 
00:31:51.389 --> 00:31:51.399 align:start position:0%
of the surrounding states that are not
 
00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
right to work we can't afford to take a
 
00:31:55.269 --> 00:31:55.279 align:start position:0%
15% pay cut we can't afford more
 
00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:57.320 align:start position:0%
contractors coming in here and more

opposition of House Bill
 
00:35:12.829 --> 00:35:12.839 align:start position:0%
1377 Right to Work statistics show in
 
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
states with right to work laws the
 
00:35:18.589 --> 00:35:18.599 align:start position:0%
poverty rates are higher 15.3% overall
 
00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
21.4% for children which is just
 
00:35:24.150 --> 00:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
terrible frankly compared with poverty
 
00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:27.320 align:start position:0%
rates of 12.8% overall and 18% for
 
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
children in states without these
 
00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:32.920 align:start position:0%
laws again all of that is very sad we
 
00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:34.760 align:start position:0%
don't need to make those things worse
 
00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
additionally people under the age of 65
 
00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
in states with no right to work laws are
 
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
more likely to be uninsured 133%
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
compared with
 
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
99.4% in free bargaining
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
States in our world today we can't
 
00:35:51.230 --> 00:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
afford to take any actions which
 
00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:53.560 align:start position:0%
contribute to higher poverty rates more
 
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
homeless families and more of our
 
00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
friends and family without health
 
00:35:59.589 --> 00:35:59.599 align:start position:0%
insurance with Rising costs of health
 
00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
insurance and living in general New
 
00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:03.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is ranked number 10 in the
 
00:36:06.109 --> 00:36:06.119 align:start position:0%
nation for the high cost of healthare
 
00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:08.200 align:start position:0%
it's not uncommon for people to lose
 
00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
their homes have to file bankruptcy just
 
00:36:14.069 --> 00:36:14.079 align:start position:0%
based on health care costs alone union
 
00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:16.280 align:start position:0%
jobs provide excellent benefits and
 
00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
health care which help take care of that
 
00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:20.200 align:start position:0%
problem in and of
 
00:36:22.589 --> 00:36:22.599 align:start position:0%
itself right to work is wrong because a
 
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
legislation forces Union representatives
 
00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
to work for free on behalf of employ
 
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
emplo who represent uh who request Union
 
00:36:32.349 --> 00:36:32.359 align:start position:0%
representation but don't pay for that
 
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
representation this representation is
 
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
not only in the event of discipline or
 
00:36:38.069 --> 00:36:38.079 align:start position:0%
something along those lines but
 
00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
additionally in negotiating the benefits
 
00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:44.200 align:start position:0%
and wages that they also enjoy not only
 
00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
the paying dues
 
00:36:48.069 --> 00:36:48.079 align:start position:0%
members in New Hampshire we pride
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
ourselves in being the Live Free or Die
 
00:36:52.950 --> 00:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
state to allow a legislative body to
 
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
make such important decisions on behalf
 
00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
of residents and voters of the state is
 
00:36:59.430 --> 00:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
direct conflict with those beliefs we
 
00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
want to make those decisions ourselves
 
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
and leave that at a local level workers
 
00:37:05.790 --> 00:37:05.800 align:start position:0%
should have the Liberty to choose by
 
00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
voting whether to join a union I urge
 
00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:11.560 align:start position:0%

of the committee for the record my name
 
00:44:15.309 --> 00:44:15.319 align:start position:0%
is Scott Gove I'm a current recording
 
00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
Secretary of Teamsters Local 633 of
 
00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
Manchester New Hampshire I'm here today
 
00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:21.839 align:start position:0%
in opposition of House Bill 1377 Right
 
00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
to Work according to New Hampshire
 
00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor New Hampshire High
 
00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
Cost of housing and utilities are major
 
00:44:30.710 --> 00:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
factors in corporate relocation
 
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:32.200 align:start position:0%
decisions and not New Hampshire's right
 
00:44:34.829 --> 00:44:34.839 align:start position:0%
to work status right to work is wrong
 
00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
because the legislation forces Union
 
00:44:38.910 --> 00:44:38.920 align:start position:0%
representatives to work for free on
 
00:44:41.309 --> 00:44:41.319 align:start position:0%
behalf of employees who request Union
 
00:44:43.829 --> 00:44:43.839 align:start position:0%
representation but won't pay for that
 
00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
representation Right to Work legislation
 
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
allows employers to keep wages lower
 
00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:51.720 align:start position:0%
benefits scarcer and in some cases abuse
 
00:44:54.349 --> 00:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
is quiet it benefits employers whose
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
goals are to keep employees divided and
 
00:44:58.990 --> 00:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
distracted right to work is wrong and is
 
00:45:01.309 --> 00:45:01.319 align:start position:0%
not needed in New Hampshire it is
 
00:45:01.319 --> 00:45:02.990 align:start position:0%
not needed in New Hampshire it is
fundamentally

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
fundamentally
 
00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
unamerican in New Hampshire we have a
 
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
2.3% unemployment with over 177,000 job
 
00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:10.069 align:start position:0%
2.3% unemployment with over 177,000 job
openings

00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:10.079 align:start position:0%
openings
 
00:45:11.950 --> 00:45:11.960 align:start position:0%
available workers should have the
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
Liberty to choose by voting whether to
 
00:45:16.829 --> 00:45:16.839 align:start position:0%
join a union I urge this committee to
 
00:45:19.710 --> 00:45:19.720 align:start position:0%

boss can claim Monopoly bargaining power

over dissenting workers taking away the

individual's right to negotiate for
 
00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:26.680 align:start position:0%
themsel the union boss then demands the
 
00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
government enforced authority to extract
 
00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:30.760 align:start position:0%
mandatory dues or fees from that
 
00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
unwilling worker adding insult to injury
 
00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
this poll show the vast majority of
 
00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:38.200 align:start position:0%
Voters agree it's just plain wrong this
 
00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
bill would guarantee workers the right
 
00:47:42.069 --> 00:47:42.079 align:start position:0%
to decide for themselves whether or not
 
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
a labor union deserves their financial
 
00:47:46.549 --> 00:47:46.559 align:start position:0%
support same as any other private
 
00:47:49.349 --> 00:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
organization once when asked if you
 
00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
would support a controversial resolution
 
00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:53.880 align:start position:0%

executive director Fred comr said hell
 
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
no we don't support it I was a right to
 
00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
work state we have to earn our
 
00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
membership if we supported that we'd
 
00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
lose too many
 
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
members you see without Right to Work
 
00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
protections there's little incentive for
 
00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:12.200 align:start position:0%
Union officials to offer a good service
 
00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:14.680 align:start position:0%
to their members they can compel people
 
00:48:17.349 --> 00:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
to pay them either way fact is good
 
00:48:19.829 --> 00:48:19.839 align:start position:0%
unions don't need forc dues and bad
 
00:48:22.270 --> 00:48:22.280 align:start position:0%
unions don't deserve them furthermore
 
00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:23.800 align:start position:0%
it's clear that right to work would help

Hampshire's economic Outlook
 
00:48:28.510 --> 00:48:28.520 align:start position:0%
2012 to 2022 the number of people
 
00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
employed grew by 6.7% in New Hampshire
 
00:48:35.190 --> 00:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
8.6% in all such Forest unionism States
 
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
right to work states on the other hand
 
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
enjoyed employment growth of
 
00:48:42.309 --> 00:48:42.319 align:start position:0%
15.7% more than double hours and that's
 
00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:44.680 align:start position:0%
no surprise because area development
 
00:48:47.829 --> 00:48:47.839 align:start position:0%
magazine surveys have consistently found
 
00:48:49.789 --> 00:48:49.799 align:start position:0%

00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:55.240 align:start position:0%
either important or very important to

purchasing power for a family of four
 
00:49:14.349 --> 00:49:14.359 align:start position:0%
clearly not only is Right to Work the
 
00:49:16.190 --> 00:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
morally right thing to do protecting
 
00:49:17.349 --> 00:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
this Freedom will also help New

conquered
 
00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:41.640 align:start position:0%
conquered um follow
 
00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
so you said uh people are paying dues
 
00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:47.240 align:start position:0%
without consent I've been paying dues
 
00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
for 28 years because I want to because
 
00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:52.480 align:start position:0%
not because I'm forced to I don't
 
00:49:54.349 --> 00:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
understand you get the without consent
 
00:49:57.549 --> 00:49:57.559 align:start position:0%
part uh I'm not saying that everybody
 
00:49:59.069 --> 00:49:59.079 align:start position:0%
pays dues without
 
00:50:01.030 --> 00:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
consent well you kind of did because you
 
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
didn't say some people do all right
 
00:50:05.789 --> 00:50:05.799 align:start position:0%
question let him no it's all right it's
 
00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:07.839 align:start position:0%
all right represent he's going to answer
 
00:50:09.309 --> 00:50:09.319 align:start position:0%
I'll let you ask other questions all
 
00:50:12.109 --> 00:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
right my apologies sir that's not a
 
00:50:13.390 --> 00:50:13.400 align:start position:0%
common sense understanding of the
 
00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:17.440 align:start position:0%
English language and just because one
 
00:50:19.109 --> 00:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
person does one thing doesn't mean that
 
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
everybody else is uniform in that
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
behavior there are people that
 
00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
are compelled to pay dues to keep their
 
00:50:28.549 --> 00:50:28.559 align:start position:0%
job or get their job uh because New
 
00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is not a right to work state
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
they would not join the union or pay the
 
00:50:36.430 --> 00:50:36.440 align:start position:0%
union a dime if they had the choice but
 
00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
because of current law in New Hampshire
 
00:50:42.829 --> 00:50:42.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
payments there a followup representative
 
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
cler there's a lot of followup but
 
00:50:52.309 --> 00:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure where to start to be
 
00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
honest and
 
00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
uh um it's probably a conversation that
 
00:50:59.190 --> 00:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
would last longer than we' all we'd all
 
00:51:01.069 --> 00:51:01.079 align:start position:0%
like why don't you give it two think of
 
00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
your two good questions or your two best
 
00:51:04.549 --> 00:51:04.559 align:start position:0%
questions and then if you'd like to
 
00:51:06.190 --> 00:51:06.200 align:start position:0%
speak with the presenter outside you can
 
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
do that I appreciate that thank you and
 
00:51:10.829 --> 00:51:10.839 align:start position:0%
thank you as well you know um Force
 
00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
unionism what's
 
00:51:16.510 --> 00:51:16.520 align:start position:0%
that it would be the concept that some
 
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
workers are forced to pay union dues in
 
00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:21.280 align:start position:0%
order to get or keep their jobs so the
 
00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:23.720 align:start position:0%
unionism would be the association with
 
00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:25.559 align:start position:0%
the Union the force part would be that
 
00:51:28.789 --> 00:51:28.799 align:start position:0%
it's involuntary it's a matter of labor
 
00:51:30.349 --> 00:51:30.359 align:start position:0%
law because nature is not a right to
 
00:51:30.359 --> 00:51:31.309 align:start position:0%
law because nature is not a right to
work

00:51:31.309 --> 00:51:31.319 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:51:31.319 --> 00:51:36.910 align:start position:0%
work
state

00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:39.640 align:start position:0%
right again I just
 
00:51:42.069 --> 00:51:42.079 align:start position:0%
uh I I just don't want to battle right
 
00:51:44.589 --> 00:51:44.599 align:start position:0%
here as much as I'd like to but um I
 
00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
don't know like I like I said you know
 
00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
if we if we want to chat on a different
 
00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
level we can definitely do that but um
 
00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:52.760 align:start position:0%
for the sake of time and for the sake of
 
00:51:55.630 --> 00:51:55.640 align:start position:0%
everybody here I'm not going to go too
 
00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
crazy so thank you thank you appreciate
 
00:51:59.430 --> 00:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
you thank you any other questions for
 
00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:00.870 align:start position:0%
you thank you any other questions for
the

00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
presenter represent McKenzie so are you
 
00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
familiar with the national lior
 
00:52:09.230 --> 00:52:09.240 align:start position:0%
Relations Act I am okay so so isn't it
 
00:52:12.069 --> 00:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
illegal under that under the national uh
 
00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
Labor Relations Act to force somebody to
 
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
be a union member it's it's legal
 
00:52:22.829 --> 00:52:22.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:27.589 --> 00:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
law so it is not illegal to force people
 
00:52:31.069 --> 00:52:31.079 align:start position:0%
to associate with the Union it is
 
00:52:32.589 --> 00:52:32.599 align:start position:0%
allowed under the National Labor
 
00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
Elations act unless States opt out under
 
00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:37.880 align:start position:0%
section 14b of the tap tartle act which
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
amended the National Labor Relations Act
 
00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
by passing a state right to work law in
 
00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:44.200 align:start position:0%
States like New
 
00:52:47.910 --> 00:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire unions are perfectly able to
 
00:52:51.870 --> 00:52:51.880 align:start position:0%
force workers to associate with
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
them followup
 
00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:56.510 align:start position:0%
them followup
questions

00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:52:59.829 --> 00:52:59.839 align:start position:0%
so but that's your understanding of the
 
00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
National Labor Relations Act that that
 
00:53:06.309 --> 00:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
members can be compelled to be in a
 
00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
union in spite of the fact that that
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
would be illegal in the United States
 
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
already been decided but your opinion is
 
00:53:16.349 --> 00:53:16.359 align:start position:0%
they can be forced in New Hampshire
 
00:53:20.309 --> 00:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
Webster's Dictionary defines join join
 
00:53:23.670 --> 00:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
Union as to associate oneself with
 
00:53:26.069 --> 00:53:26.079 align:start position:0%
certainly any worker compelled to
 
00:53:27.710 --> 00:53:27.720 align:start position:0%
provide material support for an
 
00:53:30.109 --> 00:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
organization is inherently compelled to
 
00:53:32.549 --> 00:53:32.559 align:start position:0%
associate with it funding an
 
00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
organization is the deepest form of
 
00:53:37.150 --> 00:53:37.160 align:start position:0%
Association Force unionism violates
 
00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:38.680 align:start position:0%
individual workers freedom of
 
00:53:40.510 --> 00:53:40.520 align:start position:0%
Association whether or not the union
 
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
lists them on official membership roles
 
00:53:45.789 --> 00:53:45.799 align:start position:0%
or lets some vote on internal affairs
 
00:53:48.549 --> 00:53:48.559 align:start position:0%
and sometimes union bosses will distort
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
the facts even further consider
 
00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
carefully this quote from Article 2
 
00:53:54.349 --> 00:53:54.359 align:start position:0%
Section one of the United Auto Workers
 
00:53:56.910 --> 00:53:56.920 align:start position:0%
New National cont contract employees
 
00:53:58.950 --> 00:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
covered by this agreement at the time it
 
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:00.640 align:start position:0%
becomes effective and to are members of
 
00:54:02.829 --> 00:54:02.839 align:start position:0%
the Union at that time shall be required
 
00:54:05.190 --> 00:54:05.200 align:start position:0%
as a condition of continued employment
 
00:54:07.069 --> 00:54:07.079 align:start position:0%
to continue membership in the union for
 
00:54:09.630 --> 00:54:09.640 align:start position:0%
the duration of this agreement employees
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
covered by this agreement who are not
 
00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:13.720 align:start position:0%
members at this time this agreement
 
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
becomes effective shall be required as a
 
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
condition of continued employment to
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
become members of the Union perhaps the
 
00:54:21.870 --> 00:54:21.880 align:start position:0%
UAW is being frank here and their
 
00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
practices fall short what's permissible
 
00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
under current law or perhaps UW simply
 
00:54:28.309 --> 00:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
trying to mislead workers strong arming
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
them into submission either way right to
 
00:54:31.829 --> 00:54:31.839 align:start position:0%
work allow would help Shield grain
 
00:54:36.589 --> 00:54:36.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:38.789 --> 00:54:38.799 align:start position:0%
Injustice I would the only thing Mr
 
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
chairman is that I would like to see the
 
00:54:44.589 --> 00:54:44.599 align:start position:0%
source of that and the whether or not
 
00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
that's an interpretation that's being
 
00:54:48.670 --> 00:54:48.680 align:start position:0%
Advanced here again it would be a
 
00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
violation of the National Labor
 
00:54:52.589 --> 00:54:52.599 align:start position:0%

00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:55.319 align:start position:0%

this Committee in this legislature for
 
00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
years or decades that um they vigorously
 
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
oppose um the deceptively labeled um law
 
00:57:14.309 --> 00:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
right to work right to work bills
 
00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
whenever they have been introduced um
 
00:57:19.589 --> 00:57:19.599 align:start position:0%
the Jew I I I want to add just the
 
00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:22.760 align:start position:0%
Jewish clergy um Association in New
 
00:57:24.630 --> 00:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has asked that their testimony
 
00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
be entered so I'm going to since they're
 
00:57:28.990 --> 00:57:29.000 align:start position:0%
not outside right now or haven't
 
00:57:30.309 --> 00:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
presented I'm going to do that at the
 
00:57:32.190 --> 00:57:32.200 align:start position:0%
end of my testimony just enter the
 
00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
testimony um I also just as an aside um
 
00:57:38.029 --> 00:57:38.039 align:start position:0%
I've we've heard several times now the
 
00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
reference to union bosses I am a long
 
00:57:43.549 --> 00:57:43.559 align:start position:0%
time Church Pastor I am also a proud
 
00:57:47.150 --> 00:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
Union member and uh formerly I was the
 
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
national Secretary treasur of my union
 
00:57:53.549 --> 00:57:53.559 align:start position:0%
and okay what does a union Boss look
 
00:57:56.710 --> 00:57:56.720 align:start position:0%
like to you do I look like a union boss
 
00:57:59.150 --> 00:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
so just want to say that Reverend Dr
 
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:04.640 align:start position:0%
Gail Kenny the union boss um so um our
 
00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:06.200 align:start position:0%
faith leads us to understand that
 
00:58:08.029 --> 00:58:08.039 align:start position:0%
workers deserve to have a voice on the
 
00:58:09.950 --> 00:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
job and the right to come together
 
00:58:12.349 --> 00:58:12.359 align:start position:0%
collectively we also believe that New
 
00:58:15.150 --> 00:58:15.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employers with unions have a
 
00:58:17.589 --> 00:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
right to negotiate their with their
 
00:58:19.950 --> 00:58:19.960 align:start position:0%
workers without the heavy hand of the
 
00:58:23.109 --> 00:58:23.119 align:start position:0%
legislature telling them what specific
 
00:58:25.789 --> 00:58:25.799 align:start position:0%
contractual decisions can can or cannot
 
00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
be in the contract that employers choose
 
00:58:30.829 --> 00:58:30.839 align:start position:0%
willingly to negotiate with their
 
00:58:35.549 --> 00:58:35.559 align:start position:0%
workers um so if the outof state
 
00:58:37.549 --> 00:58:37.559 align:start position:0%
Architects representative of the
 
00:58:39.230 --> 00:58:39.240 align:start position:0%
national Right to Work committee through
 
00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
the name New England right to work
 
00:58:42.589 --> 00:58:42.599 align:start position:0%
committee and other National architects
 
00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
of this bill came to you bearing truth
 
00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
as opposed to false witness they would
 
00:58:51.309 --> 00:58:51.319 align:start position:0%
tell you where Right to Work came from
 
00:58:53.549 --> 00:58:53.559 align:start position:0%
and I hope uh you know by now but just
 
00:58:56.190 --> 00:58:56.200 align:start position:0%
in case you don't just a real um quick
 
00:59:00.069 --> 00:59:00.079 align:start position:0%
history in the 1940s in the Jim Crow
 
00:59:02.670 --> 00:59:02.680 align:start position:0%
South workers in the textile industry
 
00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
and other places in the South decided to
 
00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:07.720 align:start position:0%
come together collectively to organize
 
00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
collectively to have a voice on the job
 
00:59:11.549 --> 00:59:11.559 align:start position:0%
and to negotiate over wages benefits and
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
working conditions black workers and
 
00:59:16.549 --> 00:59:16.559 align:start position:0%
white workers in the South came together
 
00:59:20.069 --> 00:59:20.079 align:start position:0%
and began to form unions oh no how can
 
00:59:21.789 --> 00:59:21.799 align:start position:0%
that possibly be happening in the Jim
 
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
Crow South so powerful
 
00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:27.480 align:start position:0%
industrialist um led by a gentleman
 
00:59:31.150 --> 00:59:31.160 align:start position:0%
named Vance muse from Texas got together
 
00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
and said how can we stop this and they
 
00:59:36.549 --> 00:59:36.559 align:start position:0%
dreamed up the concept of right to work
 
00:59:37.950 --> 00:59:37.960 align:start position:0%
what they called right to work they
 
00:59:39.789 --> 00:59:39.799 align:start position:0%
thought it was a great name that they
 
00:59:43.109 --> 00:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
invented but the concept was to enter
 
00:59:45.870 --> 00:59:45.880 align:start position:0%
into law made it um to
 
00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
prohibit in law um any kind of
 
00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:52.799 align:start position:0%
contractual um provision that said that
 
00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
all workers who were represented by the
 
00:59:56.789 --> 00:59:56.799 align:start position:0%
union black workers and white workers
 
00:59:58.870 --> 00:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
should contribute to the cost of
 
01:00:02.309 --> 01:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
contract negotiations not anything else
 
01:00:02.319 --> 01:00:03.589 align:start position:0%
contract negotiations not anything else
contract

01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
contract
 
01:00:06.510 --> 01:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
negotiations and they felt specifically
 
01:00:08.309 --> 01:00:08.319 align:start position:0%
that if they could do this and say to
 
01:00:10.309 --> 01:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
White workers you don't have to pay your
 
01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
union dues because we've passed a law in
 
01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:13.720 align:start position:0%
the state that you don't have to do that
 
01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
anymore and encourage white workers not
 
01:00:18.789 --> 01:00:18.799 align:start position:0%
to pay union dues that would completely
 
01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
eviscerate the collective power of the
 
01:00:25.029 --> 01:00:25.039 align:start position:0%
Union in that particular workplace and
 
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
just so um Vance Muse um who was leading
 
01:00:31.829 --> 01:00:31.839 align:start position:0%
this effort all across the South um from
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
Texas to the Atlantic Ocean um he also
 
01:00:36.910 --> 01:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
went before a US Senate hearing to talk
 
01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
about the value of these new laws that
 
01:00:42.109 --> 01:00:42.119 align:start position:0%
he had dreamed up and he said to the US
 
01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
Senate um in hearing I'm a southerner
 
01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:47.720 align:start position:0%
and a white supremacist and this is the
 
01:00:50.789 --> 01:00:50.799 align:start position:0%
way to go and then in his literature he
 
01:00:50.799 --> 01:00:51.950 align:start position:0%
way to go and then in his literature he
also

01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:00:55.470 --> 01:00:55.480 align:start position:0%
said this is what right to work is okay
 
01:00:57.549 --> 01:00:57.559 align:start position:0%
his literature promoting right to work
 
01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
laws said that if right to work laws
 
01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:03.839 align:start position:0%
were not passed and then this is a quote
 
01:01:08.670 --> 01:01:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:11.309 --> 01:01:11.319 align:start position:0%
here if right to work laws are not
 
01:01:14.109 --> 01:01:14.119 align:start position:0%
passed white women and white men will be
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
forced into organizations meaning unions
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
with black African Apes whom they will
 
01:01:24.069 --> 01:01:24.079 align:start position:0%
have to call brother or lose their jobs
 
01:01:26.309 --> 01:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
that is the origin of Right to Work its
 
01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
sole purpose is to divide workers on the
 
01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
job that remains its sole purpose today
 
01:01:35.230 --> 01:01:35.240 align:start position:0%
um just really quickly we heard
 
01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
Fantastical previous testimony uh in
 
01:01:40.710 --> 01:01:40.720 align:start position:0%
January from one of the sponsors of the
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
bill who painted a picture and said what
 
01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
if the New Hampshire AFL C and Walmart
 
01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
got together in cahoots and forced every
 
01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
Walmart worker um to become a union
 
01:01:52.069 --> 01:01:52.079 align:start position:0%
member that's what would happen if we
 
01:01:54.589 --> 01:01:54.599 align:start position:0%
don't pass right to work laws that is so
 
01:01:57.750 --> 01:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
Far From Reality coming from a sponsor
 
01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
it's scary um
 
01:02:04.109 --> 01:02:04.119 align:start position:0%
so unionized workers already have a
 
01:02:06.549 --> 01:02:06.559 align:start position:0%
freedom to vote democratically on
 
01:02:08.589 --> 01:02:08.599 align:start position:0%
whether or not they want a clause in
 
01:02:11.230 --> 01:02:11.240 align:start position:0%
their contract calling for all workers
 
01:02:13.349 --> 01:02:13.359 align:start position:0%
to share modestly in the cost of
 
01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
representation and contract
 
01:02:18.190 --> 01:02:18.200 align:start position:0%
Administration New Hampshire employers
 
01:02:20.029 --> 01:02:20.039 align:start position:0%
have the right to choose whether or not
 
01:02:22.269 --> 01:02:22.279 align:start position:0%
to have such a clause in their contract
 
01:02:23.789 --> 01:02:23.799 align:start position:0%
that addresses workers sharing the
 
01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
modest cost
 
01:02:27.870 --> 01:02:27.880 align:start position:0%
representation I don't know why um
 
01:02:30.309 --> 01:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
non-union employers are coming before
 
01:02:32.069 --> 01:02:32.079 align:start position:0%
you pleading for this because every
 
01:02:34.069 --> 01:02:34.079 align:start position:0%
non-union employer or frankly every
 
01:02:36.990 --> 01:02:37.000 align:start position:0%
unionized employer in this state already
 
01:02:39.990 --> 01:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
has a choice as to whether or not to
 
01:02:41.710 --> 01:02:41.720 align:start position:0%
accept a certain provision in their
 
01:02:44.269 --> 01:02:44.279 align:start position:0%
contract it's their choice it shouldn't
 
01:02:48.269 --> 01:02:48.279 align:start position:0%
be your choice in the Live Free or Die
 
01:02:50.589 --> 01:02:50.599 align:start position:0%
State um New Hampshire workers have a
 
01:02:52.309 --> 01:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
freedom to choose whether or not to seek
 
01:02:53.829 --> 01:02:53.839 align:start position:0%
employment in any place where they're
 
01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
already exist a democratically um you
 
01:02:59.870 --> 01:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
know organized Union um it's already
 
01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:01.720 align:start position:0%
legally established that no worker can
 
01:03:03.789 --> 01:03:03.799 align:start position:0%
be forced to be a union member and that
 
01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
the freedom and the process already
 
01:03:08.109 --> 01:03:08.119 align:start position:0%
exists to seek seek relief even from
 
01:03:10.069 --> 01:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
Modest sharing in the cost of Union
 
01:03:12.109 --> 01:03:12.119 align:start position:0%
representation and I want to say
 
01:03:14.029 --> 01:03:14.039 align:start position:0%
something about construction
 
01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
construction contractors have the
 
01:03:17.829 --> 01:03:17.839 align:start position:0%
freedom to choose whether or not to
 
01:03:20.269 --> 01:03:20.279 align:start position:0%
enter into Partnerships with their
 
01:03:22.750 --> 01:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
construction unions so that the union
 
01:03:25.309 --> 01:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
not the employer the Union Bears the
 
01:03:27.269 --> 01:03:27.279 align:start position:0%
major responsibility for employee
 
01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:29.960 align:start position:0%
screening and training in a way that
 
01:03:31.829 --> 01:03:31.839 align:start position:0%
makes those contractors those employers
 
01:03:34.470 --> 01:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
more productive and competitive if you
 
01:03:36.870 --> 01:03:36.880 align:start position:0%
prohibit these agreements in the state
 
01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire how is this legislature
 
01:03:42.510 --> 01:03:42.520 align:start position:0%
going to compensate those employers and
 
01:03:43.589 --> 01:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
make them
 
01:03:48.549 --> 01:03:48.559 align:start position:0%
whole so um one thing the at the last
 
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
hearing one of the proponents of um the
 
01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
right to work Bill said in the hearing
 
01:03:54.549 --> 01:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if it was captured in
 
01:03:56.549 --> 01:03:56.559 align:start position:0%
the microphone or whether it was just an
 
01:03:58.269 --> 01:03:58.279 align:start position:0%
aside that he said afterwards but what
 
01:04:00.029 --> 01:04:00.039 align:start position:0%
he said is he kind of turned to the side
 
01:04:01.349 --> 01:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
and he said he sort of looked at
 
01:04:03.549 --> 01:04:03.559 align:start position:0%
committee this committee members and
 
01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
said why don't you just vote 10 to 10
 
01:04:08.190 --> 01:04:08.200 align:start position:0%
and be done with it and the message to
 
01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
me about that is that nobody is
 
01:04:12.829 --> 01:04:12.839 align:start position:0%
listening nobody is listening to the
 
01:04:15.069 --> 01:04:15.079 align:start position:0%
employers that have come before you and
 
01:04:17.269 --> 01:04:17.279 align:start position:0%
said don't do this to this just vote the
 
01:04:18.990 --> 01:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
way you've always voted and and you know
 
01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:22.480 align:start position:0%

01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
lir thank you Mr chair and thanks for
 
01:05:37.789 --> 01:05:37.799 align:start position:0%
your testimony when you were a union
 
01:05:41.069 --> 01:05:41.079 align:start position:0%
boss did you force all your people to
 
01:05:43.670 --> 01:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
pay you or or to join and did you use
 
01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:45.839 align:start position:0%
that money for big vacations and and
 
01:05:46.789 --> 01:05:46.799 align:start position:0%
things like
 
01:05:51.510 --> 01:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
that absolutely not our members wanted
 
01:05:53.829 --> 01:05:53.839 align:start position:0%
very much to be a part of the Union so
 
01:05:55.349 --> 01:05:55.359 align:start position:0%
that collectively they could have a
 
01:05:57.630 --> 01:05:57.640 align:start position:0%
voice on the job it was something that
 
01:05:59.430 --> 01:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
people aspired to which is why the
 
01:06:01.470 --> 01:06:01.480 align:start position:0%
workers came to together collectively to
 
01:06:04.430 --> 01:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
form the union to begin with no forcing
 
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
involved thank you thank you Mr chair

members of the committee thank you for
 
01:06:24.349 --> 01:06:24.359 align:start position:0%
your time I will be extraordinary fairly
 
01:06:26.670 --> 01:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
brief as you have many people here who
 
01:06:28.670 --> 01:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
will say the same things that I will and
 
01:06:30.589 --> 01:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to affirm for the people
 
01:06:32.510 --> 01:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
of Peter bro the union workers that I
 
01:06:34.589 --> 01:06:34.599 align:start position:0%
have in my town that right to work is
 
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
wrong for New Hampshire I don't support
 
01:06:38.269 --> 01:06:38.279 align:start position:0%
it the union workers here don't support
 
01:06:41.549 --> 01:06:41.559 align:start position:0%
it unions are important because workers
 
01:06:43.269 --> 01:06:43.279 align:start position:0%
when they are individually working with
 
01:06:45.549 --> 01:06:45.559 align:start position:0%
their boss don't have any power and what
 
01:06:47.829 --> 01:06:47.839 align:start position:0%
unions need is that collective
 
01:06:50.190 --> 01:06:50.200 align:start position:0%
bargaining to allow themselves to have
 
01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
that power with their employer to be
 
01:06:54.630 --> 01:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
able to make decent wages to be able to
 
01:06:57.630 --> 01:06:57.640 align:start position:0%
get vacation hours to be able to work
 
01:07:00.789 --> 01:07:00.799 align:start position:0%
more uh for the for their dollar people
 
01:07:04.069 --> 01:07:04.079 align:start position:0%
deserve to be able to work one job and
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
meet their wages and what's happening
 
01:07:07.630 --> 01:07:07.640 align:start position:0%
right now in the United States I know it
 
01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
because I'm living it right now I I get
 
01:07:11.470 --> 01:07:11.480 align:start position:0%
the privilege of being a legislator but
 
01:07:13.710 --> 01:07:13.720 align:start position:0%
I have to be busy busy busy to make sure
 
01:07:16.549 --> 01:07:16.559 align:start position:0%
that the bills are made people are
 
01:07:19.470 --> 01:07:19.480 align:start position:0%
underwater and they need unions to be
 
01:07:21.789 --> 01:07:21.799 align:start position:0%
able to get them out of that to be able
 
01:07:25.549 --> 01:07:25.559 align:start position:0%
to work collectively in order to move
 
01:07:28.349 --> 01:07:28.359 align:start position:0%
forward and unions have built what we
 
01:07:30.029 --> 01:07:30.039 align:start position:0%
see here today they're the reason we
 
01:07:31.829 --> 01:07:31.839 align:start position:0%
have the weekend they're the reason we
 
01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
have any labor protection that we have
 
01:07:35.309 --> 01:07:35.319 align:start position:0%
right now and I think supporting the
 
01:07:37.309 --> 01:07:37.319 align:start position:0%
unions is an important thing and I'm
 
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
here against right to work so thank you
 
01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman for your time and I will get
 
01:07:43.029 --> 01:07:43.039 align:start position:0%

this bill seems to go after that's
 
01:09:08.070 --> 01:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
already encapsulated in federal and

01:09:46.829 --> 01:09:46.839 align:start position:0%
I'm chairman of the conservative
 
01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
committee right now I still am chairman
 
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
of that committee I um even though I'm
 
01:09:55.270 --> 01:09:55.280 align:start position:0%
retired I was a part of the collective
 
01:09:59.189 --> 01:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
bargaining team and I was in a year that
 
01:10:02.070 --> 01:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
it was it was tough Financial Times and
 
01:10:04.870 --> 01:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
we worked with the governor you know
 
01:10:06.430 --> 01:10:06.440 align:start position:0%
those that were elected to the
 
01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining committee worked
 
01:10:11.189 --> 01:10:11.199 align:start position:0%
with the governor on making sure we
 
01:10:15.870 --> 01:10:15.880 align:start position:0%
preserve jobs and that we we cut medical
 
01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
costs where we could and that we also
 
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
got pay increases we did that with a
 
01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
survey the survey went out to people
 
01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
when you are asked to join a union you
 
01:10:32.830 --> 01:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
are asked um to sign a card and ask for
 
01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
that money to be taken out of your
 
01:10:37.270 --> 01:10:37.280 align:start position:0%
paychecks that's completely volunteer
 
01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
and even after the Janice decision
 
01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
happened which was June 27th
 
01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
2018 which eliminated the fair share
 
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
membership requirement which seems to be
 
01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
the crust of this bill um that no longer
 
01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:54.189 align:start position:0%
the crust of this bill um that no longer
happens

01:10:54.189 --> 01:10:54.199 align:start position:0%
happens
 
01:10:58.350 --> 01:10:58.360 align:start position:0%
for public um
 
01:11:01.110 --> 01:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
employees the state of New Hampshire
 
01:11:06.030 --> 01:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
has four unions that represent um
 
01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
10,27 positions in n in
 
01:11:13.709 --> 01:11:13.719 align:start position:0%
20122 of those positions only
 
01:11:18.910 --> 01:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
7,527 were filled and of those filled
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
positions SEIU represented
 
01:11:26.110 --> 01:11:26.120 align:start position:0%
4,910 which were due paying members so
 
01:11:28.870 --> 01:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
as you can see overwhelmingly
 
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
voluntarily people are joining unions
 
01:11:33.070 --> 01:11:33.080 align:start position:0%
because they believe in the principles
 
01:11:36.149 --> 01:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
it brings and the benefits it
 
01:11:40.189 --> 01:11:40.199 align:start position:0%
brings so already in
 
01:11:44.189 --> 01:11:44.199 align:start position:0%
legislation you know um there is that
 
01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:46.360 align:start position:0%
prohibition from the right to strike is
 
01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
already prohibited in state leg in the
 
01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
state legislation and one thing this
 
01:11:54.669 --> 01:11:54.679 align:start position:0%
bill does that is completely
 
01:11:57.709 --> 01:11:57.719 align:start position:0%
unnecessary even if it was to pass for
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
some reason this part should definitely
 
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
come out of it which is 273
 
01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
D9 which um
 
01:12:11.669 --> 01:12:11.679 align:start position:0%
which h establishes a penalty section
 
01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
that says any person employer labor
 
01:12:16.030 --> 01:12:16.040 align:start position:0%
organization agent or representative of
 
01:12:18.590 --> 01:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
an employer or labor organization who
 
01:12:21.669 --> 01:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
directly or indirectly imposes upon any
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
person a requirement prohibit by this
 
01:12:27.189 --> 01:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor
 
01:12:29.629 --> 01:12:29.639 align:start position:0%
and um you know may have a fine not
 
01:12:32.510 --> 01:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
exceeding $1,000 and up to 90 days in
 
01:12:35.189 --> 01:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
prison there's no definition of this I
 
01:12:39.870 --> 01:12:39.880 align:start position:0%
believe the um you know
 
01:12:44.350 --> 01:12:44.360 align:start position:0%
the they there is a fiscal note on this
 
01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
um because they didn't know how to how
 
01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
they would impose this how would you
 
01:12:51.149 --> 01:12:51.159 align:start position:0%
impose it for what so please take that
 
01:12:54.189 --> 01:12:54.199 align:start position:0%
out that doesn't belong in any part of
 
01:12:56.910 --> 01:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
right to work in any sense of the
 
01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:59.310 align:start position:0%
right to work in any sense of the
imagination

01:12:59.310 --> 01:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
imagination
 
01:13:03.709 --> 01:13:03.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:07.870 --> 01:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
um the state contract that we get for
 
01:13:11.910 --> 01:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
years has been has been put together and
 
01:13:15.149 --> 01:13:15.159 align:start position:0%
organized by Union representation formed
 
01:13:17.149 --> 01:13:17.159 align:start position:0%
together by employees joining together
 
01:13:18.350 --> 01:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
have one
 
01:13:21.790 --> 01:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
voice and full represent representation
 
01:13:25.470 --> 01:13:25.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:28.590 --> 01:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
and through elected
 
01:13:31.669 --> 01:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
leaders the president or the union boss
 
01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
is an elected leader so all of this is a
 
01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
very public very well organized process
 
01:13:40.990 --> 01:13:41.000 align:start position:0%
it saves the state of New Hampshire a
 
01:13:44.189 --> 01:13:44.199 align:start position:0%
lot of money from you know having a
 
01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
negotiated contract that everybody comes
 
01:13:50.830 --> 01:13:50.840 align:start position:0%
to the table and having a process where
 
01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
contract infractions are are go through
 
01:13:58.310 --> 01:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
committees and and do everything and so
 
01:13:58.320 --> 01:13:59.149 align:start position:0%

through their voluntary membership of
 
01:14:15.950 --> 01:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
the many labor unions of the State of
 
01:14:20.270 --> 01:14:20.280 align:start position:0%

Joe

01:14:43.830 --> 01:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:51.629 --> 01:14:51.639 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman Joe Guthrie
 
01:14:54.229 --> 01:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
for the record I represent at
 
01:14:58.430 --> 01:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
Hamstead uh and I'm here mainly
 
01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
because I'm get concerned when we see
 
01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
the bills over and over again quite sure
 
01:15:07.350 --> 01:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
you you have more
 
01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
information than then then you really
 
01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
need to make a decision and I I just
 
01:15:16.229 --> 01:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
want to put a face on someone who votes
 
01:15:18.510 --> 01:15:18.520 align:start position:0%
against bills like
 
01:15:22.270 --> 01:15:22.280 align:start position:0%
this uh I have voted against them I'm
 
01:15:25.270 --> 01:15:25.280 align:start position:0%
one of the few that voted against a bill
 
01:15:28.750 --> 01:15:28.760 align:start position:0%
similar to this at the last time that uh
 
01:15:31.390 --> 01:15:31.400 align:start position:0%
was very controversial so I would just
 
01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
like to tell you that my experience and
 
01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
I'm the oldest member of the house uh
 
01:15:39.709 --> 01:15:39.719 align:start position:0%
and I see a lot of white hairs and I
 
01:15:42.910 --> 01:15:42.920 align:start position:0%
hope that that says to me that you have
 
01:15:45.510 --> 01:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
the same kind of life experience that I
 
01:15:50.590 --> 01:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
may have had and I came to uh as a Young
 
01:15:55.390 --> 01:15:55.400 align:start position:0%
Man uh in a union uh was just beginning
 
01:15:57.310 --> 01:15:57.320 align:start position:0%
and we had such a thing as
 
01:15:59.910 --> 01:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
scaps I don't even know if anybody knows
 
01:16:02.189 --> 01:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
what that word means anywhere it
 
01:16:04.830 --> 01:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
happened to be people who didn't want to
 
01:16:07.790 --> 01:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
pay their way didn't want to pay their
 
01:16:12.629 --> 01:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
dues and in those days the union needed
 
01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
as much protection as they could have
 
01:16:17.870 --> 01:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
and I think they still need that
 
01:16:21.390 --> 01:16:21.400 align:start position:0%
protection and I I'm sorry to see that
 
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
there is a move that uh
 
01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh is doing what some anything to weaken
 
01:16:32.430 --> 01:16:32.440 align:start position:0%
the relationship between labor and the
 
01:16:35.470 --> 01:16:35.480 align:start position:0%
union and I would suggest to you that
 
01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
that relationship is stronger and better
 
01:16:42.070 --> 01:16:42.080 align:start position:0%
when everybody
 
01:16:46.310 --> 01:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
participates and uh pays their way well
 
01:16:48.990 --> 01:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
I don't really have any questions but I
 
01:16:51.189 --> 01:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
will answer them but that's I just
 
01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to put a face on someone who at
 
01:16:56.709 --> 01:16:56.719 align:start position:0%
least has has gone through what the
 
01:17:00.229 --> 01:17:00.239 align:start position:0%
union went through uh getting organized
 
01:17:03.310 --> 01:17:03.320 align:start position:0%
and uh but that was a different
 
01:17:07.390 --> 01:17:07.400 align:start position:0%
situation I'd hate to see that go back
 
01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
we resurrect the word scab thank you for
 
01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:15.480 align:start position:0%

job good morning Mr Leiden ibw
 
01:17:43.510 --> 01:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
welcome chair committee thank you for
 
01:17:47.149 --> 01:17:47.159 align:start position:0%
taking tons of testimony um I know was a
 
01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
little bit more than you guys usually
 
01:17:51.790 --> 01:17:51.800 align:start position:0%
get um I'll try to talk about things
 
01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
that haven't already been talked about
 
01:17:54.910 --> 01:17:54.920 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to give a little bit of my
 
01:17:57.629 --> 01:17:57.639 align:start position:0%
personal experience with unions uh I'm a
 
01:17:59.870 --> 01:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
union electrician unlike a lot of the
 
01:18:01.590 --> 01:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
people that have spoken today I'm not a
 
01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
lifelong Union member I did 18 years out
 
01:18:09.030 --> 01:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
of the Union working privately um was
 
01:18:10.950 --> 01:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
never bothered I was never forced to go
 
01:18:14.189 --> 01:18:14.199 align:start position:0%
and work in a union until actually the
 
01:18:15.510 --> 01:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
first interaction I had with the Union
 
01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
was when I decided that I wanted to join
 
01:18:19.390 --> 01:18:19.400 align:start position:0%
a union because I wanted the retirement
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
benefits that came with it so I know the
 
01:18:26.189 --> 01:18:26.199 align:start position:0%
the big thing that has been said in uh
 
01:18:28.189 --> 01:18:28.199 align:start position:0%
the positive towards this bill is that
 
01:18:30.229 --> 01:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
it's to protect workers from being
 
01:18:32.830 --> 01:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
harassed by unions I worked 18 years for
 
01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
some of the biggest non-union
 
01:18:35.590 --> 01:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
contractors I never got approached by
 
01:18:38.590 --> 01:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
unions ever got harassed to become a
 
01:18:40.870 --> 01:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
part of a union like I said the first
 
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
time that I ever spoke with a union rep
 
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
to become a union member was when I
 
01:18:49.550 --> 01:18:49.560 align:start position:0%
decided that I wanted to be
 
01:18:54.149 --> 01:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
um I understand what they're saying with
 
01:18:56.149 --> 01:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
um if the unions offer a great
 
01:18:58.270 --> 01:18:58.280 align:start position:0%
product then people will want to be
 
01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
union members we all appreciate the
 
01:19:02.830 --> 01:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
roads we appreciate the firefighters but
 
01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
if taxes were opt in absolutely no one
 
01:19:06.910 --> 01:19:06.920 align:start position:0%
would opt in we know that that's that's
 
01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
human nature um so to rely on people to
 
01:19:11.870 --> 01:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
opt in if it's a great business model
 
01:19:14.270 --> 01:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
and the government switch to it be
 
01:19:16.229 --> 01:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
bankrupt within a real short amount of
 
01:19:17.470 --> 01:19:17.480 align:start position:0%
time because again it's just not in
 
01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
human nature to opt into things like
 
01:19:22.229 --> 01:19:22.239 align:start position:0%
that even though we like the services
 
01:19:23.629 --> 01:19:23.639 align:start position:0%
that they provide
 
01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
so even some of our members that enjoy
 
01:19:27.629 --> 01:19:27.639 align:start position:0%
the services that are being offered they
 
01:19:31.550 --> 01:19:31.560 align:start position:0%
may not opt in and uh in the state right
 
01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:33.320 align:start position:0%
now we're Electrical Workers inside
 
01:19:35.950 --> 01:19:35.960 align:start position:0%
construction we build buildings we have
 
01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
a deficit of Electrical Workers right
 
01:19:41.950 --> 01:19:41.960 align:start position:0%
now and we operate a multi-million
 
01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
dollar training facility that was all
 
01:19:46.189 --> 01:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
privately paid for and privately funded
 
01:19:47.870 --> 01:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
so we are providing electricians to the
 
01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire never taken a
 
01:19:51.470 --> 01:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
dime of tax money for that we haven't
 
01:19:54.229 --> 01:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
taken a tax break that's all paid for by
 
01:19:56.629 --> 01:19:56.639 align:start position:0%
our members contributing to that and our
 
01:19:59.709 --> 01:19:59.719 align:start position:0%
contractors contributing um like I said
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
I want to try and keep my testimony
 
01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
pretty short because I know there's a
 
01:20:04.750 --> 01:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
lot of people that want to speak I'll
 
01:20:09.709 --> 01:20:09.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:12.790 --> 01:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
has Madam
 
01:20:16.110 --> 01:20:16.120 align:start position:0%
clerk thank you Mr chair um forgive me
 
01:20:20.470 --> 01:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
if you said this but doesn't your union
 
01:20:24.030 --> 01:20:24.040 align:start position:0%
also as a benefit to future members and
 
01:20:26.189 --> 01:20:26.199 align:start position:0%
current members and the recruitment of a
 
01:20:29.310 --> 01:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
very important aspect of our economy
 
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
have a training academy too a training
 
01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
facility yes we have a training facility
 
01:20:37.990 --> 01:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
it was built in 2008 and it cost $1.3
 
01:20:41.709 --> 01:20:41.719 align:start position:0%
million to build um we don't we charge
 
01:20:43.790 --> 01:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
our students that come into our apprenti
 
01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
ship $200 that's it um it costs us about
 
01:20:50.149 --> 01:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
$2,800 just in the books per student
 
01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
that's all paid for by the members
 
01:20:54.229 --> 01:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
contributing to the education of our
 
01:20:57.550 --> 01:20:57.560 align:start position:0%
future electricians and again this is
 
01:20:59.629 --> 01:20:59.639 align:start position:0%
this is an education that we provide
 
01:21:01.270 --> 01:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
without taking any money from the
 
01:21:03.790 --> 01:21:03.800 align:start position:0%
government to train electricians to work
 
01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:09.629 --> 01:21:09.639 align:start position:0%
state all right thank you very much for
 
01:21:12.270 --> 01:21:12.280 align:start position:0%
your testimony oh I'm sorry one more
 
01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
01:21:15.790 --> 01:21:15.800 align:start position:0%
love thank you for taking my question
 
01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I've heard a lot
 
01:21:21.149 --> 01:21:21.159 align:start position:0%
where you know uh unions complain that
 
01:21:23.790 --> 01:21:23.800 align:start position:0%
uh non-paying um employees are
 
01:21:25.510 --> 01:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
benefiting from collective bargaining
 
01:21:28.229 --> 01:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
and all the benefits and have the unions
 
01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
ever thought about going to the the
 
01:21:32.950 --> 01:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
federal delegation where the where the
 
01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
pro problem actually exists as far as
 
01:21:37.830 --> 01:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
that goes uh to to remove that from
 
01:21:41.470 --> 01:21:41.480 align:start position:0%
National Labor Relations Bo U uh
 
01:21:44.910 --> 01:21:44.920 align:start position:0%
statutes to uh to to make it so if uh if
 
01:21:47.590 --> 01:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not paying you don't have to serve
 
01:21:52.189 --> 01:21:52.199 align:start position:0%
me to my knowledge no um we have
 
01:21:56.030 --> 01:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
obviously Internationals uh that serve
 
01:21:58.510 --> 01:21:58.520 align:start position:0%
in DC and speak to that for the most
 
01:22:00.350 --> 01:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
part though our unions in the Building
 
01:22:02.870 --> 01:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
Trades all kind of operate autonomously
 
01:22:04.550 --> 01:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
we're kind of our own government we're
 
01:22:07.310 --> 01:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
set up much like you guys are so as far
 
01:22:10.430 --> 01:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
as like as far as bargaining for your
 
01:22:14.310 --> 01:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
own uh benefits and your own wages the
 
01:22:15.430 --> 01:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
other thing to keep in mind is we only
 
01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
set minimums so we don't set speed
 
01:22:20.110 --> 01:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
limits we don't set the cap we have a
 
01:22:21.910 --> 01:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
lot of members that make well over what
 
01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
the basic requirements are alls we set
 
01:22:26.950 --> 01:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
with our CBA is this is the least that
 
01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
you can pay someone but it's not the
 
01:22:30.110 --> 01:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
most you can pay someone we have plenty
 
01:22:32.470 --> 01:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
of people that have negotiated for
 
01:22:34.750 --> 01:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
themselves above and beyond the Union
 
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
contract um most of our general foremen
 
01:22:39.229 --> 01:22:39.239 align:start position:0%
and our foremen who are overseeing the
 
01:22:41.310 --> 01:22:41.320 align:start position:0%
bigger jobs like lonz of pharmaceuticals
 
01:22:42.629 --> 01:22:42.639 align:start position:0%
and some of the bigger construction
 
01:22:45.229 --> 01:22:45.239 align:start position:0%
projects in the state they get paid well
 
01:22:47.950 --> 01:22:47.960 align:start position:0%
over what our our minimum CBA is that's
 
01:22:49.910 --> 01:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
just that's the basic of what you can
 
01:22:51.470 --> 01:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
offer but you can always negotiate with
 
01:22:54.669 --> 01:22:54.679 align:start position:0%
your contractor if you're worth more to
 
01:22:56.709 --> 01:22:56.719 align:start position:0%
get more than what the CBA is you're not
 
01:23:00.590 --> 01:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
limited in that sense
 
01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
um follow
 
01:23:06.750 --> 01:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
up my uh my question was basically um
 
01:23:08.310 --> 01:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
you know the the fact that unions
 
01:23:09.910 --> 01:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
complain that you know there's there's
 
01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
Free Loaders okay I don't like that
 
01:23:13.310 --> 01:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
either I don't I don't think I should be
 
01:23:15.350 --> 01:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
getting uh I should be able to mark walk
 
01:23:17.390 --> 01:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
walk into Market Basket and grab a half
 
01:23:19.669 --> 01:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
a dozen stakes and walk out okay it's
 
01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
not right and that's essentially what
 
01:23:22.910 --> 01:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
happens when there's somebody reloading
 
01:23:26.669 --> 01:23:26.679 align:start position:0%
on the union okay my question is have
 
01:23:26.679 --> 01:23:27.310 align:start position:0%
on the union okay my question is have
the

01:23:27.310 --> 01:23:27.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:23:29.390 --> 01:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
unions you know gone to the federal
 
01:23:31.350 --> 01:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
delegation with the problem that's the
 
01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
Crux of the problem as far as that
 
01:23:36.030 --> 01:23:36.040 align:start position:0%
problem goes uh you know uh i' I'd like
 
01:23:38.390 --> 01:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
to see it change myself and uh and it'll
 
01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
take the unions to to do it and uh you
 
01:23:43.270 --> 01:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
know it's not whether you you know
 
01:23:45.629 --> 01:23:45.639 align:start position:0%
somebody can re renegotiate their wages
 
01:23:49.830 --> 01:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
or anything um but um you know uh has
 
01:23:51.470 --> 01:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
has it ever happened
 
01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:53.070 align:start position:0%
has it ever happened
is

01:23:53.070 --> 01:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge no um if sorry if I
 
01:23:58.750 --> 01:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
understand your your question correctly
 
01:24:00.910 --> 01:24:00.920 align:start position:0%
you're asking if we've ever gone and
 
01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
confronted like our International
 
01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
offices about what they're
 
01:24:09.550 --> 01:24:09.560 align:start position:0%
doing no the federal delegation I'm
 
01:24:11.149 --> 01:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
sorry sorry I didn't understand senators
 
01:24:13.669 --> 01:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
and and Congressman uh no to my to my
 
01:24:16.030 --> 01:24:16.040 align:start position:0%
knowledge I know that we have lobbyists
 
01:24:18.310 --> 01:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
and stuff up in DC like everyone does
 
01:24:20.510 --> 01:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
but as far as what they're actively
 
01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
involved in we don't really stay on top
 
01:24:26.030 --> 01:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
of it that's kind of why we pay them so
 
01:24:27.350 --> 01:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
as just a business agent in New
 
01:24:29.350 --> 01:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I I try to focus on just
 
01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
what's going on in the state because as
 
01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
you can see there's plenty for us to
 
01:24:35.830 --> 01:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
focus on just right
 
01:24:39.669 --> 01:24:39.679 align:start position:0%

isn't really an issue for you but do you
 
01:24:59.270 --> 01:24:59.280 align:start position:0%

01:25:00.669 --> 01:25:00.679 align:start position:0%
an electrician to come to your house and
 
01:25:00.679 --> 01:25:02.629 align:start position:0%
an electrician to come to your house and
th

01:25:02.629 --> 01:25:02.639 align:start position:0%
th
 
01:25:06.910 --> 01:25:06.920 align:start position:0%
something uh yeah pretty long time um
 
01:25:08.590 --> 01:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
there's there's a lot of Labor shortages
 
01:25:12.229 --> 01:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
right now in state um
 
01:25:16.790 --> 01:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
we're we're not um devoid of that we
 
01:25:18.310 --> 01:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
have issues too even trying to bring
 
01:25:20.109 --> 01:25:20.119 align:start position:0%
kids into the program uh we can usually
 
01:25:22.590 --> 01:25:22.600 align:start position:0%
take in about 20 to 40 depending upon
 
01:25:24.669 --> 01:25:24.679 align:start position:0%
whether we split the class up we
 
01:25:26.510 --> 01:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
struggle sometimes to get enough to fill
 
01:25:28.910 --> 01:25:28.920 align:start position:0%
those classes and even when we have
 
01:25:30.669 --> 01:25:30.679 align:start position:0%
hiring sprees where we're looking for
 
01:25:32.830 --> 01:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
more workers everyone that wants a job
 
01:25:34.470 --> 01:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
is working so there's there's very few
 
01:25:36.990 --> 01:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
people that are out of work right now so
 
01:25:39.470 --> 01:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
yeah I I know it's extremely difficult
 
01:25:41.709 --> 01:25:41.719 align:start position:0%
to get any trade especially electricians
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%

bill that is coming over and over again
 
01:26:16.709 --> 01:26:16.719 align:start position:0%
as someone who um it was a a union
 
01:26:19.030 --> 01:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
member back in the days when I work for
 
01:26:22.270 --> 01:26:22.280 align:start position:0%
H senator Amy kashar let me tell you
 
01:26:24.390 --> 01:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
being a union member it was the best
 
01:26:26.109 --> 01:26:26.119 align:start position:0%
thing that happened to me as an
 
01:26:29.390 --> 01:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
organizer forred uh a
 
01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
senator just to give you a little bit of
 
01:26:34.270 --> 01:26:34.280 align:start position:0%
brief background when you work as an
 
01:26:37.350 --> 01:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
organizer you get paid salary you're
 
01:26:39.229 --> 01:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
supposed to work 40 hours but at the end
 
01:26:42.149 --> 01:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
of the day you work seven days a week
 
01:26:45.430 --> 01:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
sometime 80 to 100 hours a
 
01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
week and after we we got signed into a
 
01:26:51.750 --> 01:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
contract and then we uh come part of the
 
01:26:55.870 --> 01:26:55.880 align:start position:0%
Union everything change our rise change
 
01:26:57.590 --> 01:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
the way that we work in we didn't work
 
01:27:00.149 --> 01:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
seven days a week anymore we were
 
01:27:01.990 --> 01:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
allowed to have days
 
01:27:04.990 --> 01:27:05.000 align:start position:0%
off we have sick time and we have more
 
01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
benefits than before that we come in
 
01:27:09.990 --> 01:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
part of the Union my husband he's an
 
01:27:12.790 --> 01:27:12.800 align:start position:0%
electrician here in New
 
01:27:15.149 --> 01:27:15.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and then my son he's an
 
01:27:18.149 --> 01:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
electrician in North Carolina and to be
 
01:27:20.629 --> 01:27:20.639 align:start position:0%
honest what what we seeing in the trade
 
01:27:23.390 --> 01:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
is like we need more people in the trade
 
01:27:26.629 --> 01:27:26.639 align:start position:0%
we keep telling kids to get in debt to
 
01:27:30.350 --> 01:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
go to college and then be $200 to
 
01:27:34.430 --> 01:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
$300 $300,000 in dead and a lot of these
 
01:27:36.629 --> 01:27:36.639 align:start position:0%
kids don't even get a job in they what
 
01:27:38.750 --> 01:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
they went to school for and they ended
 
01:27:41.350 --> 01:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
up going to a trade school why we don't
 
01:27:43.990 --> 01:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
push more for people to be in the trades
 
01:27:45.830 --> 01:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
because that's what we need the people
 
01:27:48.310 --> 01:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
right now we don't have enough people
 
01:27:49.790 --> 01:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
and I'm grateful that a lot of the
 
01:27:54.070 --> 01:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
unions and I'm going to be saying this a
 
01:27:55.470 --> 01:27:55.480 align:start position:0%
lot of these
 
01:27:59.470 --> 01:27:59.480 align:start position:0%
unions have refugees legal document
 
01:28:01.229 --> 01:28:01.239 align:start position:0%
people who come
 
01:28:04.709 --> 01:28:04.719 align:start position:0%
here going into the trades train them
 
01:28:06.149 --> 01:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
because they already have a background
 
01:28:09.229 --> 01:28:09.239 align:start position:0%
in their countries and help them to make
 
01:28:11.950 --> 01:28:11.960 align:start position:0%
sure they get the proper training and
 
01:28:14.629 --> 01:28:14.639 align:start position:0%
they they are part of the trade here in
 
01:28:17.470 --> 01:28:17.480 align:start position:0%
the US so I'm grateful to for the junion
 
01:28:20.510 --> 01:28:20.520 align:start position:0%

01:29:12.229 --> 01:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
Gregory Davis with my partner Susan I
 
01:29:13.790 --> 01:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
co-pastor to the Congregational Church
 
01:29:16.109 --> 01:29:16.119 align:start position:0%
in Meridan New Hampshire and am part of
 
01:29:18.790 --> 01:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
the United Church of Christ that uh my
 
01:29:20.709 --> 01:29:20.719 align:start position:0%
uh colleague Gail referred to as the
 
01:29:22.990 --> 01:29:23.000 align:start position:0%
largest POS denomination in the state
 
01:29:24.990 --> 01:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
which has consistently advocated worker
 
01:29:26.990 --> 01:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
rights I want to begin by saying that I
 
01:29:28.910 --> 01:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
am not now nor I have ever been part of
 
01:29:31.790 --> 01:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
a union but like most of you I assume
 
01:29:32.950 --> 01:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
unless any of you are independently
 
01:29:35.830 --> 01:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
wealthy I work for a living and those of
 
01:29:37.590 --> 01:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
us who work know what it means to be
 
01:29:39.470 --> 01:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
paid well we know what it means to be
 
01:29:41.430 --> 01:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
not paid well we know what it means to
 
01:29:43.390 --> 01:29:43.400 align:start position:0%
take advantage of benefits that unions
 
01:29:45.950 --> 01:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
have made possible for us our world and
 
01:29:47.189 --> 01:29:47.199 align:start position:0%
our working conditions would be
 
01:29:49.750 --> 01:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
profoundly different had unions not
 
01:29:51.669 --> 01:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
organized to make sure that we had
 
01:29:53.709 --> 01:29:53.719 align:start position:0%
things like a 40-hour week and 8h hour
 
01:29:58.390 --> 01:29:58.400 align:start position:0%
day weekend and and uh time time off um
 
01:30:00.390 --> 01:30:00.400 align:start position:0%
and we all benefit from that regardless
 
01:30:02.270 --> 01:30:02.280 align:start position:0%
of whether we were part of the unions
 
01:30:04.709 --> 01:30:04.719 align:start position:0%
that uh advocated for that or not and my
 
01:30:06.470 --> 01:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
guess is none of us would want to live
 
01:30:07.750 --> 01:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
in a world where that didn't happen now
 
01:30:09.550 --> 01:30:09.560 align:start position:0%
let's be clear it didn't happen because
 
01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
the employer said let's take care of our
 
01:30:14.070 --> 01:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
people let's make sure that they're not
 
01:30:16.750 --> 01:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
overworked it happened because unions
 
01:30:19.189 --> 01:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
organized to demand what their employers
 
01:30:21.189 --> 01:30:21.199 align:start position:0%
were unwilling to give the strongest
 
01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
argument against against this right to
 
01:30:25.390 --> 01:30:25.400 align:start position:0%
work so-called bill that strangely keeps
 
01:30:27.229 --> 01:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
coming up in the state despite the fact
 
01:30:28.950 --> 01:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire thus far has the
 
01:30:30.350 --> 01:30:30.360 align:start position:0%
distinction being one of the few states
 
01:30:33.270 --> 01:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
that consistently says no and I trust
 
01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
and hope we'll be we'll do that again
 
01:30:36.310 --> 01:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
the strongest argument against it is
 
01:30:37.669 --> 01:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:30:39.990 --> 01:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
proponents have so little faith in their
 
01:30:42.830 --> 01:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
argument that they chose to lie and we
 
01:30:44.590 --> 01:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
keep talking about we keep using their
 
01:30:46.229 --> 01:30:46.239 align:start position:0%
language but their language is wrong
 
01:30:47.750 --> 01:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
there's nothing about this that has
 
01:30:48.990 --> 01:30:49.000 align:start position:0%
anything to do with the right to work
 
01:30:51.070 --> 01:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
there's nothing about it it's it's it's
 
01:30:54.189 --> 01:30:54.199 align:start position:0%
a dising genous naming misnaming of a
 
01:30:57.590 --> 01:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
bill to to um skew the conversation had
 
01:30:59.470 --> 01:30:59.480 align:start position:0%
they the the honesty and the Integrity
 
01:31:00.750 --> 01:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
they would have called it something like
 
01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
right to exploit or Right to Work For
 
01:31:05.590 --> 01:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
Less because this isn't about worker
 
01:31:08.189 --> 01:31:08.199 align:start position:0%
rights this is about disempowering
 
01:31:11.550 --> 01:31:11.560 align:start position:0%
unions so that employers have more power
 
01:31:13.470 --> 01:31:13.480 align:start position:0%
now let's also be clear that if the
 
01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
unions didn't exist this bill wouldn't
 
01:31:17.470 --> 01:31:17.480 align:start position:0%
be here and that's of course the goal of
 
01:31:20.669 --> 01:31:20.679 align:start position:0%
this bill to to disempower unions the
 
01:31:22.350 --> 01:31:22.360 align:start position:0%
whole argument about
 
01:31:23.669 --> 01:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
and to go back to to your question
 
01:31:25.709 --> 01:31:25.719 align:start position:0%
representative love about why why not
 
01:31:28.229 --> 01:31:28.239 align:start position:0%
just uh um disengage people who don't
 
01:31:30.149 --> 01:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
want to be part of the Union that's
 
01:31:32.669 --> 01:31:32.679 align:start position:0%
again that's missing the issue the
 
01:31:34.430 --> 01:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
reason this matters to employers and
 
01:31:36.109 --> 01:31:36.119 align:start position:0%
note by the way you're going to hear
 
01:31:38.629 --> 01:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
from very few if any workers that
 
01:31:41.109 --> 01:31:41.119 align:start position:0%
support this the reason employers want
 
01:31:43.229 --> 01:31:43.239 align:start position:0%
this is because they know that the fewer
 
01:31:44.990 --> 01:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
people there are that are part of unions
 
01:31:46.870 --> 01:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
they're paying dues the less power the
 
01:31:49.910 --> 01:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
unions have this is about disempowering
 
01:31:52.629 --> 01:31:52.639 align:start position:0%
unions it's not about a right to work
 
01:31:54.870 --> 01:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
and this just be and I just want to be
 
01:31:56.629 --> 01:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
clear about the conversation so that we
 
01:31:57.910 --> 01:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
we understand where we're coming from
 
01:32:00.149 --> 01:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
and the argument about you know uh
 
01:32:02.310 --> 01:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
freeloading I mean it's the argument
 
01:32:04.510 --> 01:32:04.520 align:start position:0%
used earlier was about taxes that if
 
01:32:05.550 --> 01:32:05.560 align:start position:0%
people were said well you know if you
 
01:32:07.470 --> 01:32:07.480 align:start position:0%
don't want to pay your taxes we you'll
 
01:32:08.910 --> 01:32:08.920 align:start position:0%
still get all the benefits but why
 
01:32:10.470 --> 01:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
should you have to pay taxes or if I
 
01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
ride up to a toll booth and I say well I
 
01:32:14.590 --> 01:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
believe in the right to drive and I I
 
01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
don't feel I should have to pay the toll
 
01:32:17.590 --> 01:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
these are ridiculous arguments we know
 
01:32:19.669 --> 01:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
that and we ought to be quite we we're
 
01:32:22.030 --> 01:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
wise enough I think to dismiss them to
 
01:32:24.350 --> 01:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
name this disingenuous dishonest
 
01:32:26.229 --> 01:32:26.239 align:start position:0%
fundamentally immoral bill for what it
 
01:32:28.470 --> 01:32:28.480 align:start position:0%
is and to and to make it inexpedient to
 
01:32:30.390 --> 01:32:30.400 align:start position:0%
legislate once again as New Hampshire
 
01:32:32.310 --> 01:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
has done consistently thus far and we
 
01:32:33.750 --> 01:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
are counting on you to do again this
 
01:32:35.470 --> 01:32:35.480 align:start position:0%
time thank
 
01:32:39.380 --> 01:32:39.390 align:start position:0%

morning okay good morning chairman
 
01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
infantine and members of the labor
 
01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Deborah house and I
 
01:33:04.510 --> 01:33:04.520 align:start position:0%
am the democratically elected president
 
01:33:06.550 --> 01:33:06.560 align:start position:0%
of the American Federation of teachers
 
01:33:09.270 --> 01:33:09.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I'm not a union boss
 
01:33:11.790 --> 01:33:11.800 align:start position:0%
you're a union boss no I'm not a union
 
01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
boss uh the members of our 27 locals
 
01:33:17.669 --> 01:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
elected me president and I'm here to
 
01:33:21.070 --> 01:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
represent them um and just to be clear
 
01:33:23.390 --> 01:33:23.400 align:start position:0%
we have mostly public sector workers but
 
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
we also do have one private sector local
 
01:33:28.590 --> 01:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
which is the ringe faculty Federation um
 
01:33:30.070 --> 01:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
so I'm here not only on behalf of our
 
01:33:32.709 --> 01:33:32.719 align:start position:0%
one private sector local but also all of
 
01:33:35.149 --> 01:33:35.159 align:start position:0%
our Union brothers and sisters and uh
 
01:33:37.629 --> 01:33:37.639 align:start position:0%
Union family in the private sector
 
01:33:39.629 --> 01:33:39.639 align:start position:0%
because uh we are here in staunch
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
opposition of HB 1377 the so-called
 
01:33:46.550 --> 01:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
right to work um it is and always has
 
01:33:49.070 --> 01:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
been not the New Hampshire way it is an
 
01:33:52.550 --> 01:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
interference in negotiation between
 
01:33:54.709 --> 01:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
employers and employees as represented
 
01:33:57.830 --> 01:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
by their unions we strongly stand for
 
01:34:01.149 --> 01:34:01.159 align:start position:0%
the rights of workers to join together
 
01:34:02.950 --> 01:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
in a union and negotiate with their
 
01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
employers over wages hours and working
 
01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
conditions because that's what allows
 
01:34:12.550 --> 01:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
you to have reasonable working
 
01:34:15.030 --> 01:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
conditions hours that allow you to do
 
01:34:16.350 --> 01:34:16.360 align:start position:0%
your job and still have a life
 
01:34:18.189 --> 01:34:18.199 align:start position:0%
afterwards still be able to go home to
 
01:34:20.550 --> 01:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
your family and enjoy some time with
 
01:34:22.629 --> 01:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
them before the end of the day before
 
01:34:25.270 --> 01:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
you're totally exhausted uh it's
 
01:34:27.229 --> 01:34:27.239 align:start position:0%
something that we all kind of aspire to
 
01:34:30.189 --> 01:34:30.199 align:start position:0%
to be able to you know have a life
 
01:34:32.430 --> 01:34:32.440 align:start position:0%
outside of work
 
01:34:34.310 --> 01:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
um we
 
01:34:37.830 --> 01:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
are in opposition to HB 1377 because it
 
01:34:39.870 --> 01:34:39.880 align:start position:0%
represents government interference
 
01:34:42.149 --> 01:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
between what private
 
01:34:45.310 --> 01:34:45.320 align:start position:0%
employers and the employees can bargain
 
01:34:49.310 --> 01:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
over and if those employers choose to
 
01:34:51.790 --> 01:34:51.800 align:start position:0%
agree with their employees that there
 
01:34:56.510 --> 01:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
should be a fee paid for the service of
 
01:34:59.550 --> 01:34:59.560 align:start position:0%
negotiating and maintaining the
 
01:35:03.470 --> 01:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
contract then that fee can become a
 
01:35:05.790 --> 01:35:05.800 align:start position:0%
condition of employment just like the
 
01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
employer can set other conditions of
 
01:35:11.229 --> 01:35:11.239 align:start position:0%
employment like dress code or what the
 
01:35:14.189 --> 01:35:14.199 align:start position:0%
hours are you have to report to work
 
01:35:15.510 --> 01:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
unreasonable this is not something that
 
01:35:19.070 --> 01:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
is somehow
 
01:35:22.149 --> 01:35:22.159 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional we accept these
 
01:35:25.189 --> 01:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
employment conditions when we accept a
 
01:35:29.790 --> 01:35:29.800 align:start position:0%
job so for someone to conflate Du and
 
01:35:32.109 --> 01:35:32.119 align:start position:0%
fees and say you're being forced to be a
 
01:35:35.310 --> 01:35:35.320 align:start position:0%
member is some kind of linguistic
 
01:35:38.709 --> 01:35:38.719 align:start position:0%
gymnastics that does violence to
 
01:35:42.709 --> 01:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
logic and uh right to work has always
 
01:35:48.750 --> 01:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
been against the New Hampshire way of
 
01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:50.390 align:start position:0%
been against the New Hampshire way of
allowing

01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
allowing
 
01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
our private employers and employees to
 
01:35:56.070 --> 01:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
set their own terms in negotiations the
 
01:35:57.350 --> 01:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
government doesn't belong in the
 
01:36:00.109 --> 01:36:00.119 align:start position:0%
negotiating room so we urge you to once
 
01:36:03.830 --> 01:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
again vote itl on right to work and
 
01:36:06.070 --> 01:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
that's all I have to say if there are
 
01:36:08.709 --> 01:36:08.719 align:start position:0%
questions I will take them and uh I'm
 
01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
not a union boss thank you uh there's a
 
01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
question for you I I have to step out uh
 
01:36:17.189 --> 01:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
Vice chairman seaworth will take over
 
01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:19.760 align:start position:0%

provision in the
 
01:36:32.189 --> 01:36:32.199 align:start position:0%
law which
 
01:36:37.070 --> 01:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
allows the voting by the members on the
 
01:36:42.550 --> 01:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
specific issue of the agency fee unlike

provision I would have to say that I

being in the public sector where the
 
01:37:06.870 --> 01:37:06.880 align:start position:0%

joined a union I've never been on the do
 
01:38:38.270 --> 01:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
government Dole and I take issue to a
 
01:38:40.430 --> 01:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
previous speaker who made it sound like
 
01:38:43.109 --> 01:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
anyone who's not in the Union uh is on
 
01:38:45.510 --> 01:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
the government toll that's not true and
 
01:38:47.910 --> 01:38:47.920 align:start position:0%
also I was able to save money to help my

01:38:57.430 --> 01:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
Association we have the right to
 
01:39:00.750 --> 01:39:00.760 align:start position:0%

01:39:04.350 --> 01:39:04.360 align:start position:0%

01:39:07.430 --> 01:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
associate this bill will help to hold
 
01:39:09.790 --> 01:39:09.800 align:start position:0%
unions accountable I heard one speaker
 
01:39:12.589 --> 01:39:12.599 align:start position:0%
say that union membership has
 
01:39:15.189 --> 01:39:15.199 align:start position:0%
dropped well part of that reason is
 
01:39:16.589 --> 01:39:16.599 align:start position:0%
because people don't feel that they're
 
01:39:20.310 --> 01:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
being represented so they they don't opt
 
01:39:22.830 --> 01:39:22.840 align:start position:0%
to join
 
01:39:25.870 --> 01:39:25.880 align:start position:0%
union now the ageny fee is something
 
01:39:28.470 --> 01:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
that um I haven't really heard too much
 
01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
about here the ageny fee is what I took
 
01:39:33.709 --> 01:39:33.719 align:start position:0%
issue with when I was a teacher I had
 
01:39:36.629 --> 01:39:36.639 align:start position:0%
been teaching for 10 years and as
 
01:39:39.430 --> 01:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie said the
 
01:39:42.550 --> 01:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
teachers decided in the union to vote
 
01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
that everyone must pay an agency fee so
 
01:39:48.430 --> 01:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
I was already employed and I had been
 
01:39:51.229 --> 01:39:51.239 align:start position:0%
there for 10 years and the union bosses
 
01:39:55.149 --> 01:39:55.159 align:start position:0%
came to me and said you will now pay a
 
01:39:58.030 --> 01:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
fee first of all that to me is very
 
01:40:00.709 --> 01:40:00.719 align:start position:0%
unamerican nobody should be forcing me
 
01:40:03.709 --> 01:40:03.719 align:start position:0%
to pay money I don't wish to pay so what
 
01:40:06.870 --> 01:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
I did was I did win a religious
 
01:40:09.910 --> 01:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
exemption but then ironically I was told
 
01:40:12.550 --> 01:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
by one of the Union lawyers you can't
 
01:40:14.709 --> 01:40:14.719 align:start position:0%
give your money to St Vincent to Paul
 
01:40:18.070 --> 01:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
which is a religious organization I win
 
01:40:20.629 --> 01:40:20.639 align:start position:0%
because it's a religious objection that
 
01:40:22.470 --> 01:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
I have to the union and yet they're
 
01:40:25.470 --> 01:40:25.480 align:start position:0%
telling me I can't give my 400 some more
 
01:40:27.950 --> 01:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
dollars which to me was not just a
 
01:40:29.910 --> 01:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
little bit that was a
 
01:40:33.350 --> 01:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
lot and I ended up having to give to a
 
01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:35.430 align:start position:0%
lot and I ended up having to give to a
different

01:40:35.430 --> 01:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:40:38.270 --> 01:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
charity now I was a police officer in
 
01:40:41.189 --> 01:40:41.199 align:start position:0%
Texas and I know I've heard people say
 
01:40:43.790 --> 01:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
that if we do away with collective
 
01:40:45.629 --> 01:40:45.639 align:start position:0%
bargaining which this bill does not
 
01:40:48.589 --> 01:40:48.599 align:start position:0%
address it is not saying unions can't
 
01:40:50.910 --> 01:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
exist and people can't choose to join
 
01:40:53.430 --> 01:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
join them and I have to say I wonder why
 
01:40:56.229 --> 01:40:56.239 align:start position:0%
unions are so afraid of right to work
 
01:40:58.470 --> 01:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
because all it's doing is saying that
 
01:41:01.870 --> 01:41:01.880 align:start position:0%
people don't need to join and I was a
 
01:41:04.830 --> 01:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
police officer in Texas we did not have
 
01:41:08.470 --> 01:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
a union and there was never any problem
 
01:41:12.790 --> 01:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
when contract negotiations came up so to
 
01:41:14.950 --> 01:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
say that oh if you get rid of the uh
 
01:41:16.350 --> 01:41:16.360 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining there's going to
 
01:41:19.629 --> 01:41:19.639 align:start position:0%
be uh chaos that's not true at least I
 
01:41:23.310 --> 01:41:23.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:25.109 --> 01:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
now I've heard previous speakers say
 
01:41:26.030 --> 01:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
that this
 
01:41:29.390 --> 01:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
bill empowers more government but I've
 
01:41:32.470 --> 01:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
also heard other people talk about the
 
01:41:33.950 --> 01:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
federal government and what they have
 
01:41:36.149 --> 01:41:36.159 align:start position:0%
done the federal government is the cause
 
01:41:38.470 --> 01:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
of this if it wasn't for what the
 
01:41:41.229 --> 01:41:41.239 align:start position:0%
federal government said we wouldn't need
 
01:41:43.950 --> 01:41:43.960 align:start position:0%
right to work because people could
 
01:41:46.830 --> 01:41:46.840 align:start position:0%
negotiate their own contracts or they
 
01:41:48.910 --> 01:41:48.920 align:start position:0%
could get together with like-minded
 
01:41:50.870 --> 01:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
people and do it without having to pay
 
01:41:54.189 --> 01:41:54.199 align:start position:0%
does to do it and as I said in Texas we
 
01:41:55.910 --> 01:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
never had to do that we never had to pay
 
01:41:58.669 --> 01:41:58.679 align:start position:0%
someone to go to the city council and
 
01:42:01.070 --> 01:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
negotiate our
 
01:42:03.390 --> 01:42:03.400 align:start position:0%
contract I've heard someone say that
 
01:42:05.709 --> 01:42:05.719 align:start position:0%
this bill comes up year after year after
 
01:42:08.550 --> 01:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
year after year Well if anybody's seen
 
01:42:10.790 --> 01:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
the movie Amazing Grace yes it is a
 
01:42:14.510 --> 01:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
movie but it is based on
 
01:42:18.030 --> 01:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
truth um William Wilberforce brought up
 
01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
for 24 years to get rid of slavery
 
01:42:23.990 --> 01:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
before it was accepted so if this bill
 
01:42:25.550 --> 01:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
keeps coming up maybe it's something
 
01:42:28.510 --> 01:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
that people have to start thinking about
 
01:42:31.870 --> 01:42:31.880 align:start position:0%
and as far as the weekends go the
 
01:42:34.310 --> 01:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
weekends were actually started by the
 
01:42:35.950 --> 01:42:35.960 align:start position:0%
good Lord whether you're Jewish and it's
 
01:42:39.790 --> 01:42:39.800 align:start position:0%
on the Sabbath or Christian it's Sunday
 
01:42:43.950 --> 01:42:43.960 align:start position:0%
seven six days of work one day of peace
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:52.950 --> 01:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
started oh and also this bill will um
 
01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
hold unions more accountable because
 
01:42:56.629 --> 01:42:56.639 align:start position:0%
people will either want to join or not
 
01:43:00.109 --> 01:43:00.119 align:start position:0%
depending on their situation thank you
 
01:43:04.470 --> 01:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:07.109 --> 01:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
questions representative lir thank you
 
01:43:08.510 --> 01:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony too thanks
 
01:43:11.950 --> 01:43:11.960 align:start position:0%
for coming in and speaking
 
01:43:15.390 --> 01:43:15.400 align:start position:0%
um so initially you're a lot of the
 
01:43:17.990 --> 01:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
stuff you said was kind of almost for
 
01:43:20.950 --> 01:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
unions as opposed to being against them
 
01:43:22.109 --> 01:43:22.119 align:start position:0%
because you're you know you were going
 
01:43:23.350 --> 01:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
back and forth kind of and that and
 
01:43:25.910 --> 01:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
that's okay because there's uh a lot of
 
01:43:28.149 --> 01:43:28.159 align:start position:0%
things on both sides that can be worked
 
01:43:31.669 --> 01:43:31.679 align:start position:0%
out but my question is do you think that
 
01:43:33.629 --> 01:43:33.639 align:start position:0%
unions are afraid of right to work or
 
01:43:36.750 --> 01:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
right to work is afraid of unions I
 
01:43:39.189 --> 01:43:39.199 align:start position:0%
think seeing all the people in this room
 
01:43:40.830 --> 01:43:40.840 align:start position:0%
that have come out for unions and in
 
01:43:42.470 --> 01:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
other testimonies that I've given in the
 
01:43:44.550 --> 01:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
years the unions are afraid of right to
 
01:43:46.709 --> 01:43:46.719 align:start position:0%
work and I don't understand that because
 
01:43:48.629 --> 01:43:48.639 align:start position:0%
it's not against the union it's just
 
01:43:51.270 --> 01:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
giving me as an individual or or you as
 
01:43:54.070 --> 01:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
an individual the right to decide and
 
01:43:56.910 --> 01:43:56.920 align:start position:0%
that is what being an American is yeah
 
01:43:58.510 --> 01:43:58.520 align:start position:0%
and I I agree with you if I could follow
 
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
up please um yeah the right to decide is
 
01:44:03.870 --> 01:44:03.880 align:start position:0%
is definitely everybody's right I agree
 
01:44:06.430 --> 01:44:06.440 align:start position:0%
with you I worked non-un and like other
 
01:44:08.149 --> 01:44:08.159 align:start position:0%
people here started off nonunion and
 
01:44:11.589 --> 01:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
then went because they wanted to so um I
 
01:44:13.030 --> 01:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
guess that's more of a statement than a
 
01:44:14.310 --> 01:44:14.320 align:start position:0%
question but again thanks for your
 
01:44:16.709 --> 01:44:16.719 align:start position:0%
testimon you're welcome sir are there
 
01:44:19.589 --> 01:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
 
01:44:19.599 --> 01:44:21.270 align:start position:0%
further questions representative
Sullivan

01:44:21.270 --> 01:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
Sullivan
 
01:44:22.709 --> 01:44:22.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:44:26.629 --> 01:44:26.639 align:start position:0%
my question um earlier you said that uh
 
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
the agency fee that you were expected to
 
01:44:33.310 --> 01:44:33.320 align:start position:0%
um pay um as a teacher was um created by
 
01:44:36.709 --> 01:44:36.719 align:start position:0%
the union um was it created by the union
 
01:44:38.390 --> 01:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
or was it created by an agreement
 
01:44:40.750 --> 01:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
between the union and the school board
 
01:44:43.229 --> 01:44:43.239 align:start position:0%
it was probably the latter
 
01:44:46.390 --> 01:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
um the members of the Union after 10
 
01:44:50.070 --> 01:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
years they did vote that anyone who was
 
01:44:51.950 --> 01:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
not in the Union would be forced to pay
 
01:44:55.589 --> 01:44:55.599 align:start position:0%
this agency fee so unfortunately that
 
01:44:58.030 --> 01:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
put me at odds with my fellow workers
 
01:45:01.310 --> 01:45:01.320 align:start position:0%
because they voted to take money from me
 
01:45:03.629 --> 01:45:03.639 align:start position:0%
after 10
 
01:45:07.589 --> 01:45:07.599 align:start position:0%
years follow up but
 
01:45:10.030 --> 01:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
again was the union able to do that on
 
01:45:12.149 --> 01:45:12.159 align:start position:0%
their own or did they do that along with
 
01:45:13.750 --> 01:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
an agreement with the school board who
 
01:45:16.229 --> 01:45:16.239 align:start position:0%
is the employer right it was definitely
 
01:45:18.629 --> 01:45:18.639 align:start position:0%
an agreement with the school board but
 
01:45:21.510 --> 01:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
it wasn't something that I signed up for
 
01:45:24.189 --> 01:45:24.199 align:start position:0%
when I first became a teacher there and
 
01:45:26.189 --> 01:45:26.199 align:start position:0%
even though it it was an agreement it's
 
01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
still wrong I mean there are lots of
 
01:45:30.430 --> 01:45:30.440 align:start position:0%
things that government does agreements
 
01:45:32.790 --> 01:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
that are wrong and whether it's from
 
01:45:35.189 --> 01:45:35.199 align:start position:0%
years ago or now we see
 
01:45:39.270 --> 01:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
that the thing is I'm an individual and
 
01:45:40.870 --> 01:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
I was always taught to fight my own
 
01:45:43.990 --> 01:45:44.000 align:start position:0%
battles and that's the way I am and if I
 
01:45:46.270 --> 01:45:46.280 align:start position:0%
have a problem I will address it to
 
01:45:48.790 --> 01:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
whomever whether it's an employee
 
01:45:53.709 --> 01:45:53.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:56.189 --> 01:45:56.199 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
01:45:58.390 --> 01:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
McKenzie thank
 
01:46:01.270 --> 01:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
you are you familiar with the Janice
 
01:46:03.510 --> 01:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
Deion yes I am it's for private I mean
 
01:46:07.589 --> 01:46:07.599 align:start position:0%
uh public employees only so after 2018 I
 
01:46:10.149 --> 01:46:10.159 align:start position:0%
did not have to pay in
 
01:46:10.159 --> 01:46:14.470 align:start position:0%
did not have to pay in
anymore

01:46:14.470 --> 01:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
follow during the course of your career
 
01:46:19.669 --> 01:46:19.679 align:start position:0%
when you were covered by Collective
 
01:46:22.510 --> 01:46:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
did you take the benefits that were
 
01:46:27.910 --> 01:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
negotiated yeah I had to had no choice
 
01:46:30.709 --> 01:46:30.719 align:start position:0%
you had to yeah so you took the I
 
01:46:32.709 --> 01:46:32.719 align:start position:0%
couldn't say to my boss I don't want to
 
01:46:34.910 --> 01:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
be paid this
 
01:46:37.589 --> 01:46:37.599 align:start position:0%
amount F the
 
01:46:41.870 --> 01:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
PO so the union negotiated the
 
01:46:44.109 --> 01:46:44.119 align:start position:0%
benefits there was a
 
01:46:46.510 --> 01:46:46.520 align:start position:0%
contract and you were covered by that
 
01:46:49.270 --> 01:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
contract and you took all the benefits
 
01:46:52.750 --> 01:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
and enjoyed all of the the um coverage
 
01:46:55.310 --> 01:46:55.320 align:start position:0%
that every other person in that ban unit
 
01:46:58.430 --> 01:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
received I earned the benefits and I
 
01:46:58.440 --> 01:46:59.950 align:start position:0%
received I earned the benefits and I
earned

01:46:59.950 --> 01:46:59.960 align:start position:0%
earned
 
01:47:03.310 --> 01:47:03.320 align:start position:0%
whatever and again it's the federal
 
01:47:05.270 --> 01:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
government that set up this problem to
 
01:47:08.390 --> 01:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
begin with and two wrongs don't make a
 
01:47:11.950 --> 01:47:11.960 align:start position:0%
right so I think what representative
 
01:47:14.589 --> 01:47:14.599 align:start position:0%
love said is is very valid that the
 
01:47:16.790 --> 01:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
union needs to get to address the
 
01:47:18.270 --> 01:47:18.280 align:start position:0%
federal government and get rid of the
 
01:47:20.070 --> 01:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining because no it
 
01:47:22.669 --> 01:47:22.679 align:start position:0%
isn't fair that I can be represented by
 
01:47:25.589 --> 01:47:25.599 align:start position:0%
something that I don't pay for but on
 
01:47:27.109 --> 01:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
the other hand it's not fair for them to
 
01:47:30.030 --> 01:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:32.709 --> 01:47:32.719 align:start position:0%
either any further
 
01:47:34.589 --> 01:47:34.599 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for your
 
01:47:36.270 --> 01:47:36.280 align:start position:0%
testimony you're
 
01:47:41.270 --> 01:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
welcome next up is uh Josh reap followed
 
01:47:49.310 --> 01:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:55.470 align:start position:0%
 
here

01:47:55.470 --> 01:47:55.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:56.390 --> 01:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you for the
 
01:47:57.910 --> 01:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be here and before I get
 
01:47:59.350 --> 01:47:59.360 align:start position:0%
my testimony I just want to say I know
 
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
this is a very long hearing and I got to
 
01:48:03.910 --> 01:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
say it's a testament to the people of
 
01:48:05.990 --> 01:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that we could be civil and
 
01:48:07.990 --> 01:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
it but yet in a in a situation that's a
 
01:48:09.350 --> 01:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
very polarized world it's really great
 
01:48:11.070 --> 01:48:11.080 align:start position:0%
to see so many people with different
 
01:48:13.189 --> 01:48:13.199 align:start position:0%
opinions remaining civil and respectful
 
01:48:15.589 --> 01:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
and hearing from each other so um I hope
 
01:48:17.149 --> 01:48:17.159 align:start position:0%
that we can meet an example for the rest
 
01:48:19.910 --> 01:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
of the country in that regard uh but any
 
01:48:22.149 --> 01:48:22.159 align:start position:0%
rate um my name is Joshua reap I'm the
 
01:48:24.470 --> 01:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
president CEO of associated builders and
 
01:48:26.990 --> 01:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
contractors uh we represent nearly 300
 
01:48:28.430 --> 01:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
construction firms and Associated
 
01:48:30.910 --> 01:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
businesses across New Hampshire our
 
01:48:32.070 --> 01:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
association believes in the free
 
01:48:33.910 --> 01:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
enterprise system is fundamental to Our
 
01:48:36.470 --> 01:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
Success is the American way of life we
 
01:48:38.270 --> 01:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
believe that the employer must have a
 
01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
concern for the general welfare of the
 
01:48:41.830 --> 01:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
employee and that there must be fair
 
01:48:43.910 --> 01:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
compensation for that work performed at
 
01:48:46.070 --> 01:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
the same time we believe that employees
 
01:48:47.510 --> 01:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
have an obligation for satisfactory
 
01:48:49.950 --> 01:48:49.960 align:start position:0%
performance of work assigned We Believe
 
01:48:52.270 --> 01:48:52.280 align:start position:0%
leg legislation that Embraces fair play
 
01:48:54.870 --> 01:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
for employer employees is essential for
 
01:48:56.510 --> 01:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
the preservation of our free enterprise
 
01:48:59.270 --> 01:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
system and today I'm here in support of
 
01:48:59.280 --> 01:49:00.910 align:start position:0%
system and today I'm here in support of
HP

01:49:00.910 --> 01:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
HP
 
01:49:03.510 --> 01:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
1377 which actually would provide the
 
01:49:04.870 --> 01:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
private sector with the same rights
 
01:49:07.550 --> 01:49:07.560 align:start position:0%
already enjoyed by the public sector and
 
01:49:10.030 --> 01:49:10.040 align:start position:0%
Workforce we believe uh that any law
 
01:49:11.229 --> 01:49:11.239 align:start position:0%
that's passed should protect the rights
 
01:49:13.189 --> 01:49:13.199 align:start position:0%
of employees for for work regardless of
 
01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
race color creed age sex national origin
 
01:49:19.109 --> 01:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
or membership or non-membership in an
 
01:49:21.950 --> 01:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
organization We Believe work opportuni
 
01:49:23.550 --> 01:49:23.560 align:start position:0%
should be made available to all legal
 
01:49:26.109 --> 01:49:26.119 align:start position:0%
residents and we support programs toward
 
01:49:28.910 --> 01:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
that end we support Right to Work simply
 
01:49:31.070 --> 01:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
because um laws like this guarantee
 
01:49:33.109 --> 01:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
workers can seek employment without fear
 
01:49:35.070 --> 01:49:35.080 align:start position:0%
that they'd be required to join or pay
 
01:49:37.070 --> 01:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
fees Associated for a union when they
 
01:49:39.750 --> 01:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
are hired these laws simply allow
 
01:49:41.709 --> 01:49:41.719 align:start position:0%
workers who do not want to participate
 
01:49:43.430 --> 01:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
in a collective barging agreement to opt
 
01:49:45.030 --> 01:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
out of joining the union or paying dues
 
01:49:48.030 --> 01:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
or fees associated with that if all or
 
01:49:49.830 --> 01:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
most of the members of a bargaining unit
 
01:49:51.629 --> 01:49:51.639 align:start position:0%
believe a union representation will
 
01:49:53.510 --> 01:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
represent their interests then nothing
 
01:49:55.510 --> 01:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
in a right to work law such as one per
 
01:49:57.709 --> 01:49:57.719 align:start position:0%
you would prohibit them from exercising
 
01:49:59.189 --> 01:49:59.199 align:start position:0%
their federally protected right to
 
01:50:02.070 --> 01:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
organize a union and bargain with their
 
01:50:04.189 --> 01:50:04.199 align:start position:0%
employer however in a right to work
 
01:50:05.990 --> 01:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
environment what changes is people are
 
01:50:07.790 --> 01:50:07.800 align:start position:0%
liberated from the violence coercion
 
01:50:09.270 --> 01:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
intimidation and peer pressure that
 
01:50:11.550 --> 01:50:11.560 align:start position:0%
ultimately comes as part of unionization
 
01:50:13.830 --> 01:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
in campaigns and close closed shop
 
01:50:16.550 --> 01:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
states such as New Hampshire at the same
 
01:50:18.589 --> 01:50:18.599 align:start position:0%
time you underneath right to work laws
 
01:50:20.350 --> 01:50:20.360 align:start position:0%
as we've seen in the public sector
 
01:50:21.870 --> 01:50:21.880 align:start position:0%
unions are held accountable to their
 
01:50:23.470 --> 01:50:23.480 align:start position:0%
workers they have to justify their
 
01:50:24.350 --> 01:50:24.360 align:start position:0%
existence they have to have a
 
01:50:26.109 --> 01:50:26.119 align:start position:0%
relationship with those individuals they
 
01:50:27.470 --> 01:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
just can't take for Advantage I have a
 
01:50:28.790 --> 01:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
thousand people that I'm representing
 
01:50:30.390 --> 01:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
and I don't need to answer everybody
 
01:50:31.990 --> 01:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
under right to work everybody has a
 
01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
voice everybody has a bit more power
 
01:50:35.390 --> 01:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
within their organization within their
 
01:50:38.990 --> 01:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
Union to have to have their voice heard
 
01:50:40.669 --> 01:50:40.679 align:start position:0%
opponents state that the wages are lower
 
01:50:42.709 --> 01:50:42.719 align:start position:0%
in Right to Work say States they're
 
01:50:44.149 --> 01:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
entitled to their own beliefs but not
 
01:50:46.350 --> 01:50:46.360 align:start position:0%
necessarily their own facts facts of the
 
01:50:48.669 --> 01:50:48.679 align:start position:0%
matter today is that today's market is
 
01:50:50.430 --> 01:50:50.440 align:start position:0%
an employee Market when the labor
 
01:50:51.790 --> 01:50:51.800 align:start position:0%
shortages that were actually talked
 
01:50:53.709 --> 01:50:53.719 align:start position:0%
about earlier across all sectors but
 
01:50:56.149 --> 01:50:56.159 align:start position:0%
particularly in construction wages and
 
01:50:58.470 --> 01:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
benefits are higher now than ever as
 
01:51:01.069 --> 01:51:01.079 align:start position:0%
employers compete for talented labor
 
01:51:02.790 --> 01:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
what opponents further fail to mention
 
01:51:04.709 --> 01:51:04.719 align:start position:0%
is that the when you have a collective
 
01:51:06.069 --> 01:51:06.079 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement it takes away an
 
01:51:08.149 --> 01:51:08.159 align:start position:0%
individual's right to negotiate with
 
01:51:09.629 --> 01:51:09.639 align:start position:0%
their employer directly what they feel
 
01:51:12.589 --> 01:51:12.599 align:start position:0%
they should be compensated for and in an
 
01:51:14.990 --> 01:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
open shop world if someone feels I'm not
 
01:51:16.990 --> 01:51:17.000 align:start position:0%
making what I deserve I can go somewhere
 
01:51:19.229 --> 01:51:19.239 align:start position:0%
else but rather than do that I am
 
01:51:20.510 --> 01:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
allowed to speak to directly to my
 
01:51:23.030 --> 01:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
employer and a union collective
 
01:51:25.750 --> 01:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement I prohibited from
 
01:51:27.030 --> 01:51:27.040 align:start position:0%
having a direct conversation with my
 
01:51:29.149 --> 01:51:29.159 align:start position:0%
employer so I can't go to the owner I
 
01:51:30.870 --> 01:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
can't go to my supervisor and say I want
 
01:51:33.870 --> 01:51:33.880 align:start position:0%
more pay that's left up to the the union
 
01:51:35.310 --> 01:51:35.320 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining
 
01:51:38.910 --> 01:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
agreement so in this era where we have a
 
01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
market where it is a employee um high
 
01:51:44.950 --> 01:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
demand Market um individuals that are
 
01:51:46.350 --> 01:51:46.360 align:start position:0%
subject to Collective bargain agreements
 
01:51:47.990 --> 01:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
the employer one can't directly
 
01:51:49.390 --> 01:51:49.400 align:start position:0%
negotiate with those individuals and
 
01:51:51.470 --> 01:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
secondly that employer can just fall
 
01:51:53.069 --> 01:51:53.079 align:start position:0%
back and say hey the CBA says I can I
 
01:51:54.109 --> 01:51:54.119 align:start position:0%
only have to pay this much and that's
 
01:51:56.350 --> 01:51:56.360 align:start position:0%
all I'm going to pay you so it actually
 
01:51:57.950 --> 01:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
is a detriment to people in this current
 
01:51:57.960 --> 01:51:59.270 align:start position:0%
is a detriment to people in this current
labor

01:51:59.270 --> 01:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
labor
 
01:52:01.669 --> 01:52:01.679 align:start position:0%
market um and another thing I'd like to
 
01:52:03.390 --> 01:52:03.400 align:start position:0%
point out too that on Union stats.com
 
01:52:04.830 --> 01:52:04.840 align:start position:0%
there's some interesting data and
 
01:52:07.669 --> 01:52:07.679 align:start position:0%
information out there um when the state
 
01:52:09.229 --> 01:52:09.239 align:start position:0%
P when the state became subject to the
 
01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
Janice decision and union workers in the
 
01:52:13.830 --> 01:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
public sector um had the choice whether
 
01:52:16.310 --> 01:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
not to pay a fee or join the union they
 
01:52:17.870 --> 01:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
didn't see a substantial drop in Union
 
01:52:19.470 --> 01:52:19.480 align:start position:0%
membership from my my understanding from
 
01:52:21.750 --> 01:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
Union .c which is publicly available
 
01:52:23.430 --> 01:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
it's a website run by Trinity University
 
01:52:25.510 --> 01:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
as well as Georgia University it takes
 
01:52:27.189 --> 01:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Labor Statistics data and
 
01:52:30.510 --> 01:52:30.520 align:start position:0%
analyzes it by sector um I would argue
 
01:52:32.149 --> 01:52:32.159 align:start position:0%
too here in New Hampshire actually about
 
01:52:34.030 --> 01:52:34.040 align:start position:0%
90% of the construction Workforce
 
01:52:35.510 --> 01:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
chooses to have a direct relationship
 
01:52:37.750 --> 01:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
with employer well you might say to me
 
01:52:39.790 --> 01:52:39.800 align:start position:0%
well why do you want right to work then
 
01:52:41.790 --> 01:52:41.800 align:start position:0%
simple um I want to make sure that
 
01:52:43.310 --> 01:52:43.320 align:start position:0%
people aren't subject to the coion and
 
01:52:45.310 --> 01:52:45.320 align:start position:0%
peer pressure in violence that often
 
01:52:48.030 --> 01:52:48.040 align:start position:0%
times comes with not often but often not
 
01:52:49.229 --> 01:52:49.239 align:start position:0%
often but sometimes with these
 
01:52:52.470 --> 01:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
organization campaigns because if people
 
01:52:54.990 --> 01:52:55.000 align:start position:0%
have a situation where the union has to
 
01:52:57.470 --> 01:52:57.480 align:start position:0%
go in there and negotiate and justify
 
01:52:58.629 --> 01:52:58.639 align:start position:0%
themselves to the individual you have a
 
01:52:59.990 --> 01:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
better relationship better working
 
01:53:01.629 --> 01:53:01.639 align:start position:0%
relationship between the worker and in
 
01:53:03.870 --> 01:53:03.880 align:start position:0%
the Union in closing I thank thank you
 
01:53:05.790 --> 01:53:05.800 align:start position:0%
for your your time and ask you support
 
01:53:07.910 --> 01:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
HB 1377 for the opportunity for all
 
01:53:09.470 --> 01:53:09.480 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire have be happy to
 
01:53:10.550 --> 01:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
take any
 
01:53:12.830 --> 01:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:53:16.229 --> 01:53:16.239 align:start position:0%
lir Follow by Mackenzie sure does the
 
01:53:19.069 --> 01:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
ABC oh sorry thank you thanks Mike does
 
01:53:20.790 --> 01:53:20.800 align:start position:0%
the ABC have a registered apprenticeship
 
01:53:23.910 --> 01:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
and what does it cost um anybody that
 
01:53:26.910 --> 01:53:26.920 align:start position:0%
joins to go there yep uh ABC is the only
 
01:53:28.550 --> 01:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
construction trade Association across
 
01:53:30.030 --> 01:53:30.040 align:start position:0%
the country it's dedicated to trade
 
01:53:32.030 --> 01:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
development um we have other trade
 
01:53:33.669 --> 01:53:33.679 align:start position:0%
associations that do Management training
 
01:53:34.709 --> 01:53:34.719 align:start position:0%
we do that too but we also have
 
01:53:37.270 --> 01:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
apprentiship programs uh and they're
 
01:53:39.229 --> 01:53:39.239 align:start position:0%
they're it varies by state by state we
 
01:53:40.550 --> 01:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
have one in New Hampshire we have one in
 
01:53:42.709 --> 01:53:42.719 align:start position:0%
Vermont um I know the New York Chapter
 
01:53:45.470 --> 01:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
has multiple trades as well um how does
 
01:53:47.470 --> 01:53:47.480 align:start position:0%
it get paid for the employers pay for it
 
01:53:48.950 --> 01:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
it is not it's not something the
 
01:53:50.310 --> 01:53:50.320 align:start position:0%
individual pays for that's the other
 
01:53:52.750 --> 01:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
thing in the open shop World um you earn
 
01:53:54.910 --> 01:53:54.920 align:start position:0%
while you learn the employer pays for
 
01:53:56.350 --> 01:53:56.360 align:start position:0%
the tuition more often than not now
 
01:53:57.709 --> 01:53:57.719 align:start position:0%
every company can choose to do that
 
01:53:59.629 --> 01:53:59.639 align:start position:0%
differently just like every country
 
01:54:00.750 --> 01:54:00.760 align:start position:0%
company can negotiate with their
 
01:54:02.430 --> 01:54:02.440 align:start position:0%
Collective baring agreement differently
 
01:54:04.310 --> 01:54:04.320 align:start position:0%
in the union world but in our world in
 
01:54:06.189 --> 01:54:06.199 align:start position:0%
my experience with my members uh the
 
01:54:09.149 --> 01:54:09.159 align:start position:0%
employer pays for the training and you
 
01:54:10.669 --> 01:54:10.679 align:start position:0%
it's registered right it's registered
 
01:54:13.550 --> 01:54:13.560 align:start position:0%
with the state yep okay um thanks can I
 
01:54:15.990 --> 01:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
follow up please yes follow up um you
 
01:54:20.229 --> 01:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
said that um typically workers are
 
01:54:22.629 --> 01:54:22.639 align:start position:0%
prohibited in the union from speaking to
 
01:54:24.750 --> 01:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
their employers well there's a grievance
 
01:54:26.189 --> 01:54:26.199 align:start position:0%
process involved with most Collective
 
01:54:27.870 --> 01:54:27.880 align:start position:0%
Bain agreements will outline how to
 
01:54:31.069 --> 01:54:31.079 align:start position:0%
handle grievances how to hand issues um
 
01:54:33.750 --> 01:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
in my experience uh being working for an
 
01:54:35.270 --> 01:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
employer that was non-union then became
 
01:54:38.709 --> 01:54:38.719 align:start position:0%
unionized can I just I'm talking I'm I
 
01:54:39.990 --> 01:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
apologize I should have been a little
 
01:54:43.790 --> 01:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
bit more forthright about wages sure you
 
01:54:45.830 --> 01:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
say they are prohibited from speaking
 
01:54:47.069 --> 01:54:47.079 align:start position:0%
about wage I heard earlier that there
 
01:54:48.950 --> 01:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
was testimony that someone said hey you
 
01:54:50.069 --> 01:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
know this is the minim minimum that
 
01:54:52.030 --> 01:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to pay you but you can talk
 
01:54:54.310 --> 01:54:54.320 align:start position:0%
to your employer about possibly getting
 
01:54:55.709 --> 01:54:55.719 align:start position:0%
more if you think you're more or if
 
01:54:59.149 --> 01:54:59.159 align:start position:0%
you're running a job or Etc so where is
 
01:55:00.550 --> 01:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
the prohibition well if you're running a
 
01:55:02.870 --> 01:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
job your your pay scale changes because
 
01:55:05.550 --> 01:55:05.560 align:start position:0%
your position changes if you're talking
 
01:55:08.229 --> 01:55:08.239 align:start position:0%
about uh a CBA being a minimum floor
 
01:55:10.310 --> 01:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
that's negotiated between the employer
 
01:55:12.069 --> 01:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
and the union representation not
 
01:55:13.550 --> 01:55:13.560 align:start position:0%
necessarily the individual workers on
 
01:55:15.109 --> 01:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
that job site that's between the
 
01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
business agent or or the representative
 
01:55:20.030 --> 01:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
of the union and the employer that's not
 
01:55:22.350 --> 01:55:22.360 align:start position:0%
up so if if Josh reap wants to say I
 
01:55:24.669 --> 01:55:24.679 align:start position:0%
want $3 more an hour I can't just go to
 
01:55:26.550 --> 01:55:26.560 align:start position:0%
the company owner and and ask him for
 
01:55:28.270 --> 01:55:28.280 align:start position:0%
that I probably could try but he's going
 
01:55:30.430 --> 01:55:30.440 align:start position:0%
to remind me that it's up to the I had
 
01:55:32.030 --> 01:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
need to talk to my business agent and go
 
01:55:34.069 --> 01:55:34.079 align:start position:0%
through the channels it's determined
 
01:55:35.709 --> 01:55:35.719 align:start position:0%
it's determined by the union because
 
01:55:37.270 --> 01:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
when you join a union you wave certain
 
01:55:39.629 --> 01:55:39.639 align:start position:0%
rights as an individual to collectively
 
01:55:40.990 --> 01:55:41.000 align:start position:0%
decide those as a group and that's where
 
01:55:42.470 --> 01:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
the union steps in to represent you on
 
01:55:45.750 --> 01:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
behalf of you to the employer follow up
 
01:55:47.430 --> 01:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:55:50.310 --> 01:55:50.320 align:start position:0%
um yeah I've been in the coer UN for 28
 
01:55:52.390 --> 01:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
years I was actually a business rep for
 
01:55:57.229 --> 01:55:57.239 align:start position:0%
5 years okay um when someone wants more
 
01:55:59.189 --> 01:55:59.199 align:start position:0%
money or or would like more money you
 
01:56:01.550 --> 01:56:01.560 align:start position:0%
know obviously they they talk to their
 
01:56:03.390 --> 01:56:03.400 align:start position:0%
employer they don't come to the business
 
01:56:05.750 --> 01:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
agent and say hey can I get a raise from
 
01:56:08.030 --> 01:56:08.040 align:start position:0%
my company you know it's it's directly
 
01:56:09.750 --> 01:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
it really is directly if if I'm wrong on
 
01:56:12.589 --> 01:56:12.599 align:start position:0%
a fact I'll accept that and um you said
 
01:56:15.629 --> 01:56:15.639 align:start position:0%
minimum wage so if I went to a company
 
01:56:16.870 --> 01:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
if I was working for a company that
 
01:56:19.550 --> 01:56:19.560 align:start position:0%
belonged to the ABC and they said well
 
01:56:20.790 --> 01:56:20.800 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry all I have to give you is
 
01:56:23.350 --> 01:56:23.360 align:start position:0%
minimum wage was $7.50 an
 
01:56:25.750 --> 01:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
hour I don't know a single person paying
 
01:56:27.629 --> 01:56:27.639 align:start position:0%
minimum wage right now that's not that
 
01:56:29.709 --> 01:56:29.719 align:start position:0%
wasn't my question they could actually
 
01:56:32.109 --> 01:56:32.119 align:start position:0%
say that right minimum wage is 750 I'm
 
01:56:34.229 --> 01:56:34.239 align:start position:0%
all I have to give you is 750
 
01:56:36.430 --> 01:56:36.440 align:start position:0%
now anyone can say whatever they want
 
01:56:37.750 --> 01:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day I don't have a
 
01:56:39.270 --> 01:56:39.280 align:start position:0%
single contractor that's paying minimum
 
01:56:41.229 --> 01:56:41.239 align:start position:0%
wage for for anything like that right
 
01:56:42.910 --> 01:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
and one more question if I because at
 
01:56:44.189 --> 01:56:44.199 align:start position:0%
the same time that employee can go
 
01:56:47.750 --> 01:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
elsewhere yes right exactly sure and
 
01:56:48.870 --> 01:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
that was going to be another one of
 
01:56:50.229 --> 01:56:50.239 align:start position:0%
points but
 
01:56:52.950 --> 01:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
so do you think that your wages your
 
01:56:55.030 --> 01:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
wage just your hourly
 
01:56:58.109 --> 01:56:58.119 align:start position:0%
wage are pretty close to what say union
 
01:56:58.119 --> 01:56:59.910 align:start position:0%
wage are pretty close to what say union
carpenters

01:56:59.910 --> 01:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
carpenters
 
01:57:02.470 --> 01:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
make my wages I don't I don't have any I
 
01:57:04.430 --> 01:57:04.440 align:start position:0%
work for the ABC I don't you're
 
01:57:06.030 --> 01:57:06.040 align:start position:0%
Carpenters I don't I don't have
 
01:57:07.790 --> 01:57:07.800 align:start position:0%
Carpenters that work for the ABC
 
01:57:09.750 --> 01:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
carpenters in the ABC that belong to the
 
01:57:12.709 --> 01:57:12.719 align:start position:0%
ABC or or uh the Carpenters that work
 
01:57:14.750 --> 01:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
for contractors that thank you for
 
01:57:17.350 --> 01:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
clarifying Sor I yeah yeah it's all good
 
01:57:19.069 --> 01:57:19.079 align:start position:0%
um every every company's going to be
 
01:57:20.950 --> 01:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
different but I don't I don't know what
 
01:57:23.830 --> 01:57:23.840 align:start position:0%
the current Carpenter Union rate is and
 
01:57:25.310 --> 01:57:25.320 align:start position:0%
I can't tell you which specifically
 
01:57:26.629 --> 01:57:26.639 align:start position:0%
which each contractor pays their
 
01:57:28.149 --> 01:57:28.159 align:start position:0%
Carpenters but I can tell you it's going
 
01:57:30.629 --> 01:57:30.639 align:start position:0%
to be competitive okay yeah okay I just
 
01:57:33.109 --> 01:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
want to make sure thank you Mr chair
 
01:57:33.119 --> 01:57:35.950 align:start position:0%
want to make sure thank you Mr chair
represent

01:57:35.950 --> 01:57:35.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:40.470 --> 01:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
McKenzie uh in your testimony um Mr reap
 
01:57:42.750 --> 01:57:42.760 align:start position:0%
you mentioned you say this
 
01:57:45.950 --> 01:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
that people are liberated from violence
 
01:57:48.910 --> 01:57:48.920 align:start position:0%
coercion intimidation as frequently part
 
01:57:52.189 --> 01:57:52.199 align:start position:0%
of the Union Camp unionization campaigns
 
01:57:54.189 --> 01:57:54.199 align:start position:0%
can you provide this committee with any
 
01:57:58.830 --> 01:57:58.840 align:start position:0%
evidence uh that uh this is happened
 
01:58:01.470 --> 01:58:01.480 align:start position:0%
this has happened in New Hampshire and

a negotiating team at all uh I
 
01:59:23.830 --> 01:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
personally have not been part of a
 
01:59:27.149 --> 01:59:27.159 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining team or negotiated
 
01:59:29.950 --> 01:59:29.960 align:start position:0%
contracts thank you
 
01:59:32.589 --> 01:59:32.599 align:start position:0%
sure representative seaworth thank you
 
01:59:35.589 --> 01:59:35.599 align:start position:0%
very much chairman thank you Mr chairman
 
01:59:38.910 --> 01:59:38.920 align:start position:0%
um in some of the prior testimony I
 
01:59:43.069 --> 01:59:43.079 align:start position:0%
heard an assertion that if an
 
01:59:48.109 --> 01:59:48.119 align:start position:0%
employer doesn't feel that these these
 
01:59:51.310 --> 01:59:51.320 align:start position:0%
um Fair share Agreements are appropriate
 
01:59:54.030 --> 01:59:54.040 align:start position:0%
to the contract they can simply
 
01:59:56.629 --> 01:59:56.639 align:start position:0%
refuse to negotiate them or to put them
 
01:59:59.709 --> 01:59:59.719 align:start position:0%
in the contract do you have any
 
02:00:02.870 --> 02:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
experience with that from the employer
 
02:00:05.709 --> 02:00:05.719 align:start position:0%
side of of the table um there there's
 
02:00:07.189 --> 02:00:07.199 align:start position:0%
been a lot of testimony can you can you
 
02:00:10.030 --> 02:00:10.040 align:start position:0%
say that question again for me so
 
02:00:13.430 --> 02:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
the what I heard some people say is that
 
02:00:16.629 --> 02:00:16.639 align:start position:0%
if an employer doesn't think this idea
 
02:00:18.669 --> 02:00:18.679 align:start position:0%
that there can there should be a fair
 
02:00:21.550 --> 02:00:21.560 align:start position:0%
share of agreement that all employees
 
02:00:23.350 --> 02:00:23.360 align:start position:0%
should be required to pay a certain
 
02:00:26.390 --> 02:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
amount to the union that the employer
 
02:00:29.990 --> 02:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
can simply say no that they don't want
 
02:00:31.550 --> 02:00:31.560 align:start position:0%
that as part of the
 
02:00:33.709 --> 02:00:33.719 align:start position:0%
contract do you have any experience with
 
02:00:34.589 --> 02:00:34.599 align:start position:0%
that you're effectively talking about
 
02:00:37.910 --> 02:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
like an agency fee or shop fee right um
 
02:00:40.069 --> 02:00:40.079 align:start position:0%
that's that that fee is going to be
 
02:00:42.149 --> 02:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
negotiated based on each
 
02:00:42.159 --> 02:00:44.790 align:start position:0%
negotiated based on each
individual

02:00:44.790 --> 02:00:44.800 align:start position:0%
individual
 
02:00:48.069 --> 02:00:48.079 align:start position:0%
shops agreement with the Union um I I
 
02:00:49.950 --> 02:00:49.960 align:start position:0%
can't think of offhand of any situations
 
02:00:52.390 --> 02:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
where there's not been a shop fee um
 
02:00:54.910 --> 02:00:54.920 align:start position:0%
that that's something that often times
 
02:00:59.510 --> 02:00:59.520 align:start position:0%

seven
 
02:02:38.390 --> 02:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
years I'll keep my remarks brief I'm
 
02:02:40.189 --> 02:02:40.199 align:start position:0%
speaking out against this bill it's not
 
02:02:42.669 --> 02:02:42.679 align:start position:0%
what we stand for in New Hampshire we
 
02:02:44.790 --> 02:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
have already discussed this previously
 
02:02:46.870 --> 02:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
in the legislature numerous times in
 
02:02:49.149 --> 02:02:49.159 align:start position:0%
2021 to be exact legislature voted oted
 
02:02:52.589 --> 02:02:52.599 align:start position:0%
this measure down known previously as s
 
02:02:55.430 --> 02:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
sp61 this has been voted down when we've
 
02:02:57.990 --> 02:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
had both parties in control of
 
02:03:00.510 --> 02:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
legislature this brings me to today's
 
02:03:02.990 --> 02:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
hearing if this legislation was voted
 
02:03:05.669 --> 02:03:05.679 align:start position:0%
down previously it
 
02:03:07.910 --> 02:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
proves that no matter what side of the
 
02:03:10.589 --> 02:03:10.599 align:start position:0%
aisle you're on this legislation
 
02:03:12.510 --> 02:03:12.520 align:start position:0%
understands the value of unions and the
 
02:03:15.350 --> 02:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
vital role that unions play in securing
 
02:03:17.229 --> 02:03:17.239 align:start position:0%
jobs for the working
 
02:03:19.910 --> 02:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
people this legislation does nothing for
 
02:03:21.870 --> 02:03:21.880 align:start position:0%
the working people of New Hampshire it's
 
02:03:24.149 --> 02:03:24.159 align:start position:0%
actually detrimental it should be named
 
02:03:25.430 --> 02:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
Right to Work For
 
02:03:28.270 --> 02:03:28.280 align:start position:0%
Less the average ra wage in right to
 
02:03:31.669 --> 02:03:31.679 align:start position:0%
work states is an average of 8,700 less
 
02:03:33.510 --> 02:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
than the same wage in non-ri to work
 
02:03:35.109 --> 02:03:35.119 align:start position:0%
states like New
 
02:03:37.589 --> 02:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a specific piece of this bill
 
02:03:40.270 --> 02:03:40.280 align:start position:0%
I'd like to speak to is
 
02:03:44.669 --> 02:03:44.679 align:start position:0%
273 d8 coercion and intimidation
 
02:03:46.870 --> 02:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
prohibited more than seven years ago I
 
02:03:49.430 --> 02:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
voluntarily walked into the IBD
 
02:03:52.950 --> 02:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
ibw local 490 office looking for work I
 
02:03:55.870 --> 02:03:55.880 align:start position:0%
was employed at the time I had a
 
02:03:58.270 --> 02:03:58.280 align:start position:0%
job I was in the North country of New
 
02:04:00.830 --> 02:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where I spent nine years below
 
02:04:03.990 --> 02:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
the poverty level in terms of
 
02:04:07.189 --> 02:04:07.199 align:start position:0%
income I was looking for change in no
 
02:04:09.030 --> 02:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
way did I feel pressured or coerced to
 
02:04:09.950 --> 02:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
join this
 
02:04:12.350 --> 02:04:12.360 align:start position:0%
organization in fact the gentleman I
 
02:04:13.790 --> 02:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
spoke to wanted to make sure I was
 
02:04:16.950 --> 02:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
serious about joining as I in my mid-40s
 
02:04:20.189 --> 02:04:20.199 align:start position:0%
now when was 39 years old then
 
02:04:22.910 --> 02:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
I have no regrets for joining the union
 
02:04:24.430 --> 02:04:24.440 align:start position:0%
do I speak to other electricians about
 
02:04:27.149 --> 02:04:27.159 align:start position:0%
the Union Yes am I proud of what I am a
 
02:04:30.629 --> 02:04:30.639 align:start position:0%
part of yes um this past June I was
 
02:04:33.069 --> 02:04:33.079 align:start position:0%
voted in as vice president of our
 
02:04:37.069 --> 02:04:37.079 align:start position:0%
Union and I'm very proud of that am I
 
02:04:38.510 --> 02:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
upset when someone has no interest in
 
02:04:39.790 --> 02:04:39.800 align:start position:0%
the union
 
02:04:42.470 --> 02:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
no do I pressure people to join in the
 
02:04:45.830 --> 02:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
conversation no I know what I have in my
 
02:04:49.589 --> 02:04:49.599 align:start position:0%
hands I worked in many Industries in the
 
02:04:52.030 --> 02:04:52.040 align:start position:0%
uh private and public sector since
 
02:04:55.069 --> 02:04:55.079 align:start position:0%
graduating from s some college in
 
02:04:58.030 --> 02:04:58.040 align:start position:0%
2001 I need to go back on something I
 
02:05:01.189 --> 02:05:01.199 align:start position:0%
said I do have a regret I do not regret
 
02:05:04.430 --> 02:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
a day of my education my only regret is
 
02:05:06.669 --> 02:05:06.679 align:start position:0%
I did not find this opportunity in 2001
 
02:05:08.270 --> 02:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
when I
 
02:05:10.350 --> 02:05:10.360 align:start position:0%
graduated this bill does nothing but
 
02:05:12.990 --> 02:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
Target organized labor and its policies
 
02:05:14.470 --> 02:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
I'll remind you that without organized
 
02:05:16.390 --> 02:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
labor historically we would not have a
 
02:05:18.790 --> 02:05:18.800 align:start position:0%
40-hour work week benefits of any kind
 
02:05:21.109 --> 02:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
mind protections against child labor and
 
02:05:23.750 --> 02:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
the list goes on supporters of this bill
 
02:05:26.030 --> 02:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
are quick to Target unions they need to
 
02:05:27.990 --> 02:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
understand that with we do so much for
 
02:05:30.390 --> 02:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
the good of this
 
02:05:32.589 --> 02:05:32.599 align:start position:0%
country the history books only talk
 
02:05:34.990 --> 02:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
about labor unions going on strike let
 
02:05:38.950 --> 02:05:38.960 align:start position:0%

02:05:41.990 --> 02:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
strike I am a father a brother a son and

02:08:11.790 --> 02:08:11.800 align:start position:0%
please good morning my name is Matt Pik
 
02:08:13.510 --> 02:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
I'm a resident of Manchester here
 
02:08:15.870 --> 02:08:15.880 align:start position:0%
representing workers democracy I've
 
02:08:17.830 --> 02:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
lived in New Hampshire for 4 years and
 
02:08:19.589 --> 02:08:19.599 align:start position:0%
my time here I've worked at more than a
 
02:08:22.990 --> 02:08:23.000 align:start position:0%
few manufacturing jobs New Hampshire is
 
02:08:24.669 --> 02:08:24.679 align:start position:0%
part of a belt of manufacturing in New
 
02:08:26.109 --> 02:08:26.119 align:start position:0%
England area that represents the
 
02:08:28.910 --> 02:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
backbone of American industry however
 
02:08:30.390 --> 02:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
while Manufacturing in New Hampshire
 
02:08:32.189 --> 02:08:32.199 align:start position:0%
employs 10% of the state's employee
 
02:08:34.510 --> 02:08:34.520 align:start position:0%
Workforce the total average real wages
 
02:08:36.510 --> 02:08:36.520 align:start position:0%
of its of its workers is considerably
 
02:08:38.310 --> 02:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
less than our counter counterparts and
 
02:08:41.629 --> 02:08:41.639 align:start position:0%
states around us why is this this is
 
02:08:43.030 --> 02:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
because of the climate of vicious
 
02:08:44.830 --> 02:08:44.840 align:start position:0%
harassment and antagonism that many
 
02:08:46.510 --> 02:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
employers bring against workers who
 
02:08:48.589 --> 02:08:48.599 align:start position:0%
exercise their legal rights as a work as
 
02:08:50.910 --> 02:08:50.920 align:start position:0%
a Workforce I have personally been
 
02:08:52.750 --> 02:08:52.760 align:start position:0%
involved in two separate Union campaigns
 
02:08:55.229 --> 02:08:55.239 align:start position:0%
at facilities around Manchester Airport
 
02:08:57.870 --> 02:08:57.880 align:start position:0%
and both times I have witnessed and have
 
02:08:59.629 --> 02:08:59.639 align:start position:0%
been the victim of extensive labor
 
02:09:02.030 --> 02:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
violations and unfair labor practices
 
02:09:04.069 --> 02:09:04.079 align:start position:0%
including wrong wrongful terminations of
 
02:09:05.950 --> 02:09:05.960 align:start position:0%
lead organizers for protected
 
02:09:08.830 --> 02:09:08.840 align:start position:0%
conservative activity I'm currently on
 
02:09:10.950 --> 02:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
an active nlrb case where three
 
02:09:13.030 --> 02:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
voluntary organizers including myself
 
02:09:15.189 --> 02:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
were fired on dubious and non-descript
 
02:09:17.589 --> 02:09:17.599 align:start position:0%
charges within 4 months after our
 
02:09:19.950 --> 02:09:19.960 align:start position:0%
campaign became public knowledge not to
 
02:09:22.589 --> 02:09:22.599 align:start position:0%
mention the other charges uh for Brazen
 
02:09:24.510 --> 02:09:24.520 align:start position:0%
acts of surveillance policy change
 
02:09:26.229 --> 02:09:26.239 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation of
 
02:09:28.069 --> 02:09:28.079 align:start position:0%
facts and
 
02:09:30.189 --> 02:09:30.199 align:start position:0%
retaliation companies in New Hampshire
 
02:09:32.229 --> 02:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
already feel that they're above the law
 
02:09:34.350 --> 02:09:34.360 align:start position:0%
when dealing with Union drives and right
 
02:09:36.229 --> 02:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
to work laws will only embolden them
 
02:09:38.589 --> 02:09:38.599 align:start position:0%
further far too often do we speak of
 
02:09:40.310 --> 02:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
unions from a business oriented or
 
02:09:42.629 --> 02:09:42.639 align:start position:0%
economistic perspective but the reality
 
02:09:44.270 --> 02:09:44.280 align:start position:0%
is that unions are not just a service
 
02:09:46.669 --> 02:09:46.679 align:start position:0%
for working people it is in essence the
 
02:09:48.310 --> 02:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
only measure by which workers can affect
 
02:09:50.310 --> 02:09:50.320 align:start position:0%
effectively combat exploitation and
 
02:09:53.310 --> 02:09:53.320 align:start position:0%
assert dignity at a job site unions are
 
02:09:55.189 --> 02:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
organizations formed by workers
 
02:09:57.149 --> 02:09:57.159 align:start position:0%
organizations that pull their forces
 
02:09:59.350 --> 02:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
pull their savings pull their political
 
02:10:02.149 --> 02:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
and civil activity into a United effort
 
02:10:03.790 --> 02:10:03.800 align:start position:0%
because of the vast disproportional
 
02:10:06.109 --> 02:10:06.119 align:start position:0%
power that corrupt wealth and Monopoly
 
02:10:08.830 --> 02:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
have in this country over the past 50
 
02:10:10.790 --> 02:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
years real wages have stagnated while
 
02:10:12.790 --> 02:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
productivity has doubled rents have
 
02:10:14.750 --> 02:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
doubled the cost of buying a home has
 
02:10:15.830 --> 02:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
gone up
 
02:10:18.830 --> 02:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
255 College tuitions have gone up rough
 
02:10:21.990 --> 02:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
150% all adjusted for inflation and
 
02:10:23.510 --> 02:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
traditional pension plans have been
 
02:10:26.390 --> 02:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
nearly entirely replaced by defined
 
02:10:29.510 --> 02:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
contribution or 401K plans leaving two
 
02:10:31.229 --> 02:10:31.239 align:start position:0%
whole Generations without a reliable
 
02:10:33.390 --> 02:10:33.400 align:start position:0%
source of income for retirement the
 
02:10:35.390 --> 02:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
severe loss in buying power and the
 
02:10:37.350 --> 02:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
general poor condition of our economy
 
02:10:39.069 --> 02:10:39.079 align:start position:0%
can be directly correlated with the
 
02:10:41.549 --> 02:10:41.559 align:start position:0%
gradual decline of union membership
 
02:10:43.390 --> 02:10:43.400 align:start position:0%
which was precipitated by the passing of
 
02:10:45.750 --> 02:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
the T ta heartley act establishing the
 
02:10:47.390 --> 02:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
state's ability to pass Right to Work
 
02:10:49.990 --> 02:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
legislation there is a likewise
 
02:10:51.790 --> 02:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
correlation between the number of states
 
02:10:53.430 --> 02:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
that have passed Right to Work bills and
 
02:10:56.669 --> 02:10:56.679 align:start position:0%
the entropy of organized labor right to
 
02:10:59.270 --> 02:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
work laws in general are only an effort
 
02:11:01.510 --> 02:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
by corrupt wealth and Monopoly to break
 
02:11:03.910 --> 02:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
the back of workers let us learn from
 
02:11:06.470 --> 02:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
recent examples in Missouri and Michigan
 
02:11:07.990 --> 02:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
where right to work was recently
 
02:11:09.910 --> 02:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
defeated and reversed for the first time
 
02:11:12.589 --> 02:11:12.599 align:start position:0%
in decades why were they defeated and
 
02:11:15.109 --> 02:11:15.119 align:start position:0%
reversed because the American worker had
 
02:11:17.589 --> 02:11:17.599 align:start position:0%
experience in knowing the truth of it
 
02:11:19.189 --> 02:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
why should we join those States
 
02:11:21.589 --> 02:11:21.599 align:start position:0%
dominated by corrupt wealth and Monopoly
 
02:11:23.430 --> 02:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
like those in the Deep South where right
 
02:11:24.990 --> 02:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
to work is an extension of right to
 
02:11:27.229 --> 02:11:27.239 align:start position:0%
slave we New Hampshire rights oppose
 
02:11:30.069 --> 02:11:30.079 align:start position:0%
such slave Holdings by power We Live
 
02:11:33.390 --> 02:11:33.400 align:start position:0%
Free or Die and Right to Work For Less
 
02:11:35.589 --> 02:11:35.599 align:start position:0%
is anything but Freedom it is a path
 
02:11:38.189 --> 02:11:38.199 align:start position:0%
towards quicker death to Poverty to
 
02:11:40.229 --> 02:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
continued am miseration of the worker on
 
02:11:42.669 --> 02:11:42.679 align:start position:0%
the production line freedom to freeload
 
02:11:44.629 --> 02:11:44.639 align:start position:0%
at the expense of others not only
 
02:11:46.229 --> 02:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
freeloading in the sense of receiving
 
02:11:48.470 --> 02:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
Ben benefits without putting in their
 
02:11:50.950 --> 02:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
Fair contribution but also freeloading
 
02:11:53.350 --> 02:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
in the sense of not contributing to the
 
02:11:55.350 --> 02:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
long-term movement of organized labor
 
02:11:57.310 --> 02:11:57.320 align:start position:0%
itself through the entire history
 
02:11:59.430 --> 02:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
through all the energy and all of the
 
02:12:01.390 --> 02:12:01.400 align:start position:0%
Blood Sweat and Tears that went into
 
02:12:02.990 --> 02:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
building up our rights and building up
 
02:12:05.709 --> 02:12:05.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:07.910 --> 02:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
today if we want any chance of
 
02:12:09.629 --> 02:12:09.639 align:start position:0%
recovering our economy for the working
 
02:12:11.709 --> 02:12:11.719 align:start position:0%
majority and once again create a good
 
02:12:14.069 --> 02:12:14.079 align:start position:0%
and widely accessible standard of living
 
02:12:16.310 --> 02:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
the answer is to strengthen our unions
 
02:12:18.589 --> 02:12:18.599 align:start position:0%
not weaken them the amount times this
 
02:12:20.629 --> 02:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
bill has been proposed despite Mass
 
02:12:22.350 --> 02:12:22.360 align:start position:0%
descent from the public and especially
 
02:12:25.109 --> 02:12:25.119 align:start position:0%
from Working Families every single time
 
02:12:26.790 --> 02:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
only tells me that maybe our state
 
02:12:28.669 --> 02:12:28.679 align:start position:0%
delegation does not truly have the
 
02:12:31.109 --> 02:12:31.119 align:start position:0%
interest of the constituency at heart
 
02:12:31.119 --> 02:12:35.189 align:start position:0%
interest of the constituency at heart

think Mr Reap is still here but what you

described in early your testimony about
 
02:13:18.270 --> 02:13:18.280 align:start position:0%
uh trying to trying to organize and then
 
02:13:20.189 --> 02:13:20.199 align:start position:0%
being you know fired from your job and
 
02:13:22.270 --> 02:13:22.280 align:start position:0%
other sort of it sounds that sounds a
 
02:13:25.430 --> 02:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
bit like the coersion and intimidation
 
02:13:27.430 --> 02:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
that Mr reap had in his
 
02:13:30.589 --> 02:13:30.599 align:start position:0%
testimony you have a comment on
 
02:13:34.350 --> 02:13:34.360 align:start position:0%
that uh I mean what I've experienced in
 
02:13:36.390 --> 02:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
the course of organizing around
 
02:13:38.830 --> 02:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
Manchester is that if anybody is
 
02:13:41.109 --> 02:13:41.119 align:start position:0%
intimidating anyone it's the company
 
02:13:42.870 --> 02:13:42.880 align:start position:0%

contractors who supports this
 
02:14:22.589 --> 02:14:22.599 align:start position:0%

workers of the State of New Hampshire
 
02:15:29.709 --> 02:15:29.719 align:start position:0%
the legislature this legislation comes
 
02:15:32.229 --> 02:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
to us from out of state and testimony in
 
02:15:33.830 --> 02:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
the past years and this year has been
 
02:15:35.990 --> 02:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly against the bill for the
 
02:15:38.390 --> 02:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
following reasons it is a bill that was
 
02:15:40.470 --> 02:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
crafted out of state and doesn't reflect
 
02:15:42.990 --> 02:15:43.000 align:start position:0%
what's happening in our state moreover
 
02:15:45.030 --> 02:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
the history of the bill is racist
 
02:15:47.310 --> 02:15:47.320 align:start position:0%
seeking to divide workers along race
 
02:15:50.629 --> 02:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
lines and put and to put down black
 
02:15:53.790 --> 02:15:53.800 align:start position:0%
workers racism is something that is not
 
02:15:55.390 --> 02:15:55.400 align:start position:0%
needed in the state and is something
 
02:15:57.709 --> 02:15:57.719 align:start position:0%
that we all need to take a stand on here
 
02:16:00.470 --> 02:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
and across the country it is an the
 
02:16:03.750 --> 02:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
anti-union anti-worker bill many workers
 
02:16:05.750 --> 02:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
and many union members from a variety of
 
02:16:08.669 --> 02:16:08.679 align:start position:0%
Industries have spoken about how they
 
02:16:11.030 --> 02:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
have benefited from better pay better
 
02:16:13.310 --> 02:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
safety better working conditions because
 
02:16:15.149 --> 02:16:15.159 align:start position:0%
they are members of the Union I can say
 
02:16:18.149 --> 02:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
that for myself as well they have tested
 
02:16:20.030 --> 02:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
to the training opportunities that they
 
02:16:22.229 --> 02:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
have received and that have helped them
 
02:16:26.750 --> 02:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
gain skills to make them um workers to
 
02:16:28.030 --> 02:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
of a high
 
02:16:30.390 --> 02:16:30.400 align:start position:0%
standard workers testify that the
 
02:16:33.070 --> 02:16:33.080 align:start position:0%
differences about differences in safety
 
02:16:35.110 --> 02:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
companies and right to work states are
 
02:16:37.709 --> 02:16:37.719 align:start position:0%
less diligent about safety training and
 
02:16:39.790 --> 02:16:39.800 align:start position:0%
safe working conditions not only keep
 
02:16:42.230 --> 02:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
workers healthy but save on cost in the
 
02:16:42.240 --> 02:16:45.150 align:start position:0%
workers healthy but save on cost in the
long

02:16:45.150 --> 02:16:45.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:48.990 --> 02:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
run workers in a right to work um States
 
02:16:51.349 --> 02:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
generally earn less with half the
 
02:16:53.309 --> 02:16:53.319 align:start position:0%
workers in New Hampshire earning less
 
02:16:56.070 --> 02:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
than a living wage and over a quarter
 
02:16:57.870 --> 02:16:57.880 align:start position:0%
stating that they have difficulty
 
02:17:00.669 --> 02:17:00.679 align:start position:0%
meeting daily expenses we should be
 
02:17:03.669 --> 02:17:03.679 align:start position:0%
lifting up workers moreover workers who
 
02:17:06.830 --> 02:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
are respected and paid decently have
 
02:17:08.990 --> 02:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
better morale which is better for their
 
02:17:12.230 --> 02:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
employers too the precarious financial
 
02:17:15.190 --> 02:17:15.200 align:start position:0%
situation of low wage workers leads to
 
02:17:18.509 --> 02:17:18.519 align:start position:0%
food and housing insecurity poor health
 
02:17:21.270 --> 02:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
and poor educational outcomes and more
 
02:17:23.669 --> 02:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
need to seek Public Assistance which is
 
02:17:26.629 --> 02:17:26.639 align:start position:0%
funded by taxpayers not by the employers
 
02:17:29.389 --> 02:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
whose low pay is causing the
 
02:17:31.750 --> 02:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
difficulties supposedly businesses are
 
02:17:34.469 --> 02:17:34.479 align:start position:0%
drawn to states with right to work but a
 
02:17:36.349 --> 02:17:36.359 align:start position:0%
study showed that those States also have
 
02:17:39.629 --> 02:17:39.639 align:start position:0%
low taxes and inexpensive electricity
 
02:17:41.950 --> 02:17:41.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has relatively low taxes
 
02:17:45.549 --> 02:17:45.559 align:start position:0%
but High electricity costs and moreover
 
02:17:48.349 --> 02:17:48.359 align:start position:0%
we have a housing and a Child Care
 
02:17:51.349 --> 02:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
crisis which it discourage workers from
 
02:17:53.509 --> 02:17:53.519 align:start position:0%
coming to New Hampshire and even make it
 
02:17:55.030 --> 02:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
difficult for our own Granite State
 
02:17:57.030 --> 02:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
Workers to
 
02:17:59.349 --> 02:17:59.359 align:start position:0%
work there is also a question of
 
02:18:01.469 --> 02:18:01.479 align:start position:0%
fairness workers in the US and New
 
02:18:03.669 --> 02:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire already have the choice to
 
02:18:05.709 --> 02:18:05.719 align:start position:0%
work or not to work for a company that
 
02:18:08.190 --> 02:18:08.200 align:start position:0%
has a union if they work for a company
 
02:18:10.629 --> 02:18:10.639 align:start position:0%
with a union and benefit from the
 
02:18:12.589 --> 02:18:12.599 align:start position:0%
contract and rights that the union has
 
02:18:16.549 --> 02:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
negotiated if they expected um then it
 
02:18:18.469 --> 02:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
is only fair that they pay the union
 
02:18:20.070 --> 02:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
dues for those
 
02:18:23.549 --> 02:18:23.559 align:start position:0%
benefits um several analogies have been
 
02:18:27.150 --> 02:18:27.160 align:start position:0%
made if one works but we know that if
 
02:18:29.389 --> 02:18:29.399 align:start position:0%
one wants to shop say at Sam's Club one
 
02:18:31.030 --> 02:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
pays the membership dues if you want to
 
02:18:33.950 --> 02:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
try travel on a Turnpike you pay the
 
02:18:37.230 --> 02:18:37.240 align:start position:0%
tolls there are alternatives I don't
 
02:18:38.950 --> 02:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
have to shop at those shops and I don't
 
02:18:41.270 --> 02:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
have to drive on the turnpike similarly
 
02:18:42.870 --> 02:18:42.880 align:start position:0%
workers can choose to work in a
 
02:18:45.629 --> 02:18:45.639 align:start position:0%
non-union shop and finally as a retired
 
02:18:47.790 --> 02:18:47.800 align:start position:0%
public educator in New Hampshire I am
 
02:18:49.270 --> 02:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
always pleased to hear from former
 
02:18:51.389 --> 02:18:51.399 align:start position:0%
students and in the past year or so I
 
02:18:54.270 --> 02:18:54.280 align:start position:0%
met a student in his early 20s who was
 
02:18:57.070 --> 02:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
so proud of himself to be a member of
 
02:19:00.389 --> 02:19:00.399 align:start position:0%
ibw which afforded him good paying job
 
02:19:02.469 --> 02:19:02.479 align:start position:0%
training and promotion opportunities
 
02:19:04.830 --> 02:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
retirement savings and the opportunity
 
02:19:07.469 --> 02:19:07.479 align:start position:0%
to stay in his home Community we need
 
02:19:10.150 --> 02:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
young workers in our grain State and for
 
02:19:11.990 --> 02:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
the betterment of our workers their
 
02:19:14.190 --> 02:19:14.200 align:start position:0%
safety fair business practices and the
 
02:19:16.190 --> 02:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire way please vote this bill
 
02:19:21.469 --> 02:19:21.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:23.990 --> 02:19:24.000 align:start position:0%

02:19:27.509 --> 02:19:27.519 align:start position:0%

02:19:34.389 --> 02:19:34.399 align:start position:0%
read something from the
 
02:19:34.399 --> 02:19:39.509 align:start position:0%
read something from the
online

02:19:39.509 --> 02:19:39.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:42.790 --> 02:19:42.800 align:start position:0%
happy thank you Mr chair um I will say
 
02:19:45.349 --> 02:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
there are some repetitions because
 
02:19:49.270 --> 02:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
people did sign up twice but uh with

um not only should um employee employers
 
03:40:59.950 --> 03:40:59.960 align:start position:0%
work out their wages um having an
 
03:41:01.870 --> 03:41:01.880 align:start position:0%
accelerator takes it out of the hands of
 
03:41:09.030 --> 03:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:09.040 --> 03:41:14.229 align:start position:0%
 
good

03:41:14.229 --> 03:41:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:16.429 --> 03:41:16.439 align:start position:0%
representative stop thank you Mr
 
03:41:20.870 --> 03:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
chairman um I I would um like
 
03:41:24.830 --> 03:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
to I speak against the motion of itl uh
 
03:41:26.830 --> 03:41:26.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has not raised our minimum
 
03:41:30.950 --> 03:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
wage since 2009 that's a very long time
 
03:41:33.149 --> 03:41:33.159 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire has the eighth highest
 
03:41:37.990 --> 03:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
cost of living in the country um and um
 
03:41:40.110 --> 03:41:40.120 align:start position:0%
although very few people right now are
 
03:41:43.550 --> 03:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
making um the minimum wage mostly it's
 
03:41:46.309 --> 03:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
tipped workers who if they come in and
 
03:41:48.349 --> 03:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
have a slow shift then the employers
 
03:41:52.070 --> 03:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
required to make up their uh make up
 
03:41:54.910 --> 03:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
their salary to 725 an hour that's a
 
03:41:57.950 --> 03:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
starvation wage um the bill as presented
 
03:42:00.990 --> 03:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
is very conservative it starts out um
 
03:42:05.030 --> 03:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
only raising the minimum wage to like
 
03:42:09.030 --> 03:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
$927 an hour but then um a year from now
 
03:42:12.670 --> 03:42:12.680 align:start position:0%
it would be 11 and it goes up to 17 um
 
03:42:16.670 --> 03:42:16.680 align:start position:0%
by uh by 2025 and the um reason that um
 
03:42:20.950 --> 03:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
I chose $17 is because the um MIT
 
03:42:23.990 --> 03:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
minimum wage calculator or or excuse me
 
03:42:25.910 --> 03:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
living wage calculator says that that's
 
03:42:27.510 --> 03:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that a person would
 
03:42:30.389 --> 03:42:30.399 align:start position:0%
have to make um in order to have a
 
03:42:35.910 --> 03:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
decent um U value of of life and um a
 
03:42:38.870 --> 03:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
decent quality of life so that's you
 
03:42:41.189 --> 03:42:41.199 align:start position:0%
know that's why we're looking at $17 an
 
03:42:43.309 --> 03:42:43.319 align:start position:0%
hour because I think one of the things
 
03:42:44.990 --> 03:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
that we need to think about is the
 
03:42:47.550 --> 03:42:47.560 align:start position:0%
quality of life of our constituents the
 
03:42:48.910 --> 03:42:48.920 align:start position:0%
other reason that I think we need to
 
03:42:51.670 --> 03:42:51.680 align:start position:0%
raise the minimum wage is because we are
 
03:42:53.149 --> 03:42:53.159 align:start position:0%
currently in the middle of a worker
 
03:42:57.110 --> 03:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
shortage and I every other um State
 
03:42:59.670 --> 03:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
around us has raised their minimum wage
 
03:43:02.070 --> 03:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
significantly and we are competing with
 
03:43:06.990 --> 03:43:07.000 align:start position:0%
those States for workers and um this
 
03:43:10.429 --> 03:43:10.439 align:start position:0%
$725 minimum wage is a is a red flag
 
03:43:11.990 --> 03:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
to young people who are considering
 
03:43:13.309 --> 03:43:13.319 align:start position:0%
whether they want to stay in the state
 
03:43:15.590 --> 03:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
or people who are considering moving
 
03:43:18.750 --> 03:43:18.760 align:start position:0%
here because minimum wage generally um
 
03:43:20.630 --> 03:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
it it affects people at the at the
 
03:43:22.630 --> 03:43:22.640 align:start position:0%
beginnings of their career and people at
 
03:43:26.229 --> 03:43:26.239 align:start position:0%
the the lower end of the wage scale so I
 
03:43:29.070 --> 03:43:29.080 align:start position:0%
mean I think it's part of our job as
 
03:43:31.710 --> 03:43:31.720 align:start position:0%
policy makers to create conditions that
 
03:43:34.309 --> 03:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
promote economic growth and right now
 
03:43:35.950 --> 03:43:35.960 align:start position:0%
the limiting factor in growing the New
 
03:43:39.030 --> 03:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire economy is the labor force so
 
03:43:42.269 --> 03:43:42.279 align:start position:0%
if we're not going to do things to um
 
03:43:44.630 --> 03:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
make our state more competitive then
 
03:43:46.670 --> 03:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
we're really hampering economic growth
 
03:43:48.710 --> 03:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
in the state and I think that that's why
 
03:43:51.189 --> 03:43:51.199 align:start position:0%
it's important to pass this Bill thank
 
03:43:52.870 --> 03:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
you representative thank you
 
03:43:54.149 --> 03:43:54.159 align:start position:0%
representative kahill followed by
 
03:43:58.349 --> 03:43:58.359 align:start position:0%
bushard thank you Mr chairman um I would
 
03:44:01.149 --> 03:44:01.159 align:start position:0%
U I would agree that the workforce is a
 
03:44:04.229 --> 03:44:04.239 align:start position:0%
major problem as is housing as is child
 
03:44:05.990 --> 03:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
care and this is why people need to make
 
03:44:08.790 --> 03:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
more money to be able to afford those
 
03:44:12.229 --> 03:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
things um personally I would have been a
 
03:44:16.590 --> 03:44:16.600 align:start position:0%
bit a bit more gradual and but this is
 
03:44:19.910 --> 03:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
what was offered and I'll support
 
03:44:19.920 --> 03:44:21.550 align:start position:0%
what was offered and I'll support
itative

03:44:21.550 --> 03:44:21.560 align:start position:0%
itative
 
03:44:24.750 --> 03:44:24.760 align:start position:0%
buard thank you Mr chair and be patient
 
03:44:28.750 --> 03:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
I forgot my glasses but I want to say um
 
03:44:31.389 --> 03:44:31.399 align:start position:0%
that I'm in opposition of this motion
 
03:44:33.309 --> 03:44:33.319 align:start position:0%
because I know that there are workers in
 
03:44:33.319 --> 03:44:33.990 align:start position:0%
because I know that there are workers in
my

03:44:33.990 --> 03:44:34.000 align:start position:0%
my
 
03:44:36.750 --> 03:44:36.760 align:start position:0%
city who work two or three jobs to pay
 
03:44:39.630 --> 03:44:39.640 align:start position:0%
their rent heat as well as putting food
 
03:44:42.710 --> 03:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
on on their table for their
 
03:44:45.910 --> 03:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
families though this bill is not a
 
03:44:48.710 --> 03:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
living wage bill it can help lift
 
03:44:52.149 --> 03:44:52.159 align:start position:0%
individuals and families out of poverty
 
03:44:54.269 --> 03:44:54.279 align:start position:0%
establish a degree of Economic Security
 
03:44:58.349 --> 03:44:58.359 align:start position:0%
for them and reduce chronic anxiety and
 
03:45:01.830 --> 03:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
stress often experienced due to income
 
03:45:04.149 --> 03:45:04.159 align:start position:0%
insufficiencies employeers would benefit
 
03:45:07.469 --> 03:45:07.479 align:start position:0%
from lower employee turnover and less
 
03:45:10.309 --> 03:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
money spent on hiring and training
 
03:45:12.750 --> 03:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
so far there is no empirical evidence
 
03:45:15.269 --> 03:45:15.279 align:start position:0%
raising the minimum wage causes an
 
03:45:19.670 --> 03:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
increase in unemployment or job loss in
 
03:45:22.910 --> 03:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
fact a golden Sachs analysis of the 13
 
03:45:24.710 --> 03:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
states that have raised their minimum
 
03:45:27.349 --> 03:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
wage found that the states where the
 
03:45:31.070 --> 03:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
minimum wage went up had faster
 
03:45:32.790 --> 03:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
employment growth than the states where
 
03:45:36.830 --> 03:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage remained at the 2013
 
03:45:39.389 --> 03:45:39.399 align:start position:0%
level and we haven't raised our minimum
 
03:45:39.399 --> 03:45:40.550 align:start position:0%
level and we haven't raised our minimum
wage

03:45:40.550 --> 03:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
wage
 
03:45:40.560 --> 03:45:41.830 align:start position:0%
wage
since

03:45:41.830 --> 03:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
since
 
03:45:45.550 --> 03:45:45.560 align:start position:0%
2007 as a taxpayer I am also concerned
 
03:45:47.389 --> 03:45:47.399 align:start position:0%
that many of these workers who will
 
03:45:49.830 --> 03:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
benefit from this minimum
 
03:45:53.389 --> 03:45:53.399 align:start position:0%
wage they'll depend on government safety
 
03:45:56.750 --> 03:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
net programs to supplement their
 
03:45:59.309 --> 03:45:59.319 align:start position:0%
salaries to meet their basic needs like
 
03:46:03.030 --> 03:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
food shelter transportation and heating
 
03:46:05.870 --> 03:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
I urge my colleagues to join me in
 
03:46:09.110 --> 03:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
opposing this itl on this minimum
 
03:46:11.990 --> 03:46:12.000 align:start position:0%

got a job for $18,000 plus I mean $18 an
 
03:46:45.830 --> 03:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
hour plus commission uh there's let's
 
03:46:48.950 --> 03:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
let the let the the market dictate
 
03:46:50.950 --> 03:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
thanks repr
 
03:46:55.189 --> 03:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
Schultz thank you Mr chair
 
03:46:59.469 --> 03:46:59.479 align:start position:0%
sorry um I get that anecdotal evidence
 
03:47:03.790 --> 03:47:03.800 align:start position:0%
um for our loved ones around us can
 
03:47:06.349 --> 03:47:06.359 align:start position:0%
influence our views on this I don't know
 
03:47:08.510 --> 03:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
if you listened to my speech if you were
 
03:47:10.070 --> 03:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
at the State House
 
03:47:13.389 --> 03:47:13.399 align:start position:0%
um on session day when the $15 bill that
 
03:47:15.710 --> 03:47:15.720 align:start position:0%
I was the lead sponsor on all my talking
 
03:47:18.189 --> 03:47:18.199 align:start position:0%
points were about Ronald Reagan and his
 
03:47:20.950 --> 03:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
value of hard work uh with the hope I
 
03:47:23.790 --> 03:47:23.800 align:start position:0%
would win over some Republicans to the
 
03:47:27.189 --> 03:47:27.199 align:start position:0%
cause uh one Republican did come over
 
03:47:29.269 --> 03:47:29.279 align:start position:0%
and so for that I do think it was worth
 
03:47:31.710 --> 03:47:31.720 align:start position:0%
it and maybe this won't change your mind
 
03:47:34.910 --> 03:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
but you know I think there are pretty
 
03:47:37.630 --> 03:47:37.640 align:start position:0%
compelling arguments to make that would
 
03:47:40.469 --> 03:47:40.479 align:start position:0%
appeal to Republicans
 
03:47:44.269 --> 03:47:44.279 align:start position:0%
um I know this because the data supports
 
03:47:47.030 --> 03:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
this when you pull the average Granite
 
03:47:50.030 --> 03:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
Stater and you say would you like New
 
03:47:52.189 --> 03:47:52.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to have a higher minimum wage
 
03:47:52.199 --> 03:47:53.030 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to have a higher minimum wage
than

03:47:53.030 --> 03:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
than
 
03:47:56.349 --> 03:47:56.359 align:start position:0%
$725 an hour at least the last poll I
 
03:48:00.550 --> 03:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
saw that did only go to 15 the majority
 
03:48:03.349 --> 03:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
of Republican voters in New Hampshire
 
03:48:06.229 --> 03:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
supported this so Rank and file
 
03:48:08.510 --> 03:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
Republicans are with us on this issue
 
03:48:13.149 --> 03:48:13.159 align:start position:0%
this is a bipar an issue um why then
 
03:48:16.590 --> 03:48:16.600 align:start position:0%
would we as a bipartisan body want to do
 
03:48:19.710 --> 03:48:19.720 align:start position:0%
that and I would say to support
 
03:48:22.510 --> 03:48:22.520 align:start position:0%
capitalism the market has failed Us in
 
03:48:25.469 --> 03:48:25.479 align:start position:0%
this area 100 over
 
03:48:28.189 --> 03:48:28.199 align:start position:0%
130,000 Granite Staters make less than
 
03:48:30.110 --> 03:48:30.120 align:start position:0%
15 I'm sorry that I don't have that up
 
03:48:32.990 --> 03:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
to date about how many make less than 17
 
03:48:35.389 --> 03:48:35.399 align:start position:0%
but it's obviously going to be more than
 
03:48:38.590 --> 03:48:38.600 align:start position:0%
130,000 Granite Staters with that high
 
03:48:41.429 --> 03:48:41.439 align:start position:0%
of a figure all of these folks making
 
03:48:43.510 --> 03:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
sub subpar
 
03:48:46.790 --> 03:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
wages live in all of our districts
 
03:48:50.030 --> 03:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
impacts our economy significantly and
 
03:48:52.389 --> 03:48:52.399 align:start position:0%
our economy isn't as good as the
 
03:48:55.110 --> 03:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
surrounding states that all have
 
03:48:59.349 --> 03:48:59.359 align:start position:0%
essentially double uh what we have um
 
03:49:01.070 --> 03:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
and I'll just end on this point because
 
03:49:03.990 --> 03:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
I think it to me is the number one point
 
03:49:07.189 --> 03:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
I will die on this hill this is the one
 
03:49:09.990 --> 03:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
issue I will die on is issues of wages
 
03:49:12.910 --> 03:49:12.920 align:start position:0%
and that's the notion of Working Poor we
 
03:49:15.590 --> 03:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
live in America in the one of the
 
03:49:17.950 --> 03:49:17.960 align:start position:0%
wealthiest States as represented of sto
 
03:49:21.550 --> 03:49:21.560 align:start position:0%
poed out in the country we live in a
 
03:49:24.950 --> 03:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
place of enormous wealth um certainly
 
03:49:27.269 --> 03:49:27.279 align:start position:0%
true of the people who probably serve in
 
03:49:28.950 --> 03:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
this body I can't say that I know that
 
03:49:31.550 --> 03:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
for sure we are a privileged group and I
 
03:49:33.870 --> 03:49:33.880 align:start position:0%
don't have a problem with privilege I do
 
03:49:35.269 --> 03:49:35.279 align:start position:0%
have a problem with the notion of
 
03:49:39.070 --> 03:49:39.080 align:start position:0%
Working Poor no one in America in the
 
03:49:41.750 --> 03:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
grand gred State should work full-time
 
03:49:44.590 --> 03:49:44.600 align:start position:0%
and not be able to pay rent or feed
 
03:49:47.750 --> 03:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
their children or take care of the
 
03:49:50.510 --> 03:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
basics much less have to struggle to pay
 
03:49:52.830 --> 03:49:52.840 align:start position:0%
for medication or child care all the
 
03:49:52.840 --> 03:49:53.870 align:start position:0%
for medication or child care all the
other

03:49:53.870 --> 03:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:49:53.880 --> 03:49:55.590 align:start position:0%
other
things

03:49:55.590 --> 03:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
things
 
03:50:01.030 --> 03:50:01.040 align:start position:0%
um as a Catholic as a person of
 
03:50:03.469 --> 03:50:03.479 align:start position:0%
moral uh I don't know I can't say that
 
03:50:05.269 --> 03:50:05.279 align:start position:0%
I'm the best human being necessarily but
 
03:50:08.269 --> 03:50:08.279 align:start position:0%
I try I just morally have a huge problem
 
03:50:12.030 --> 03:50:12.040 align:start position:0%
with this the notion that we a wealthy
 
03:50:15.790 --> 03:50:15.800 align:start position:0%
privileged State um would allow
 
03:50:18.309 --> 03:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
something like working poverty to be a
 
03:50:21.149 --> 03:50:21.159 align:start position:0%
concept that we perpetuate and so I just
 
03:50:24.469 --> 03:50:24.479 align:start position:0%
urge you regardless of your vote today
 
03:50:26.830 --> 03:50:26.840 align:start position:0%
think about that talk to your
 
03:50:30.590 --> 03:50:30.600 align:start position:0%
constituents we need this if the if we
 
03:50:33.429 --> 03:50:33.439 align:start position:0%
need to pass this in the near future and
 
03:50:36.870 --> 03:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
it is beyond suffering at this point and
 
03:50:40.469 --> 03:50:40.479 align:start position:0%
capitalism has not paid enough attention
 
03:50:43.269 --> 03:50:43.279 align:start position:0%
to what the aspect of workers in a
 
03:50:46.590 --> 03:50:46.600 align:start position:0%
capitalist economy and that as a value
 
03:50:49.830 --> 03:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
in uh society and if we don't turn that
 
03:50:52.030 --> 03:50:52.040 align:start position:0%
around uh it's going to hurt all of us
 
03:50:53.670 --> 03:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
because it certainly has hurt the
 
03:50:56.269 --> 03:50:56.279 align:start position:0%
state's economy
 
03:50:59.950 --> 03:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
um I try to keep it brief thank you but
 
03:51:02.429 --> 03:51:02.439 align:start position:0%
anyway there's there's my honest thought
 
03:51:02.439 --> 03:51:03.590 align:start position:0%
anyway there's there's my honest thought
repres

03:51:03.590 --> 03:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
repres
 
03:51:05.510 --> 03:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
Sullivan thank
 
03:51:09.590 --> 03:51:09.600 align:start position:0%
you um minimum wage keeps going up um up
 
03:51:13.070 --> 03:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
and up and up in the states around us in
 
03:51:15.309 --> 03:51:15.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it goes up in the bills
 
03:51:18.750 --> 03:51:18.760 align:start position:0%
that we propose
 
03:51:21.269 --> 03:51:21.279 align:start position:0%
um the bill the first bill I was
 
03:51:24.349 --> 03:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
involved with was a $12 minimum wage um
 
03:51:26.750 --> 03:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
then it was $15 minimum wage now it's a
 
03:51:30.510 --> 03:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
$17 minimum wage and and those are all
 
03:51:32.309 --> 03:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
appropriate numbers for their time the
 
03:51:35.110 --> 03:51:35.120 align:start position:0%
problem is we've not adopted any of them
 
03:51:36.389 --> 03:51:36.399 align:start position:0%
um and I've said it before I'm
 
03:51:38.790 --> 03:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
embarrassed to be in a state that does
 
03:51:41.870 --> 03:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
not have a competitive minimum wage um
 
03:51:45.630 --> 03:51:45.640 align:start position:0%
it hurts us as already has been stated
 
03:51:50.189 --> 03:51:50.199 align:start position:0%
um it sends a message to Young workers
 
03:51:53.750 --> 03:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
that we don't care enough about them to
 
03:51:57.910 --> 03:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
provide the lowest wage earners a
 
03:52:00.510 --> 03:52:00.520 align:start position:0%
competitive minimum wage um it's the
 
03:52:03.110 --> 03:52:03.120 align:start position:0%
least we can do and I will oppose the
 
03:52:06.590 --> 03:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
itl in favor of a different motion thank
 
03:52:08.870 --> 03:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
you representative McKenzie followed by
 
03:52:08.880 --> 03:52:09.670 align:start position:0%
you representative McKenzie followed by
Co

03:52:09.670 --> 03:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
Co
 
03:52:12.269 --> 03:52:12.279 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
03:52:17.950 --> 03:52:17.960 align:start position:0%
uh I think uh if we look at this
 
03:52:20.950 --> 03:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
strategically and we look at uh the fact
 
03:52:24.189 --> 03:52:24.199 align:start position:0%
that there are 50,000 people leaving the
 
03:52:26.790 --> 03:52:26.800 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire every day to work
 
03:52:28.870 --> 03:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
in a different state than New
 
03:52:31.630 --> 03:52:31.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if you look at the fact that
 
03:52:34.469 --> 03:52:34.479 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts minimum wage is $15 an
 
03:52:37.790 --> 03:52:37.800 align:start position:0%
hour a simple trip across the border
 
03:52:40.469 --> 03:52:40.479 align:start position:0%
you're in the $15 an hour range if you
 
03:52:43.950 --> 03:52:43.960 align:start position:0%
go to Vermont you're in the 13
 
03:52:47.510 --> 03:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
1367 if you go to Maine you're in
 
03:52:51.189 --> 03:52:51.199 align:start position:0%
145 so those people live on the
 
03:52:54.229 --> 03:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
border and those people who every day
 
03:52:55.510 --> 03:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
now I'm not saying the minimum wage
 
03:52:58.030 --> 03:52:58.040 align:start position:0%
workers the all of that 50,000 but
 
03:53:00.389 --> 03:53:00.399 align:start position:0%
that's a documented uh number that came
 
03:53:03.590 --> 03:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
from an economic study that we were uh
 
03:53:05.950 --> 03:53:05.960 align:start position:0%
that representative buer was nice enough
 
03:53:06.990 --> 03:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
to give
 
03:53:10.590 --> 03:53:10.600 align:start position:0%
us so just think think about this if
 
03:53:12.870 --> 03:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
somebody can get in their car and drive
 
03:53:12.880 --> 03:53:13.830 align:start position:0%
somebody can get in their car and drive
10

03:53:13.830 --> 03:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
10
 
03:53:17.630 --> 03:53:17.640 align:start position:0%
miles and make potentially $8 more an
 
03:53:20.229 --> 03:53:20.239 align:start position:0%
hour why would they stay in New
 
03:53:22.630 --> 03:53:22.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and there has to be some
 
03:53:24.510 --> 03:53:24.520 align:start position:0%
consideration for this just
 
03:53:27.590 --> 03:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
strategically looking at it we talk
 
03:53:29.750 --> 03:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
about this all the time about workers
 
03:53:32.990 --> 03:53:33.000 align:start position:0%
being you know we're losing workers we
 
03:53:34.429 --> 03:53:34.439 align:start position:0%
can't attract them to the state of New
 
03:53:36.510 --> 03:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I can tell you just
 
03:53:38.590 --> 03:53:38.600 align:start position:0%
looking at that economic report that
 
03:53:40.990 --> 03:53:41.000 align:start position:0%
this Situation's going to get worse and
 
03:53:43.590 --> 03:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
worse and worse and the predictions
 
03:53:45.469 --> 03:53:45.479 align:start position:0%
about how many vacancies are going to be
 
03:53:48.149 --> 03:53:48.159 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire is staggering so we
 
03:53:49.590 --> 03:53:49.600 align:start position:0%
need to start thinking about how we
 
03:53:52.070 --> 03:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
going to keep workers here and one way
 
03:53:54.110 --> 03:53:54.120 align:start position:0%
to begin the process of keeping workers
 
03:53:56.790 --> 03:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
here is to not let people in other
 
03:53:59.110 --> 03:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
states that surround us raise their
 
03:54:00.590 --> 03:54:00.600 align:start position:0%
minimum wage to the extent that they
 
03:54:02.670 --> 03:54:02.680 align:start position:0%
pull our workers out of the state which
 
03:54:04.790 --> 03:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
is which is what's happening each and
 
03:54:09.030 --> 03:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
every day so I I know the arguments
 
03:54:10.950 --> 03:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
people say Well everybody's this is all
 
03:54:12.630 --> 03:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
going to work out and the economy is
 
03:54:15.830 --> 03:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
going to make it work out but as as
 
03:54:17.910 --> 03:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
03:54:20.429 --> 03:54:20.439 align:start position:0%
said the signal that we're
 
03:54:23.030 --> 03:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
sending and it's not that we don't even
 
03:54:24.870 --> 03:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
have a minimum wage in the books in New
 
03:54:26.870 --> 03:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the only reason people have
 
03:54:29.429 --> 03:54:29.439 align:start position:0%
paid $725 an hour is because of the
 
03:54:32.070 --> 03:54:32.080 align:start position:0%
federal minimum wage we eliminated that
 
03:54:33.950 --> 03:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
minimum wage in New Hampshire a few
 
03:54:37.590 --> 03:54:37.600 align:start position:0%
years ago came back excuse me wrap it up
 
03:54:40.670 --> 03:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
no I said I believe oh we we we got rid
 
03:54:43.229 --> 03:54:43.239 align:start position:0%
of it and then we brought it back no I
 
03:54:45.030 --> 03:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
don't think we did true okay my
 
03:54:47.349 --> 03:54:47.359 align:start position:0%
apologies well what's still there is the
 
03:54:49.590 --> 03:54:49.600 align:start position:0%
tip wage is still in the in the minimum
 
03:54:51.550 --> 03:54:51.560 align:start position:0%
wage area but I don't think we ever
 
03:54:53.630 --> 03:54:53.640 align:start position:0%
brought it back I might be wrong we'll
 
03:54:55.870 --> 03:54:55.880 align:start position:0%
look at that again but that's a fact we
 
03:54:58.070 --> 03:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
got to start thinking about Workforce
 
03:54:59.670 --> 03:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
Development how we're going to keep
 
03:55:00.950 --> 03:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
people in the state how we're going to
 
03:55:04.030 --> 03:55:04.040 align:start position:0%
keep them engaged and this is one
 
03:55:06.950 --> 03:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
area that everybody says well they're
 
03:55:09.670 --> 03:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
getting paid 18 or 15 or that that the
 
03:55:11.510 --> 03:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
market is really responding to this when
 
03:55:14.590 --> 03:55:14.600 align:start position:0%
in fact if that's the case then what's a
 
03:55:17.349 --> 03:55:17.359 align:start position:0%
big deal if that's the case then why
 
03:55:19.229 --> 03:55:19.239 align:start position:0%
aren't we raising the minimum wage to be
 
03:55:22.030 --> 03:55:22.040 align:start position:0%
competitive with other places and I did
 
03:55:24.309 --> 03:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
Workforce Development with the aflc for
 
03:55:27.110 --> 03:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
a very long time and wages make a
 
03:55:29.389 --> 03:55:29.399 align:start position:0%
difference they make a difference and
 
03:55:30.830 --> 03:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
when you can travel a couple of miles
 
03:55:32.670 --> 03:55:32.680 align:start position:0%
and make a lot more money that makes a
 
03:55:34.990 --> 03:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
difference thank you Mr chairman welcome
 
03:55:35.000 --> 03:55:36.590 align:start position:0%
difference thank you Mr chairman welcome
representative

03:55:36.590 --> 03:55:36.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:55:39.790 --> 03:55:39.800 align:start position:0%
C thank you Mr chairman um I'm going to
 
03:55:42.550 --> 03:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
support itl on this I said a couple of
 
03:55:45.030 --> 03:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
times here our federal government is the
 
03:55:46.590 --> 03:55:46.600 align:start position:0%
one that hasn't raised the minimum wage
 
03:55:48.149 --> 03:55:48.159 align:start position:0%
and I think our complaints need to go to
 
03:55:50.469 --> 03:55:50.479 align:start position:0%
our federal government and I think that
 
03:55:52.269 --> 03:55:52.279 align:start position:0%
our Employers in the state should be
 
03:55:54.189 --> 03:55:54.199 align:start position:0%
able to set their wages and our
 
03:55:56.790 --> 03:55:56.800 align:start position:0%
employees looking for jobs should be
 
03:55:59.830 --> 03:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
able to demand the wage that they want
 
03:56:03.149 --> 03:56:03.159 align:start position:0%
or find another job and um as we listen
 
03:56:05.469 --> 03:56:05.479 align:start position:0%
to all of the right to work bills or All
 
03:56:08.269 --> 03:56:08.279 align:start position:0%
the Right to Work testimony we've heard
 
03:56:10.110 --> 03:56:10.120 align:start position:0%
I've heard time and time again they
 
03:56:12.229 --> 03:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
don't want to work for a union shop they
 
03:56:14.189 --> 03:56:14.199 align:start position:0%
can go get a job elsewhere well they
 
03:56:16.910 --> 03:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to make $7.25 or whatever the
 
03:56:19.229 --> 03:56:19.239 align:start position:0%
minimum wage is right now go find a job
 
03:56:21.189 --> 03:56:21.199 align:start position:0%
elsewhere or tell the employer I'm not
 
03:56:22.710 --> 03:56:22.720 align:start position:0%
going to work for that dollar amount
 
03:56:25.590 --> 03:56:25.600 align:start position:0%
simple as that and move on and that will
 
03:56:27.149 --> 03:56:27.159 align:start position:0%
correct the situation I listened to the
 
03:56:29.670 --> 03:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
news last night hearing that McDonald's
 
03:56:31.030 --> 03:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
is now charging I think it was
 
03:56:32.229 --> 03:56:32.239 align:start position:0%
McDonald's in California they're
 
03:56:35.070 --> 03:56:35.080 align:start position:0%
charging $18 now for a Hamburg meal and
 
03:56:36.710 --> 03:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
people are complaining because this is
 
03:56:38.830 --> 03:56:38.840 align:start position:0%
unaffordable well geez when you increase
 
03:56:40.990 --> 03:56:41.000 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage at McDonald's to be $15
 
03:56:43.349 --> 03:56:43.359 align:start position:0%
an hour what are you expecting you know
 
03:56:45.510 --> 03:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
there will forever be an unaffordable
 
03:56:47.429 --> 03:56:47.439 align:start position:0%
minimum wage because as the minimum wage
 
03:56:49.469 --> 03:56:49.479 align:start position:0%
increase the cost of goods is going to
 
03:56:51.670 --> 03:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
increase it just keeps going higher and
 
03:56:53.229 --> 03:56:53.239 align:start position:0%
higher and then everybody else who's
 
03:56:55.149 --> 03:56:55.159 align:start position:0%
paid above that is going to want their
 
03:56:58.070 --> 03:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
increase and it just keeps going so the
 
03:56:59.510 --> 03:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
federal government is not willing to
 
03:57:01.830 --> 03:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
increase it I'm fine staying with where
 
03:57:03.590 --> 03:57:03.600 align:start position:0%
it is and letting the employers
 
03:57:07.590 --> 03:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:07.600 --> 03:57:11.269 align:start position:0%
 
themselves

03:57:11.269 --> 03:57:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:12.590 --> 03:57:12.600 align:start position:0%
I don't disagree with a lot of the
 
03:57:15.389 --> 03:57:15.399 align:start position:0%
things that were said to my left and I
 
03:57:16.790 --> 03:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
will say what I said the last three
 
03:57:18.550 --> 03:57:18.560 align:start position:0%
times a bill came in front of us I
 
03:57:22.269 --> 03:57:22.279 align:start position:0%
really wish the house Democrat and house
 
03:57:24.070 --> 03:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
Republican leadership will get together
 
03:57:26.189 --> 03:57:26.199 align:start position:0%
get together and and come to an
 
03:57:28.269 --> 03:57:28.279 align:start position:0%
agreement on this where we don't have
 
03:57:31.309 --> 03:57:31.319 align:start position:0%
any escalations we don't have any uh
 
03:57:34.429 --> 03:57:34.439 align:start position:0%
automatic increases um or we just make a
 
03:57:37.469 --> 03:57:37.479 align:start position:0%
decision what the we all know in our
 
03:57:39.070 --> 03:57:39.080 align:start position:0%
heads to be the minimum wage that are
 
03:57:41.550 --> 03:57:41.560 align:start position:0%
going on in this state because I'm I
 
03:57:44.630 --> 03:57:44.640 align:start position:0%
don't like being the punching bag of uh
 
03:57:47.030 --> 03:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
of the state and this committee uh for
 
03:57:49.990 --> 03:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
this this issue all the time um there is
 
03:57:53.630 --> 03:57:53.640 align:start position:0%
solution uh but I'm sorry to say this
 
03:57:55.149 --> 03:57:55.159 align:start position:0%

03:57:57.750 --> 03:57:57.760 align:start position:0%

that's a start um would it be something
 
03:58:26.189 --> 03:58:26.199 align:start position:0%
that we could uh defer till next week
 
03:58:29.349 --> 03:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
and try to come up with a number just uh
 
03:58:32.110 --> 03:58:32.120 align:start position:0%
or or even pass this and a floor
 
03:58:34.070 --> 03:58:34.080 align:start position:0%

blur moving on
 
04:02:11.309 --> 04:02:11.319 align:start position:0%
to House Bill
 
04:02:13.670 --> 04:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
1668 relative to the establishment of a
 
04:02:15.950 --> 04:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
4-day work week representative Dro here
 
04:02:19.670 --> 04:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
recognized for a motion yep I move itl
 
04:02:21.229 --> 04:02:21.239 align:start position:0%
motion of the floor is inexpedient to
 
04:02:23.429 --> 04:02:23.439 align:start position:0%
legislate moved by represent Dro second
 
04:02:25.750 --> 04:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
by representative
 
04:02:28.710 --> 04:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
Prout you're recognized to speak to your
 
04:02:32.349 --> 04:02:32.359 align:start position:0%
motion okay well during testimony we
 
04:02:35.750 --> 04:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
heard um that this they did some studies
 
04:02:37.469 --> 04:02:37.479 align:start position:0%
and they actually found that a shorter
 
04:02:38.950 --> 04:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
Work Week actually
 
04:02:40.590 --> 04:02:40.600 align:start position:0%
kept Revenue the same for businesses or
 
04:02:42.550 --> 04:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
in some cases actually increased
 
04:02:44.710 --> 04:02:44.720 align:start position:0%
it and I couldn't wrap my head around
 
04:02:46.950 --> 04:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
that and I had asked for some more
 
04:02:48.469 --> 04:02:48.479 align:start position:0%
information which we never received or
 
04:02:51.349 --> 04:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
at least I never did um so I just revert
 
04:02:52.990 --> 04:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
back to numbers numbers are kind of what
 
04:02:55.309 --> 04:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
I always use to fall back on and in New
 
04:02:57.149 --> 04:02:57.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a lot of the
 
04:02:59.510 --> 04:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
trades they charge by the hour they
 
04:03:01.990 --> 04:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
might have a set price for big jobs but
 
04:03:03.389 --> 04:03:03.399 align:start position:0%
um you know plumbers coming out to
 
04:03:04.710 --> 04:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
repair your house it's by the hour
 
04:03:07.070 --> 04:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
electrician whatever so if you're a
 
04:03:08.750 --> 04:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
business as 10 employees
 
04:03:10.550 --> 04:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
and now you go from a 40 hour work week
 
04:03:13.189 --> 04:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
to 32h hour work week you're losing
 
04:03:16.149 --> 04:03:16.159 align:start position:0%
eight hours of billable work per
 
04:03:18.630 --> 04:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
employee that comes out to 80 hours a
 
04:03:23.070 --> 04:03:23.080 align:start position:0%
week so I H I don't see how Revenue will
 
04:03:25.550 --> 04:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
increase or even stay the same by
 
04:03:28.469 --> 04:03:28.479 align:start position:0%
decreasing the work working hours so
 
04:03:31.030 --> 04:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
part of the testimony we heard was well
 
04:03:32.910 --> 04:03:32.920 align:start position:0%
you just hire more employees everybody
 
04:03:35.630 --> 04:03:35.640 align:start position:0%
in this room both sides agree there's a
 
04:03:37.950 --> 04:03:37.960 align:start position:0%
work shortage it's not easy just to go
 
04:03:40.030 --> 04:03:40.040 align:start position:0%
out out and hire a new employee and to
 
04:03:43.830 --> 04:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
make up 80 hours of billable labor that
 
04:03:45.590 --> 04:03:45.600 align:start position:0%
would be over two employees now you have
 
04:03:47.750 --> 04:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
to go find two new employees out of a
 
04:03:49.790 --> 04:03:49.800 align:start position:0%
Workforce that already you can't find
 
04:03:53.030 --> 04:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
anybody on top of that we learned last
 
04:03:54.349 --> 04:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
time we had a little class on
 
04:03:56.110 --> 04:03:56.120 align:start position:0%
unemployment taxes and all that so now
 
04:03:57.790 --> 04:03:57.800 align:start position:0%
you're increasing the cost of your
 
04:04:00.309 --> 04:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
business by having new employees you're
 
04:04:01.910 --> 04:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
probably offering them benefits and
 
04:04:03.870 --> 04:04:03.880 align:start position:0%
everything else so even to get your
 
04:04:05.429 --> 04:04:05.439 align:start position:0%
Revenue the same now the cost of running
 
04:04:07.590 --> 04:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
a business goes up um and that's just
 
04:04:08.670 --> 04:04:08.680 align:start position:0%
the first half of the bill and the
 
04:04:10.750 --> 04:04:10.760 align:start position:0%
second half of the bill talked about the
 
04:04:13.229 --> 04:04:13.239 align:start position:0%
way we would pay overtime and to save
 
04:04:15.750 --> 04:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
time I don't we don't really need to get
 
04:04:19.189 --> 04:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
into all that but um the way it's done
 
04:04:20.910 --> 04:04:20.920 align:start position:0%
right now is basically the
 
04:04:23.189 --> 04:04:23.199 align:start position:0%
employer sets forth you know you can
 
04:04:25.070 --> 04:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
either pay overtime per day or you can
 
04:04:27.309 --> 04:04:27.319 align:start position:0%
pay your cumula of hours at the end of
 
04:04:29.670 --> 04:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
the week over 40 you can pay for that so
 
04:04:31.389 --> 04:04:31.399 align:start position:0%
having it mandated in a bill to pay a
 
04:04:34.469 --> 04:04:34.479 align:start position:0%
certain way kind of takes away what's
 
04:04:37.149 --> 04:04:37.159 align:start position:0%
always been the uh you know the the
 
04:04:39.790 --> 04:04:39.800 align:start position:0%
option of a business owner himself so
 
04:04:41.469 --> 04:04:41.479 align:start position:0%
and I don't really support bills that
 
04:04:43.990 --> 04:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
force it one way and not the other and
 
04:04:46.990 --> 04:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
for that reason I can't support this
 
04:04:50.990 --> 04:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you representative
 
04:04:52.870 --> 04:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
Sullivan I I think this is an
 
04:04:56.269 --> 04:04:56.279 align:start position:0%
interesting concept um and I have uh
 
04:04:58.670 --> 04:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
read and actually heard some radio
 
04:05:01.630 --> 04:05:01.640 align:start position:0%
programs uh discussing the uh the 4-day
 
04:05:04.590 --> 04:05:04.600 align:start position:0%
work week and I think uh in in some
 
04:05:07.070 --> 04:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
circumstances um it would it would make
 
04:05:10.790 --> 04:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
for a good you know experiment
 
04:05:14.189 --> 04:05:14.199 align:start position:0%
um however to make it a a required part
 
04:05:14.199 --> 04:05:15.309 align:start position:0%
um however to make it a a required part
of

04:05:15.309 --> 04:05:15.319 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:05:20.070 --> 04:05:20.080 align:start position:0%
our um workplace uh
 
04:05:23.309 --> 04:05:23.319 align:start position:0%
is in many instances
 
04:05:27.870 --> 04:05:27.880 align:start position:0%
uh difficult if not impossible um and uh
 
04:05:30.149 --> 04:05:30.159 align:start position:0%
frankly maybe there will come a time way
 
04:05:33.910 --> 04:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
down the road where this will will take
 
04:05:36.670 --> 04:05:36.680 align:start position:0%
uh be be more appropriate and more
 
04:05:38.469 --> 04:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
popular but right now
 
04:05:40.110 --> 04:05:40.120 align:start position:0%
I think it's in the category of an
 
04:05:43.469 --> 04:05:43.479 align:start position:0%
experiment um I hope people continue to
 
04:05:45.990 --> 04:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
experiment with it um and get more data
 
04:05:48.590 --> 04:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
to see if it see if more employers and
 
04:05:52.070 --> 04:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
employees might benefit from it but uh
 
04:05:54.389 --> 04:05:54.399 align:start position:0%
as a bill um it certainly it's not
 
04:05:56.309 --> 04:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
something I can support so I would will
 
04:06:01.189 --> 04:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:04.349 --> 04:06:04.359 align:start position:0%
itl I don't see any other
 
04:06:06.750 --> 04:06:06.760 align:start position:0%

04:06:10.030 --> 04:06:10.040 align:start position:0%

this is a bill that came to us with with
 
04:08:07.670 --> 04:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
no sponsor presenting it um I'm not
 
04:08:10.189 --> 04:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
enely sure what his motives were um the
 
04:08:13.550 --> 04:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
sponsor didn't come yeah um he um there
 
04:08:17.070 --> 04:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
is a identical bill that I understand he
 
04:08:19.030 --> 04:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
wanted it in the Senate right so so B
 
04:08:22.349 --> 04:08:22.359 align:start position:0%
bottom line is um the sponsor asked us

to itl this bill um I'm moving interm
 
04:08:27.830 --> 04:08:27.840 align:start position:0%

be voting against veterans with PS PTSD

um so uh we can vote to study it rather
 
04:08:37.870 --> 04:08:37.880 align:start position:0%

your motion thank you Mr chairman um
 
04:10:49.990 --> 04:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
some of the testimony
 
04:10:54.189 --> 04:10:54.199 align:start position:0%
um give us pause to look at this and
 
04:10:57.189 --> 04:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
um one question that came up was suspect
 
04:11:00.469 --> 04:11:00.479 align:start position:0%
questioning if they needed to do a um
 
04:11:01.950 --> 04:11:01.960 align:start position:0%
polygraph on them and this would
 
04:11:04.070 --> 04:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
prohibit that so um for that reason and
 
04:11:06.910 --> 04:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
amongst others um it shouldn't go
 
04:11:08.269 --> 04:11:08.279 align:start position:0%
forward thank than
 
04:11:12.149 --> 04:11:12.159 align:start position:0%
you there was another Sullivan thank you
 
04:11:14.309 --> 04:11:14.319 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure I'm a fan of doing
 
04:11:16.990 --> 04:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
polygraph tests on uh prospective
 
04:11:20.950 --> 04:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
employees um however um we didn't hear
 
04:11:22.750 --> 04:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
about any employers that were actually
 
04:11:24.790 --> 04:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
doing it other than perhaps law
 
04:11:26.510 --> 04:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement which there is an exception
 
04:11:30.990 --> 04:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
for um and I I guess I just I'm not in
 
04:11:34.269 --> 04:11:34.279 align:start position:0%
favor of passing legislation that solves
 
04:11:37.109 --> 04:11:37.119 align:start position:0%
problems that do not presently exist so
 
04:11:42.870 --> 04:11:42.880 align:start position:0%

04:12:52.910 --> 04:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
freelance employees recognized
 
04:12:54.830 --> 04:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan for a
 
04:12:58.870 --> 04:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
motion I move um interim study motion
 
04:13:01.149 --> 04:13:01.159 align:start position:0%
second FL is interim study seconded by
 
04:13:03.149 --> 04:13:03.159 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
04:13:05.349 --> 04:13:05.359 align:start position:0%
Schultz you recognized speak to your
 
04:13:08.149 --> 04:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
motion thank you um
 
04:13:09.469 --> 04:13:09.479 align:start position:0%
I think the sponsor of this bill
 
04:13:12.469 --> 04:13:12.479 align:start position:0%
acknowledged that um it really didn't do
 
04:13:16.790 --> 04:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
um all of what he wanted it to um the
 
04:13:19.510 --> 04:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
person who testified uh at length uh
 
04:13:22.750 --> 04:13:22.760 align:start position:0%
who's in a freelance working situation
 
04:13:25.189 --> 04:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
um I think also felt like they were sort
 
04:13:29.750 --> 04:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
of grasping at straws um the um it was
 
04:13:32.109 --> 04:13:32.119 align:start position:0%
it this is not a problem in search of a
 
04:13:34.389 --> 04:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
solution well this is a problem in
 
04:13:35.910 --> 04:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
search of a solution we just didn't find
 
04:13:40.790 --> 04:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
it with this bill um so as an aside uh
 
04:13:42.790 --> 04:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
during our discussion of it it was
 
04:13:45.309 --> 04:13:45.319 align:start position:0%
suggested that there are some uh unions
 
04:13:48.990 --> 04:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
out there such as the um musicians union
 
04:13:51.670 --> 04:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
or the uh screen Screen Actors Guild or
 
04:13:57.550 --> 04:13:57.560 align:start position:0%
the uh writer Guild who do Loosely um
 
04:14:01.870 --> 04:14:01.880 align:start position:0%
pull together um groups of people who do
 
04:14:03.429 --> 04:14:03.439 align:start position:0%
not have the same employer or do not
 
04:14:06.269 --> 04:14:06.279 align:start position:0%
have even consistently um the same
 
04:14:08.830 --> 04:14:08.840 align:start position:0%
employer individual ually um but it does
 
04:14:11.070 --> 04:14:11.080 align:start position:0%
set some standards for their employment
 
04:14:12.550 --> 04:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
and there there might be something to
 
04:14:14.590 --> 04:14:14.600 align:start position:0%
work with there but uh bottom line is it
 
04:14:17.870 --> 04:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
needs work um and um I think we should
 
04:14:20.429 --> 04:14:20.439 align:start position:0%
encourage the sponsor to uh continue his
 
04:14:23.349 --> 04:14:23.359 align:start position:0%
work on this and hopefully come back
 
04:14:28.590 --> 04:14:28.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:32.429 --> 04:14:32.439 align:start position:0%
you I initially uh felt that um this
 
04:14:34.830 --> 04:14:34.840 align:start position:0%
bill should go to interim study um after
 
04:14:38.070 --> 04:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
listening to testimony um online online
 
04:14:41.429 --> 04:14:41.439 align:start position:0%
and um because I think it's well it's
 
04:14:42.550 --> 04:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
not our
 
04:14:45.309 --> 04:14:45.319 align:start position:0%
job to teach people what to do with
 
04:14:46.950 --> 04:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
their bills and to tell them how to fix
 
04:14:49.630 --> 04:14:49.640 align:start position:0%
them necessarily all the time it's
 
04:14:51.750 --> 04:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
clearly something that is going on it's
 
04:14:55.229 --> 04:14:55.239 align:start position:0%
a clearly postco type of situation uh it
 
04:14:57.950 --> 04:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
even has a name you know now you know
 
04:15:00.269 --> 04:15:00.279 align:start position:0%
gig employee or gig jobs or all these
 
04:15:04.710 --> 04:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
other things that that go on um and uh
 
04:15:07.550 --> 04:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
it it will be worth the exercise
 
04:15:10.429 --> 04:15:10.439 align:start position:0%
and I say that in a polite way that
 
04:15:13.510 --> 04:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
to understand what is allowed and what
 
04:15:16.109 --> 04:15:16.119 align:start position:0%
is not by our department of labor rules
 
04:15:17.790 --> 04:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
and our other rules regarding health
 
04:15:21.149 --> 04:15:21.159 align:start position:0%
insurance and such so um again while I
 
04:15:23.229 --> 04:15:23.239 align:start position:0%
don't think it's our our our job
 
04:15:25.950 --> 04:15:25.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily to teach someone how to fix
 
04:15:28.389 --> 04:15:28.399 align:start position:0%
their bills or to resolve their issues
 
04:15:30.830 --> 04:15:30.840 align:start position:0%
um there's more benefit that can come
 
04:15:34.109 --> 04:15:34.119 align:start position:0%
out of this for all of us uh and anyone
 
04:15:35.389 --> 04:15:35.399 align:start position:0%
who wants to stay on this committee for
 
04:15:37.149 --> 04:15:37.159 align:start position:0%
years to come because this is will
 
04:15:38.790 --> 04:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
continue to be an issue that needs to be
 
04:15:44.269 --> 04:15:44.279 align:start position:0%

passes it'll be on the consent agenda we
 
04:19:48.950 --> 04:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
have one more piece of business
 
04:19:51.910 --> 04:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth um a question to
 
04:19:53.990 --> 04:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan on the bill that
 
04:19:56.109 --> 04:19:56.119 align:start position:0%
I submitted that had to do with the
 
04:19:58.710 --> 04:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
probate um we had talked about whether
 
04:20:00.630 --> 04:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
it was appropriate to have a study
 
04:20:03.950 --> 04:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
committee on that and just wanted to get
 
04:20:05.750 --> 04:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
an opinion whether we want to try to
 
04:20:07.790 --> 04:20:07.800 align:start position:0%
schedule that it's on our calendar for
 
04:20:12.429 --> 04:20:12.439 align:start position:0%
next Wednesday to be exact um is that
 
04:20:14.630 --> 04:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
something we want to formally do a
 
04:20:17.309 --> 04:20:17.319 align:start position:0%
subcommittee do we want to uh work
 
04:20:17.319 --> 04:20:19.189 align:start position:0%
subcommittee do we want to uh work
offline

04:20:19.189 --> 04:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
offline
 
04:20:23.349 --> 04:20:23.359 align:start position:0%
I it it can be removed from ex we could
 
04:20:24.990 --> 04:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
delay it it's not one of the early bills
 
04:20:27.510 --> 04:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
it has to get done it uh it seemed like
 
04:20:30.349 --> 04:20:30.359 align:start position:0%
something that uh you as sponsor beli
 
04:20:34.590 --> 04:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
needed some uh some work in Amendment um
 
04:20:38.429 --> 04:20:38.439 align:start position:0%
is is that correct so uh I came up with
 
04:20:41.950 --> 04:20:41.960 align:start position:0%
the with a number $3,000 was is the
 
04:20:44.590 --> 04:20:44.600 align:start position:0%
number in that bill it sounded like from
 
04:20:48.189 --> 04:20:48.199 align:start position:0%
the discussion that other members might
 
04:20:50.950 --> 04:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
have preferred a different way of
 
04:20:53.030 --> 04:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
calculating that
 
04:20:55.189 --> 04:20:55.199 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:20:57.870 --> 04:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
that I am open to anything that that
 
04:21:01.590 --> 04:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
would find a an a resolution to it I'm
 
04:21:05.590 --> 04:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
not I'm not against my number but I'm
 
04:21:09.309 --> 04:21:09.319 align:start position:0%
I'm not particularly for it either okay
 
04:21:12.309 --> 04:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
um I I I think coming
 
04:21:16.670 --> 04:21:16.680 align:start position:0%
up in the spirit of 20 to nothing um it
 
04:21:18.590 --> 04:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
might be nice to to work on it to make
 
04:21:19.750 --> 04:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we've got something
 
04:21:21.590 --> 04:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
that is a consensus I mean I don't think
 
04:21:24.229 --> 04:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
it's a a volatile issue frankly I think
 
04:21:25.870 --> 04:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
if we did nothing it probably wouldn't
 
04:21:29.109 --> 04:21:29.119 align:start position:0%
be the end of the world um but because
 
04:21:30.510 --> 04:21:30.520 align:start position:0%
it's not like anybody's been knocking
 
04:21:33.950 --> 04:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
our door down to uh fix this thing um we
 
04:21:36.670 --> 04:21:36.680 align:start position:0%
we had to go looking for it um but but
 
04:21:38.229 --> 04:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
uh just the same if we're going to fix
 
04:21:39.870 --> 04:21:39.880 align:start position:0%
it if we can fix it in a way that people
 
04:21:44.790 --> 04:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
feel is uh um you know most acceptable
 
04:21:47.229 --> 04:21:47.239 align:start position:0%
um by most everyone that'd be a good
 
04:21:48.830 --> 04:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
idea and put something else in the
 
04:21:52.510 --> 04:21:52.520 align:start position:0%
consent calendar so yes I I I would be
 
04:21:56.469 --> 04:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
um be willing to work on it so I guess
 
04:21:59.109 --> 04:21:59.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman maybe an appropriate way to
 
04:22:02.149 --> 04:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
schedule that is to defer the executive
 
04:22:04.630 --> 04:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
session and schedule a subcommittee when
 
04:22:07.349 --> 04:22:07.359 align:start position:0%
we finish our meeting
 
04:22:10.950 --> 04:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
a week from now maybe I uh I will notify
 
04:22:12.790 --> 04:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
um our assistant that we will be
 
04:22:15.149 --> 04:22:15.159 align:start position:0%
removing that bill from executive
 
04:22:17.750 --> 04:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
session next week and then if you and
 
04:22:19.710 --> 04:22:19.720 align:start position:0%
representative s would get me the
 
04:22:22.109 --> 04:22:22.119 align:start position:0%
appropriate members
 
04:22:25.870 --> 04:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
um so we can announce it next week how
 
04:22:28.109 --> 04:22:28.119 align:start position:0%
many are we looking for two to each to
 
04:22:30.990 --> 04:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
each um representative buard did you say
 
04:22:32.830 --> 04:22:32.840 align:start position:0%

04:22:49.870 --> 04:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
reason we can't announce that today and
 
04:22:53.269 --> 04:22:53.279 align:start position:0%
