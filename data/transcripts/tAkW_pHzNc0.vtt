to discuss now um perhaps we need a
 
00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:42.440 align:start position:0%
minute or two before that's distributed
 
00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:46.600 align:start position:0%
I will say that um this amendment is a
 
00:16:49.749 --> 00:16:49.759 align:start position:0%
replace Hall as mentioned earlier and it
 
00:16:51.309 --> 00:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
does come with
 
00:16:54.509 --> 00:16:54.519 align:start position:0%
findings uh four of
 
00:16:58.949 --> 00:16:58.959 align:start position:0%
them and the body of this amendment came
 
00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:04.120 align:start position:0%
to us from the chair of Ethics um all of
 
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
the findings came to us from the chair
 
00:17:12.669 --> 00:17:12.679 align:start position:0%
of Ethics um last year and and continued
 
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
to stay with us in the um retain Bill
 
00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
process that points to why this is an
 
00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:23.880 align:start position:0%
important piece of
 
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
legislation um and
 
00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:29.039 align:start position:0%
then I think it's
 
00:17:29.039 --> 00:17:31.470 align:start position:0%
then I think it's
clear

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:31.480 align:start position:0%
clear
 
00:17:34.909 --> 00:17:34.919 align:start position:0%
um you will see as you look through up
 
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
here we go as you look through the
 
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
amendment um a lot of the language will
 
00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
be similar to what we saw in that
 
00:17:46.669 --> 00:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
it but representative she would you like
 
00:17:52.909 --> 00:17:52.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:52.919 --> 00:17:55.470 align:start position:0%
 
Amendment

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:55.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:00.280 align:start position:0%
yes um so as chairman Hill stated
 
00:18:02.909 --> 00:18:02.919 align:start position:0%
previously that this bill has been a
 
00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:05.240 align:start position:0%
work in progress since last
 
00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:09.960 align:start position:0%
term um we've studied how other
 
00:18:14.149 --> 00:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
states uh handle recusal in their
 
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039 align:start position:0%
legislatures um we've had help from the
 
00:18:17.039 --> 00:18:18.350 align:start position:0%
legislatures um we've had help from the
research

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
research
 
00:18:21.669 --> 00:18:21.679 align:start position:0%
department and um as well as the Ethics
 
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
Committee which 99% of the wording comes
 
00:18:27.789 --> 00:18:27.799 align:start position:0%
from recommendations from the Ethics
 
00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
Committee so we feel we have good
 
00:18:34.029 --> 00:18:34.039 align:start position:0%
wording um strong wording that uh we've
 
00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:37.480 align:start position:0%
got input by a number of uh sources and
 
00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:39.400 align:start position:0%
we feel that you know this bill is ready
 
00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:44.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
floor thank you um would the ranking
 
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
member who also sits on ethics like
 
00:18:56.669 --> 00:18:56.679 align:start position:0%
a quick comment or two uh good morning
 
00:19:00.149 --> 00:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee
 
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
I initially supported
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
this until I went to the Ethics
 
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
Committee and yes I am on the Ethics
 
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
Committee and with discussion in the
 
00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee I listened to what was
 
00:19:14.789 --> 00:19:14.799 align:start position:0%
said uh former Speaker of the House Don
 
00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
aitech was the first to speak who said
 
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
this is too broad it's not
 
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
enforcable it goes beyond in fact what
 
00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
she said is enforceable and and the big
 
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
thing is it excludes too many people too
 
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
many members of the legislature and the
 
00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:34.360 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee felt it should be
 
00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:37.640 align:start position:0%
narrowed down therefore the Ethics
 
00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:40.280 align:start position:0%
Committee voted against this particular
 
00:19:44.149 --> 00:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
is um thank you um representative wall
 
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
did the Ethics Committee
 
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.870 align:start position:0%
did the Ethics Committee
mention

00:19:52.870 --> 00:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
mention
 
00:19:57.549 --> 00:19:57.559 align:start position:0%
um the source of of the language in this
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
yes the source of the language was
 
00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
definitely mentioned um they recognized
 
00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
that uh again the members of the
 
00:20:08.029 --> 00:20:08.039 align:start position:0%
committee just felt that it excluded too
 
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
many members from being able to vote in
 
00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:13.400 align:start position:0%
the house that we needed to narrow it
 
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
down did the Ethics Committee offer
 
00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
suggestions of how that could be
 
00:20:20.909 --> 00:20:20.919 align:start position:0%
narrowed down the Ethics Committee said
 
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
respectfully that they would like this
 
00:20:25.549 --> 00:20:25.559 align:start position:0%
committee to be able to look at it
 
00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:27.640 align:start position:0%
further and see what they could do they
 
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
didn't feel that were in the position to
 
00:20:32.789 --> 00:20:32.799 align:start position:0%
um draft
 
00:20:37.149 --> 00:20:37.159 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you any further
 
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:39.640 align:start position:0%
comments representative sers yeah I have
 
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
a thank you Mr chair I have a question
 
00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:43.720 align:start position:0%
as far as the ethic committee I know
 
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
they don't write legislation I get it
 
00:20:48.430 --> 00:20:48.440 align:start position:0%
but did they have
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
suggestions actually they do write
 
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
legislation that's how we get the
 
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
original bill um was written by the
 
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
chair of I thought I just heard her say
 
00:20:59.470 --> 00:20:59.480 align:start position:0%
that they did didn't write it
 
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:02.360 align:start position:0%
so yes represent I'd like to respond to
 
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
that sure um this has gone so far right
 
00:21:06.789 --> 00:21:06.799 align:start position:0%
now that we're into the home stretch on
 
00:21:09.029 --> 00:21:09.039 align:start position:0%
it and they felt that this committee had
 
00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:11.720 align:start position:0%
a better handle on uh what should or
 
00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
should not be included they they feel
 
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:17.320 align:start position:0%
that it goes too far in the terms again
 
00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:19.720 align:start position:0%
of excluding too many members in terms
 
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
of the language and if we go through it
 
00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:23.400 align:start position:0%
we can perhaps pick that out I don't
 
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
know what the committee prefers to do
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you um
 
00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
so it was evident um at least to me from
 
00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
the start that there were two ways to
 
00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
draft legislation on this topic um one
 
00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
was as the Ethics Committee gave us the
 
00:21:44.269 --> 00:21:44.279 align:start position:0%
bill which was for
 
00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
prosecutorial purposes um when when
 
00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
someone had an Ethics complaint um filed
 
00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:55.960 align:start position:0%
they would be able to use this language
 
00:21:59.390 --> 00:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
um to match it up to what the complaint
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
was and and that's what the original
 
00:22:02.159 --> 00:22:04.110 align:start position:0%
was and and that's what the original
Bill

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:04.120 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
did um this
 
00:22:10.029 --> 00:22:10.039 align:start position:0%
committee I'm not sure if it was last
 
00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:12.520 align:start position:0%
year or the end yeah I think it was this
 
00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:17.960 align:start position:0%
term um try to look at it more as an
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
advisory um piece of legislation so that
 
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
we could advise particularly newer
 
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
Representatives what was ad advisable
 
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
when when would be a good time for
 
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
someone to recuse themselves so that you
 
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
could avoid that complaint U arriving at
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
ethics um that was the piece that we
 
00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
brought to the Ethics Committee um prior
 
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
to retaining this um during the normal I
 
00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:52.640 align:start position:0%
think it was even after a
 
00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:55.480 align:start position:0%
crossover um they didn't like that
 
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
version either because it gave them no
 
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
leeway um
 
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
from from that point on um all this
 
00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
committee has done is um taken their
 
00:23:15.789 --> 00:23:15.799 align:start position:0%
language that that they originally
 
00:23:19.149 --> 00:23:19.159 align:start position:0%
requested and and that's what we sent
 
00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
back to them yesterday uh for comment um
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
it was their language so um I'm not sure
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
if if um there's much that we can do
 
00:23:35.549 --> 00:23:35.559 align:start position:0%
Beyond um giving them two options
 
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
neither of which they seem to have have
 
00:23:41.149 --> 00:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
liked and one of those options was their
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
own language back so um representative
 
00:23:47.789 --> 00:23:47.799 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman I I
 
00:23:49.230 --> 00:23:49.240 align:start position:0%
really appreciate and agree with what
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
you have said um I it's my belief that
 
00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:55.720 align:start position:0%
the Ethics Committee would prefer to go
 
00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:57.320 align:start position:0%
back even though they didn't state it
 
00:23:59.909 --> 00:23:59.919 align:start position:0%
it's and during the short discussion
 
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
they had on this amendment yesterday
 
00:24:05.269 --> 00:24:05.279 align:start position:0%
they preferred seemed to have preferred
 
00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
the simpler language that uh chairman
 
00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
Ned Gordon had had in the beginning
 
00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:14.440 align:start position:0%
which um defined when someone should
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
recuse for conflicts of interest and
 
00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
defines uh direct
 
00:24:24.789 --> 00:24:24.799 align:start position:0%
Financial uh benefit and that's about it
 
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
that's the difference it it simplifies
 
00:24:30.029 --> 00:24:30.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
you I think the language before
 
00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
us is Ned Gordon's language represent uh
 
00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
chairman Gordon's language the only
 
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
thing that has been
 
00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:54.520 align:start position:0%
changed Was the removal of an
 
00:24:58.110 --> 00:24:58.120 align:start position:0%
additional definition that of special
 
00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:00.590 align:start position:0%
additional definition that of special
interest

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
um and the reason special interest was
 
00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
removed was it didn't seem to um Define
 
00:25:10.669 --> 00:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
anything it only gave us an additional
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
definition to have to weed through um
 
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
you'll see on line 27 of page
 
00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
two um con it the original language said
 
00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:25.000 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest means the condition
 
00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
in which a legislator has a special
 
00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
interest and we've changed that to a
 
00:25:34.149 --> 00:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
financial interest or a non-financial
 
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
personal interest both of those things
 
00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:39.080 align:start position:0%
were already defined as special interest
 
00:25:40.909 --> 00:25:40.919 align:start position:0%
in the original
 
00:25:40.919 --> 00:25:43.389 align:start position:0%
in the original
language

00:25:43.389 --> 00:25:43.399 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:25:43.399 --> 00:25:44.909 align:start position:0%
language
so

00:25:44.909 --> 00:25:44.919 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:49.640 align:start position:0%
um they had in the original Bill special
 
00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
interest defined as means any Financial
 
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
or non-financial personal interest in
 
00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
the outcome of a matter that is the
 
00:25:59.909 --> 00:25:59.919 align:start position:0%
subject of offici activity distinct from
 
00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
and greater than the interests of the
 
00:26:04.149 --> 00:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
public at
 
00:26:11.909 --> 00:26:11.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
removed in response um I understand what
 
00:26:18.669 --> 00:26:18.679 align:start position:0%
you're saying Mr chairman um disclosure
 
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
of conflicts of interests in the
 
00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:23.240 align:start position:0%
amendment um I'm going from the original
 
00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:26.120 align:start position:0%
draft I don't I didn't look at the
 
00:26:28.269 --> 00:26:28.279 align:start position:0%
amendment to see exactly where it comes
 
00:26:31.549 --> 00:26:31.559 align:start position:0%
in um but talks about anyone acting as
 
00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
counsel or serving as an attorney for
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
any party which has a conflict of
 
00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:38.600 align:start position:0%
interest in the official legislative
 
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
activity and that has been added from my
 
00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:46.520 align:start position:0%
understanding um where is that now I'm
 
00:26:49.029 --> 00:26:49.039 align:start position:0%
looking at just the original draft that
 
00:26:50.669 --> 00:26:50.679 align:start position:0%
was given to
 
00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
me can you point to a line or I'm on for
 
00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
the original draft on
 
00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.710 align:start position:0%
the original draft on
roman3

00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:58.720 align:start position:0%

away thank line 18 did you say yeah I
 
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:19.600 align:start position:0%

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
two uh acting as Council serving as
 
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
attorney for any party that has conflict
 
00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:24.950 align:start position:0%
attorney for any party that has conflict
of

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.510 align:start position:0%
of
interest

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.029 align:start position:0%
interest
um

00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:29.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:31.909 --> 00:27:31.919 align:start position:0%
that there was a comment about
 
00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:34.520 align:start position:0%
that again there was no big discussion
 
00:27:39.669 --> 00:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
on this I mean almost instantly um the
 
00:27:41.149 --> 00:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
former Speaker of the House said it's
 
00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
too broad it it it's almost
 
00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
unenforceable rep yes representative
 
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
McGuire uh two comments really that part
 
00:27:54.269 --> 00:27:54.279 align:start position:0%
about acting as Council which has a
 
00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest in the official
 
00:27:58.750 --> 00:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
legislative activity isn't that already
 
00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
forbidden by our constitution yes so we
 
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
don't need to reiterate it in the
 
00:28:07.230 --> 00:28:07.240 align:start position:0%
legislation because it's in the
 
00:28:10.909 --> 00:28:10.919 align:start position:0%
Constitution and the other thing is that
 
00:28:12.870 --> 00:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
the current
 
00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
definitions allow for a great deal of
 
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:19.360 align:start position:0%
interpretation U for example when we're
 
00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
voting on
 
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
the education Freedom accounts or the
 
00:28:25.389 --> 00:28:25.399 align:start position:0%
tax credit
 
00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
scholarships some people who families
 
00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
are involved in the program recuse
 
00:28:33.549 --> 00:28:33.559 align:start position:0%
themselves and some people don't because
 
00:28:36.509 --> 00:28:36.519 align:start position:0%
they say Well it affects everybody so I
 
00:28:39.789 --> 00:28:39.799 align:start position:0%
think that having it clearer that in
 
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
such a case you should recuse yourself
 
00:28:45.029 --> 00:28:45.039 align:start position:0%
will mean
 
00:28:47.509 --> 00:28:47.519 align:start position:0%
that we need to give better guidelines
 
00:28:48.950 --> 00:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
because otherwise people are going to
 
00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
interpret it the way they
 
00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
want thank
 
00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
you representative wall I think that
 
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
does make sense one of the problems we
 
00:28:58.590 --> 00:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
have is people people don't even look at
 
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
the ethics guidelines people don't seem
 
00:29:04.389 --> 00:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
to know uh when they should recuse we'd
 
00:29:06.909 --> 00:29:06.919 align:start position:0%
rather have more people recuse them not
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%
in the interest of doing the right thing
 
00:29:12.509 --> 00:29:12.519 align:start position:0%
and that is the problem getting people
 
00:29:14.269 --> 00:29:14.279 align:start position:0%
to understand when and when they should
 
00:29:20.269 --> 00:29:20.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:23.509 --> 00:29:23.519 align:start position:0%
said um I would like to point out that u
 
00:29:25.909 --> 00:29:25.919 align:start position:0%
under the findings uh the number one
 
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
finding talks about part two article 7
 
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Constitution no
 
00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
member of the general court shall take
 
00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
fees be of councel or act as Advocate or
 
00:29:39.630 --> 00:29:39.640 align:start position:0%
any cause before either branch of the
 
00:29:42.269 --> 00:29:42.279 align:start position:0%
legislature um and upon due proof
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
thereof such member shall forfeit his
 
00:29:48.029 --> 00:29:48.039 align:start position:0%
seat in the legislature that's
 
00:29:48.039 --> 00:29:50.269 align:start position:0%
seat in the legislature that's
almost

00:29:50.269 --> 00:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
almost
 
00:29:50.279 --> 00:29:52.310 align:start position:0%
almost
exactly

00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
um the definition that they had problems
 
00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:59.110 align:start position:0%
um the definition that they had problems
with

00:29:59.110 --> 00:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:30:01.509 --> 00:30:01.519 align:start position:0%
the question of course Mr chair is that
 
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
the if it's already you've already found
 
00:30:05.909 --> 00:30:05.919 align:start position:0%
that it's in the constitution do we need
 
00:30:10.669 --> 00:30:10.679 align:start position:0%
to reiterate that in in the statute or
 
00:30:12.029 --> 00:30:12.039 align:start position:0%
is it
 
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
assumed um or are they not is it not act
 
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
actually being done and counter to that
 
00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
if it's already in the Constitution
 
00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
what's the harm in it being reiterated
 
00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
okay representative sers I'm just
 
00:30:28.389 --> 00:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
wondering on
 
00:30:31.509 --> 00:30:31.519 align:start position:0%
um why not just point the Constitution
 
00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:34.600 align:start position:0%
at that point could you know as
 
00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.710 align:start position:0%
at that point could you know as
well

00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:37.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:43.470 align:start position:0%
 
good

00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:43.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:46.789 --> 00:30:46.799 align:start position:0%
sense six of to me that's six of one
 
00:30:50.269 --> 00:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
half dozen of another um if you point to
 
00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:53.640 align:start position:0%
that section or you use the the
 
00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
language from the Constitution yep
 
00:30:58.750 --> 00:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
representative C yeah so as a new
 
00:31:01.549 --> 00:31:01.559 align:start position:0%
legislator um I you can only use that in
 
00:31:04.389 --> 00:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
the first year
 
00:31:07.269 --> 00:31:07.279 align:start position:0%
by still the first year uh any case my
 
00:31:08.629 --> 00:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
point is is that you know the
 
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
Constitution is is uh an area that I'm
 
00:31:14.669 --> 00:31:14.679 align:start position:0%
not extremely wellous but getting better
 
00:31:18.269 --> 00:31:18.279 align:start position:0%
with and if I if I look at a statue and
 
00:31:22.269 --> 00:31:22.279 align:start position:0%
it's in there it it's pointing to a a
 
00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
part one part two article then they said
 
00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
oh okay that makes sense to me that's
 
00:31:28.750 --> 00:31:28.760 align:start position:0%
all it just helps out for
 
00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:31.880 align:start position:0%
clarity I I agree
 
00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:34.120 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:31:37.269 --> 00:31:37.279 align:start position:0%
would if it were me and I waved my magic
 
00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
W I would probably put both things in
 
00:31:42.549 --> 00:31:42.559 align:start position:0%
there I would put the language and the
 
00:31:46.669 --> 00:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
the um that section listed there um
 
00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:50.360 align:start position:0%
showing where it came from
 
00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
um the point being however
 
00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
that if the organization that is to deal
 
00:32:03.629 --> 00:32:03.639 align:start position:0%
with the prosecutorial part of this
 
00:32:06.990 --> 00:32:07.000 align:start position:0%
um that's why we put the findings that's
 
00:32:09.389 --> 00:32:09.399 align:start position:0%
why that that section is listed in the
 
00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:14.120 align:start position:0%
findings to to show this is where where
 
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
you go for guidance if you need it as
 
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
the Ethics Committee um it's not it's
 
00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:26.559 align:start position:0%
not this committee's job to um show the
 
00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
ethics Comm comme how they are to
 
00:32:31.149 --> 00:32:31.159 align:start position:0%
proceed and where they are going for
 
00:32:31.159 --> 00:32:35.029 align:start position:0%
proceed and where they are going for
information

00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:35.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
so any further comment representative
 
00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
o thank you Mr chair I would just make a
 
00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
quick comment about findings findings
 
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
end up in session law right which is
 
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
referred to during court cases
 
00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
potentially to determine legislative
 
00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
intent but it never appears in the
 
00:32:59.710 --> 00:32:59.720 align:start position:0%
statute in chapter law so I don't see
 
00:33:06.149 --> 00:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
any harm in making findings as extensive
 
00:33:07.590 --> 00:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
as you can make
 
00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:11.320 align:start position:0%
them with the idea being if a court ever
 
00:33:14.269 --> 00:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
needs to refer to the findings to find
 
00:33:16.470 --> 00:33:16.480 align:start position:0%
out what the legislative intent of the
 
00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:19.880 align:start position:0%
legislation under question was uh they
 
00:33:22.389 --> 00:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
can do that and and the more information
 
00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
there the
 
00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
better thank
 
00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.470 align:start position:0%
better thank
you

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:33:30.509 --> 00:33:30.519 align:start position:0%
yep thank you I I think what we were
 
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
referring to
 
00:33:36.029 --> 00:33:36.039 align:start position:0%
is the
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
um the objection by the Ethics Committee
 
00:33:42.310 --> 00:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
to the amendment as it's currently
 
00:33:45.149 --> 00:33:45.159 align:start position:0%
written one of those items was the fact
 
00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
that they were showing um counselors and
 
00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:55.080 align:start position:0%
uh acting of as councel as
 
00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
Advocate and yet
 
00:34:00.629 --> 00:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
um the Ethics Committee should be aware
 
00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:02.440 align:start position:0%
of what the Constitution says about
 
00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.269 align:start position:0%
of what the Constitution says about
those

00:34:03.269 --> 00:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
things in response yes this Ethics
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
Committee certainly is and again the
 
00:34:09.629 --> 00:34:09.639 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee didn't have great
 
00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:11.720 align:start position:0%
discussion about this they had several
 
00:34:13.629 --> 00:34:13.639 align:start position:0%
cases to deal with yesterday this was
 
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
the last thing on the docket and um very
 
00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
very little discussion but the only
 
00:34:22.149 --> 00:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
discussion or the only comments made
 
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
were one um that and I'll read what they
 
00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:28.069 align:start position:0%
were one um that and I'll read what they
were

00:34:28.069 --> 00:34:28.079 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
the concerns were um that it's too
 
00:34:35.869 --> 00:34:35.879 align:start position:0%
broad that it excludes too many people
 
00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
and it goes beyond what is reasonably
 
00:34:39.669 --> 00:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
enforceable and those were the exact
 
00:34:49.629 --> 00:34:49.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:56.470 --> 00:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
comment if you would like to ask for a
 
00:34:56.480 --> 00:34:57.589 align:start position:0%
comment if you would like to ask for a
caucus

00:34:57.589 --> 00:34:57.599 align:start position:0%
caucus
 
00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
um we'll be in a brief few minute
 
00:35:05.349 --> 00:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
caucus five minutes would be great um
 
00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:07.160 align:start position:0%
that brings us back
 
00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:12.440 align:start position:0%
at between 20 of and quarter
 
00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:25.790 align:start position:0%
at between 20 of and quarter
of

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:25.800 --> 00:39:02.030 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.440 --> 00:52:15.789 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:52:15.789 --> 00:52:15.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:19.390 --> 00:52:19.400 align:start position:0%
comment says shall we go to uh calling
 
00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:21.030 align:start position:0%
comment says shall we go to uh calling
the

00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:25.109 --> 00:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
role um Mr chairman we had the caucus
 
00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
and and we had very respectful
 
00:52:30.309 --> 00:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
discussion we are totally in agreement
 
00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:31.240 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
findings uh the concern is with the
 
00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
recusal um and we have some
 
00:52:39.950 --> 00:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
language uh that's a little bit narrower
 
00:52:44.349 --> 00:52:44.359 align:start position:0%
on the recusal aspect and with that um
 
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
it narrows it down to two uh
 
00:52:50.430 --> 00:52:50.440 align:start position:0%
specific options or situations where
 
00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
someone should
 
00:52:57.950 --> 00:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:57.960 --> 00:53:00.230 align:start position:0%
 
a

00:53:00.230 --> 00:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:53:03.549 --> 00:53:03.559 align:start position:0%
draft of that for the recusal and we
 
00:53:05.349 --> 00:53:05.359 align:start position:0%
respectfully asked if we can at least
 
00:53:09.789 --> 00:53:09.799 align:start position:0%
have that looked at today are you have
 
00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
you headed head already TOS or is this
 
00:53:16.549 --> 00:53:16.559 align:start position:0%
it's it's they it doesn't have um an
 
00:53:18.670 --> 00:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
amendment number it's just a draft this
 
00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:22.200 align:start position:0%
a discussion yes that's all it is okay
 
00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
well uh if you would like to propose
 
00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
well can we pass this out then so people
 
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:39.109 --> 00:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
you you have enough that I think
 
00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
so do you have enough going that
 
00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
way um all all all that we were asking
 
00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
for Mr chairman is a change in the
 
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:57.030 align:start position:0%
 
bill

00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
we're looking at lines I should point
 
00:54:02.549 --> 00:54:02.559 align:start position:0%
out to everyone this is not um official
 
00:54:05.789 --> 00:54:05.799 align:start position:0%
this is um just a type piece of a typ
 
00:54:09.109 --> 00:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
it's only a draft only a draft for
 
00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:11.480 align:start position:0%
consideration um and we're looking at
 
00:54:14.789 --> 00:54:14.799 align:start position:0%
the recusal section which is uh lines 19
 
00:54:18.430 --> 00:54:18.440 align:start position:0%
through 24 or 25 rather whatever to the
 
00:54:23.349 --> 00:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
bottom of the page um page one yes yes
 
00:54:26.349 --> 00:54:26.359 align:start position:0%
this page two
 
00:54:28.829 --> 00:54:28.839 align:start position:0%
um we're keeping the same so under the
 
00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
recusal section we're looking for two
 
00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:32.589 align:start position:0%
recusal section we're looking for two
specific

00:54:32.589 --> 00:54:32.599 align:start position:0%
specific
 
00:54:32.599 --> 00:54:34.510 align:start position:0%
specific
situations

00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:34.520 align:start position:0%
situations
 
00:54:37.950 --> 00:54:37.960 align:start position:0%
um some of you may Rec remember when we
 
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
had former State Rep the late State Rep
 
00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
Doug lay who was a member of this
 
00:54:47.069 --> 00:54:47.079 align:start position:0%
committee and um he was being paid by I
 
00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
think it was the education department I
 
00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:52.799 align:start position:0%
forget exactly yeah that's what it was
 
00:54:55.270 --> 00:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
thank you yet he was working here here
 
00:54:58.829 --> 00:54:58.839 align:start position:0%
and voting and there were um concerns
 
00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
about that and he eventually did start
 
00:55:03.829 --> 00:55:03.839 align:start position:0%
recusing from voting but this became a
 
00:55:06.030 --> 00:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
real situation because it was not clear
 
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
when he should recuse at least to him it
 
00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
was not can can I ask what part of this
 
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
is new um which from line what to what
 
00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
is we're looking at line 19 you
 
00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
legislators shall recuse themselves from
 
00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
voting on any legislation all the way to
 
00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:32.789 --> 00:55:32.799 align:start position:0%
that line through 23 so just that
 
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph is what we're talking about
 
00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
right and yes no no no no it also goes
 
00:55:42.029 --> 00:55:42.039 align:start position:0%
to the bottom of the page line
 
00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
yeah and they're very similar to what we
 
00:55:53.029 --> 00:55:53.039 align:start position:0%
have and what's been proposed by
 
00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:55.480 align:start position:0%
representative Shan and again I I truly
 
00:55:57.190 --> 00:55:57.200 align:start position:0%
respect all the work that's gone into
 
00:55:59.549 --> 00:55:59.559 align:start position:0%
this it's it's been a tough project for
 
00:56:02.789 --> 00:56:02.799 align:start position:0%
those who are deeply involved um and
 
00:56:05.309 --> 00:56:05.319 align:start position:0%
that would replace on the
 
00:56:10.589 --> 00:56:10.599 align:start position:0%
Amendments um everything from line
 
00:56:12.670 --> 00:56:12.680 align:start position:0%
23 um
 
00:56:20.829 --> 00:56:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
what okay I haven't compared the two yet
 
00:56:25.950 --> 00:56:25.960 align:start position:0%
um let's just take a
 
00:56:29.029 --> 00:56:29.039 align:start position:0%
um in order here that again looking at
 
00:56:31.589 --> 00:56:31.599 align:start position:0%
those of you who can remember the Doug
 
00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
way situation um the language in in this
 
00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
proposed I did not draft this we did
 
00:56:42.549 --> 00:56:42.559 align:start position:0%
this is Ned Gordon former representative
 
00:56:45.069 --> 00:56:45.079 align:start position:0%
n Gordon chairman n Gordon's
 
00:56:45.079 --> 00:56:47.109 align:start position:0%
n Gordon chairman n Gordon's
Amendment

00:56:47.109 --> 00:56:47.119 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:56:50.270 --> 00:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
um this this brings back the idea of
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:55.549 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:56:55.549 --> 00:56:55.559 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:57:01.390 --> 00:57:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:05.029 --> 00:57:05.039 align:start position:0%
remove the wording that you originally
 
00:57:07.789 --> 00:57:07.799 align:start position:0%
um weren't in favor of we were going to
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
remove that the special special interest
 
00:57:14.029 --> 00:57:14.039 align:start position:0%
and the definition yes yes so so there's
 
00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
on on page 20 on line 22 because that's
 
00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:25.640 align:start position:0%
where special interest comes in so what
 
00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
interest representative Maguire yes
 
00:57:38.910 --> 00:57:38.920 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm looking at this Roman one
 
00:57:42.910 --> 00:57:42.920 align:start position:0%
and it appears to me that this is almost
 
00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:49.640 align:start position:0%
exactly what's in 1B of the shean
 
00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:53.470 align:start position:0%
exactly what's in 1B of the shean
amendment

00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:53.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:56.829 --> 00:57:56.839 align:start position:0%
and yeah I'm not sure what's different
 
00:57:59.390 --> 00:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
yeah well it it's the difference as far
 
00:58:02.589 --> 00:58:02.599 align:start position:0%
as I can tell is employed buyers acting
 
00:58:06.309 --> 00:58:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:09.069 --> 00:58:09.079 align:start position:0%
whereas for this organization rather
 
00:58:11.150 --> 00:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
than has a responsibility for the
 
00:58:13.390 --> 00:58:13.400 align:start position:0%
welfare of the organization it seems
 
00:58:15.950 --> 00:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
like it would broaden it rather than if
 
00:58:19.309 --> 00:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
you're just an employee rather than a
 
00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
fiduciary right yeah I mean if you're
 
00:58:25.589 --> 00:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
the the treasurer of the permanent
 
00:58:28.069 --> 00:58:28.079 align:start position:0%
firefighters of New Hampshire you don't
 
00:58:30.430 --> 00:58:30.440 align:start position:0%
really have a you have a fiduciary
 
00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:32.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility to the organization but
 
00:58:35.710 --> 00:58:35.720 align:start position:0%
you're not in a policymaking role and
 
00:58:37.109 --> 00:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
you're also and you're also employed by
 
00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
them yeah and yeah right if you're
 
00:58:42.430 --> 00:58:42.440 align:start position:0%
employed you may be the janitor for that
 
00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
organization here you would be yeah I
 
00:58:49.309 --> 00:58:49.319 align:start position:0%
think it I think that the particularly
 
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
with this conflict on special interest I
 
00:58:54.829 --> 00:58:54.839 align:start position:0%
think the language in the Shen Amendment
 
00:58:57.829 --> 00:58:57.839 align:start position:0%
is a little clearer and it says pretty
 
00:59:00.510 --> 00:59:00.520 align:start position:0%
much the same thing except well it
 
00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
narrower yeah it's less broad
 
00:59:08.829 --> 00:59:08.839 align:start position:0%
mhm so if you're the treasurer of the
 
00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
organization and you're a legislator
 
00:59:13.549 --> 00:59:13.559 align:start position:0%
shouldn't you recuse
 
00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
yes yes but this the this says if you're
 
00:59:19.950 --> 00:59:19.960 align:start position:0%
the you have to be an employee of that
 
00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
organization if you're the bartender at
 
00:59:26.230 --> 00:59:26.240 align:start position:0%
the Sweeny post it's not a
 
00:59:28.589 --> 00:59:28.599 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't need to recuse yourself
 
00:59:28.599 --> 00:59:29.589 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't need to recuse yourself
that

00:59:29.589 --> 00:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:31.950 --> 00:59:31.960 align:start position:0%
right that's how I read it that if you
 
00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
were employed
 
00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:37.720 align:start position:0%
by yeah you've got you've got to recuse
 
00:59:41.710 --> 00:59:41.720 align:start position:0%
and and I think that would include the
 
00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:43.430 align:start position:0%
and and I think that would include the
janitor

00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
janitor
 
00:59:46.470 --> 00:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
and and that would broaden who would
 
00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
recuse representative
 
00:59:52.589 --> 00:59:52.599 align:start position:0%
V just a a language issue here if it
 
00:59:55.829 --> 00:59:55.839 align:start position:0%
were read is employed by and is acting
 
00:59:57.630 --> 00:59:57.640 align:start position:0%
as an agent for an
 
01:00:00.510 --> 01:00:00.520 align:start position:0%
organization that might uh be the
 
01:00:02.670 --> 01:00:02.680 align:start position:0%
original intent which one are you
 
01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
referring to please
 
01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:07.109 align:start position:0%
referring to please
copy

01:00:07.109 --> 01:00:07.119 align:start position:0%
copy
 
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:16.990 --> 01:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
20 instead of the or make it an and is
 
01:00:18.589 --> 01:00:18.599 align:start position:0%
that what you're suggesting
 
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
representative V yes I think that's
 
01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily restrictive because
 
01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
particularly for nonprofits there's a
 
01:00:28.990 --> 01:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
whole lot of volunteer board members
 
01:00:31.390 --> 01:00:31.400 align:start position:0%
that are not
 
01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:33.640 align:start position:0%
employed I I I
 
01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
would significantly disagree with that
 
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
at making that
 
01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
change I was just mentioning the fact
 
01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
that that would change substantially the
 
01:00:47.589 --> 01:00:47.599 align:start position:0%
meaning of the sentence it would narrow
 
01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
back to where we were in the sheen yes
 
01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
make it I'm also curious and narrower
 
01:00:56.470 --> 01:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
because you'd have to be employed by yes
 
01:01:00.029 --> 01:01:00.039 align:start position:0%
it would I'm also curious as to why on
 
01:01:02.670 --> 01:01:02.680 align:start position:0%
line 18 of the document just handed to
 
01:01:06.589 --> 01:01:06.599 align:start position:0%
us it talks about 14- C colon
 
01:01:11.069 --> 01:01:11.079 align:start position:0%
3- a whereas in the shean amendment line
 
01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:17.960 align:start position:0%
23 is 14- C colon 4- a so
 
01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
which what what's being changed here I
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:25.789 align:start position:0%
 
question

01:01:25.789 --> 01:01:25.799 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:01:27.589 --> 01:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
is that a
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
typo representative nutting Wong oh I
 
01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
would just guess that's a typo because
 
01:01:34.870 --> 01:01:34.880 align:start position:0%
in a line 16 it says by inserting after
 
01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:36.270 align:start position:0%
in a line 16 it says by inserting after
section

01:01:36.270 --> 01:01:36.280 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
three so I would just guess that that's
 
01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:43.309 align:start position:0%
three so I would just guess that that's
a

01:01:43.309 --> 01:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:46.190 --> 01:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
typo except that it continues back onto
 
01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:58.670 align:start position:0%
 
Amendment

01:01:58.670 --> 01:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:01.109 --> 01:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
I I'd like to go back to the idea that
 
01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:05.720 align:start position:0%
it if the if the complaint was that it
 
01:02:06.910 --> 01:02:06.920 align:start position:0%
was too
 
01:02:15.269 --> 01:02:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:17.349 --> 01:02:17.359 align:start position:0%
broad I guess that's open to
 
01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
interpretation and that's where we have
 
01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
a problem I don't think it is I don't
 
01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
think it is I think if you're if you're
 
01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
expanding by just saying someone has to
 
01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:28.880 align:start position:0%
be employed
 
01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:33.160 align:start position:0%
by I think rather than the the sheen
 
01:02:35.029 --> 01:02:35.039 align:start position:0%
Amendment which just said that you had
 
01:02:37.870 --> 01:02:37.880 align:start position:0%
to have a fiduciary obligation in that
 
01:02:40.589 --> 01:02:40.599 align:start position:0%
company you're bringing in an awful lot
 
01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
more people I don't think it is subject
 
01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
to interpretation I think it's very
 
01:02:49.549 --> 01:02:49.559 align:start position:0%
clearly broadening who would who
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
potentially could would have to
 
01:02:53.359 --> 01:02:56.029 align:start position:0%
potentially could would have to
recuse

01:02:56.029 --> 01:02:56.039 align:start position:0%
recuse
 
01:03:01.589 --> 01:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
not are there any other changes here um
 
01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:06.990 align:start position:0%
not are there any other changes here um
besides

01:03:06.990 --> 01:03:07.000 align:start position:0%
besides
 
01:03:10.109 --> 01:03:10.119 align:start position:0%
the so we are taking out the special in
 
01:03:12.430 --> 01:03:12.440 align:start position:0%
well it's written special interest but
 
01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
apparently that's
 
01:03:17.069 --> 01:03:17.079 align:start position:0%
not going to be there what what would
 
01:03:23.069 --> 01:03:23.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
interest the definition that's already
 
01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:37.069 --> 01:03:37.079 align:start position:0%
Amendment and I'll and I'll throw out
 
01:03:37.079 --> 01:03:38.109 align:start position:0%
Amendment and I'll and I'll throw out
another

01:03:38.109 --> 01:03:38.119 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:03:41.589 --> 01:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
question are any of these things could
 
01:03:43.950 --> 01:03:43.960 align:start position:0%
if there's word smithing that needs to
 
01:03:47.789 --> 01:03:47.799 align:start position:0%
be done if there is is that something
 
01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:49.480 align:start position:0%
that can be taken
 
01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:51.750 align:start position:0%
that can be taken
up

01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:04:02.349 --> 01:04:02.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:05.950 --> 01:04:05.960 align:start position:0%
over I I'm I'm tossing that out as
 
01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
a open question uh if there are phrases
 
01:04:15.269 --> 01:04:15.279 align:start position:0%
that I I understand the goal of trying
 
01:04:15.279 --> 01:04:16.990 align:start position:0%
that I I understand the goal of trying
to

01:04:16.990 --> 01:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:04:21.549 --> 01:04:21.559 align:start position:0%
um acquest to the concern of the Ethics
 
01:04:24.670 --> 01:04:24.680 align:start position:0%
Committee on the broadening section but
 
01:04:27.549 --> 01:04:27.559 align:start position:0%
I don't think this language does that
 
01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
but if there is other
 
01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
language that could be brought to the
 
01:04:35.910 --> 01:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
Senate that
 
01:04:37.829 --> 01:04:37.839 align:start position:0%
did um
 
01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:40.799 align:start position:0%
narrow that that's another
 
01:04:42.990 --> 01:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
possibility so Mr chairman you're
 
01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
suggesting that if we pass the Shen
 
01:04:48.829 --> 01:04:48.839 align:start position:0%
amendment that you would not be opposed
 
01:04:52.349 --> 01:04:52.359 align:start position:0%
to um further looking at
 
01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
this thank you never
 
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
um it very rarely does something of this
 
01:05:05.829 --> 01:05:05.839 align:start position:0%
nature um go go unattended by the other
 
01:05:10.589 --> 01:05:10.599 align:start position:0%
body um either direction so so it would
 
01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
be um it would be rare um former
 
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
chairman of of the Ethics Committee and
 
01:05:19.789 --> 01:05:19.799 align:start position:0%
a former strong member of the Ethics
 
01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
Committee will be seeing this on that
 
01:05:23.269 --> 01:05:23.279 align:start position:0%
side so I'm sure there'll be
 
01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
wordsmithing done over there yeah I'm
 
01:05:28.309 --> 01:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
sure there will be I I have no doubt
 
01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
that there would be
 
01:05:33.870 --> 01:05:33.880 align:start position:0%
um quite honestly that was one of the
 
01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
benefits I felt of of adopting 99.9% of
 
01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
the language from the Ethics Committee I
 
01:05:43.150 --> 01:05:43.160 align:start position:0%
thought it would Li eliminate or limit
 
01:05:47.029 --> 01:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
the amount of um word smithing that went
 
01:05:49.029 --> 01:05:49.039 align:start position:0%
on on the Senate
 
01:05:53.029 --> 01:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
side but I'm not saying that that that
 
01:05:54.589 --> 01:05:54.599 align:start position:0%
passing the sheen
 
01:05:57.710 --> 01:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
Amendment precludes the opportunity for
 
01:06:00.430 --> 01:06:00.440 align:start position:0%
someone in the Senate to change
 
01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
phraseology I I'm I'm just saying this
 
01:06:05.349 --> 01:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
is the best option we have in front of
 
01:06:08.990 --> 01:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
us right now uh seems to be this the
 
01:06:13.589 --> 01:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
shien um Amendment and I'm ready
 
01:06:17.950 --> 01:06:17.960 align:start position:0%
to um move forward on the
 
01:06:21.789 --> 01:06:21.799 align:start position:0%
OTP thank you Dennis Malloy yep
 
01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:24.760 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:06:28.029 --> 01:06:28.039 align:start position:0%
this but I I want to ask uh
 
01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
representative wall this is then
 
01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
in not in line with what the Ethics
 
01:06:38.549 --> 01:06:38.559 align:start position:0%
Committee voted on yesterday I want to
 
01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
be clear about that or or just
 
01:06:44.710 --> 01:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
or suggested in in your
 
01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
meeting to to to accept the
 
01:06:52.190 --> 01:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
Shen yes may I respond thank you um
 
01:06:55.190 --> 01:06:55.200 align:start position:0%
again there was very very brief time
 
01:06:58.390 --> 01:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
given to this in ethics um by the former
 
01:07:00.990 --> 01:07:01.000 align:start position:0%
speaker of the house and the
 
01:07:03.670 --> 01:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
chairman of the Ethics Committee as well
 
01:07:06.829 --> 01:07:06.839 align:start position:0%
as former Judiciary Committee Member
 
01:07:08.670 --> 01:07:08.680 align:start position:0%
representative former representative
 
01:07:12.750 --> 01:07:12.760 align:start position:0%
house um Ned Gordon and Donna saitech
 
01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
and um they were in agreement that the
 
01:07:19.630 --> 01:07:19.640 align:start position:0%
they claimed they believe that the Shen
 
01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
amendment is too broad that it's very
 
01:07:24.549 --> 01:07:24.559 align:start position:0%
difficult to enforce
 
01:07:28.710 --> 01:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
um that it would exclude too many people
 
01:07:31.589 --> 01:07:31.599 align:start position:0%
but if that's the case perhaps it makes
 
01:07:34.190 --> 01:07:34.200 align:start position:0%
sense to let the other bodies see
 
01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
this and determine for themselves and if
 
01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
they need to amend it based on what
 
01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
we've also said from the Ethics
 
01:07:44.910 --> 01:07:44.920 align:start position:0%
Committee then so be it and then go to
 
01:07:46.069 --> 01:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
Committee of
 
01:07:49.390 --> 01:07:49.400 align:start position:0%
conference that may
 
01:07:53.589 --> 01:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
represent or comment yeah uh thank you
 
01:07:55.390 --> 01:07:55.400 align:start position:0%
think then that
 
01:07:59.349 --> 01:07:59.359 align:start position:0%
perhaps I would be amable to sending
 
01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
this over to the Senate and uh letting
 
01:08:04.349 --> 01:08:04.359 align:start position:0%
them work that out it seems like the
 
01:08:07.029 --> 01:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
general consensus here is that they'll
 
01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
take a good look at it thank you and
 
01:08:12.829 --> 01:08:12.839 align:start position:0%
tear it apart or do it that's my that's
 
01:08:15.709 --> 01:08:15.719 align:start position:0%
my part or or op
 
01:08:19.950 --> 01:08:19.960 align:start position:0%
op yeah sorry thank you and Mr chairman
 
01:08:21.749 --> 01:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
I think that's exactly where we've come
 
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
to in our discussion that you know there
 
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
wasn't a lot of effort and not I
 
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
shouldn't say that there wasn't a lot of
 
01:08:29.950 --> 01:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
time being given to this because there
 
01:08:33.189 --> 01:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
wasn't time yesterday and
 
01:08:37.709 --> 01:08:37.719 align:start position:0%
um and this was our first exposure to
 
01:08:42.110 --> 01:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
what uh chairman Gordon has Preferred so
 
01:08:45.309 --> 01:08:45.319 align:start position:0%
I think given our time also and the fact
 
01:08:48.110 --> 01:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
that we do have another chance in the
 
01:08:51.030 --> 01:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
Senate um then we I I suggest we support
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
the Shan Amendment thank you
 
01:08:56.430 --> 01:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
you have your light do you you have a
 
01:08:58.030 --> 01:08:58.040 align:start position:0%
comment representative
 
01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
fo you still have your light there you
 
01:09:05.709 --> 01:09:05.719 align:start position:0%
go any further comment before
 
01:09:09.510 --> 01:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:13.229 --> 01:09:13.239 align:start position:0%
vote seeing none one more represent I
 
01:09:14.749 --> 01:09:14.759 align:start position:0%
would just like to say thank you for the
 
01:09:17.590 --> 01:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh conversation about this today having
 
01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
been exposed to this for the very first
 
01:09:23.149 --> 01:09:23.159 align:start position:0%
time uh I think what little we what we
 
01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
talked about here I think I'm clear
 
01:09:28.749 --> 01:09:28.759 align:start position:0%
about the what's what we need to do and
 
01:09:30.870 --> 01:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
what so I appreciate that thank you
 
01:09:33.189 --> 01:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for your comments um that
 
01:09:35.309 --> 01:09:35.319 align:start position:0%
that's actually from my point of view
 
01:09:37.550 --> 01:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
that's one of the benefits of having
 
01:09:40.189 --> 01:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
substitutes come in um because quite
 
01:09:42.349 --> 01:09:42.359 align:start position:0%
often it's a forest for the trees
 
01:09:44.349 --> 01:09:44.359 align:start position:0%
situation and and it is good to get
 
01:09:46.870 --> 01:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
fresh eyes on a situation yes thank you
 
01:09:48.749 --> 01:09:48.759 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate the fact that we've had
 
01:09:51.789 --> 01:09:51.799 align:start position:0%
really decent uh respectful open
 
01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
discussion on this even though we're not
 
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
really wholeheartedly in favor um at
 
01:09:58.669 --> 01:09:58.679 align:start position:0%
least everyone's been brought on board
 
01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:01.840 align:start position:0%
so everyone understands where we are and
 
01:10:04.870 --> 01:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
what possibilities there can be so thank
 
01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
you well as you know as former chair of
 
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
this this is what this committee does um
 
01:10:15.189 --> 01:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
it's it's not
 
01:10:18.189 --> 01:10:18.199 align:start position:0%
a it's never been a committee as far as
 
01:10:19.550 --> 01:10:19.560 align:start position:0%
I've been here and you've been here
 
01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:21.560 align:start position:0%

01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
nothing um ordinarily what I was going
 
01:14:50.990 --> 01:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
to say is ordinarily I Would S entertain
 
01:14:53.310 --> 01:14:53.320 align:start position:0%
the idea of consent calendar but I'm
 
01:14:55.830 --> 01:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
fairly certain this is not going to be
 
01:14:57.750 --> 01:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
anything that would stay on the consent
 
01:15:00.629 --> 01:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
calendar so I'm going to suggest that it
 
01:15:03.950 --> 01:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
calendar without
 
01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:11.590 align:start position:0%
calendar without
objection

01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:16.070 --> 01:15:16.080 align:start position:0%

we've uh been working on um with help
 
01:16:23.830 --> 01:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
from Mr Terry PA and um
 
01:16:26.270 --> 01:16:26.280 align:start position:0%
researchers and it seems that this needs
 
01:16:29.229 --> 01:16:29.239 align:start position:0%
a little more work before we can put it
 
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
for a boat thank you um I'm not sure if
 
01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
it's something that
 
01:16:37.790 --> 01:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
uh that
 
01:16:41.070 --> 01:16:41.080 align:start position:0%
are either our house attorney or would
 
01:16:44.470 --> 01:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
like to speak to or you I'm getting head
 
01:16:47.709 --> 01:16:47.719 align:start position:0%
shakes back there that's good um so from
 
01:16:51.070 --> 01:16:51.080 align:start position:0%
my point of view my and and feel free to
 
01:16:53.310 --> 01:16:53.320 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong um this this is
 
01:16:57.310 --> 01:16:57.320 align:start position:0%
a situation that um is being dealt with
 
01:16:57.320 --> 01:16:58.990 align:start position:0%
a situation that um is being dealt with
um

01:16:58.990 --> 01:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:02.629 --> 01:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
internally um from a more comprehensive
 
01:17:07.110 --> 01:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
um Avenue uh the the dealings of House
 
01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:10.440 align:start position:0%
Bill 157 primarily dealt with
 
01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
legislators um and we are of the
 
01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
understanding that um that it's being
 
01:17:21.149 --> 01:17:21.159 align:start position:0%
broadened um more to fall in line with
 
01:17:25.149 --> 01:17:25.159 align:start position:0%
um house uh with House and Senate staff
 
01:17:29.709 --> 01:17:29.719 align:start position:0%
as well so it would make sense to me um
 
01:17:32.590 --> 01:17:32.600 align:start position:0%
that if we set this aside in interim
 
01:17:34.270 --> 01:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
study rather than
 
01:17:37.229 --> 01:17:37.239 align:start position:0%
itl um it would allow the vehicle to
 
01:17:40.669 --> 01:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
exist and the house position would not
 
01:17:43.709 --> 01:17:43.719 align:start position:0%
um be an itl which would preclude
 
01:17:45.870 --> 01:17:45.880 align:start position:0%
further legislation coming up in this
 
01:17:49.470 --> 01:17:49.480 align:start position:0%
same um area so it just seems to me to
 
01:17:55.709 --> 01:17:55.719 align:start position:0%
be a a logical um step to take and allow
 
01:18:00.590 --> 01:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
um our our Dream Team to uh put together
 
01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
something for uh for January or February
 
01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
I think um and then we'll we'll still
 
01:18:09.550 --> 01:18:09.560 align:start position:0%
have the the door available the
 
01:18:11.950 --> 01:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity available to um submit
 
01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
legislation if we need to so with that
 
01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
um unless there's further
 
01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:20.760 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none um I'll ask the
 
01:18:24.149 --> 01:18:24.159 align:start position:0%

appreciated um we do I would like to
 
01:19:32.110 --> 01:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
talk to the rest of the committee though
 
01:19:36.790 --> 01:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
we um next week have an interesting
 
01:19:39.750 --> 01:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
situation coming up um we have a retain
 
01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
bill Senate Bill 84 still um let this be
 
01:19:47.310 --> 01:19:47.320 align:start position:0%
a lesson to you that will become chairs
 
01:19:51.550 --> 01:19:51.560 align:start position:0%
in the future um retain bills are not
 
01:19:54.310 --> 01:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
always your friend and especially retain
 
01:19:59.750 --> 01:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
bills that that um last until near the
 
01:20:03.270 --> 01:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
deadline date um because you get
 
01:20:05.310 --> 01:20:05.320 align:start position:0%
contacted by virtually everyone that
 
01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
wants to add a non gerine Amendment onto
 
01:20:11.790 --> 01:20:11.800 align:start position:0%
your retain bill so as of the moment we
 
01:20:16.229 --> 01:20:16.239 align:start position:0%
have um we we purposely hung on to um
 
01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 84 in order to take any
 
01:20:23.350 --> 01:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
information or input from the special
 
01:20:27.149 --> 01:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
committee on committees and that it was
 
01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
picked that this would be the vehicle to
 
01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
take that direction from the special
 
01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
committee on committees um that's why
 
01:20:37.669 --> 01:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
we've been waiting as long as we have
 
01:20:39.629 --> 01:20:39.639 align:start position:0%
that has been forthcoming in fact our
 
01:20:44.149 --> 01:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
own um Vice chair prepared the amendment
 
01:20:46.390 --> 01:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
from the special committee on committees
 
01:20:50.110 --> 01:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
where she also sits so that was going to
 
01:20:53.910 --> 01:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
be a replace all bill um amendment that
 
01:20:55.709 --> 01:20:55.719 align:start position:0%
was going to replace everything that's
 
01:20:58.830 --> 01:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
on Senate bill now Senate Bill 84
 
01:21:02.990 --> 01:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
now we now have three other um
 
01:21:05.229 --> 01:21:05.239 align:start position:0%
amendments non- gerain amendments that
 
01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
we need hearing for next
 
01:21:11.030 --> 01:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
Wednesday I'm
 
01:21:14.310 --> 01:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
hopeful um and I'm looking over to see
 
01:21:17.390 --> 01:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
I'm hopeful that the Amendments come to
 
01:21:22.149 --> 01:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
us early enough that we can submit our
 
01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
entry into the
 
01:21:26.709 --> 01:21:26.719 align:start position:0%
calendar they are all
 
01:21:26.719 --> 01:21:29.790 align:start position:0%
calendar they are all
here

01:21:29.790 --> 01:21:29.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:33.470 --> 01:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
okay no we should have okay we have two
 
01:21:36.910 --> 01:21:36.920 align:start position:0%
we we need three or we need four
 
01:21:39.669 --> 01:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
total um
 
01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
yeah the the pro the problem just so
 
01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
you're aware is that in order to enter
 
01:21:50.390 --> 01:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
it into the calendar as an as a non-gain
 
01:21:53.629 --> 01:21:53.639 align:start position:0%
hearing for next week we need the number
 
01:21:55.669 --> 01:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
of the amendment that comes from
 
01:21:58.910 --> 01:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
OS um that's what we've been pushing for
 
01:22:01.070 --> 01:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
and we we're a half hour from the
 
01:22:04.629 --> 01:22:04.639 align:start position:0%
deadline here so um once we get that
 
01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
number then we can submit it and and I'm
 
01:22:11.590 --> 01:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
assuming the four amendments that we
 
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
have are going to be relatively quick um
 
01:22:18.110 --> 01:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
I think I've schedule 10 minutes apart
 
01:22:21.070 --> 01:22:21.080 align:start position:0%
here um just I think we'll be able to
 
01:22:23.390 --> 01:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
knock through all of them and I actually
 
01:22:25.669 --> 01:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
think we'll be able to knock out the
 
01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
entire amended um Bill fairly
 
01:22:33.510 --> 01:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
quickly but it does mean one additional
 
01:22:36.149 --> 01:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
trip for everybody to conquer um I think
 
01:22:38.350 --> 01:22:38.360 align:start position:0%
it'll be 10 o00 next
 
01:22:40.910 --> 01:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
Wednesday and and then we'll be done for
 
01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
this Academic Year but I thought I'd
 
01:22:45.390 --> 01:22:45.400 align:start position:0%
keep you up to date with where we are
 
01:22:47.189 --> 01:22:47.199 align:start position:0%
and why we are in the position that
 
01:22:47.199 --> 01:22:48.110 align:start position:0%
and why we are in the position that
we're

01:22:48.110 --> 01:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:22:51.189 --> 01:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
in there any questions about that or any
 
01:22:53.310 --> 01:22:53.320 align:start position:0%
concerns or comments
 
01:22:55.950 --> 01:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
if it slips a day
 
01:22:59.510 --> 01:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
um if it slips a day I will not be in
 
01:23:02.550 --> 01:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
attendance I have jury
 
01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:08.400 align:start position:0%
duty um okay um as I
 
01:23:12.590 --> 01:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
said if it slips a day from the 8th of
 
01:23:15.950 --> 01:23:15.960 align:start position:0%
November I don't think any of these are
 
01:23:20.310 --> 01:23:20.320 align:start position:0%
of any great controversy that um we you
 
01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
will be missed but I don't think it's
 
01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
going to affect uh the outcome of these
 
01:23:30.910 --> 01:23:30.920 align:start position:0%
seems Seems fair to say um thank you for
 
01:23:32.830 --> 01:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
the updated notice though but you're
 
01:23:35.390 --> 01:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
okay for is everyone else okay for that
 
01:23:38.709 --> 01:23:38.719 align:start position:0%
date the8 all right sounds good it'll it
 
01:23:40.189 --> 01:23:40.199 align:start position:0%
we should be out of here I would think
 
01:23:41.790 --> 01:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
if we start at 10: we should be out of
 
01:23:44.189 --> 01:23:44.199 align:start position:0%
here at 11: that's my
 
01:23:47.470 --> 01:23:47.480 align:start position:0%
guess all right thanks very much I
 
01:23:49.510 --> 01:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate it with that I'm
 
01:23:52.750 --> 01:23:52.760 align:start position:0%
closing um I have one question not no no
 
01:23:54.669 --> 01:23:54.679 align:start position:0%
not for everybody else just for you what
 
01:24:21.350 --> 01:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
