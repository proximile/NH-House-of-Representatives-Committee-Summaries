00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
like the commissioner from Homeland

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:00.660 align:start position:0%
of Education Frank edelblue several
 
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
senators and uh reps as well so we will
 
00:13:07.009 --> 00:13:07.019 align:start position:0%
be meeting on March 31 11 o'clock over
 
00:13:10.129 --> 00:13:10.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:12.889 --> 00:13:12.899 align:start position:0%
that's where we have the allocation for
 
00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:14.700 align:start position:0%
additional dollars for security in the
 
00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
schools and the schools apply for these
 
00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.350 align:start position:0%
schools and the schools apply for these
grants

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
grants
 
00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
we have presently spent close to 43
 
00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:22.620 align:start position:0%
million dollars in Safety and Security
 
00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:24.300 align:start position:0%
in our schools which is a higher per
 
00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:27.420 align:start position:0%
capita than other states are doing
 
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire should be applauded for
 
00:13:32.329 --> 00:13:32.339 align:start position:0%
that okay it looks like we have
 
00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
two other committees which I'll be soon
 
00:13:52.009 --> 00:13:52.019 align:start position:0%
scheduling here one is the legislative
 
00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:54.660 align:start position:0%
oversight committee for improvement and
 
00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
assessment in schools that be towards
 
00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
latter part of March I don't have a
 
00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:00.839 align:start position:0%
specific date yet attentively looking at
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
March 27th
 
00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
and also looking at a meeting for the
 
00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:08.940 align:start position:0%
higher education study committee which
 
00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:11.220 align:start position:0%
we have that deals with post-secondary
 
00:14:14.449 --> 00:14:14.459 align:start position:0%
education most likely on the 27th also
 
00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:15.660 align:start position:0%
one in the morning one in the afternoon
 
00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:17.940 align:start position:0%
but we have not yet I'm trying to get
 
00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:33.590 --> 00:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
so while we're waiting I was a little
 
00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:35.220 align:start position:0%
bit late because I was outside listening
 
00:14:37.569 --> 00:14:37.579 align:start position:0%
to the Manchester High School Central
 
00:14:42.189 --> 00:14:42.199 align:start position:0%
thing and they were so excellent things
 
00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:45.540 align:start position:0%
there yeah yeah I saw that Central was
 
00:14:47.769 --> 00:14:47.779 align:start position:0%
great for me
 
00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:52.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:54.829 --> 00:14:54.839 align:start position:0%
you're completely unbiased
 
00:14:56.509 --> 00:14:56.519 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell Wednesdays when
 
00:14:58.730 --> 00:14:58.740 align:start position:0%
you're working with the CTE advisory
 
00:15:01.009 --> 00:15:01.019 align:start position:0%
Council we'd like to get a trip down to
 
00:15:03.949 --> 00:15:03.959 align:start position:0%
alverne too okay and and uh you might
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:11.329 --> 00:15:11.339 align:start position:0%
yeah you you can work with um Terry
 
00:15:11.339 --> 00:15:14.710 align:start position:0%
yeah you you can work with um Terry
Wolfe

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
for the public we really had a good day
 
00:15:26.689 --> 00:15:26.699 align:start position:0%
yesterday in terms of some of the
 
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
priorities for this committee we were
 
00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:30.839 align:start position:0%
able to acquire additional dollars for
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
the Career Technical education tuition
 
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
and transportation that was a real jump
 
00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:36.170 align:start position:0%
and transportation that was a real jump
forward

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:36.180 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
um uh another uh 4.4 million dollars for
 
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
the next biennium that brings up 11.2
 
00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:45.240 align:start position:0%
million per per year uh we've been
 
00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:47.100 align:start position:0%
funding it 9 million in the past and
 
00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
this will help out with the
 
00:15:50.569 --> 00:15:50.579 align:start position:0%
transportation costs Transportation
 
00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:53.220 align:start position:0%
reimbursement by the Senate by the state
 
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
for CTE from the sending school to the
 
00:15:57.949 --> 00:15:57.959 align:start position:0%
receiving Center is 10 cents per mile
 
00:16:01.069 --> 00:16:01.079 align:start position:0%
per pupil it doesn't pay for the bus
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
the other thing which we had occur we
 
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
had fiscal capacity disparity that bill
 
00:16:08.930 --> 00:16:08.940 align:start position:0%
I got a good positive light yesterday
 
00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
from the division two and we're really
 
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:14.220 align:start position:0%
pleased with that also we had a bill
 
00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
that dealt with additional weighted
 
00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:18.740 align:start position:0%
formula for special education diversity
 
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839 align:start position:0%
that also got the green light and
 
00:16:23.389 --> 00:16:23.399 align:start position:0%
there's at least another 12 million
 
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
dollars pumped into that as well
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
um so we're seeing some uh in the
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
Medicaid direct is being looked at uh
 
00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
currently and um I I believe that that's
 
00:16:37.249 --> 00:16:37.259 align:start position:0%
going to come out satisfactory as well
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
so all that will really help us out in
 
00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:41.820 align:start position:0%
terms of where we're going with our
 
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
support of public education in the state
 
00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:46.740 align:start position:0%
looks like we're all here right now
 
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
so uh HB 629 is not on the uh list that
 
00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:54.300 align:start position:0%
you have in front of you for today
 
00:16:56.389 --> 00:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
however it's a bill we skipped yesterday
 
00:16:59.210 --> 00:16:59.220 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day and due to the
 
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
fact we are getting out of here around
 
00:17:02.329 --> 00:17:02.339 align:start position:0%
five o'clock 5 30 somewhere around that
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
hour and had gone since early in the
 
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
morning and so we are going to take 629
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
up first and then get down into our
 
00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:12.260 align:start position:0%
calendar for today which starts with
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
cacr7 so I'd like to recognize represent
 
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
McDonald for a
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
motion please on 629 629 is a bill
 
00:17:24.530 --> 00:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
establishing a student Bill of Rights
 
00:17:27.730 --> 00:17:27.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I move that we find
 
00:17:30.169 --> 00:17:30.179 align:start position:0%
hb629 establishing a student Bill of
 
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
Rights and expedient to legislate is
 
00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:33.900 align:start position:0%
there a second
 
00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:36.660 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher seconds that so a
 
00:17:39.529 --> 00:17:39.539 align:start position:0%
medical clerk motion made by uh
 
00:17:41.570 --> 00:17:41.580 align:start position:0%
represent McDonald and second by
 
00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:43.700 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher
 
00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:46.860 align:start position:0%
McDonald you're recognized to speak to
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
your motion thank you I believe this
 
00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:52.740 align:start position:0%
should be itl because although it was
 
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
well intended to as was said by the
 
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor put the focus back on
 
00:17:59.090 --> 00:17:59.100 align:start position:0%
students this was really went about in
 
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
the wrong way as no students were asked
 
00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
for any input and there was no attempt
 
00:18:07.850 --> 00:18:07.860 align:start position:0%
to made to get student input and that
 
00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:09.919 align:start position:0%
was my biggest concern but in addition
 
00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:13.740 align:start position:0%
it seems that rights were picked to be
 
00:18:15.529 --> 00:18:15.539 align:start position:0%
included in a student Bill of Rights but
 
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
it's a non-exhaustive list of all the
 
00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:19.740 align:start position:0%
rights included so my concern is with
 
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
the rights that were not included why or
 
00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
some picked and why are some others and
 
00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:26.900 align:start position:0%
they're not a certain particular order
 
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
of the rides being listed there's many
 
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
concerns regarding that and members on
 
00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:34.140 align:start position:0%
this committee I know some would agree
 
00:18:36.169 --> 00:18:36.179 align:start position:0%
that there is a concern by what was
 
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
included as compared to what was not
 
00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
included so thank you thank you very
 
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
much from the maker of the second thank
 
00:18:46.669 --> 00:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and I I have obviously
 
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
similar similar concerns but I also have
 
00:18:51.049 --> 00:18:51.059 align:start position:0%
a lot of concerns about what is listed
 
00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:52.799 align:start position:0%
in this document
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
um first of all it goes right to the
 
00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:56.460 align:start position:0%
principle of what is a right for
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
instance line 12 of page one identifies
 
00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
the Privileges of the Constitution to
 
00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
which people are entitled constitution
 
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
does not contain any privileges it
 
00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:07.980 align:start position:0%
recognizes pre-existing natural rights
 
00:19:10.669 --> 00:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
of persons
 
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
further issues involve unqualified
 
00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:17.160 align:start position:0%
freedom to assemble which could easily
 
00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:19.020 align:start position:0%
be interpreted to allow students to
 
00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:20.820 align:start position:0%
assemble for political reasons at any
 
00:19:23.690 --> 00:19:23.700 align:start position:0%
time including during the school day
 
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
and perhaps most dangerously this bill
 
00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
would assign students and this is this
 
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
is law this is not just we're not
 
00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
putting opinions out there in this thing
 
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
this is law when you assign a student
 
00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
the unqualified and unabridged right to
 
00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
private conscience in religious matters
 
00:19:45.770 --> 00:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
you are effectively telling their
 
00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
parents that they have no right to
 
00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
direct their religious education they
 
00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
can refuse to go to church and anything
 
00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:53.220 align:start position:0%
else they want to do when we're talking
 
00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
about minors here miners have rights but
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
they don't have all of the full natural
 
00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
rights inherent to a full adult with
 
00:20:03.289 --> 00:20:03.299 align:start position:0%
adult agency we have to recognize that
 
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
in document like this thank you thank
 
00:20:09.409 --> 00:20:09.419 align:start position:0%

mem go ahead please representative so uh
 
00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
when I submitted the bill originally to
 
00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:14.220 align:start position:0%
uh OLS uh what you're seeing is what the
 
00:23:17.810 --> 00:23:17.820 align:start position:0%
original bill was and what they did was
 
00:23:21.230 --> 00:23:21.240 align:start position:0%
um the the person that was the
 
00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
um lawyer uh drafting lawyer uh cut out
 
00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
the first part of it uh which is a
 
00:23:30.529 --> 00:23:30.539 align:start position:0%
statement of findings and so this
 
00:23:30.539 --> 00:23:31.789 align:start position:0%
statement of findings and so this
amendment

00:23:31.789 --> 00:23:31.799 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
um reinstates the statement of findings
 
00:23:35.270 --> 00:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
which gives
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
some context I think to the rest of the
 
00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:40.860 align:start position:0%
bill and
 
00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
um as I said when I presented this bill
 
00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:44.990 align:start position:0%
um as I said when I presented this bill
that

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
um this is meant to get the focus back
 
00:23:51.289 --> 00:23:51.299 align:start position:0%
on students the the people that are the
 
00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:53.220 align:start position:0%
product of Education the people that it
 
00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:56.100 align:start position:0%
should be the focus of Education
 
00:23:58.789 --> 00:23:58.799 align:start position:0%
um and I appreciate that some people
 
00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:02.220 align:start position:0%
fear that this might embolden some of
 
00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:05.700 align:start position:0%
the students but um the every part of
 
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
this bill is actually found in
 
00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:11.159 align:start position:0%
Constitution either the New Hampshire
 
00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:14.580 align:start position:0%
Constitution the U.S Constitution or
 
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
federal law around adequate and free
 
00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:20.580 align:start position:0%
education so
 
00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:21.529 align:start position:0%
education so
um

00:24:21.529 --> 00:24:21.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
I think it's uh important that that as a
 
00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:28.380 align:start position:0%
committee and as a state house we
 
00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
recognize the the students in our
 
00:24:33.649 --> 00:24:33.659 align:start position:0%
classes and and uh
 
00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:35.700 align:start position:0%
you know we've had some great bills come
 
00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:37.260 align:start position:0%
through here that really are going to
 
00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
make a difference in students lives and
 
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
this is just one to give them
 
00:24:45.649 --> 00:24:45.659 align:start position:0%
um some confidence that that they are
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
recognized as well
 
00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
are there questions from the committee
 
00:24:58.010 --> 00:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher
 
00:24:59.149 --> 00:24:59.159 align:start position:0%
yeah that's just the first question
 
00:25:00.289 --> 00:25:00.299 align:start position:0%
because I'm reading some of this and
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of
 
00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:03.900 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of language in here that I
 
00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
would consider somewhat vague or or I'm
 
00:25:07.789 --> 00:25:07.799 align:start position:0%
not sure how to interpret all of it but
 
00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
I I guess I would ask is this coming
 
00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
from an organization or some or of some
 
00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:13.860 align:start position:0%
kind is this a model legislation of some
 
00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:16.130 align:start position:0%
kind is this a model legislation of some
sort

00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
this legislation was
 
00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:23.220 align:start position:0%
um something that I had read about
 
00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
um on that on ncls and
 
00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
um this was some of the some of the
 
00:25:31.610 --> 00:25:31.620 align:start position:0%
languages from that but other languages
 
00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
also locally devised and like I said
 
00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:37.140 align:start position:0%
it's to give context
 
00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
I noticed that the LBA does not have a
 
00:25:47.169 --> 00:25:47.179 align:start position:0%
physical note on it it does have FN
 
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
attached to the bill have you any
 
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
projection what the costs are for this
 
00:25:56.450 --> 00:25:56.460 align:start position:0%
I am totally uh so much as to why
 
00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:00.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:04.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:06.900 align:start position:0%
the rights delineated in the
 
00:26:08.750 --> 00:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution both the New Hampshire
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
Constitution and the Federal
 
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution are what are called
 
00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
negative rights you have the right from
 
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
certain things the right from intrusion
 
00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:20.940 align:start position:0%
of government
 
00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:22.190 align:start position:0%
of government
Etc

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.090 align:start position:0%
Etc
um

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
a number at which a number of these are
 
00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:28.980 align:start position:0%
and clearly based on one or both of the
 
00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:31.919 align:start position:0%
Constitutions but other ones are a right
 
00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:34.380 align:start position:0%
to something and nobody has a right to
 
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
something that requires an act of
 
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
somebody else and there are a number of
 
00:26:43.669 --> 00:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
items here that are what are called
 
00:26:43.679 --> 00:26:45.890 align:start position:0%
items here that are what are called
positive

00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
positive
 
00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.450 align:start position:0%
positive
um

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:47.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
rights which are not guaranteed by our
 
00:26:53.570 --> 00:26:53.580 align:start position:0%
constitutions and which require somebody
 
00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:55.620 align:start position:0%
else to act
 
00:26:58.970 --> 00:26:58.980 align:start position:0%
and that was never the intent of any of
 
00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:01.740 align:start position:0%
our founder Founders and it is very much
 
00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
against my basic belief system that
 
00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:08.460 align:start position:0%
anybody has the right to require another
 
00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:11.940 align:start position:0%
person to act and that would be my
 
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
biggest objection to this is those lines
 
00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
that require somebody else to act
 
00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:19.620 align:start position:0%
somebody else to pay somebody else to do
 
00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:20.590 align:start position:0%
somebody else to pay somebody else to do
things

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:20.600 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
I don't believe one person can require
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
that of somebody else thank you further
 
00:27:30.909 --> 00:27:30.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:33.169 --> 00:27:33.179 align:start position:0%
further discussion yes representative
 
00:27:33.179 --> 00:27:35.210 align:start position:0%

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:35.220 align:start position:0%
Damon
 
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.630 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:40.909 --> 00:27:40.919 align:start position:0%
I'm a little puzzled representative
 
00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
Lucas are when you speak about
 
00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
sorry forgetting the term you just used
 
00:27:48.769 --> 00:27:48.779 align:start position:0%
positive rights thank you
 
00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:55.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:56.210 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:56.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:59.510 --> 00:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
like 31 on the first page through six or
 
00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
so on the second page is that what
 
00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.350 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:28:09.350 --> 00:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:12.380 align:start position:0%
starting around 26 where you're now
 
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
requiring other people to act to be
 
00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:19.220 align:start position:0%
taxed to all of those things as a right
 
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:22.200 align:start position:0%
it may be something that we have agreed
 
00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
to do but it is not a right
 
00:28:28.669 --> 00:28:28.679 align:start position:0%
may I continue yes so first of all
 
00:28:31.549 --> 00:28:31.559 align:start position:0%
there's nothing here about taxation in
 
00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
that part
 
00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.029 align:start position:0%
that part
um

00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm just on a completely
 
00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
different page than you are I think
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:45.140 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative Tanner
 
00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
I'm also confused
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
um some of these like the ones about uh
 
00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:53.039 align:start position:0%
education there's um certainly in our
 
00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
constitution in the New Hampshire
 
00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:56.149 align:start position:0%
constitution in the New Hampshire
Constitution

00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
00:29:00.649 --> 00:29:00.659 align:start position:0%
there is a mention of the right for
 
00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:03.240 align:start position:0%
education but we've also federally and
 
00:29:05.409 --> 00:29:05.419 align:start position:0%
also State have a
 
00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
standard that has been passed and is in
 
00:29:11.390 --> 00:29:11.400 align:start position:0%
law that says children have a right to a
 
00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
free and adequate education
 
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
that children with disabilities
 
00:29:19.789 --> 00:29:19.799 align:start position:0%
um have different rights under under
 
00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:23.340 align:start position:0%
federal law so I think what you're I I
 
00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:26.340 align:start position:0%
am not going to think what you do you
 
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
mean that you your personal belief is
 
00:29:32.409 --> 00:29:32.419 align:start position:0%
different than what's in this bill
 
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
rather than uh the fact that it needs a
 
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
physical note because it's you feel that
 
00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:41.330 align:start position:0%
physical note because it's you feel that
um

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:41.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:44.940 align:start position:0%
these rights uh are not in statute and
 
00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:46.980 align:start position:0%
and and need
 
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
um I don't understand need a fiscal
 
00:29:53.090 --> 00:29:53.100 align:start position:0%
responsibility to them
 
00:29:57.889 --> 00:29:57.899 align:start position:0%
in the Constitution it doesn't say that
 
00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
what it says is that we shall cherish
 
00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:02.580 align:start position:0%
and encourage
 
00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
education which is quite different from
 
00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:08.940 align:start position:0%
what the courts decided from what a
 
00:30:12.529 --> 00:30:12.539 align:start position:0%
specific few judges decided it meant
 
00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:15.480 align:start position:0%
that that meant we had to pay for
 
00:30:18.590 --> 00:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
Education now we have as a legislature
 
00:30:23.389 --> 00:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
and we have in towns decided to do that
 
00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:25.740 align:start position:0%
but that isn't because it is a right it
 
00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:28.620 align:start position:0%
is because we decided to do that and I
 
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
my objection is to calling it a right
 
00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
and saying that a student has a right to
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
that the student has that because the
 
00:30:39.289 --> 00:30:39.299 align:start position:0%
town has decided to support that or for
 
00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
the state money because the state has
 
00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:44.220 align:start position:0%
decided to spend money and support that
 
00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:47.100 align:start position:0%
not because of a right nobody has a
 
00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
right to insist that somebody else do
 
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
something and you are insisting
 
00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
that they have the right to have other
 
00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
people pay for their education
 
00:30:59.930 --> 00:30:59.940 align:start position:0%
yes so
 
00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:01.919 align:start position:0%
you're adjust you're objecting to the
 
00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
word right how would you state that
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
since the courts have decided and the
 
00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:10.500 align:start position:0%
the based on our Constitution that that
 
00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:13.980 align:start position:0%
in fact is what happens that a child has
 
00:31:16.789 --> 00:31:16.799 align:start position:0%
the right or whatever word you want to
 
00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:17.820 align:start position:0%
put in there
 
00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:20.220 align:start position:0%
to receive a free and adequate education
 
00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:22.380 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
I would say that they were hyperactive
 
00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
judges a few of them
 
00:31:30.049 --> 00:31:30.059 align:start position:0%
what you would place in that sentence
 
00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:34.020 align:start position:0%
other than right I would leave that out
 
00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:35.940 align:start position:0%
I would not put that in a student Bill
 
00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:38.220 align:start position:0%
of Rights because it does not go along
 
00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:40.380 align:start position:0%
with our constitutional rights that's
 
00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
what I would do there are a number of
 
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
things that are in here that follow our
 
00:31:44.159 --> 00:31:45.490 align:start position:0%
things that are in here that follow our
accounts

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:45.500 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:47.640 align:start position:0%
that don't
 
00:31:49.730 --> 00:31:49.740 align:start position:0%
um just answer it and you're done you're
 
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
done and no follow-up questions
 
00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
representative cascadden thank you maybe
 
00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:55.620 align:start position:0%
I can add some clarity for this bill
 
00:31:59.090 --> 00:31:59.100 align:start position:0%
that really reinforces that any student
 
00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:01.740 align:start position:0%
has the right to attend a public school
 
00:32:04.669 --> 00:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
in other words unlike non-public schools
 
00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
every student is admitted it doesn't
 
00:32:09.169 --> 00:32:09.179 align:start position:0%
matter what the need it doesn't matter
 
00:32:12.889 --> 00:32:12.899 align:start position:0%
what any of the classifications are but
 
00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:16.140 align:start position:0%
every single student is admitted to a
 
00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
public institution and that's not always
 
00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
the case so I don't know if that helps
 
00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:22.130 align:start position:0%
the case so I don't know if that helps
clarify

00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:22.140 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
00:32:24.889 --> 00:32:24.899 align:start position:0%
the right I think they have that right
 
00:32:27.409 --> 00:32:27.419 align:start position:0%
now but I think there's a perception out
 
00:32:28.669 --> 00:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
there that you know
 
00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:31.260 align:start position:0%
with Choice which is fine people have
 
00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:32.330 align:start position:0%
with Choice which is fine people have
choice

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
choice
 
00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
but there is a difference
 
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
with how you're funding
 
00:32:39.409 --> 00:32:39.419 align:start position:0%
mechanisms are and how
 
00:32:42.649 --> 00:32:42.659 align:start position:0%
the public school must service every
 
00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:45.240 align:start position:0%
single child
 
00:32:47.149 --> 00:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
I I have a question for representative
 
00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:52.860 align:start position:0%
Tanner here on line 36 and 37 on page
 
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
two it says the right to access without
 
00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:56.690 align:start position:0%
two it says the right to access without
tuition

00:32:56.690 --> 00:32:56.700 align:start position:0%
tuition
 
00:32:59.510 --> 00:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
each resident School District's K-12
 
00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919 align:start position:0%
basic education program for students of
 
00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:04.140 align:start position:0%
qualifying age
 
00:33:06.169 --> 00:33:06.179 align:start position:0%
I'm a k through
 
00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:08.460 align:start position:0%
8th District
 
00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
and we have agreements that are made
 
00:33:15.409 --> 00:33:15.419 align:start position:0%
with us receiving schools to tuition our
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
students to those schools and that's
 
00:33:19.909 --> 00:33:19.919 align:start position:0%
very typical throughout this state
 
00:33:22.610 --> 00:33:22.620 align:start position:0%
the local board has the authority to
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
approve the receiving school as one of
 
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
their tuition schools
 
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
we also have numerous places within the
 
00:33:31.730 --> 00:33:31.740 align:start position:0%
state right now
 
00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:35.220 align:start position:0%
where the local school board that's
 
00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
sending school board has approved
 
00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:41.220 align:start position:0%
certain schools where students are sent
 
00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:44.100 align:start position:0%
but they've also capped their tuition
 
00:33:46.669 --> 00:33:46.679 align:start position:0%
let's say they cap it at twenty thousand
 
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:49.140 align:start position:0%
and you have a receiving school that's
 
00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:50.940 align:start position:0%
also jumped from twenty thousand to
 
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand five hundred dollars
 
00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
some of those districts are allowing
 
00:33:59.029 --> 00:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
the parent to pay that difference
 
00:34:01.009 --> 00:34:01.019 align:start position:0%
others are saying if we don't pay the
 
00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:02.640 align:start position:0%
full freight then you're not going to go
 
00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:03.769 align:start position:0%
full freight then you're not going to go
there

00:34:03.769 --> 00:34:03.779 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:34:07.009 --> 00:34:07.019 align:start position:0%
so what are you implying here by this
 
00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
section of law
 
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:09.829 align:start position:0%
section of law
um

00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:12.109 --> 00:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
I I need to have a better understanding
 
00:34:16.129 --> 00:34:16.139 align:start position:0%
of the the where you're going with item
 
00:34:18.109 --> 00:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
a here on line 36.
 
00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
so the Claremont decision uh said we
 
00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:23.820 align:start position:0%
hold that part 2 article 83
 
00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
imposes a duty on the state to provide a
 
00:34:29.629 --> 00:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
constitutionally adequate education to
 
00:34:32.089 --> 00:34:32.099 align:start position:0%
every educable child in the public
 
00:34:34.250 --> 00:34:34.260 align:start position:0%
schools in New Hampshire and to
 
00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:36.540 align:start position:0%
guarantee adequate funding that's
 
00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
Claremont versus the government uh
 
00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:41.220 align:start position:0%
governor in
 
00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:41.829 align:start position:0%
governor in
um

00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:41.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:45.649 --> 00:34:45.659 align:start position:0%
1993. that that's a court decision and
 
00:34:49.369 --> 00:34:49.379 align:start position:0%
so even even if you only go to eighth
 
00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
grade you're still your town and your
 
00:34:53.950 --> 00:34:53.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are still
 
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
responsible for providing a
 
00:34:58.070 --> 00:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
constitutionally adequate education to
 
00:35:01.070 --> 00:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
every educable child in Residence within
 
00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:03.240 align:start position:0%
your area okay now I'm going to follow
 
00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
that up with another question then so we
 
00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
have tuition agreements in this
 
00:35:09.109 --> 00:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
particular hypothetical District talk
 
00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:12.300 align:start position:0%
with receiving schools a b and c
 
00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:15.060 align:start position:0%
and a and b fall within the tuition cap
 
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
C doesn't But A and B provide all the
 
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
services that are required by the
 
00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:23.820 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an adequate education
 
00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
so the student has that opportunity
 
00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
provided to him or her
 
00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:30.780 align:start position:0%
but the parent says well I also want to
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
go to C and I'm willing to pay the 500.
 
00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:36.180 align:start position:0%
are they being denied the opportunity
 
00:35:38.089 --> 00:35:38.099 align:start position:0%
for an adequate education
 
00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
I think that what we're talking about is
 
00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
not about the student Bill of Rights I
 
00:35:45.349 --> 00:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
think we're talking about uh actually a
 
00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:47.700 align:start position:0%
bill that we have coming up later in the
 
00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:51.900 align:start position:0%
in the session uh or in today about
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
um vouchers and about
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
um payments uh to other schools uh that
 
00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
are not within but each each district
 
00:36:03.470 --> 00:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
um should in my opinion by law have an
 
00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:06.300 align:start position:0%
anchor school that's a public school
 
00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
that's uh free and it performs an
 
00:36:11.089 --> 00:36:11.099 align:start position:0%
adequate education doesn't mean that
 
00:36:12.890 --> 00:36:12.900 align:start position:0%
they have to have a whole bunch of
 
00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:14.820 align:start position:0%
choices although we do have Choice
 
00:36:18.349 --> 00:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
within our um educational setting so I
 
00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
just think that that's
 
00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
okay I'm just trying to get a little
 
00:36:23.810 --> 00:36:23.820 align:start position:0%
clarification this is just the um so
 
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
you've used the word anchor which I
 
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate that so that
 
00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
um we're we're not talking of a voucher
 
00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:33.599 align:start position:0%
program here at all we're talking about
 
00:36:35.329 --> 00:36:35.339 align:start position:0%
a whole different tuition type program
 
00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:37.140 align:start position:0%
that's in existence throughout the state
 
00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:36:41.329 --> 00:36:41.339 align:start position:0%
and the way this is written it could be
 
00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:43.980 align:start position:0%
interpreted to deny some students which
 
00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
are attending from these k8s or k-6s or
 
00:36:49.069 --> 00:36:49.079 align:start position:0%
whatever we may have the opportunity to
 
00:36:51.170 --> 00:36:51.180 align:start position:0%
continue going where they're going this
 
00:36:54.650 --> 00:36:54.660 align:start position:0%
isn't a denial bill this is a uh bill
 
00:36:56.990 --> 00:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
that states what their right is what
 
00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
what they have every student that's
 
00:37:01.849 --> 00:37:01.859 align:start position:0%
educable in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:37:04.849 --> 00:37:04.859 align:start position:0%
has a right to a free and adequate
 
00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:08.820 align:start position:0%
education and that has to be provided by
 
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
the local community and and how they do
 
00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:13.370 align:start position:0%
the local community and and how they do
that

00:37:13.370 --> 00:37:13.380 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:16.130 --> 00:37:16.140 align:start position:0%
um they no no child in that particular
 
00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:18.180 align:start position:0%
Community should be forced to pay extra
 
00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:20.420 align:start position:0%
parents should be paid
 
00:37:23.750 --> 00:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
forced to pay extra money to go to a
 
00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
private school
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
so last question I have for you then I I
 
00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
don't want to get this back and forth
 
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
myself but so if it's provided that they
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
have the option
 
00:37:40.069 --> 00:37:40.079 align:start position:0%
to go to a b or c and they choose C
 
00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
knowing that they're going to get
 
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
transportation to a of course high
 
00:37:45.050 --> 00:37:45.060 align:start position:0%
school students are not necessarily
 
00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:46.740 align:start position:0%
guaranteed Transportation but the
 
00:37:49.370 --> 00:37:49.380 align:start position:0%
district May provide that to a where all
 
00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
those services but they still choose to
 
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
go to be
 
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
are you supportive of that concept I
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
think I think that is that is a choice
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
bill that is a that is part of the EFA
 
00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:04.460 align:start position:0%
or the choice no that's not not
 
00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:06.540 align:start position:0%
it's part of the it's part of the
 
00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:09.300 align:start position:0%
croydonville that originally set up but
 
00:38:12.349 --> 00:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
but that is part of one of the bills
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be talking about
 
00:38:17.109 --> 00:38:17.119 align:start position:0%
later and this this is not to
 
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
identify and
 
00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
restrict it is simply a statement of a
 
00:38:26.089 --> 00:38:26.099 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights it's the basic thing and
 
00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
then whatever the legislature does on
 
00:38:32.569 --> 00:38:32.579 align:start position:0%
top of that as long as each educable
 
00:38:32.579 --> 00:38:33.890 align:start position:0%
top of that as long as each educable
child

00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:33.900 align:start position:0%
child
 
00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
has the ability to attend
 
00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
uh free and adequate education
 
00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
opportunity the opportunity yeah
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
representative cascadden um I was just
 
00:38:45.650 --> 00:38:45.660 align:start position:0%
thinking your local school board
 
00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:47.569 align:start position:0%
thinking your local school board
policies

00:38:47.569 --> 00:38:47.579 align:start position:0%
policies
 
00:38:50.270 --> 00:38:50.280 align:start position:0%
should have that clearly spelled out
 
00:38:52.849 --> 00:38:52.859 align:start position:0%
um there's one on admission of Resident
 
00:38:52.859 --> 00:38:53.990 align:start position:0%
um there's one on admission of Resident
students

00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
and however your district is structured
 
00:38:58.490 --> 00:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
you could have potentially have language
 
00:39:01.069 --> 00:39:01.079 align:start position:0%
in there already that determines whether
 
00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:03.060 align:start position:0%
the district is going to allow that to
 
00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
occur if the parent wants to pay the
 
00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:06.540 align:start position:0%
difference and you should also have a
 
00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:08.700 align:start position:0%
policy that talks about non-residents
 
00:39:11.089 --> 00:39:11.099 align:start position:0%
and what authorities they have to either
 
00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:13.500 align:start position:0%
attend your school or the school of
 
00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:15.660 align:start position:0%
their choice but the district should
 
00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:17.820 align:start position:0%
already have policies in there that
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
clearly describe what options families
 
00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:21.290 align:start position:0%
clearly describe what options families
have

00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:21.300 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:39:24.589 --> 00:39:24.599 align:start position:0%
within that District yeah representative
 
00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
cordelli uh Belcher
 
00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
as a a parent I have a problem with a
 
00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
number of these so-called rights in here
 
00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:39.420 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at Roman 3 on page two
 
00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:40.210 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at Roman 3 on page two
um

00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:40.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
uh does my child have a right to free
 
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
speech in my house
 
00:39:49.609 --> 00:39:49.619 align:start position:0%
um I know of many instances where um I
 
00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:51.900 align:start position:0%
denied my child uh free speech in my
 
00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:53.510 align:start position:0%
denied my child uh free speech in my
home

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
um and how about the right of personal
 
00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:57.349 align:start position:0%
um and how about the right of personal
privacy

00:39:57.349 --> 00:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:00.420 align:start position:0%
um you know we had uh our computer in a
 
00:40:03.109 --> 00:40:03.119 align:start position:0%
public space we could look at what was
 
00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:04.680 align:start position:0%
going on
 
00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:07.260 align:start position:0%
um in a school personal privacy does
 
00:40:10.609 --> 00:40:10.619 align:start position:0%
that mean that the school or uh
 
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
um law enforcement cannot search lockers
 
00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:15.710 align:start position:0%
um law enforcement cannot search lockers
anymore

00:40:15.710 --> 00:40:15.720 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
00:40:19.089 --> 00:40:19.099 align:start position:0%
um I think that there are a great many
 
00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:22.280 align:start position:0%
things in here that were
 
00:40:25.609 --> 00:40:25.619 align:start position:0%
prescribing rights to minors that go
 
00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:30.180 align:start position:0%
well beyond what uh I as a parent would
 
00:40:35.150 --> 00:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
want to provide to my child my children
 
00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:38.220 align:start position:0%
representative uh Belcher
 
00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:39.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I appreciate
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
those comments from rep for daily so I
 
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
won't belabor any of those points but I
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
would like to take a look at the new
 
00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:48.420 align:start position:0%
section the statement of findings
 
00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:51.540 align:start position:0%
especially under Roman three
 
00:40:53.390 --> 00:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
um where I or I'm going to suggest that
 
00:40:56.390 --> 00:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
this this this uh statement of Rights is
 
00:40:58.609 --> 00:40:58.619 align:start position:0%
actually deeply confusing the concept of
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
rights with privileges
 
00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
first of all so it actually says
 
00:41:04.609 --> 00:41:04.619 align:start position:0%
privilege is right here so again I I
 
00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
would I would make the point that the
 
00:41:07.370 --> 00:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
constitution does not contain privileges
 
00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:09.180 align:start position:0%
it recognizes pre-existing natural
 
00:41:10.849 --> 00:41:10.859 align:start position:0%
rights that are inherent to each person
 
00:41:12.589 --> 00:41:12.599 align:start position:0%
I happen to believe that as image
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
bearers of God we do but each person can
 
00:41:16.849 --> 00:41:16.859 align:start position:0%
decide for themselves why each person
 
00:41:18.829 --> 00:41:18.839 align:start position:0%
has an inherent dignity and rights but
 
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
they're inherent to a person they're not
 
00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:22.980 align:start position:0%
granted by the Constitution they're just
 
00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:24.890 align:start position:0%
granted by the Constitution they're just
recognized

00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:24.900 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
and the problem comes where it suggests
 
00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:29.460 align:start position:0%
down here that these rights can go
 
00:41:32.450 --> 00:41:32.460 align:start position:0%
through Evolution and interpretation
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
and that's just not something that
 
00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:36.300 align:start position:0%
rights are subject to rights either
 
00:41:38.569 --> 00:41:38.579 align:start position:0%
exist or they do not they do not evolve
 
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
they are unchanging at all times and in
 
00:41:42.349 --> 00:41:42.359 align:start position:0%
all places
 
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
and to confuse that concept with
 
00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:46.260 align:start position:0%
privileges that are granted by
 
00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:48.780 align:start position:0%
government puts us into a position where
 
00:41:51.109 --> 00:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
we have we can lose these rights with a
 
00:41:53.569 --> 00:41:53.579 align:start position:0%
51 majority deciding we don't have them
 
00:41:53.579 --> 00:41:54.530 align:start position:0%
51 majority deciding we don't have them
anymore

00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:54.540 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
00:41:56.589 --> 00:41:56.599 align:start position:0%
so that's that's my big issue with this
 
00:41:56.599 --> 00:41:58.450 align:start position:0%
so that's that's my big issue with this
representative

00:41:58.450 --> 00:41:58.460 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:42:03.050 --> 00:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I am very confused
 
00:42:06.109 --> 00:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
about the fact that we have compulsory
 
00:42:08.329 --> 00:42:08.339 align:start position:0%
education in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:42:11.569 --> 00:42:11.579 align:start position:0%
to the age of 18. so children are in
 
00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:14.700 align:start position:0%
essence forced to attend school
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
the parents are have an obligation to
 
00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:21.540 align:start position:0%
determine which school or which type of
 
00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:23.820 align:start position:0%
school their children attend so now
 
00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:25.740 align:start position:0%
we're going to turn around and give
 
00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:28.980 align:start position:0%
those same that same group of people who
 
00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
we are forcing into a situation forcing
 
00:42:33.829 --> 00:42:33.839 align:start position:0%
into an education and we're going to
 
00:42:36.829 --> 00:42:36.839 align:start position:0%
tell them what their rights are well if
 
00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:41.220 align:start position:0%
you look at page two line 22 the very
 
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
first thing I would have done as a high
 
00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
school student would be to assemble my
 
00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:48.680 align:start position:0%
fellow students and say that I no longer
 
00:42:53.569 --> 00:42:53.579 align:start position:0%
have a duty to I'm going to exercise my
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
right of petition and peaceful assembly
 
00:42:57.410 --> 00:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
to tell you that I will not be going to
 
00:42:59.329 --> 00:42:59.339 align:start position:0%
school nor should it be compulsory any
 
00:42:59.339 --> 00:43:02.569 align:start position:0%
school nor should it be compulsory any
longer

00:43:02.569 --> 00:43:02.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:04.260 align:start position:0%
one of the state troopers coming after
 
00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:05.530 align:start position:0%
one of the state troopers coming after
you

00:43:05.530 --> 00:43:05.540 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:07.740 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald
 
00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:09.900 align:start position:0%
thank you um an additional point that
 
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
has not been mentioned in this
 
00:43:13.309 --> 00:43:13.319 align:start position:0%
conversation but was made note during
 
00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
the hearing if you look at the
 
00:43:18.109 --> 00:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
definitions in line 26 to 27 on the
 
00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:20.040 align:start position:0%
first page of the amendment in this
 
00:43:22.430 --> 00:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
chapter public school student means any
 
00:43:24.290 --> 00:43:24.300 align:start position:0%
child enrolled in a New Hampshire or
 
00:43:26.809 --> 00:43:26.819 align:start position:0%
public or chartered Public School
 
00:43:29.809 --> 00:43:29.819 align:start position:0%
now it doesn't say K through 12 school
 
00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
and we do have public universities in
 
00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:34.140 align:start position:0%
the states such as UNH and the
 
00:43:36.050 --> 00:43:36.060 align:start position:0%
university system and there's nothing in
 
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
this bill to believe that those students
 
00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:39.900 align:start position:0%
attending those school would be Exempted
 
00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
so some of these rights were recognizing
 
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
the rights of adults because the
 
00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
majority of college students are not of
 
00:43:48.589 --> 00:43:48.599 align:start position:0%
minor age and the distinction is not
 
00:43:52.250 --> 00:43:52.260 align:start position:0%
made and it's ambiguous as worded
 
00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:54.300 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the committee
 
00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair I also
 
00:43:59.569 --> 00:43:59.579 align:start position:0%
see this as a violation of natural
 
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
rights because the students don't have
 
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
the right to choose what type of
 
00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:07.020 align:start position:0%
education they are pursuing when they're
 
00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:09.060 align:start position:0%
under the age of 18
 
00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:11.220 align:start position:0%
and I would argue over the age of 18
 
00:44:13.930 --> 00:44:13.940 align:start position:0%
depending on who's paying for it
 
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
and that children have the right and
 
00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
protection of their from their parents
 
00:44:21.530 --> 00:44:21.540 align:start position:0%
and when it comes to their health
 
00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
education and Welfare and if the parents
 
00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
have a duty to that the students have a
 
00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:30.420 align:start position:0%
duty to follow what their parents tell
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
them until they are emancipated from
 
00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:35.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:38.809 --> 00:44:38.819 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the committee
 
00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:42.300 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:36.780 align:start position:0%
we have a uh history in New Hampshire as
 
00:48:39.589 --> 00:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
in other states of removing obsolete
 
00:48:43.130 --> 00:48:43.140 align:start position:0%
provisions of our constitution
 
00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
um I'll Point specifically to 1968 and
 
00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0%
1980 where three Provisions were removed
 
00:48:55.569 --> 00:48:55.579 align:start position:0%
um I'll go back to the
 
00:49:00.730 --> 00:49:00.740 align:start position:0%
edition of the Blaine amendment to our
 
00:49:05.349 --> 00:49:05.359 align:start position:0%
constitution in 1877
 
00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
just prior to that in 1906 excuse me
 
00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:11.809 align:start position:0%
just prior to that in 1906 excuse me
1868.

00:49:11.809 --> 00:49:11.819 align:start position:0%
1868.
 
00:49:14.569 --> 00:49:14.579 align:start position:0%
um in the Hale versus Everett New
 
00:49:17.690 --> 00:49:17.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court case
 
00:49:21.970 --> 00:49:21.980 align:start position:0%
um there had been in statute for years
 
00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:24.780 align:start position:0%
the requirement that elected officials
 
00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:32.329 --> 00:49:32.339 align:start position:0%
um in 19 in 1868 the Supreme Court said
 
00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
that that was a dead letter
 
00:49:38.329 --> 00:49:38.339 align:start position:0%
and remove and it should be removed from
 
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
the Constitution a dead letter as
 
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
defined in the legal dictionary is a
 
00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:46.980 align:start position:0%
statute that is no longer enforced but
 
00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
has not been formally repealed
 
00:49:52.450 --> 00:49:52.460 align:start position:0%
and added in the US makes me
 
00:49:55.849 --> 00:49:55.859 align:start position:0%
u.slegal.com it cannot be enforced
 
00:50:00.890 --> 00:50:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
in 1877
 
00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
that provision for Protestant religion
 
00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:10.380 align:start position:0%
of elected officials was removed
 
00:50:13.849 --> 00:50:13.859 align:start position:0%
at the same time the Blaine amendment
 
00:50:18.349 --> 00:50:18.359 align:start position:0%
was was added by the voters and as we've
 
00:50:21.349 --> 00:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
talked about in the past it was a
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
reaction to what was going on in the
 
00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:25.609 align:start position:0%
reaction to what was going on in the
time

00:50:25.609 --> 00:50:25.619 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:50:25.619 --> 00:50:26.349 align:start position:0%
time
um

00:50:26.349 --> 00:50:26.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
with the know-nothing party the
 
00:50:32.589 --> 00:50:32.599 align:start position:0%
predecessors to the Ku Klux Klan
 
00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
Church burnings and an anti-catholic and
 
00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
anti-jewish movement in the country to
 
00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:43.140 align:start position:0%
keep the schools as Protestant
 
00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:46.130 align:start position:0%
keep the schools as Protestant
institutions

00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:46.140 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:47.150 align:start position:0%
institutions
um

00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
it was suggested at the time that they
 
00:50:54.049 --> 00:50:54.059 align:start position:0%
removed the
 
00:50:58.250 --> 00:50:58.260 align:start position:0%
um Protestant elected officials
 
00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:01.980 align:start position:0%
provision but added the blame Amendment
 
00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:05.160 align:start position:0%
um so that Catholics who now were going
 
00:51:07.849 --> 00:51:07.859 align:start position:0%
to be allowed into office would not be
 
00:51:10.490 --> 00:51:10.500 align:start position:0%
able to use their position to provide
 
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:18.680 align:start position:0%
um we've heard
 
00:51:20.690 --> 00:51:20.700 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:51:25.250 --> 00:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court decisions were narrow
 
00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:26.390 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court decisions were narrow
rulings

00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
rulings
 
00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
that is not the case the rulings in
 
00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:31.309 align:start position:0%
that is not the case the rulings in
multiple

00:51:31.309 --> 00:51:31.319 align:start position:0%
multiple
 
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
cases has been very Broad and
 
00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:38.480 align:start position:0%
substantive substantial when it comes to
 
00:51:41.049 --> 00:51:41.059 align:start position:0%
school choice
 
00:51:44.809 --> 00:51:44.819 align:start position:0%
some of the initial cases were different
 
00:51:49.250 --> 00:51:49.260 align:start position:0%
than our education Freedom accounts for
 
00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:52.380 align:start position:0%
instance the zelman versus Simmons
 
00:51:56.470 --> 00:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
Harris case was a uh excuse me in Ohio
 
00:51:58.490 --> 00:51:58.500 align:start position:0%
Voucher Program now we don't have
 
00:52:00.049 --> 00:52:00.059 align:start position:0%
vouchers we all know in New Hampshire
 
00:52:03.710 --> 00:52:03.720 align:start position:0%
but this was a voucher case and the
 
00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:05.480 align:start position:0%
opinion of the case
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
said excuse me sorry Luna don't don't
 
00:52:13.309 --> 00:52:13.319 align:start position:0%
cast what okay let's let's not have any
 
00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:15.660 align:start position:0%
sideways discussions here represent
 
00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:18.180 align:start position:0%
cordelli has the floor
 
00:52:21.650 --> 00:52:21.660 align:start position:0%
um the opinion stated
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
I'm putting words in my own mouth at the
 
00:52:27.650 --> 00:52:27.660 align:start position:0%
moment uh the Ohio program permits such
 
00:52:30.049 --> 00:52:30.059 align:start position:0%
individuals to exercise genuine Choice
 
00:52:32.809 --> 00:52:32.819 align:start position:0%
among options public and private secular
 
00:52:35.930 --> 00:52:35.940 align:start position:0%
and religious the program is therefore a
 
00:52:40.069 --> 00:52:40.079 align:start position:0%
program of true private Choice as stated
 
00:52:42.410 --> 00:52:42.420 align:start position:0%
in the Supreme Court decision in Trinity
 
00:52:45.890 --> 00:52:45.900 align:start position:0%
Lutheran versus Comer case
 
00:52:48.730 --> 00:52:48.740 align:start position:0%
um just chief justice Roberts wrote
 
00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:51.780 align:start position:0%
exclusion of Trinity Lutheran from a
 
00:52:54.049 --> 00:52:54.059 align:start position:0%
public benefit for which it is otherwise
 
00:52:56.589 --> 00:52:56.599 align:start position:0%
qualified solely because it is a church
 
00:53:01.309 --> 00:53:01.319 align:start position:0%
is odious odious to our constitution all
 
00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:04.140 align:start position:0%
the same and cannot stand
 
00:53:05.829 --> 00:53:05.839 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:53:08.329 --> 00:53:08.339 align:start position:0%
Espinoza versus Montana Department of
 
00:53:11.170 --> 00:53:11.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:15.650 --> 00:53:15.660 align:start position:0%
just from uh three years ago
 
00:53:15.660 --> 00:53:19.490 align:start position:0%
just from uh three years ago
it

00:53:19.490 --> 00:53:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:22.130 --> 00:53:22.140 align:start position:0%
was stated by Justice Alito
 
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
that if a state decides to fund private
 
00:53:27.250 --> 00:53:27.260 align:start position:0%
education institutions it cannot
 
00:53:29.930 --> 00:53:29.940 align:start position:0%
discriminate against parents who choose
 
00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
to send their children to religious
 
00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:32.870 align:start position:0%
to send their children to religious
schools

00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:53:36.410 --> 00:53:36.420 align:start position:0%
Justice Roberts added we have repeatedly
 
00:53:38.569 --> 00:53:38.579 align:start position:0%
held that The Establishment Clause is
 
00:53:40.549 --> 00:53:40.559 align:start position:0%
not offended when religious observers
 
00:53:43.730 --> 00:53:43.740 align:start position:0%
and organizations benefit from neutral
 
00:53:45.849 --> 00:53:45.859 align:start position:0%
government programs
 
00:53:51.309 --> 00:53:51.319 align:start position:0%
just last year Maine Carson versus Macon
 
00:53:54.410 --> 00:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
Justice Roberts reiterated what he had
 
00:53:57.349 --> 00:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
written in the 2020 case a state need
 
00:54:00.109 --> 00:54:00.119 align:start position:0%
not subsidize private education but once
 
00:54:02.690 --> 00:54:02.700 align:start position:0%
the state decides to do so it cannot
 
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
disqualify private schools solely
 
00:54:07.790 --> 00:54:07.800 align:start position:0%
because they are religious
 
00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
a neutral benefit program which public
 
00:54:13.370 --> 00:54:13.380 align:start position:0%
in which public funds flow to the
 
00:54:15.650 --> 00:54:15.660 align:start position:0%
religious organizations through the
 
00:54:17.950 --> 00:54:17.960 align:start position:0%
independent choice of private benefit
 
00:54:21.290 --> 00:54:21.300 align:start position:0%
recipients private benefit recipients
 
00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:23.940 align:start position:0%
it's no longer public money it's private
 
00:54:26.569 --> 00:54:26.579 align:start position:0%
benefit recipients does not offend The
 
00:54:29.230 --> 00:54:29.240 align:start position:0%
Establishment Clause
 
00:54:31.970 --> 00:54:31.980 align:start position:0%
I would offer that
 
00:54:35.329 --> 00:54:35.339 align:start position:0%
the Blaine Amendment Article 2 Section
 
00:54:40.569 --> 00:54:40.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:46.130 --> 00:54:46.140 align:start position:0%
it is a remnant of bigotry it is a stain
 
00:54:48.890 --> 00:54:48.900 align:start position:0%
on our constitution is no longer
 
00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:51.900 align:start position:0%
enforceable based on multiple U.S
 
00:54:54.829 --> 00:54:54.839 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decisions and needs to be
 
00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:56.700 align:start position:0%
removed and we need to send it to the
 
00:55:02.329 --> 00:55:02.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:03.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:06.480 align:start position:0%

I'm not going to get into the history of
 
00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
rather than cordelli but I will want to
 
00:55:16.490 --> 00:55:16.500 align:start position:0%
get in the current times I know we
 
00:55:18.349 --> 00:55:18.359 align:start position:0%
always hear what our constituents say
 
00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
our constituents say our constituents
 
00:55:21.950 --> 00:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
say I'm not sure what you guys are
 
00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:23.640 align:start position:0%
hearing I'll tell you one thing I hear
 
00:55:25.309 --> 00:55:25.319 align:start position:0%
the one thing I hear from my
 
00:55:28.970 --> 00:55:28.980 align:start position:0%
constituents and the people uh that talk
 
00:55:32.049 --> 00:55:32.059 align:start position:0%
to me there are a few besides Alpha
 
00:55:34.250 --> 00:55:34.260 align:start position:0%
is is that
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
I don't want my tax dollar going really
 
00:55:38.930 --> 00:55:38.940 align:start position:0%
to school
 
00:55:41.450 --> 00:55:41.460 align:start position:0%
that's right here it doesn't matter it
 
00:55:42.829 --> 00:55:42.839 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter if it goes through a
 
00:55:45.049 --> 00:55:45.059 align:start position:0%
private independent resource and passes
 
00:55:46.849 --> 00:55:46.859 align:start position:0%
its way through the dollar no matter how
 
00:55:49.370 --> 00:55:49.380 align:start position:0%
it gets there my public taxes I do not
 
00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
want to sponsor someone's going to the
 
00:55:52.190 --> 00:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
school so let's
 
00:55:53.690 --> 00:55:53.700 align:start position:0%
it's a clue I'm just going to tell you
 
00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:56.760 align:start position:0%

00:55:58.370 --> 00:55:58.380 align:start position:0%
constituents and I want to make it
 
00:56:01.010 --> 00:56:01.020 align:start position:0%
public here today thank you further

mm-hmm thank you Mr chair
 
00:56:10.670 --> 00:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
it's interesting that the sites that
 
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli made on some of
 
00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
these uh Supreme Court decisions is
 
00:56:17.089 --> 00:56:17.099 align:start position:0%
interesting because
 
00:56:19.490 --> 00:56:19.500 align:start position:0%
the Lutheran case was basically targeted
 
00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:21.200 align:start position:0%
for a playground
 
00:56:24.470 --> 00:56:24.480 align:start position:0%
not school education
 
00:56:27.049 --> 00:56:27.059 align:start position:0%
the Espinoza case came out of a tax
 
00:56:30.230 --> 00:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
credit program very similar to what we
 
00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
have in this state from a standpoint
 
00:56:34.730 --> 00:56:34.740 align:start position:0%
who's been made very clear in this
 
00:56:37.370 --> 00:56:37.380 align:start position:0%
committee that tax credits are not
 
00:56:39.290 --> 00:56:39.300 align:start position:0%
public Monies
 
00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
very similar to this and that's what
 
00:56:42.829 --> 00:56:42.839 align:start position:0%
Espinoza was about
 
00:56:45.410 --> 00:56:45.420 align:start position:0%
in the main case was very similar to
 
00:56:47.150 --> 00:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
what we had in the Croydon case in this
 
00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
stage where you had a school that only
 
00:56:52.609 --> 00:56:52.619 align:start position:0%
went up I'm not sure if like the sixth
 
00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
grade and they wanted to send kids out
 
00:56:56.690 --> 00:56:56.700 align:start position:0%
of the school to another to another
 
00:56:59.329 --> 00:56:59.339 align:start position:0%
school and they provided uh public
 
00:57:01.210 --> 00:57:01.220 align:start position:0%
monies for that tuition
 
00:57:03.290 --> 00:57:03.300 align:start position:0%
the other issue that hasn't been
 
00:57:05.450 --> 00:57:05.460 align:start position:0%
mentioned in this conversation
 
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to read this to the
 
00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:08.690 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to read this to the
committee

00:57:08.690 --> 00:57:08.700 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
this comes out of the Constitution part
 
00:57:13.609 --> 00:57:13.619 align:start position:0%
one article 6.
 
00:57:15.470 --> 00:57:15.480 align:start position:0%
and I quote
 
00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
no person shall ever be compelled to pay
 
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
towards the support of schools of any
 
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
sect or denomination
 
00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:27.770 align:start position:0%
sect or denomination
1784.

00:57:27.770 --> 00:57:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:30.309 --> 00:57:30.319 align:start position:0%
so as far as I'm concerned uh
 
00:57:32.210 --> 00:57:32.220 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding the arguments about
 
00:57:34.870 --> 00:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
religion Etc and the blame Amendment
 
00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
Constitution is very clear about how
 
00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
money should be spent and should not go
 
00:57:41.870 --> 00:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
towards a sect or a denomination
 
00:57:45.049 --> 00:57:45.059 align:start position:0%
so I I'm absolutely going to post this
 
00:57:47.450 --> 00:57:47.460 align:start position:0%
uh OTP thank you
 
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:52.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair first I I want to
 
00:57:54.770 --> 00:57:54.780 align:start position:0%
speak to the the last item that was just
 
00:57:56.030 --> 00:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
brought up because I do think it's an
 
00:57:57.829 --> 00:57:57.839 align:start position:0%
important item it's a separate Clause
 
00:57:59.510 --> 00:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
within the state constitution of New
 
00:58:01.970 --> 00:58:01.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it is admittedly a
 
00:58:04.010 --> 00:58:04.020 align:start position:0%
complicating Factor when we look at all
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
this but let's be clear
 
00:58:09.349 --> 00:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
it is not just complicating for
 
00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
Religious Education because the Supreme
 
00:58:15.890 --> 00:58:15.900 align:start position:0%
Court has ruled that secular humanism is
 
00:58:18.589 --> 00:58:18.599 align:start position:0%
a religion the Supreme Court has also
 
00:58:21.170 --> 00:58:21.180 align:start position:0%
ruled that because education cannot
 
00:58:24.109 --> 00:58:24.119 align:start position:0%
possibly be Viewpoint Mutual you cannot
 
00:58:26.770 --> 00:58:26.780 align:start position:0%
possibly remove secular
 
00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
humanism and what is taught in schools
 
00:58:34.490 --> 00:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
from that milou of religiosity
 
00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
therefore when the secular Public
 
00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
Schools took over from the church
 
00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
education as they did in the late 1800s
 
00:58:44.569 --> 00:58:44.579 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire it wasn't actually
 
00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
transferring from a religious based
 
00:58:51.530 --> 00:58:51.540 align:start position:0%
worldview to a Viewpoint neutral world
 
00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:53.940 align:start position:0%
view it was transferring it from one
 
00:58:57.650 --> 00:58:57.660 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint to another Viewpoint so that
 
00:59:00.410 --> 00:59:00.420 align:start position:0%
would actually complicate not just PRI
 
00:59:02.270 --> 00:59:02.280 align:start position:0%
uh rather private education but also
 
00:59:04.609 --> 00:59:04.619 align:start position:0%
public education and we haven't heard a
 
00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
skoda's decision on that so until we do
 
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
I don't think there's any point in
 
00:59:12.370 --> 00:59:12.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:14.990 --> 00:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair to address the
 
00:59:18.049 --> 00:59:18.059 align:start position:0%
concerns because of part one article 6
 
00:59:19.630 --> 00:59:19.640 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Constitution
 
00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:22.260 align:start position:0%
removing the blame amendment in our
 
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:24.180 align:start position:0%
constitution would not actually change
 
00:59:26.690 --> 00:59:26.700 align:start position:0%
the policy regarding funding private
 
00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
education religious education with the
 
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
intent of this bill really is to do is
 
00:59:33.349 --> 00:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
to remove a stain as representative
 
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
cordelli put it on our Constitution that
 
00:59:39.890 --> 00:59:39.900 align:start position:0%
was anti-immigrant anti-catholic and in
 
00:59:42.349 --> 00:59:42.359 align:start position:0%
that time anti-immigrant was anti-irish
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
and we're coming up upon St Patrick's
 
00:59:47.569 --> 00:59:47.579 align:start position:0%
Day and here we are still arguing if we
 
00:59:49.549 --> 00:59:49.559 align:start position:0%
should recognize the people in this
 
00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
country of Irish heritage or immigrants
 
00:59:54.650 --> 00:59:54.660 align:start position:0%
of any background
 
00:59:57.470 --> 00:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
thank you representative cordelli uh
 
00:59:58.910 --> 00:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:01.260 align:start position:0%
um talking about part one article six
 
01:00:03.289 --> 01:00:03.299 align:start position:0%
the what's referred to as the compelled
 
01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
reason Clause
 
01:00:07.849 --> 01:00:07.859 align:start position:0%
um a number of those States
 
01:00:10.370 --> 01:00:10.380 align:start position:0%
um and those Court decisions
 
01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:13.140 align:start position:0%
um that I just referenced um had similar
 
01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:15.720 align:start position:0%
uh Clauses in their constitutions and
 
01:00:17.690 --> 01:00:17.700 align:start position:0%
were referred to
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
um as being not applicable by the
 
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court but just let me go back to
 
01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:24.849 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court but just let me go back to
um

01:00:24.849 --> 01:00:24.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:28.809 --> 01:00:28.819 align:start position:0%
1784 when this language was adopted
 
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
religious worship was supported by town
 
01:00:35.329 --> 01:00:35.339 align:start position:0%
taxes that's what this was about
 
01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
most of those churches were
 
01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:39.900 align:start position:0%
congregational churches
 
01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
in 1791 the act for regulating towns and
 
01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:47.640 align:start position:0%
choice of town officers passed and it
 
01:00:50.030 --> 01:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
included authorizing Town voters to
 
01:00:52.430 --> 01:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
collect taxes to support the local
 
01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:53.990 align:start position:0%
collect taxes to support the local
Ministry

01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
Ministry
 
01:00:56.450 --> 01:00:56.460 align:start position:0%
so that's what the compelled reason
 
01:00:59.270 --> 01:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
Clause is talking about to having the
 
01:01:02.089 --> 01:01:02.099 align:start position:0%
government collect taxes to give to
 
01:01:02.099 --> 01:01:03.770 align:start position:0%
government collect taxes to give to
churches

01:01:03.770 --> 01:01:03.780 align:start position:0%
churches
 
01:01:06.890 --> 01:01:06.900 align:start position:0%
towns were enforcing that to vary in
 
01:01:10.690 --> 01:01:10.700 align:start position:0%
degrees and that Act was repealed in
 
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
1819 as more faiths were coming into the
 
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
country and there was more opposition to
 
01:01:21.250 --> 01:01:21.260 align:start position:0%
favoring one religion
 
01:01:24.530 --> 01:01:24.540 align:start position:0%
primarily the Congregational Church
 
01:01:27.470 --> 01:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
with tax dollars that's what the
 
01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:30.660 align:start position:0%
compelled reason Clause article part 1
 
01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative cordiello do you have
 
01:01:39.049 --> 01:01:39.059 align:start position:0%
here you're all set now
 
01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:40.380 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
01:01:42.770 --> 01:01:42.780 align:start position:0%
Belcher yes I would just say because I I
 
01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
have received emails from constituents
 
01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:46.740 align:start position:0%
and other people suggesting they don't
 
01:01:48.289 --> 01:01:48.299 align:start position:0%
want their money going to Religious
 
01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
Education I understand the viewpoint
 
01:01:53.089 --> 01:01:53.099 align:start position:0%
the last point I want to make on this is
 
01:01:55.010 --> 01:01:55.020 align:start position:0%
you don't have to like what's happening
 
01:01:56.569 --> 01:01:56.579 align:start position:0%
right here because Supreme Court has
 
01:01:57.770 --> 01:01:57.780 align:start position:0%
ruled on this
 
01:02:01.970 --> 01:02:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:03.770 --> 01:02:03.780 align:start position:0%
but I think it's important to note that
 
01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
if we vote against it as a house we are
 
01:02:07.730 --> 01:02:07.740 align:start position:0%
in fact sending a signal to the federal
 
01:02:12.170 --> 01:02:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:18.410 --> 01:02:18.420 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Tanner
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
um could you give me the reference to
 
01:02:23.690 --> 01:02:23.700 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court decision that said
 
01:02:27.770 --> 01:02:27.780 align:start position:0%
that secular humanism is a religion
 
01:02:32.109 --> 01:02:32.119 align:start position:0%
I can certainly get that to you
 
01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:38.460 align:start position:0%
not seeing any uh we're ready to go
 
01:02:41.089 --> 01:02:41.099 align:start position:0%
ahead then we are we have a motion of
 
01:02:43.069 --> 01:02:43.079 align:start position:0%
OTP on the Constitutional Amendment
 
01:02:46.010 --> 01:02:46.020 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution number seven the
 
01:02:48.170 --> 01:02:48.180 align:start position:0%
use of money raised by taxation for
 
01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:49.970 align:start position:0%
use of money raised by taxation for
education

01:02:49.970 --> 01:02:49.980 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:02:52.609 --> 01:02:52.619 align:start position:0%
okay providing raise right taxation may
 
01:02:54.049 --> 01:02:54.059 align:start position:0%
be applied for the use of religious
 
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
educational institutions
 
01:02:58.789 --> 01:02:58.799 align:start position:0%
uh Madam clerk would you please Mr
 
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
chairman yes just a quick question of
 
01:03:01.789 --> 01:03:01.799 align:start position:0%
the chair
 
01:03:04.190 --> 01:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
um uh this first time that that that
 
01:03:07.130 --> 01:03:07.140 align:start position:0%
I've uh been in a committee where we're
 
01:03:09.170 --> 01:03:09.180 align:start position:0%
voting taking your committee making a
 
01:03:10.910 --> 01:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
committee recommendation on a
 
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment and I was just
 
01:03:14.569 --> 01:03:14.579 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could explain the
 
01:03:17.930 --> 01:03:17.940 align:start position:0%
process in committee on the floor and
 
01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
afterwards uh uh where something like
 
01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:22.260 align:start position:0%
this goes
 
01:03:24.650 --> 01:03:24.660 align:start position:0%
well where this will go is I'm talking
 
01:03:28.069 --> 01:03:28.079 align:start position:0%
about in terms of vote splits okay
 
01:03:29.930 --> 01:03:29.940 align:start position:0%
so in terms of what we do is we take
 
01:03:31.970 --> 01:03:31.980 align:start position:0%
action at this this meeting right here
 
01:03:34.069 --> 01:03:34.079 align:start position:0%
whether it's up or down
 
01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
and then the simple majority is simple
 
01:03:38.569 --> 01:03:38.579 align:start position:0%
majority right here but that's not the
 
01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
case on the house floor when it gets
 
01:03:50.530 --> 01:03:50.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:53.450 --> 01:03:53.460 align:start position:0%
if it were to achieve three-fifths yes
 
01:03:55.069 --> 01:03:55.079 align:start position:0%
that goes over there for the same thing
 
01:03:57.170 --> 01:03:57.180 align:start position:0%
and and then it does not have to go to
 
01:03:59.690 --> 01:03:59.700 align:start position:0%
the governor's office right right
 
01:04:01.849 --> 01:04:01.859 align:start position:0%
absolutely it goes on to a ballot right
 
01:04:04.010 --> 01:04:04.020 align:start position:0%
that's right and then the voters have to
 
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
decide the issue by uh super majority by
 
01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
a super majority I think it's two-thirds
 
01:04:12.530 --> 01:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
vote that's the super majority right
 
01:04:15.470 --> 01:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
there from the voters so so thank you Mr
 
01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
chair because I just think that's a very
 
01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:18.530 align:start position:0%
chair because I just think that's a very
interesting

01:04:18.530 --> 01:04:18.540 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
um uh you know uh type thing because
 
01:04:22.609 --> 01:04:22.619 align:start position:0%
it's not like our usual Bill process
 
01:04:24.890 --> 01:04:24.900 align:start position:0%
absolutely and it's it's like that
 
01:04:26.270 --> 01:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
intentionally here we're talking about
 
01:04:27.890 --> 01:04:27.900 align:start position:0%
the Constitution
 
01:04:31.069 --> 01:04:31.079 align:start position:0%
and so that's why it takes this type of
 
01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
action at various levels so this is the
 
01:04:36.530 --> 01:04:36.540 align:start position:0%
the one level where it's just you know a
 
01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
majority great thank you very much so

again thank you okay walking through
 
01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:28.620 align:start position:0%
this the area which the bill had is it

highlighted there on lines 11 through uh
 
01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:33.709 align:start position:0%
highlighted there on lines 11 through uh
14.

01:22:33.709 --> 01:22:33.719 align:start position:0%
14.
 
01:22:37.310 --> 01:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
and what this does is that we have a
 
01:22:39.850 --> 01:22:39.860 align:start position:0%
number of smaller schools in this state
 
01:22:43.130 --> 01:22:43.140 align:start position:0%
that tuition their students primarily
 
01:22:45.530 --> 01:22:45.540 align:start position:0%
secondary students but many of them some
 
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
also go tuition from grades four five
 
01:22:51.950 --> 01:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
six seven right up through grade 12.
 
01:22:54.290 --> 01:22:54.300 align:start position:0%
and what we've done in statutory law
 
01:22:57.530 --> 01:22:57.540 align:start position:0%
we've allowed these local school board
 
01:23:00.290 --> 01:23:00.300 align:start position:0%
to approve the school that they're
 
01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
sending these students to
 
01:23:08.090 --> 01:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
and they then uh have to ensure in their
 
01:23:10.130 --> 01:23:10.140 align:start position:0%
their programming that they're going to
 
01:23:12.050 --> 01:23:12.060 align:start position:0%
provide the services that are necessary
 
01:23:15.050 --> 01:23:15.060 align:start position:0%
for students from everything from
 
01:23:17.510 --> 01:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
special education through all those
 
01:23:20.090 --> 01:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
components and aspects of the adequate
 
01:23:23.930 --> 01:23:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:26.870 --> 01:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
many of these schools have contracts
 
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
which they've entered into with a
 
01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
receiving school they may have as many
 
01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
as three or four different contracts and
 
01:23:36.649 --> 01:23:36.659 align:start position:0%
the school district I'm talking about is
 
01:23:38.270 --> 01:23:38.280 align:start position:0%
there are several of them in my district
 
01:23:40.189 --> 01:23:40.199 align:start position:0%
I'll talk about one of them and I've
 
01:23:41.930 --> 01:23:41.940 align:start position:0%
done it before many times here is the
 
01:23:44.149 --> 01:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
small village at Piermont which is a K-8
 
01:23:47.270 --> 01:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
school roughly around 60 kids
 
01:23:50.209 --> 01:23:50.219 align:start position:0%
and they have contracts with Woodsville
 
01:23:52.669 --> 01:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
High School which is in Haverhill
 
01:23:55.010 --> 01:23:55.020 align:start position:0%
they have contracts with Oxbow High
 
01:23:57.290 --> 01:23:57.300 align:start position:0%
School which is in Bradford Vermont
 
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
they have contracts with Rivendell which
 
01:24:02.149 --> 01:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
is an interstate School District which
 
01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
is fairly Vermont and Orford New
 
01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:05.590 align:start position:0%
is fairly Vermont and Orford New
Hampshire

01:24:05.590 --> 01:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:24:07.790 --> 01:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
Corinth gets involved with that somewhat
 
01:24:10.970 --> 01:24:10.980 align:start position:0%
as well in Vermont they have contracts
 
01:24:12.890 --> 01:24:12.900 align:start position:0%
there with Thetford Academy also in
 
01:24:14.990 --> 01:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
Vermont and prior years they've had them
 
01:24:17.810 --> 01:24:17.820 align:start position:0%
with mescoma as well dipping down into
 
01:24:20.510 --> 01:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
the Hanover area
 
01:24:22.729 --> 01:24:22.739 align:start position:0%
these contracts are such that they
 
01:24:25.010 --> 01:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
negotiate them and there's a language
 
01:24:28.130 --> 01:24:28.140 align:start position:0%
that's put together and what happens as
 
01:24:30.729 --> 01:24:30.739 align:start position:0%
these contracts and years move forward
 
01:24:33.770 --> 01:24:33.780 align:start position:0%
the other point I want to mention is how
 
01:24:37.610 --> 01:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
does the town of Piermont then decide
 
01:24:39.410 --> 01:24:39.420 align:start position:0%
um what their how much money they're
 
01:24:41.810 --> 01:24:41.820 align:start position:0%
going to spend they take the tuition
 
01:24:44.030 --> 01:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
costs for Woodsville High School
 
01:24:46.130 --> 01:24:46.140 align:start position:0%
for Oxbow High School in Bradford
 
01:24:49.070 --> 01:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
Vermont and they take the cost to
 
01:24:51.470 --> 01:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
sending a kid to Rivendell which is down
 
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
the river in Orford the average that
 
01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:55.610 align:start position:0%
the river in Orford the average that
cost

01:24:55.610 --> 01:24:55.620 align:start position:0%
cost
 
01:24:57.770 --> 01:24:57.780 align:start position:0%
and then they add on a fudge factor of
 
01:25:00.169 --> 01:25:00.179 align:start position:0%
18 on top of that
 
01:25:02.330 --> 01:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
so that close to around twenty thousand
 
01:25:04.250 --> 01:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
dollars for tuition today so they look
 
01:25:06.890 --> 01:25:06.900 align:start position:0%
at their schools and all those schools
 
01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
fall within that range and there are
 
01:25:11.149 --> 01:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
like four kids still going to St
 
01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
Johnsbury Academy which they also
 
01:25:15.229 --> 01:25:15.239 align:start position:0%
tuition to and their tuition went up
 
01:25:18.530 --> 01:25:18.540 align:start position:0%
about a thousand dollars on top of
 
01:25:21.110 --> 01:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh where we have the cap
 
01:25:23.810 --> 01:25:23.820 align:start position:0%
and the parents are now saying well my
 
01:25:26.030 --> 01:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
child is there can they continue to go
 
01:25:28.430 --> 01:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
to school there yes they continue to go
 
01:25:30.410 --> 01:25:30.420 align:start position:0%
there are they going to be charged that
 
01:25:32.750 --> 01:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
difference though after this year is
 
01:25:35.510 --> 01:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
over and that school board's been
 
01:25:39.590 --> 01:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
hassling that issue out and and then as
 
01:25:41.030 --> 01:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
a result of that some of the parents are
 
01:25:43.790 --> 01:25:43.800 align:start position:0%
saying may I pay the difference
 
01:25:46.850 --> 01:25:46.860 align:start position:0%
if I opt to go to the academy which is
 
01:25:49.390 --> 01:25:49.400 align:start position:0%
an independent school it's approved by
 
01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Education in Vermont and
 
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
by the commissioner of Education wrote a
 
01:25:56.209 --> 01:25:56.219 align:start position:0%
letter for that that was back in when
 
01:25:58.550 --> 01:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
Virginia Barry did it and it's an
 
01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
approved School ass is uh Freiburg
 
01:26:04.729 --> 01:26:04.739 align:start position:0%
Academy over in Maine so we've been
 
01:26:06.770 --> 01:26:06.780 align:start position:0%
sending kids that direction but now
 
01:26:09.350 --> 01:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
they're saying look the cap the cost is
 
01:26:11.870 --> 01:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
above the cap which we have here and
 
01:26:13.910 --> 01:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
parents back to what I said are saying
 
01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:20.030 --> 01:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
so they are hassling right now they've
 
01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
been told by various attorneys different
 
01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:23.450 align:start position:0%
been told by various attorneys different
stories

01:26:23.450 --> 01:26:23.460 align:start position:0%
stories
 
01:26:26.450 --> 01:26:26.460 align:start position:0%
it's a confusing issue right now because
 
01:26:29.450 --> 01:26:29.460 align:start position:0%
this is also likened to landaf which is
 
01:26:31.850 --> 01:26:31.860 align:start position:0%
a community which I also have which is a
 
01:26:33.830 --> 01:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
small k-3 school they call it the blue
 
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
School up in land app and they tuition
 
01:26:38.810 --> 01:26:38.820 align:start position:0%
their kids to Lisbon but they also allow
 
01:26:41.330 --> 01:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
high school kids based upon what the
 
01:26:43.430 --> 01:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
parent would like to do some are going
 
01:26:46.610 --> 01:26:46.620 align:start position:0%
over to profile which is over to the
 
01:26:49.970 --> 01:26:49.980 align:start position:0%
west of it and and one child even goes
 
01:26:52.850 --> 01:26:52.860 align:start position:0%
to St Johnsbury Academy but they're
 
01:26:54.290 --> 01:26:54.300 align:start position:0%
paying for it they're paying for
 
01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
regardless what that tuition is land
 
01:26:58.490 --> 01:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
that's paying for that additional cost
 
01:27:01.129 --> 01:27:01.139 align:start position:0%
Paramount is in a situation right now
 
01:27:04.010 --> 01:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
where their operating budget projected
 
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
for next year is 22 percent higher than
 
01:27:08.570 --> 01:27:08.580 align:start position:0%
it was last year they've received
 
01:27:10.970 --> 01:27:10.980 align:start position:0%
several of these cat Aid type students
 
01:27:12.530 --> 01:27:12.540 align:start position:0%
and it's just thrown that whole budget
 
01:27:14.990 --> 01:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
out of whack so they're looking how can
 
01:27:18.110 --> 01:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
we keep our budget down where we can not
 
01:27:20.629 --> 01:27:20.639 align:start position:0%
nail our people with property taxes
 
01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
anymore so what this bill does
 
01:27:26.270 --> 01:27:26.280 align:start position:0%
it has a sense here to enroll a child in
 
01:27:28.129 --> 01:27:28.139 align:start position:0%
a tuition School approved by the local
 
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
school board whose tuition cost is above
 
01:27:32.270 --> 01:27:32.280 align:start position:0%
the district's established tuition cost
 
01:27:33.649 --> 01:27:33.659 align:start position:0%
per pupil
 
01:27:35.870 --> 01:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
as determined and approved by the board
 
01:27:39.290 --> 01:27:39.300 align:start position:0%
the local board may require may require
 
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
the parent to pay the tuition cost
 
01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:42.770 align:start position:0%
the parent to pay the tuition cost
difference

01:27:42.770 --> 01:27:42.780 align:start position:0%
difference
 
01:27:45.709 --> 01:27:45.719 align:start position:0%
now this is the new part in this as long
 
01:27:48.709 --> 01:27:48.719 align:start position:0%
as at least one option one of those
 
01:27:52.430 --> 01:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
schools a b c d whatever it might be
 
01:27:55.189 --> 01:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
at least one option does not require
 
01:27:57.590 --> 01:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
additional tuition payment from the
 
01:28:01.010 --> 01:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
parent so they're looking for a a school
 
01:28:02.689 --> 01:28:02.699 align:start position:0%
in which they can send their kids to
 
01:28:05.209 --> 01:28:05.219 align:start position:0%
that is not going to cost a parent any
 
01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
money at all
 
01:28:08.990 --> 01:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
that might be in the case where I am it
 
01:28:10.970 --> 01:28:10.980 align:start position:0%
might be Oxbow it may be Rivendell it
 
01:28:13.610 --> 01:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
may be Thetford Academy but would not be
 
01:28:15.649 --> 01:28:15.659 align:start position:0%
St Johnsbury Academy seeing that the
 
01:28:16.850 --> 01:28:16.860 align:start position:0%
parent would you know somebody's gonna
 
01:28:19.070 --> 01:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
have to pay that difference and so what
 
01:28:20.689 --> 01:28:20.699 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is work around find
 
01:28:23.810 --> 01:28:23.820 align:start position:0%
out what is you know permissible this
 
01:28:25.310 --> 01:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
language which we have in front of us
 
01:28:27.890 --> 01:28:27.900 align:start position:0%
today was written uh just yesterday by
 
01:28:30.110 --> 01:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
the AG's office they feel that this is
 
01:28:32.689 --> 01:28:32.699 align:start position:0%
pretty you know secure in fact that we
 
01:28:35.390 --> 01:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
are providing districts the option
 
01:28:39.050 --> 01:28:39.060 align:start position:0%
to send them to a school and for example
 
01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
they are providing paramounts providing
 
01:28:42.110 --> 01:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
that Transportation even though they
 
01:28:44.830 --> 01:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
don't have to because it's high school
 
01:28:48.229 --> 01:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
they're too Oxbow which is Bradford
 
01:28:50.209 --> 01:28:50.219 align:start position:0%
Vermont and Rivendell they connect buses
 
01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
between the town lines so and the
 
01:28:55.550 --> 01:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
Woodsville as well so all that is
 
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
available but there are some parents
 
01:28:59.390 --> 01:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
that want to continue their kids to go
 
01:29:01.610 --> 01:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
to the academy so this is what this is
 
01:29:05.330 --> 01:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
trying to do so uh
 
01:29:07.070 --> 01:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
that's all I have at this time
 
01:29:09.229 --> 01:29:09.239 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
01:29:11.530 --> 01:29:11.540 align:start position:0%
uh thank you anything from the uh
 
01:29:13.490 --> 01:29:13.500 align:start position:0%
secondary of the motion representative
 
01:29:13.500 --> 01:29:14.570 align:start position:0%
secondary of the motion representative
fort

01:29:14.570 --> 01:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
fort
 
01:29:17.689 --> 01:29:17.699 align:start position:0%
no nothing improved further discussion
 
01:29:20.330 --> 01:29:20.340 align:start position:0%
representative miler well thank you Mr
 
01:29:24.350 --> 01:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
chair so let's just clarify this so as
 
01:29:28.189 --> 01:29:28.199 align:start position:0%
I'm reading this it basically says that
 
01:29:30.649 --> 01:29:30.659 align:start position:0%
um prior to
 
01:29:34.070 --> 01:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
a parent having to pay a
 
01:29:37.370 --> 01:29:37.380 align:start position:0%
an additional tuition to a school of
 
01:29:39.590 --> 01:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
their choice
 
01:29:43.070 --> 01:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
that there is an anchor school I'll use
 
01:29:44.689 --> 01:29:44.699 align:start position:0%
that term since we used that earlier
 
01:29:47.330 --> 01:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
today now with Croydon yes there is an
 
01:29:51.229 --> 01:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
anchor school that is available in this
 
01:29:52.910 --> 01:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
case we're basically talking I would
 
01:29:54.830 --> 01:29:54.840 align:start position:0%
assume either middle school or a high
 
01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:55.790 align:start position:0%
assume either middle school or a high
school

01:29:55.790 --> 01:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
that anchor school would be an option
 
01:30:01.129 --> 01:30:01.139 align:start position:0%
for per for parents to choose where they
 
01:30:04.430 --> 01:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
would not have to pay any traditional
 
01:30:06.770 --> 01:30:06.780 align:start position:0%
any tuition additional tuition is that
 
01:30:08.990 --> 01:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
correct that is correct okay thank you
 
01:30:10.610 --> 01:30:10.620 align:start position:0%
very much
 
01:30:11.810 --> 01:30:11.820 align:start position:0%
for the discussion of Representative
 
01:30:15.830 --> 01:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much Mr chair so
 
01:30:17.870 --> 01:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
um would um
 
01:30:21.169 --> 01:30:21.179 align:start position:0%
if uh if the local school board were to
 
01:30:21.179 --> 01:30:24.709 align:start position:0%
if uh if the local school board were to
approve

01:30:24.709 --> 01:30:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:28.510 --> 01:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:31.370 --> 01:30:31.380 align:start position:0%
right approved by the local childhood
 
01:30:32.689 --> 01:30:32.699 align:start position:0%
tuition School approved by the local
 
01:30:34.910 --> 01:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
school board so if the if the local
 
01:30:36.590 --> 01:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
school board were to approve a private
 
01:30:39.290 --> 01:30:39.300 align:start position:0%
school I didn't pick any of them
 
01:30:41.330 --> 01:30:41.340 align:start position:0%
um uh you know St Paul's is right here
 
01:30:42.790 --> 01:30:42.800 align:start position:0%
in Concordia
 
01:30:46.189 --> 01:30:46.199 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah any of those
 
01:30:50.510 --> 01:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
um then um then then what am I correct
 
01:30:54.050 --> 01:30:54.060 align:start position:0%
then what what uh If This Were law this
 
01:30:58.430 --> 01:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
would allow the um uh the the student to
 
01:31:01.729 --> 01:31:01.739 align:start position:0%
take whatever the of the the approved
 
01:31:01.739 --> 01:31:03.050 align:start position:0%
take whatever the of the the approved
budget

01:31:03.050 --> 01:31:03.060 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:31:04.669 --> 01:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
um per pupil
 
01:31:06.290 --> 01:31:06.300 align:start position:0%
um tuition
 
01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:07.990 align:start position:0%
um tuition
cost

01:31:07.990 --> 01:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
cost
 
01:31:10.970 --> 01:31:10.980 align:start position:0%
determined by the school board and use
 
01:31:14.510 --> 01:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
that to pay tuition at Kua or St Paul's
 
01:31:17.570 --> 01:31:17.580 align:start position:0%
or well I think can I clarify it just to
 
01:31:20.450 --> 01:31:20.460 align:start position:0%
make sure we're absolute the the school
 
01:31:23.450 --> 01:31:23.460 align:start position:0%
that the student's going to go to has to
 
01:31:25.010 --> 01:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
be approved
 
01:31:29.510 --> 01:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
by the local board yeah and if the local
 
01:31:33.050 --> 01:31:33.060 align:start position:0%
board may say uh we'll pay it
 
01:31:35.090 --> 01:31:35.100 align:start position:0%
they would pay that difference or they
 
01:31:37.430 --> 01:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
may require the parent so that's a
 
01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
decision that local policy is going to
 
01:31:40.970 --> 01:31:40.980 align:start position:0%
have to decide that and how they're
 
01:31:43.129 --> 01:31:43.139 align:start position:0%
going to do that okay so so further
 
01:31:45.169 --> 01:31:45.179 align:start position:0%
further clarification then to make sure
 
01:31:47.870 --> 01:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding that the the the local
 
01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:49.490 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding that the the the local
board

01:31:49.490 --> 01:31:49.500 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:31:52.669 --> 01:31:52.679 align:start position:0%
um could say all right we will pay the
 
01:31:56.209 --> 01:31:56.219 align:start position:0%
full used tax dollars to pay the full
 
01:31:59.209 --> 01:31:59.219 align:start position:0%
Kua tuition or the full St Paul's
 
01:32:03.649 --> 01:32:03.659 align:start position:0%
tuition or will pay up to what we um
 
01:32:07.010 --> 01:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
what we pay to tuition our students to
 
01:32:08.629 --> 01:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
let's say Newport High School or
 
01:32:10.669 --> 01:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
something like that say it was twenty
 
01:32:12.770 --> 01:32:12.780 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars we'll uh we'll pay up
 
01:32:15.770 --> 01:32:15.780 align:start position:0%
to 20 grand and we'll approve KOA in St
 
01:32:19.189 --> 01:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
Paul's and parents your your um it's up
 
01:32:22.490 --> 01:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
to you to pay the remaining you know 70
 
01:32:27.470 --> 01:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
grand 60 60 000 or whatever it is to to
 
01:32:29.229 --> 01:32:29.239 align:start position:0%
go there is is
 
01:32:32.209 --> 01:32:32.219 align:start position:0%
the basic concept or the school board
 
01:32:35.209 --> 01:32:35.219 align:start position:0%
can pay the whole toll free
 
01:32:37.970 --> 01:32:37.980 align:start position:0%
you just yeah yeah if they want to you
 
01:32:39.530 --> 01:32:39.540 align:start position:0%
know of course you know we've had
 
01:32:42.290 --> 01:32:42.300 align:start position:0%
situations where in a community south of
 
01:32:44.149 --> 01:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
Orford where we had Parents saying well
 
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
I want my student to go to St J Academy
 
01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
well the tuition rate to Saint J at that
 
01:32:51.950 --> 01:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
point in time was around sixteen
 
01:32:54.110 --> 01:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars but if you go as a
 
01:32:55.729 --> 01:32:55.739 align:start position:0%
boarding student you're going to be
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
paying seventy thousand dollars of
 
01:32:59.570 --> 01:32:59.580 align:start position:0%
course that particular Community said
 
01:33:01.490 --> 01:33:01.500 align:start position:0%
absolutely not we're not doing that we
 
01:33:03.770 --> 01:33:03.780 align:start position:0%
have a contract with them for tuition
 
01:33:07.010 --> 01:33:07.020 align:start position:0%
not board so we're not going that route
 
01:33:08.629 --> 01:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you're thinking of are
 
01:33:09.830 --> 01:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
we going to end up having to pay for
 
01:33:12.530 --> 01:33:12.540 align:start position:0%
board uh no and we're not going to get
 
01:33:14.870 --> 01:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
in the business of trying to decide
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to just select this private
 
01:33:18.709 --> 01:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
school as that's where all our kids are
 
01:33:20.149 --> 01:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
going to go and we'll pay the difference
 
01:33:25.790 --> 01:33:25.800 align:start position:0%
this is trying to support uh options but
 
01:33:28.070 --> 01:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
the the options are not necessarily
 
01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
private schools most of the situation
 
01:33:33.290 --> 01:33:33.300 align:start position:0%
not the state is dealing with Public
 
01:33:35.390 --> 01:33:35.400 align:start position:0%
Schools where there's you know they have
 
01:33:37.070 --> 01:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
different agreements throughout the
 
01:33:40.010 --> 01:33:40.020 align:start position:0%
state this is widely accepted throughout
 
01:33:41.810 --> 01:33:41.820 align:start position:0%
the state however it's being done very
 
01:33:44.570 --> 01:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
quietly and now the attorneys are saying
 
01:33:46.250 --> 01:33:46.260 align:start position:0%
well you can't do that because you're
 
01:33:48.290 --> 01:33:48.300 align:start position:0%
you're discriminating against the parent
 
01:33:50.750 --> 01:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have the money to send the
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
child to school X well let me take can I
 
01:33:55.250 --> 01:33:55.260 align:start position:0%
take it a little further the follow-up
 
01:33:57.830 --> 01:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you so so
 
01:34:01.430 --> 01:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
um let's say uh I live in I live in
 
01:34:04.370 --> 01:34:04.380 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton I do live in Hopkinton and uh
 
01:34:05.930 --> 01:34:05.940 align:start position:0%
obviously I was I was chair of the
 
01:34:07.370 --> 01:34:07.380 align:start position:0%
school board for a lot of years and our
 
01:34:07.380 --> 01:34:08.330 align:start position:0%
school board for a lot of years and our
kids

01:34:08.330 --> 01:34:08.340 align:start position:0%
kids
 
01:34:10.250 --> 01:34:10.260 align:start position:0%
um went uh went through the Hopkins
 
01:34:12.169 --> 01:34:12.179 align:start position:0%
school district but let's say
 
01:34:14.090 --> 01:34:14.100 align:start position:0%
um let's say I'm a parent in Hopkinton
 
01:34:16.850 --> 01:34:16.860 align:start position:0%
and I'm and I'm currently um sending my
 
01:34:20.570 --> 01:34:20.580 align:start position:0%
my child to Saint Paul's and I'm paying
 
01:34:22.850 --> 01:34:22.860 align:start position:0%
full Freight tuition at St Paul's and I
 
01:34:25.729 --> 01:34:25.739 align:start position:0%
I I I don't know what it is now would
 
01:34:27.709 --> 01:34:27.719 align:start position:0%
seventy five thousand dollars a year be
 
01:34:30.709 --> 01:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
out of the out of the realm so I'm
 
01:34:32.270 --> 01:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
paying seventy five thousand dollars a
 
01:34:35.570 --> 01:34:35.580 align:start position:0%
year and um and they're in um St Paul's
 
01:34:37.430 --> 01:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
I think calls their kids like fourth
 
01:34:39.530 --> 01:34:39.540 align:start position:0%
fifth and sixth formers but but I'll
 
01:34:43.129 --> 01:34:43.139 align:start position:0%
just go with the the sophomore junior
 
01:34:46.430 --> 01:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
um um uh type of nomenclature so let's
 
01:34:48.709 --> 01:34:48.719 align:start position:0%
say my son's a junior
 
01:34:51.709 --> 01:34:51.719 align:start position:0%
um or my child's a junior at St Paul's
 
01:34:55.129 --> 01:34:55.139 align:start position:0%
I'm spending 75 000 a year
 
01:34:58.189 --> 01:34:58.199 align:start position:0%
um uh I could go to my school board and
 
01:35:00.050 --> 01:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
um and say hey could you put Saint
 
01:35:03.950 --> 01:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
Paul's on the list and then uh send me a
 
01:35:06.410 --> 01:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
check for um for twenty thousand dollars
 
01:35:09.290 --> 01:35:09.300 align:start position:0%
and uh and I can use that to pay my
 
01:35:11.930 --> 01:35:11.940 align:start position:0%
tuition how how would If This Were law
 
01:35:15.290 --> 01:35:15.300 align:start position:0%
How would how would I mean is is that
 
01:35:18.709 --> 01:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
what one of the intents of I mean
 
01:35:20.270 --> 01:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
something that could happen if this were
 
01:35:21.110 --> 01:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
a while
 
01:35:24.410 --> 01:35:24.420 align:start position:0%
it has to be approved by the locals I'm
 
01:35:26.030 --> 01:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
saying that so I go to I go to the
 
01:35:27.770 --> 01:35:27.780 align:start position:0%
school board and I say hey won't you
 
01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
would you approve St Paul's I mean don't
 
01:35:32.390 --> 01:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
we want our kids to get St Paul's it's
 
01:35:34.189 --> 01:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
not that easy you have to your of course
 
01:35:35.570 --> 01:35:35.580 align:start position:0%
your agreements and your money is
 
01:35:37.669 --> 01:35:37.679 align:start position:0%
already in the year your operating
 
01:35:39.649 --> 01:35:39.659 align:start position:0%
budget that you have so that's been done
 
01:35:42.950 --> 01:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
based prior to this so but it could
 
01:35:44.570 --> 01:35:44.580 align:start position:0%
happen right
 
01:35:46.370 --> 01:35:46.380 align:start position:0%
I mean it's basically opening the door
 
01:35:49.149 --> 01:35:49.159 align:start position:0%
if there is a community that's out there
 
01:35:51.950 --> 01:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
that will send the kids to holderness
 
01:35:53.689 --> 01:35:53.699 align:start position:0%
and pay for holderness and room and
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
board I'd be glad to send my grandkids
 
01:35:58.310 --> 01:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
there uh so I'll just tell me where that
 
01:36:01.189 --> 01:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
Community is but I do not think that
 
01:36:03.290 --> 01:36:03.300 align:start position:0%
that's going to be the case here I think
 
01:36:06.050 --> 01:36:06.060 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do is uh maintain
 
01:36:07.790 --> 01:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
situations like we've had in the past
 
01:36:09.649 --> 01:36:09.659 align:start position:0%
with Freiburg Academy where kids from
 
01:36:12.530 --> 01:36:12.540 align:start position:0%
the Conway are have gone that way or in
 
01:36:15.229 --> 01:36:15.239 align:start position:0%
where I am where they uh have the the
 
01:36:17.209 --> 01:36:17.219 align:start position:0%
choice of various schools and that
 
01:36:19.550 --> 01:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
choice in the rural areas is very very
 
01:36:22.610 --> 01:36:22.620 align:start position:0%
important we don't have Charter Schools
 
01:36:24.530 --> 01:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
other than the one that's a wonderful
 
01:36:26.270 --> 01:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
one up in Littleton but there's only one
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
or two seats available and that from the
 
01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
area where I live for the you know that
 
01:36:32.770 --> 01:36:32.780 align:start position:0%
Regional there's a lot of folks living
 
01:36:36.649 --> 01:36:36.659 align:start position:0%
so we we also are residing and we have
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
but St J Academy offers things that
 
01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
um uh you won't find at Oxbow you won't
 
01:36:44.270 --> 01:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
find at Rivendell you won't find it
 
01:36:47.330 --> 01:36:47.340 align:start position:0%
Woods still and if you want a fine
 
01:36:49.370 --> 01:36:49.380 align:start position:0%
theater program you probably would want
 
01:36:51.410 --> 01:36:51.420 align:start position:0%
to go to Oxbow that's or in Bradford
 
01:36:53.870 --> 01:36:53.880 align:start position:0%
Vermont if you want to have a division
 
01:36:56.209 --> 01:36:56.219 align:start position:0%
four basketball championship you know
 
01:36:57.770 --> 01:36:57.780 align:start position:0%
you go to Woodsville which they just won
 
01:37:00.770 --> 01:37:00.780 align:start position:0%
the other day if you want to have a a
 
01:37:03.050 --> 01:37:03.060 align:start position:0%
program that's really excellent in other
 
01:37:06.350 --> 01:37:06.360 align:start position:0%
aspects like Rivendell has you would go
 
01:37:09.169 --> 01:37:09.179 align:start position:0%
that direction it provides those options
 
01:37:11.689 --> 01:37:11.699 align:start position:0%
for for it's it's a it's a choice
 
01:37:13.430 --> 01:37:13.440 align:start position:0%
program but through two-ish has nothing
 
01:37:15.530 --> 01:37:15.540 align:start position:0%
new vouchers has nothing to do with any
 
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
of that this is the traditional way
 
01:37:22.990 --> 01:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:25.250 --> 01:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
no no thank you thank you I appreciate
 
01:37:28.970 --> 01:37:28.980 align:start position:0%
that Mr chair but but uh but don't
 
01:37:31.189 --> 01:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
um families and students already have
 
01:37:33.709 --> 01:37:33.719 align:start position:0%
those options I mean I hear from from
 
01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
families in Hopkinton that they move to
 
01:37:38.750 --> 01:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
Hopkinton because of the schools and um
 
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
so I mean don't those don't those
 
01:37:42.890 --> 01:37:42.900 align:start position:0%
options already exist
 
01:37:45.770 --> 01:37:45.780 align:start position:0%
they do that's why people from for
 
01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:48.239 align:start position:0%
example the area around Hanover and
 
01:37:49.910 --> 01:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
Lebanon that are working there at
 
01:37:52.070 --> 01:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock choose to live in
 
01:37:53.810 --> 01:37:53.820 align:start position:0%
paramount because it's right on the
 
01:37:55.189 --> 01:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
interstate highway there and they can
 
01:37:57.229 --> 01:37:57.239 align:start position:0%
zap down in 30 minutes and be down and
 
01:37:59.209 --> 01:37:59.219 align:start position:0%
have her but they also know by coming
 
01:38:01.090 --> 01:38:01.100 align:start position:0%
there I'm going to have the opportunity
 
01:38:04.129 --> 01:38:04.139 align:start position:0%
to have my child go to either Thetford
 
01:38:06.229 --> 01:38:06.239 align:start position:0%
Academy or a saint Jay or all these
 
01:38:09.350 --> 01:38:09.360 align:start position:0%
other schools that's that's the draw for
 
01:38:11.390 --> 01:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
Piermont right now
 
01:38:14.209 --> 01:38:14.219 align:start position:0%
um now when when Saint Jay jumped their
 
01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
their tuition by a thousand dollars
 
01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
which you know I perhaps if you did the
 
01:38:21.470 --> 01:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
calculation if they changed that
 
01:38:24.110 --> 01:38:24.120 align:start position:0%
percentage maybe 19 then you would have
 
01:38:26.270 --> 01:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
that still in the cards but we have
 
01:38:28.189 --> 01:38:28.199 align:start position:0%
students attending there and that
 
01:38:31.550 --> 01:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
tuition has occurred and now as a
 
01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
sophomore you might end up having to go
 
01:38:35.990 --> 01:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
somewhere else because it's above the
 
01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:37.490 align:start position:0%
somewhere else because it's above the
cap

01:38:37.490 --> 01:38:37.500 align:start position:0%
cap
 
01:38:39.770 --> 01:38:39.780 align:start position:0%
and in that you know once it's above the
 
01:38:43.070 --> 01:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
cap then unless the parent can pay that
 
01:38:45.110 --> 01:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
difference and the pyrmont's not willing
 
01:38:46.370 --> 01:38:46.380 align:start position:0%
to pay that difference you're going to
 
01:38:48.229 --> 01:38:48.239 align:start position:0%
have kids having to opt somewhere else
 
01:38:49.550 --> 01:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
to go to school
 
01:38:53.450 --> 01:38:53.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:54.890 --> 01:38:54.900 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:38:56.030 --> 01:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to ask this question
 
01:38:58.870 --> 01:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
because I live in an SAU and the
 
01:39:01.550 --> 01:39:01.560 align:start position:0%
children in my community we only serve
 
01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
up to eighth grade and then we have an
 
01:39:05.390 --> 01:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
agreement with bources high school and
 
01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
that's where we send our children so I'm
 
01:39:08.450 --> 01:39:08.460 align:start position:0%
trying to understand how this would
 
01:39:10.610 --> 01:39:10.620 align:start position:0%
affect my district
 
01:39:12.830 --> 01:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
um right now they only have one school
 
01:39:15.110 --> 01:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
choice and that's Portsmouth if
 
01:39:17.629 --> 01:39:17.639 align:start position:0%
something like this gets passed wouldn't
 
01:39:19.330 --> 01:39:19.340 align:start position:0%
that encourage
 
01:39:22.070 --> 01:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
families in in my district and a lot of
 
01:39:24.950 --> 01:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
them do as choose private school at that
 
01:39:26.330 --> 01:39:26.340 align:start position:0%
point and send their kids to Phillips
 
01:39:29.810 --> 01:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
Exeter and right now it's not approved
 
01:39:32.570 --> 01:39:32.580 align:start position:0%
by our board as you're saying but
 
01:39:34.250 --> 01:39:34.260 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that put pressure on the school
 
01:39:37.729 --> 01:39:37.739 align:start position:0%
board at some point if we this law is
 
01:39:40.490 --> 01:39:40.500 align:start position:0%
passed to have people come to our board
 
01:39:43.189 --> 01:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
and maybe take legal action to have us
 
01:39:45.649 --> 01:39:45.659 align:start position:0%
approve that school and if that's the
 
01:39:48.490 --> 01:39:48.500 align:start position:0%
case then our um like our
 
01:39:50.750 --> 01:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
we the tuition price that we pay for
 
01:39:52.850 --> 01:39:52.860 align:start position:0%
prices of high school would actually
 
01:39:55.129 --> 01:39:55.139 align:start position:0%
increase our budget for the number of
 
01:39:56.990 --> 01:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
schools so they're we're not currently
 
01:39:59.209 --> 01:39:59.219 align:start position:0%
paying for it it wouldn't change the
 
01:40:00.950 --> 01:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
costs above what you're paying for a
 
01:40:03.590 --> 01:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
tuition to the current school that
 
01:40:04.970 --> 01:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
you're using
 
01:40:08.090 --> 01:40:08.100 align:start position:0%
that would be your anchor school now if
 
01:40:09.950 --> 01:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
another person came and said I'd like to
 
01:40:12.649 --> 01:40:12.659 align:start position:0%
go over here to this one first of all
 
01:40:14.270 --> 01:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
the board would have to approve if they
 
01:40:16.129 --> 01:40:16.139 align:start position:0%
don't approve it and there's no legal
 
01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
action you can take because the board's
 
01:40:19.310 --> 01:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
responsible for providing an adequate
 
01:40:20.870 --> 01:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an adequate education
 
01:40:23.209 --> 01:40:23.219 align:start position:0%
for a student we provide that they're
 
01:40:25.250 --> 01:40:25.260 align:start position:0%
going to this present High School
 
01:40:27.890 --> 01:40:27.900 align:start position:0%
uh but if they wanted to get in the
 
01:40:30.229 --> 01:40:30.239 align:start position:0%
option they could have a contract an
 
01:40:33.290 --> 01:40:33.300 align:start position:0%
agreement with the other school and they
 
01:40:35.390 --> 01:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
would have to settle on what the tuition
 
01:40:38.270 --> 01:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
rate's going to be uh most likely they
 
01:40:40.129 --> 01:40:40.139 align:start position:0%
wouldn't increase any higher than what
 
01:40:42.110 --> 01:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
they you're presently paying it's not
 
01:40:43.970 --> 01:40:43.980 align:start position:0%
going to jump their budget
 
01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
follow yes thank you
 
01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:48.719 align:start position:0%
um so so what I guess what I'm trying to
 
01:40:51.350 --> 01:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
say is there's quite a number of schools
 
01:40:53.870 --> 01:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
in our community of students in our
 
01:40:56.209 --> 01:40:56.219 align:start position:0%
community they are currently going to
 
01:40:59.629 --> 01:40:59.639 align:start position:0%
private schools and we're not paying for
 
01:41:01.970 --> 01:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
so what would happen is our budgets
 
01:41:03.850 --> 01:41:03.860 align:start position:0%
would increase
 
01:41:07.490 --> 01:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
substantially if if if something went
 
01:41:09.590 --> 01:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
through and and that choice was made
 
01:41:11.390 --> 01:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
that we were going to provide that so
 
01:41:13.250 --> 01:41:13.260 align:start position:0%
say we're paying twenty thousand dollars
 
01:41:14.689 --> 01:41:14.699 align:start position:0%
to support since high school per student
 
01:41:17.510 --> 01:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden 10 more students
 
01:41:19.189 --> 01:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
that are currently in private school
 
01:41:21.649 --> 01:41:21.659 align:start position:0%
decide that they want that option then
 
01:41:23.530 --> 01:41:23.540 align:start position:0%
that increases our budget
 
01:41:25.669 --> 01:41:25.679 align:start position:0%
substantially those students in the
 
01:41:27.229 --> 01:41:27.239 align:start position:0%
other schools are not part of your adma
 
01:41:29.689 --> 01:41:29.699 align:start position:0%
right now they may be part of your admr
 
01:41:33.110 --> 01:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
but they're not you're once they go
 
01:41:35.629 --> 01:41:35.639 align:start position:0%
there they're part of your adma and you
 
01:41:37.669 --> 01:41:37.679 align:start position:0%
are receiving monies for those students
 
01:41:41.390 --> 01:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
too but it would be the same I doubt
 
01:41:43.010 --> 01:41:43.020 align:start position:0%
very seriously the scenario you're
 
01:41:45.550 --> 01:41:45.560 align:start position:0%
trying to refer what would occur
 
01:41:49.430 --> 01:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
I can't see that happening thank you
 
01:41:51.410 --> 01:41:51.420 align:start position:0%
uh represent Tanner
 
01:41:52.729 --> 01:41:52.739 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:41:52.739 --> 01:41:54.290 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

01:41:54.290 --> 01:41:54.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:57.470 --> 01:41:57.480 align:start position:0%
when the bill came uh before us before
 
01:42:01.129 --> 01:42:01.139 align:start position:0%
about allowing schools that
 
01:42:02.930 --> 01:42:02.940 align:start position:0%
communities that had schools to a
 
01:42:06.649 --> 01:42:06.659 align:start position:0%
certain uh level and then tuition to
 
01:42:08.990 --> 01:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
other schools and we made the provision
 
01:42:11.330 --> 01:42:11.340 align:start position:0%
now that's in in law and I actually
 
01:42:13.550 --> 01:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
voted for it where the school board has
 
01:42:15.530 --> 01:42:15.540 align:start position:0%
to approve
 
01:42:17.390 --> 01:42:17.400 align:start position:0%
um the schools that that they're
 
01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:18.430 align:start position:0%
um the schools that that they're
choosing

01:42:18.430 --> 01:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
choosing
 
01:42:21.229 --> 01:42:21.239 align:start position:0%
at that time I was representing Croydon
 
01:42:24.410 --> 01:42:24.420 align:start position:0%
as one of my floaterials and what
 
01:42:27.410 --> 01:42:27.420 align:start position:0%
happened consequently in Croydon in case
 
01:42:30.290 --> 01:42:30.300 align:start position:0%
you didn't hear is that they cut the
 
01:42:34.370 --> 01:42:34.380 align:start position:0%
budget okay they cut the budget in half
 
01:42:38.510 --> 01:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
and they cut it so low that it was much
 
01:42:41.570 --> 01:42:41.580 align:start position:0%
lower than what the tuition rate was for
 
01:42:44.570 --> 01:42:44.580 align:start position:0%
the nearby public school Newport School
 
01:42:47.870 --> 01:42:47.880 align:start position:0%
the only option students had or parents
 
01:42:50.510 --> 01:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
had to send their students to a school
 
01:42:52.430 --> 01:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
board approved School
 
01:42:55.090 --> 01:42:55.100 align:start position:0%
was a school that was a private school
 
01:42:58.430 --> 01:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
that had substantially less tuition than
 
01:42:59.810 --> 01:42:59.820 align:start position:0%
the public school
 
01:43:02.990 --> 01:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
If the parents wanted to send their kids
 
01:43:05.090 --> 01:43:05.100 align:start position:0%
to the public school and many of them
 
01:43:07.550 --> 01:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
had now Croydon only goes to fourth
 
01:43:10.129 --> 01:43:10.139 align:start position:0%
grade so they there were students that
 
01:43:11.950 --> 01:43:11.960 align:start position:0%
had been in the Newport public school
 
01:43:16.970 --> 01:43:16.980 align:start position:0%
you know for six seven years uh going
 
01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
through a program going through Career
 
01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
Technical Ed that they had at the school
 
01:43:23.810 --> 01:43:23.820 align:start position:0%
uh participating on the football team
 
01:43:28.010 --> 01:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
whatever uh now had to pay the money
 
01:43:30.890 --> 01:43:30.900 align:start position:0%
over and above what the school board had
 
01:43:33.470 --> 01:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
said as their top and we know that other
 
01:43:35.450 --> 01:43:35.460 align:start position:0%
school boards are set in caps you you
 
01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
said that yourself
 
01:43:41.270 --> 01:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
so I'm asking what in this I I feel like
 
01:43:43.129 --> 01:43:43.139 align:start position:0%
this bill is just going to throw the
 
01:43:45.050 --> 01:43:45.060 align:start position:0%
door wide open
 
01:43:47.930 --> 01:43:47.940 align:start position:0%
um for abuses like this or the abuses
 
01:43:50.810 --> 01:43:50.820 align:start position:0%
that representative alboni spoke of I
 
01:43:53.149 --> 01:43:53.159 align:start position:0%
mean one of the things we found with the
 
01:43:55.490 --> 01:43:55.500 align:start position:0%
efas was that the vast majority of
 
01:43:58.310 --> 01:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
people that took the advantage of the
 
01:44:00.890 --> 01:44:00.900 align:start position:0%
vouchers were people who were already
 
01:44:02.750 --> 01:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
sending their kids to private or
 
01:44:05.629 --> 01:44:05.639 align:start position:0%
parochial schools and it in fact
 
01:44:09.709 --> 01:44:09.719 align:start position:0%
increased what the state's um
 
01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
burden was tax burden or and essentially
 
01:44:16.070 --> 01:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
through the resources of taxpayers at
 
01:44:19.010 --> 01:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
some level uh began so I'm just I'm
 
01:44:21.350 --> 01:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
really afraid to to
 
01:44:23.990 --> 01:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
um open the door to this I feel like
 
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
it's opening Pandora's door to either go
 
01:44:31.430 --> 01:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative balboni's way or
 
01:44:34.070 --> 01:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
representative Damon's way from Croydon
 
01:44:37.129 --> 01:44:37.139 align:start position:0%
so it right now
 
01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
I I assume the reason we have to have
 
01:44:42.470 --> 01:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
that is that doing that is illegal
 
01:44:44.390 --> 01:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
through the AG's office
 
01:44:47.090 --> 01:44:47.100 align:start position:0%
and and you said it was a gray area so
 
01:44:49.129 --> 01:44:49.139 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming the reason we have this is
 
01:44:53.570 --> 01:44:53.580 align:start position:0%
to codify it so that there's no no gray
 
01:44:55.850 --> 01:44:55.860 align:start position:0%
area left that's what we're trying to do
 
01:44:58.729 --> 01:44:58.739 align:start position:0%
is codify this this is this is occurring
 
01:45:00.770 --> 01:45:00.780 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and when you talk
 
01:45:02.930 --> 01:45:02.940 align:start position:0%
about Croydon yeah you you've tuition
 
01:45:04.910 --> 01:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
before with Newport you've tuition with
 
01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:06.109 align:start position:0%
before with Newport you've tuition with
centipede

01:45:06.109 --> 01:45:06.119 align:start position:0%
centipede
 
01:45:08.750 --> 01:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
you've tuitioned with Kua you have
 
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
tuition with the Montessori School
 
01:45:13.010 --> 01:45:13.020 align:start position:0%
all those options have been available
 
01:45:15.770 --> 01:45:15.780 align:start position:0%
and but it's up to your local board to
 
01:45:18.770 --> 01:45:18.780 align:start position:0%
make that decision uh this is not going
 
01:45:21.950 --> 01:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
to change the cost of doing business uh
 
01:45:24.530 --> 01:45:24.540 align:start position:0%
at all beyond what the cost is for that
 
01:45:26.450 --> 01:45:26.460 align:start position:0%
anchor school we'll call it the anchor
 
01:45:28.729 --> 01:45:28.739 align:start position:0%
School whatever that tuition rate is
 
01:45:31.030 --> 01:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
that's what you're going to be paying
 
01:45:33.649 --> 01:45:33.659 align:start position:0%
for your students and in your
 
01:45:35.990 --> 01:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
responsible for all students basically
 
01:45:38.209 --> 01:45:38.219 align:start position:0%
living in your District if somebody
 
01:45:40.010 --> 01:45:40.020 align:start position:0%
wants to come back to public school I'd
 
01:45:41.209 --> 01:45:41.219 align:start position:0%
welcome they'll come back to Public
 
01:45:47.510 --> 01:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
Schools it does when we say when when
 
01:45:49.490 --> 01:45:49.500 align:start position:0%
you give that little explanation and I
 
01:45:52.609 --> 01:45:52.619 align:start position:0%
look at what has happened in Croydon
 
01:45:55.310 --> 01:45:55.320 align:start position:0%
is there a provision in there that that
 
01:45:57.890 --> 01:45:57.900 align:start position:0%
at least one of the schools that has to
 
01:46:00.050 --> 01:46:00.060 align:start position:0%
be fully paid for so that the student
 
01:46:02.689 --> 01:46:02.699 align:start position:0%
gets a free and adequate public
 
01:46:10.070 --> 01:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:13.250 --> 01:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
it has to be a school that's approved by
 
01:46:16.850 --> 01:46:16.860 align:start position:0%
your local board and what we have here
 
01:46:19.010 --> 01:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
is that there has to be at least one
 
01:46:20.990 --> 01:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
school that provides the options that
 
01:46:22.310 --> 01:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
you're looking for
 
01:46:25.070 --> 01:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
I can't support this unless we have
 
01:46:27.830 --> 01:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
specifically in there based on my
 
01:46:29.570 --> 01:46:29.580 align:start position:0%
personal experience and the experience
 
01:46:32.390 --> 01:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
of the citizens of Croydon
 
01:46:36.410 --> 01:46:36.420 align:start position:0%
that it be that the tuition can be no
 
01:46:38.270 --> 01:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
lower than at least
 
01:46:41.209 --> 01:46:41.219 align:start position:0%
an option for a public school that
 
01:46:43.850 --> 01:46:43.860 align:start position:0%
provides a free and adequate education
 
01:46:46.609 --> 01:46:46.619 align:start position:0%
be it the public charter school or the
 
01:46:48.530 --> 01:46:48.540 align:start position:0%
public school
 
01:46:53.930 --> 01:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:58.189 --> 01:46:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:59.689 --> 01:46:59.699 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:47:02.570 --> 01:47:02.580 align:start position:0%
following up on representative Tanner's
 
01:47:04.550 --> 01:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
discussion around Croydon which is where
 
01:47:05.930 --> 01:47:05.940 align:start position:0%
I live
 
01:47:08.629 --> 01:47:08.639 align:start position:0%
but also noting that
 
01:47:10.910 --> 01:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
there are many towns including at least
 
01:47:13.609 --> 01:47:13.619 align:start position:0%
two three others in my district that
 
01:47:16.790 --> 01:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
this applies to so I think this is a
 
01:47:18.709 --> 01:47:18.719 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty substantive bill in terms
 
01:47:20.030 --> 01:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
of the number of communities and towns
 
01:47:22.729 --> 01:47:22.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:26.530 --> 01:47:26.540 align:start position:0%
I do not read this to say that
 
01:47:30.050 --> 01:47:30.060 align:start position:0%
the town would be obligated
 
01:47:32.990 --> 01:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
for the school that is the anchor school
 
01:47:35.750 --> 01:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
to be a public school
 
01:47:39.229 --> 01:47:39.239 align:start position:0%
and that does concern me
 
01:47:41.510 --> 01:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going to follow chairman lad's
 
01:47:45.430 --> 01:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
example and use a specific example so
 
01:47:48.229 --> 01:47:48.239 align:start position:0%
according has K to four
 
01:47:51.470 --> 01:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
many of our fifth through 8th graders go
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
to the Montessori School in Newport
 
01:47:55.370 --> 01:47:55.380 align:start position:0%
which is a wonderful School wonderful
 
01:47:58.490 --> 01:47:58.500 align:start position:0%
education well respected
 
01:48:00.770 --> 01:48:00.780 align:start position:0%
it is less than ten thousand dollars
 
01:48:03.290 --> 01:48:03.300 align:start position:0%
tuition per year
 
01:48:05.990 --> 01:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
the kids who don't go there mostly go to
 
01:48:08.570 --> 01:48:08.580 align:start position:0%
Newports some go to Summit
 
01:48:11.149 --> 01:48:11.159 align:start position:0%
and either of those schools it's now in
 
01:48:13.070 --> 01:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
the ballpark of nineteen twenty thousand
 
01:48:16.250 --> 01:48:16.260 align:start position:0%
dollars a year the way I read this bill
 
01:48:18.470 --> 01:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
the town of Croydon could decide that
 
01:48:20.390 --> 01:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
the anchor school for fifth to 8th
 
01:48:22.070 --> 01:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
graders because the Montessori ends at
 
01:48:24.050 --> 01:48:24.060 align:start position:0%
eighth grade
 
01:48:26.450 --> 01:48:26.460 align:start position:0%
Montessori school and there is no option
 
01:48:28.189 --> 01:48:28.199 align:start position:0%
for parents to go to public schools
 
01:48:32.030 --> 01:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
without me and they'd be paying you ever
 
01:48:33.590 --> 01:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
take ten thousand dollars out of pocket
 
01:48:35.510 --> 01:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
per student per year
 
01:48:38.149 --> 01:48:38.159 align:start position:0%
I totally agree that it needs to specify
 
01:48:42.229 --> 01:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
that there is a public school option
 
01:48:43.910 --> 01:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:48:47.209 --> 01:48:47.219 align:start position:0%
cap is based on
 
01:48:47.219 --> 01:48:49.070 align:start position:0%
cap is based on
um

01:48:49.070 --> 01:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:52.370 --> 01:48:52.380 align:start position:0%
so Interruption lead
 
01:48:55.070 --> 01:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
if you read on line five which is
 
01:48:57.530 --> 01:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
already current law
 
01:48:59.390 --> 01:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
if there is no public school for the
 
01:49:01.070 --> 01:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
child's grade in the residential
 
01:49:03.169 --> 01:49:03.179 align:start position:0%
district the school board May contract
 
01:49:04.850 --> 01:49:04.860 align:start position:0%
with another Public School in another
 
01:49:07.010 --> 01:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
school district or with any private
 
01:49:08.930 --> 01:49:08.940 align:start position:0%
school that has been approved as a
 
01:49:11.689 --> 01:49:11.699 align:start position:0%
tuition School tuition program by the
 
01:49:13.609 --> 01:49:13.619 align:start position:0%
school board
 
01:49:16.070 --> 01:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
so that is existing when you're talking
 
01:49:17.990 --> 01:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
about Santa Fe Sunapee said we're going
 
01:49:20.510 --> 01:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
to take this kid but not that kid
 
01:49:22.970 --> 01:49:22.980 align:start position:0%
they were very specific on who was going
 
01:49:25.250 --> 01:49:25.260 align:start position:0%
to go to their school new part was your
 
01:49:29.149 --> 01:49:29.159 align:start position:0%
your your anchor school and so a student
 
01:49:31.189 --> 01:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
there would definitely have the ability
 
01:49:34.010 --> 01:49:34.020 align:start position:0%
to go and receive the an opportunity for
 
01:49:36.530 --> 01:49:36.540 align:start position:0%
an adequate education for all the grades
 
01:49:38.750 --> 01:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
are in at Newport
 
01:49:41.270 --> 01:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
they may not have received that in some
 
01:49:43.850 --> 01:49:43.860 align:start position:0%
other school but those were our options
 
01:49:47.030 --> 01:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
and the option here is that you know if
 
01:49:48.290 --> 01:49:48.300 align:start position:0%
you wanted that you would send them the
 
01:49:49.910 --> 01:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
Newport the same thing here if you want
 
01:49:52.970 --> 01:49:52.980 align:start position:0%
the option in in for example uh Piermont
 
01:49:54.410 --> 01:49:54.420 align:start position:0%
you have the option of sending them
 
01:49:58.729 --> 01:49:58.739 align:start position:0%
either to Rivendell to Woodsville or to
 
01:50:01.970 --> 01:50:01.980 align:start position:0%
Oxbow or up to the time that the tuition
 
01:50:04.370 --> 01:50:04.380 align:start position:0%
cap was increased and it went a little
 
01:50:06.169 --> 01:50:06.179 align:start position:0%
bit over and thank goodness the
 
01:50:08.450 --> 01:50:08.460 align:start position:0%
Headmaster up at St J Academy and when I
 
01:50:11.450 --> 01:50:11.460 align:start position:0%
worked with them said we will try to
 
01:50:13.189 --> 01:50:13.199 align:start position:0%
work with your students that are
 
01:50:15.950 --> 01:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
currently involved and and the board did
 
01:50:19.430 --> 01:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
work with them on that but uh but
 
01:50:21.290 --> 01:50:21.300 align:start position:0%
because it's a little higher the parents
 
01:50:24.530 --> 01:50:24.540 align:start position:0%
are not saying can we continue to have
 
01:50:27.290 --> 01:50:27.300 align:start position:0%
our students you know go there some of
 
01:50:29.390 --> 01:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
it as a result of like and landf where
 
01:50:31.430 --> 01:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
they go to profile they only go there
 
01:50:33.830 --> 01:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
because the The Adult and Family works
 
01:50:36.169 --> 01:50:36.179 align:start position:0%
there and it makes it easier on the
 
01:50:36.179 --> 01:50:37.330 align:start position:0%
there and it makes it easier on the
parent

01:50:37.330 --> 01:50:37.340 align:start position:0%
parent
 
01:50:41.270 --> 01:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
so uh I can't understand why there is an
 
01:50:43.070 --> 01:50:43.080 align:start position:0%
issue with this this is occurring
 
01:50:44.870 --> 01:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
basically in many school districts
 
01:50:47.990 --> 01:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
around the state right now and it's uh
 
01:50:50.930 --> 01:50:50.940 align:start position:0%
one which is in the best interest of of
 
01:50:53.930 --> 01:50:53.940 align:start position:0%
the student well
 
01:50:57.290 --> 01:50:57.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair both Mr chairs
 
01:50:57.300 --> 01:50:58.970 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair both Mr chairs
um

01:50:58.970 --> 01:50:58.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:02.030 --> 01:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
understand what you read that is the
 
01:51:04.250 --> 01:51:04.260 align:start position:0%
current law and I agree that this is
 
01:51:06.410 --> 01:51:06.420 align:start position:0%
happening already in a lot of
 
01:51:06.420 --> 01:51:07.189 align:start position:0%
happening already in a lot of
um

01:51:07.189 --> 01:51:07.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:10.129 --> 01:51:10.139 align:start position:0%
schools towns however
 
01:51:12.410 --> 01:51:12.420 align:start position:0%
what is also happening right now again
 
01:51:14.990 --> 01:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
using the Croydon example
 
01:51:17.390 --> 01:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
is that our current School Board does
 
01:51:19.930 --> 01:51:19.940 align:start position:0%
not want to pay what Newport is charging
 
01:51:21.770 --> 01:51:21.780 align:start position:0%
somebody's actually less than Newport
 
01:51:21.780 --> 01:51:23.990 align:start position:0%
somebody's actually less than Newport
now

01:51:23.990 --> 01:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:51:26.930 --> 01:51:26.940 align:start position:0%
and so they are trying to make it so
 
01:51:26.940 --> 01:51:27.890 align:start position:0%
and so they are trying to make it so
that

01:51:27.890 --> 01:51:27.900 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:51:29.990 --> 01:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
they will cap tuition at a level that
 
01:51:34.609 --> 01:51:34.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:39.050 --> 01:51:39.060 align:start position:0%
I don't see how this bill addresses that
 
01:51:42.770 --> 01:51:42.780 align:start position:0%
because in the new part
 
01:51:48.830 --> 01:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
the line 13 to 15. it does not specify
 
01:51:50.570 --> 01:51:50.580 align:start position:0%
Public School
 
01:51:53.270 --> 01:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
so it could be a private school
 
01:51:55.310 --> 01:51:55.320 align:start position:0%
that would be the town's anchor school
 
01:51:58.790 --> 01:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:02.629 --> 01:52:02.639 align:start position:0%
yes but that is current law
 
01:52:05.330 --> 01:52:05.340 align:start position:0%
the private school is in current law
 
01:52:09.770 --> 01:52:09.780 align:start position:0%
here and the reference to Croydon
 
01:52:12.649 --> 01:52:12.659 align:start position:0%
it says with any private school that has
 
01:52:14.870 --> 01:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
been approved as a school tuition
 
01:52:17.629 --> 01:52:17.639 align:start position:0%
program the local board has the
 
01:52:19.729 --> 01:52:19.739 align:start position:0%
responsibility to ensure that every
 
01:52:21.770 --> 01:52:21.780 align:start position:0%
student they have has an opportunity to
 
01:52:24.229 --> 01:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
an adequate education and that would be
 
01:52:26.090 --> 01:52:26.100 align:start position:0%
one of the criteria that they'd have to
 
01:52:28.550 --> 01:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
do if that private school were the only
 
01:52:30.770 --> 01:52:30.780 align:start position:0%
anchor or the only school they had an
 
01:52:32.750 --> 01:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
agreement with they would have to
 
01:52:34.729 --> 01:52:34.739 align:start position:0%
provide the opportunity for an adequate
 
01:52:37.010 --> 01:52:37.020 align:start position:0%
education and of course they would have
 
01:52:39.050 --> 01:52:39.060 align:start position:0%
to do it at the amount of money that the
 
01:52:40.850 --> 01:52:40.860 align:start position:0%
local board was going to approve if not
 
01:52:43.189 --> 01:52:43.199 align:start position:0%
the local board as a case through sex or
 
01:52:46.129 --> 01:52:46.139 align:start position:0%
K-8 would have to seek a high school a
 
01:52:47.930 --> 01:52:47.940 align:start position:0%
public school or another school in the
 
01:52:49.430 --> 01:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
state which would meet what they're
 
01:52:53.330 --> 01:52:53.340 align:start position:0%
trying to do using the issue of Croydon
 
01:52:55.850 --> 01:52:55.860 align:start position:0%
I can't accept what that Croydon board
 
01:52:58.850 --> 01:52:58.860 align:start position:0%
did cutting the budget in half
 
01:53:00.709 --> 01:53:00.719 align:start position:0%
from one point what eight million
 
01:53:03.050 --> 01:53:03.060 align:start position:0%
dollars to less than half of that that
 
01:53:04.790 --> 01:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
is an issue that could have been brought
 
01:53:07.430 --> 01:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
up and and litigation brought forward
 
01:53:08.450 --> 01:53:08.460 align:start position:0%
saying you're not providing an
 
01:53:09.890 --> 01:53:09.900 align:start position:0%
opportunity for an adequate education
 
01:53:11.330 --> 01:53:11.340 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there are people going down
 
01:53:13.910 --> 01:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
that road that situation occurred on
 
01:53:15.470 --> 01:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
Croydon I can't
 
01:53:17.270 --> 01:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
I can't tell you another school school
 
01:53:18.910 --> 01:53:18.920 align:start position:0%
district in the state that's done that
 
01:53:21.950 --> 01:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
Croydon went off the deep edge
 
01:53:25.250 --> 01:53:25.260 align:start position:0%
and so let's not compare this to Croydon
 
01:53:26.810 --> 01:53:26.820 align:start position:0%
let's compare it to what's going on
 
01:53:29.090 --> 01:53:29.100 align:start position:0%
through all these other schools that
 
01:53:31.010 --> 01:53:31.020 align:start position:0%
half the tuition because they just don't
 
01:53:33.590 --> 01:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
have the grades and levels there and
 
01:53:35.330 --> 01:53:35.340 align:start position:0%
they have to take either near school or
 
01:53:37.310 --> 01:53:37.320 align:start position:0%
the nearest several schools to get in
 
01:53:39.350 --> 01:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
and offer parents what they're looking
 
01:53:42.649 --> 01:53:42.659 align:start position:0%
for in the what for the programming as
 
01:53:43.850 --> 01:53:43.860 align:start position:0%
long as one of those schools is an
 
01:53:45.590 --> 01:53:45.600 align:start position:0%
anchor school fine the president
 
01:53:58.129 --> 01:53:58.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:00.530 --> 01:54:00.540 align:start position:0%
if you
 
01:54:02.930 --> 01:54:02.940 align:start position:0%
if nothing change
 
01:54:05.149 --> 01:54:05.159 align:start position:0%
and what the current block is
 
01:54:11.390 --> 01:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:13.729 --> 01:54:13.739 align:start position:0%
how would this change
 
01:54:15.410 --> 01:54:15.420 align:start position:0%
well right now we don't have it
 
01:54:17.209 --> 01:54:17.219 align:start position:0%
happening right here but on any given
 
01:54:18.229 --> 01:54:18.239 align:start position:0%
day there might be four different
 
01:54:19.669 --> 01:54:19.679 align:start position:0%
attorneys sitting out here in the
 
01:54:19.679 --> 01:54:20.629 align:start position:0%
attorneys sitting out here in the
audience

01:54:20.629 --> 01:54:20.639 align:start position:0%
audience
 
01:54:23.629 --> 01:54:23.639 align:start position:0%
and we get four different answers
 
01:54:26.629 --> 01:54:26.639 align:start position:0%
um at least
 
01:54:29.990 --> 01:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
and and what you have if you have
 
01:54:32.510 --> 01:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
attorneys giving advice counsel legal
 
01:54:35.689 --> 01:54:35.699 align:start position:0%
counsel to the local board the local
 
01:54:37.669 --> 01:54:37.679 align:start position:0%
board always has some attorney in the
 
01:54:39.470 --> 01:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
background giving them advice
 
01:54:41.689 --> 01:54:41.699 align:start position:0%
the advice from this attorney may be you
 
01:54:42.709 --> 01:54:42.719 align:start position:0%
can't do that because you're
 
01:54:44.390 --> 01:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
discriminating against a child to
 
01:54:47.209 --> 01:54:47.219 align:start position:0%
parents that can't afford to do this
 
01:54:49.490 --> 01:54:49.500 align:start position:0%
um others are saying well you are
 
01:54:51.350 --> 01:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
providing the opportunity for that
 
01:54:54.830 --> 01:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
student to go to school a which is the
 
01:54:56.990 --> 01:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
anchor school which has all the things
 
01:55:00.229 --> 01:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
the child needs special education
 
01:55:02.149 --> 01:55:02.159 align:start position:0%
Etc so
 
01:55:04.250 --> 01:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
um but you have other districts saying
 
01:55:05.750 --> 01:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
you just can't do this because we don't
 
01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
think it's it's above the table so what
 
01:55:11.030 --> 01:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
we have now is we have different towns
 
01:55:13.370 --> 01:55:13.380 align:start position:0%
doing different things and we're trying
 
01:55:16.070 --> 01:55:16.080 align:start position:0%
to legalize what's doing here by Statute
 
01:55:19.250 --> 01:55:19.260 align:start position:0%
and saying you may re you may pay it
 
01:55:21.229 --> 01:55:21.239 align:start position:0%
yourself School District the difference
 
01:55:24.109 --> 01:55:24.119 align:start position:0%
or you may ask the parent to pay the
 
01:55:26.629 --> 01:55:26.639 align:start position:0%
difference but you must provide an
 
01:55:28.910 --> 01:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
alternative situation option for the
 
01:55:30.410 --> 01:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
parent where they want to have this
 
01:55:31.850 --> 01:55:31.860 align:start position:0%
education and they don't have to pay a
 
01:55:31.860 --> 01:55:33.050 align:start position:0%
education and they don't have to pay a
dime

01:55:33.050 --> 01:55:33.060 align:start position:0%
dime
 
01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:38.649 align:start position:0%
dime
representative

01:55:38.649 --> 01:55:38.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:41.330 --> 01:55:41.340 align:start position:0%
let me um go to representative dry who
 
01:55:43.790 --> 01:55:43.800 align:start position:0%
has a question for uh I think
 
01:55:46.430 --> 01:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
01:55:48.950 --> 01:55:48.960 align:start position:0%
that's right thank you
 
01:55:51.109 --> 01:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
um there are two
 
01:55:53.570 --> 01:55:53.580 align:start position:0%
private high schools that are serving as
 
01:55:55.669 --> 01:55:55.679 align:start position:0%
public high schools right now Co Brown
 
01:55:58.490 --> 01:55:58.500 align:start position:0%
and Pinkerton Academy and there is no
 
01:55:59.990 --> 01:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
Independent Schools yeah Independent
 
01:56:02.270 --> 01:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
Schools so they are not Public Schools
 
01:56:05.149 --> 01:56:05.159 align:start position:0%
is that correct so though but those are
 
01:56:08.090 --> 01:56:08.100 align:start position:0%
the high school for those their
 
01:56:09.649 --> 01:56:09.659 align:start position:0%
governance is different than a school
 
01:56:14.090 --> 01:56:14.100 align:start position:0%
district okay so so would they fit
 
01:56:16.010 --> 01:56:16.020 align:start position:0%
under the definition we're trying to
 
01:56:17.810 --> 01:56:17.820 align:start position:0%
expand it to that they needed to have a
 
01:56:19.490 --> 01:56:19.500 align:start position:0%
public anchor School
 
01:56:21.470 --> 01:56:21.480 align:start position:0%
for these towns wouldn't be meeting that
 
01:56:27.649 --> 01:56:27.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:30.229 --> 01:56:30.239 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative I think I
 
01:56:32.510 --> 01:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
believe that some time ago
 
01:56:36.590 --> 01:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
both uh Cole Brown and uh Pinkerton
 
01:56:39.950 --> 01:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
work by the labor board where they were
 
01:56:41.870 --> 01:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
determined to be public schools because
 
01:56:43.850 --> 01:56:43.860 align:start position:0%
they are basically funded through public
 
01:56:46.609 --> 01:56:46.619 align:start position:0%
dollars they may have an academy there
 
01:56:49.550 --> 01:56:49.560 align:start position:0%
used to be a series of academies across
 
01:56:51.950 --> 01:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
the state and over the years that the
 
01:56:55.490 --> 01:56:55.500 align:start position:0%
term Academy was dropped but the labor
 
01:56:57.830 --> 01:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
board I think it was
 
01:57:01.070 --> 01:57:01.080 align:start position:0%
uh late 80s uh there was a question
 
01:57:02.990 --> 01:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
about the collective bargaining and
 
01:57:04.729 --> 01:57:04.739 align:start position:0%
whether or not they could be organized
 
01:57:07.070 --> 01:57:07.080 align:start position:0%
and it was determined that they could be
 
01:57:08.689 --> 01:57:08.699 align:start position:0%
organized because they are in fact
 
01:57:11.450 --> 01:57:11.460 align:start position:0%
public entities paid through public
 
01:57:13.010 --> 01:57:13.020 align:start position:0%
money so even though they may have an
 
01:57:15.470 --> 01:57:15.480 align:start position:0%
academy at the end of it they are in
 
01:57:17.149 --> 01:57:17.159 align:start position:0%
fact Public Schools
 
01:57:17.159 --> 01:57:18.950 align:start position:0%
fact Public Schools
well

01:57:18.950 --> 01:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:57:21.470 --> 01:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
everybody just so you get some
 
01:57:23.570 --> 01:57:23.580 align:start position:0%
clarification on that
 
01:57:26.030 --> 01:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
St Johnsbury Academy and Pinkerton
 
01:57:28.609 --> 01:57:28.619 align:start position:0%
Academy are similar Independent Schools
 
01:57:31.669 --> 01:57:31.679 align:start position:0%
which they do not have a school board
 
01:57:34.070 --> 01:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
they have trustees which are appointed
 
01:57:36.350 --> 01:57:36.360 align:start position:0%
and elected by the trustees
 
01:57:38.990 --> 01:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
they do receive public dollars via the
 
01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:40.729 align:start position:0%
they do receive public dollars via the
tuition

01:57:40.729 --> 01:57:40.739 align:start position:0%
tuition
 
01:57:42.770 --> 01:57:42.780 align:start position:0%
in the case of Saint Johnsbury Academy
 
01:57:44.629 --> 01:57:44.639 align:start position:0%
it's a school roughly around thousand
 
01:57:47.030 --> 01:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
kids which 240 come from all over the
 
01:57:49.550 --> 01:57:49.560 align:start position:0%
world and they pay the tuition and board
 
01:57:53.209 --> 01:57:53.219 align:start position:0%
the other students come from a lot of
 
01:57:53.219 --> 01:57:54.310 align:start position:0%
the other students come from a lot of
most

01:57:54.310 --> 01:57:54.320 align:start position:0%
most
 
01:57:57.410 --> 01:57:57.420 align:start position:0%
a huge number come from New Hampshire
 
01:58:00.050 --> 01:58:00.060 align:start position:0%
from Monroe from Littleton from Bath
 
01:58:03.290 --> 01:58:03.300 align:start position:0%
from Paramount from lime
 
01:58:06.229 --> 01:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
they come from down from Quebec to go to
 
01:58:07.970 --> 01:58:07.980 align:start position:0%
Saint J they come from as far over as
 
01:58:07.980 --> 01:58:09.229 align:start position:0%
Saint J they come from as far over as
Montpelier

01:58:09.229 --> 01:58:09.239 align:start position:0%
Montpelier
 
01:58:12.109 --> 01:58:12.119 align:start position:0%
and these students come in the 600 plus
 
01:58:15.709 --> 01:58:15.719 align:start position:0%
of them close to 700 our day students
 
01:58:20.930 --> 01:58:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:24.050 --> 01:58:24.060 align:start position:0%
and that's very similar St Johnsbury uh
 
01:58:25.430 --> 01:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
with the New England Association of
 
01:58:26.870 --> 01:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
schools and colleges they're the ones
 
01:58:29.450 --> 01:58:29.460 align:start position:0%
that go down in the credit Pinkerton and
 
01:58:31.430 --> 01:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
Pinkerton people come up and accredited
 
01:58:32.629 --> 01:58:32.639 align:start position:0%
Saint J
 
01:58:34.669 --> 01:58:34.679 align:start position:0%
it's very closely aligned the two
 
01:58:34.679 --> 01:58:36.470 align:start position:0%
it's very closely aligned the two
schools

01:58:36.470 --> 01:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:58:38.149 --> 01:58:38.159 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock back to you
 
01:58:40.430 --> 01:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
Pinkerton also has a contract with
 
01:58:44.450 --> 01:58:44.460 align:start position:0%
chester for all of its to secondary
 
01:58:46.729 --> 01:58:46.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I would ask if um
 
01:58:48.470 --> 01:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
representative Milo would allow for a
 
01:58:53.870 --> 01:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:56.390 --> 01:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
would you like to break now uh pursue
 
01:58:58.430 --> 01:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
with the conversation yes were there any
 
01:59:00.530 --> 01:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
comments further before representative
 
01:59:00.540 --> 01:59:03.050 align:start position:0%
comments further before representative
Tanner

01:59:03.050 --> 01:59:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:07.189 --> 01:59:07.199 align:start position:0%
like to know the difference between
 
01:59:08.990 --> 01:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
a private school
 
01:59:11.649 --> 01:59:11.659 align:start position:0%
a school for tuition and a public school
 
01:59:14.570 --> 01:59:14.580 align:start position:0%
in terms of what their requirements are
 
01:59:17.390 --> 01:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
by the state to provide
 
01:59:23.750 --> 01:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:26.089 --> 01:59:26.099 align:start position:0%
thank you any further comment before we
 
01:59:29.689 --> 01:59:29.699 align:start position:0%
caucus can I get an answer to that
 
01:59:31.370 --> 01:59:31.380 align:start position:0%
both the schools we're talking about
 
01:59:33.890 --> 01:59:33.900 align:start position:0%
here Pinkerton and Saint J are approved
 
01:59:36.109 --> 01:59:36.119 align:start position:0%
by the Departments of Education
 
01:59:38.330 --> 01:59:38.340 align:start position:0%
they're also accredited through the same
 
01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
accrediting organization they provide
 
01:59:43.790 --> 01:59:43.800 align:start position:0%
all the services that you would provide
 
01:59:47.390 --> 01:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
at Newport right those two schools but a
 
01:59:50.270 --> 01:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
school that's tagged as a tuition a
 
01:59:53.089 --> 01:59:53.099 align:start position:0%
school for tuition purposes what is the
 
01:59:55.669 --> 01:59:55.679 align:start position:0%
minimum standards for that school is
 
01:59:57.589 --> 01:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
that spelled out in statute under the
 
01:59:59.870 --> 01:59:59.880 align:start position:0%
tuition program which we have that
 
02:00:03.290 --> 02:00:03.300 align:start position:0%
that's approved by the local board
 
02:00:05.390 --> 02:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
that's a local decision
 
02:00:07.970 --> 02:00:07.980 align:start position:0%
whether they're adequate or not whether
 
02:00:09.709 --> 02:00:09.719 align:start position:0%
they're aren't they approved by the
 
02:00:11.870 --> 02:00:11.880 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education for tuition
 
02:00:14.330 --> 02:00:14.340 align:start position:0%
purposes and if so it was my
 
02:00:16.189 --> 02:00:16.199 align:start position:0%
understanding that there there are
 
02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
requirements which they're required to
 
02:00:19.550 --> 02:00:19.560 align:start position:0%
have if you look in the statute you're
 
02:00:20.990 --> 02:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
going to see they have to have certain
 
02:00:23.450 --> 02:00:23.460 align:start position:0%
requirements but they are only approved
 
02:00:27.589 --> 02:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
by the local board as a tuition School
 
02:00:29.629 --> 02:00:29.639 align:start position:0%
as a tuition school okay the state
 
02:00:32.089 --> 02:00:32.099 align:start position:0%
report doesn't certify them
 
02:00:34.490 --> 02:00:34.500 align:start position:0%
or doesn't uh
 
02:00:36.589 --> 02:00:36.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that they are acceptable as
 
02:00:38.930 --> 02:00:38.940 align:start position:0%
a tuition school right representative
 
02:00:38.940 --> 02:00:40.490 align:start position:0%
a tuition school right representative
pedernal

02:00:40.490 --> 02:00:40.500 align:start position:0%
pedernal
 
02:00:40.500 --> 02:00:41.810 align:start position:0%
pedernal
well

02:00:41.810 --> 02:00:41.820 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:00:42.890 --> 02:00:42.900 align:start position:0%
I have
 
02:00:48.189 --> 02:00:48.199 align:start position:0%
the RSA underneath this one which is
 
02:00:52.550 --> 02:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
193.37 and they have the school has to
 
02:00:54.470 --> 02:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
be approved as a tuition school program
 
02:00:56.510 --> 02:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
which means the school has been approved
 
02:00:58.850 --> 02:00:58.860 align:start position:0%
and contracted by the school board and
 
02:01:01.010 --> 02:01:01.020 align:start position:0%
then it goes on a private school that
 
02:01:03.530 --> 02:01:03.540 align:start position:0%
receives tuition program students shall
 
02:01:05.410 --> 02:01:05.420 align:start position:0%
and then there's a whole list of
 
02:01:08.030 --> 02:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
requirements under that yeah that we put
 
02:01:14.810 --> 02:01:14.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:21.169 --> 02:01:21.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:21.179 --> 02:01:36.890 align:start position:0%
 
depends

02:01:36.890 --> 02:01:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:39.890 --> 02:01:39.900 align:start position:0%
I apologize uh Becky Wilson director of
 
02:01:41.689 --> 02:01:41.699 align:start position:0%
governmental relations for the New
 
02:01:43.729 --> 02:01:43.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school boards Association and
 
02:01:45.410 --> 02:01:45.420 align:start position:0%
I apologize because I do not have a copy
 
02:01:46.970 --> 02:01:46.980 align:start position:0%
of this amendment in front of me I
 
02:01:49.729 --> 02:01:49.739 align:start position:0%
haven't read it so I'm a little bit
 
02:01:51.589 --> 02:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
speaking off the cuff but I feel like
 
02:01:53.629 --> 02:01:53.639 align:start position:0%
the intent of this original bill has
 
02:01:56.270 --> 02:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
somehow got lost in the thank you so
 
02:01:57.830 --> 02:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
much representative
 
02:02:00.350 --> 02:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
in the translation of this conversation
 
02:02:02.570 --> 02:02:02.580 align:start position:0%
so now even I'm confused so I wanted to
 
02:02:05.570 --> 02:02:05.580 align:start position:0%
try to just I guess put some context
 
02:02:07.910 --> 02:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
around what I thought the original
 
02:02:10.970 --> 02:02:10.980 align:start position:0%
intention was and then try to weave in
 
02:02:12.410 --> 02:02:12.420 align:start position:0%
what I think some of the questions are
 
02:02:15.649 --> 02:02:15.659 align:start position:0%
about this bill so I will use Candia as
 
02:02:17.510 --> 02:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
an example for
 
02:02:19.310 --> 02:02:19.320 align:start position:0%
um as candy is a K-8 school district
 
02:02:22.310 --> 02:02:22.320 align:start position:0%
they have tuition agreements with
 
02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
Pinkerton Academy Raymond High School
 
02:02:26.689 --> 02:02:26.699 align:start position:0%
Central High School in Manchester in
 
02:02:29.930 --> 02:02:29.940 align:start position:0%
Memorial and Manchester all of the those
 
02:02:33.950 --> 02:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
four high schools the school board has a
 
02:02:36.109 --> 02:02:36.119 align:start position:0%
written tuition agreement with each of
 
02:02:38.510 --> 02:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
those high schools the tuition at each
 
02:02:39.830 --> 02:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
of those high schools in those
 
02:02:41.510 --> 02:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
Agreements are different amounts of
 
02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:42.410 align:start position:0%
Agreements are different amounts of
money

02:02:42.410 --> 02:02:42.420 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:02:45.410 --> 02:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
so the cost to go to Pinkerton that the
 
02:02:46.729 --> 02:02:46.739 align:start position:0%
Candia School District would pay to
 
02:02:49.129 --> 02:02:49.139 align:start position:0%
Pinkerton is a different amount than
 
02:02:51.109 --> 02:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
what the Candia School District would
 
02:02:53.330 --> 02:02:53.340 align:start position:0%
pay to Raymond High School if a student
 
02:02:55.550 --> 02:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
chooses to go to Raymond however all
 
02:02:58.189 --> 02:02:58.199 align:start position:0%
four of those Agreements are entered
 
02:03:01.250 --> 02:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
into between the receiving schools and
 
02:03:03.530 --> 02:03:03.540 align:start position:0%
the Candia School District so if I'm a
 
02:03:05.390 --> 02:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
student in Candia and I'm done with
 
02:03:06.830 --> 02:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
eighth grade and I choose to go to
 
02:03:09.830 --> 02:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
Pinkerton Academy that cost x amount of
 
02:03:09.840 --> 02:03:11.030 align:start position:0%
Pinkerton Academy that cost x amount of
dollars

02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:03:12.890 --> 02:03:12.900 align:start position:0%
and then I'm a student who wants to go
 
02:03:14.390 --> 02:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
to Raymond that costs a different amount
 
02:03:16.070 --> 02:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
and Central costs a different amount and
 
02:03:18.169 --> 02:03:18.179 align:start position:0%
Memorial costs a different amount so
 
02:03:20.870 --> 02:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
when I'm a district administrator trying
 
02:03:23.149 --> 02:03:23.159 align:start position:0%
to budget for the next however many
 
02:03:25.609 --> 02:03:25.619 align:start position:0%
years I'm calculating my tuition line
 
02:03:28.430 --> 02:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
item based off of how many kids I think
 
02:03:30.649 --> 02:03:30.659 align:start position:0%
I have going to Pinkerton because I'm
 
02:03:32.510 --> 02:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
still as candy I'm responsible for those
 
02:03:32.520 --> 02:03:33.770 align:start position:0%
still as candy I'm responsible for those
students

02:03:33.770 --> 02:03:33.780 align:start position:0%
students
 
02:03:36.410 --> 02:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
I'm projecting out how much I think that
 
02:03:38.089 --> 02:03:38.099 align:start position:0%
cost is going to be for the next four
 
02:03:40.250 --> 02:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
years for the students that we have at
 
02:03:42.070 --> 02:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
the time
 
02:03:44.629 --> 02:03:44.639 align:start position:0%
my original understanding of this bill
 
02:03:46.790 --> 02:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
was that if I'm a candy student who's
 
02:03:49.189 --> 02:03:49.199 align:start position:0%
currently going to Raymond and I decide
 
02:03:50.990 --> 02:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
my sophomore year I now want to go to
 
02:03:53.510 --> 02:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
Pinkerton I have that option as a Candia
 
02:03:56.390 --> 02:03:56.400 align:start position:0%
student however I've been budgeted at
 
02:03:58.250 --> 02:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
the Raymond amount
 
02:04:01.010 --> 02:04:01.020 align:start position:0%
so now if pinkerton's tuition agreement
 
02:04:03.530 --> 02:04:03.540 align:start position:0%
that we have is more money my
 
02:04:04.729 --> 02:04:04.739 align:start position:0%
understanding of what I thought this
 
02:04:07.729 --> 02:04:07.739 align:start position:0%
bill was was that the district could not
 
02:04:09.470 --> 02:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
say to the parent
 
02:04:11.990 --> 02:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
hey your kid cost x amount of dollars
 
02:04:14.209 --> 02:04:14.219 align:start position:0%
and that's what I've planned for now you
 
02:04:16.850 --> 02:04:16.860 align:start position:0%
want to go to Pinkerton that's on you
 
02:04:18.770 --> 02:04:18.780 align:start position:0%
the difference between whatever Raymond
 
02:04:20.930 --> 02:04:20.940 align:start position:0%
was and Pinkerton
 
02:04:23.089 --> 02:04:23.099 align:start position:0%
that the intent of this bill was that
 
02:04:25.070 --> 02:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
districts could then say okay we
 
02:04:26.810 --> 02:04:26.820 align:start position:0%
understand that you want to switch it up
 
02:04:30.050 --> 02:04:30.060 align:start position:0%
for whatever the reasons are and we will
 
02:04:32.390 --> 02:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
absorb that cost because these are all
 
02:04:34.729 --> 02:04:34.739 align:start position:0%
tuition agreements that we have offered
 
02:04:37.609 --> 02:04:37.619 align:start position:0%
to all Candia students
 
02:04:40.669 --> 02:04:40.679 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't I understand the concern
 
02:04:42.649 --> 02:04:42.659 align:start position:0%
I think listening to the conversation
 
02:04:45.050 --> 02:04:45.060 align:start position:0%
that may be the way this is worded
 
02:04:47.629 --> 02:04:47.639 align:start position:0%
would change that intent
 
02:04:50.570 --> 02:04:50.580 align:start position:0%
and I I think from what I've heard going
 
02:04:53.810 --> 02:04:53.820 align:start position:0%
around in the last few minutes
 
02:04:56.689 --> 02:04:56.699 align:start position:0%
the question would be you couldn't say
 
02:04:58.729 --> 02:04:58.739 align:start position:0%
to the parent
 
02:05:00.770 --> 02:05:00.780 align:start position:0%
there's no option for your kid to stay
 
02:05:03.229 --> 02:05:03.239 align:start position:0%
at Raymond or there's no option for your
 
02:05:05.330 --> 02:05:05.340 align:start position:0%
kid to access any of these because they
 
02:05:07.490 --> 02:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
all cost more money and so therefore
 
02:05:09.709 --> 02:05:09.719 align:start position:0%
we're not going to let your child go to
 
02:05:12.709 --> 02:05:12.719 align:start position:0%
any of these and you can't take the I
 
02:05:15.129 --> 02:05:15.139 align:start position:0%
don't believe take the money as a parent
 
02:05:18.169 --> 02:05:18.179 align:start position:0%
that I had going to Raymond and then
 
02:05:18.179 --> 02:05:19.189 align:start position:0%
that I had going to Raymond and then
just

02:05:19.189 --> 02:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:05:21.350 --> 02:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
use it as a voucher to go to any other
 
02:05:23.689 --> 02:05:23.699 align:start position:0%
school these would not be individual
 
02:05:25.729 --> 02:05:25.739 align:start position:0%
student agreements these are tuition
 
02:05:27.350 --> 02:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
agreements that the school board is
 
02:05:30.830 --> 02:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
entering into with other schools and in
 
02:05:32.450 --> 02:05:32.460 align:start position:0%
order to be an approved program by the
 
02:05:34.370 --> 02:05:34.380 align:start position:0%
local school board the school board is
 
02:05:36.290 --> 02:05:36.300 align:start position:0%
accepting responsibility and has the
 
02:05:38.629 --> 02:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
obligation to ensure that those students
 
02:05:39.950 --> 02:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
are getting a free appropriate public
 
02:05:41.930 --> 02:05:41.940 align:start position:0%
education at all of the programs that
 
02:05:45.310 --> 02:05:45.320 align:start position:0%
they approve you can't approve a program
 
02:05:47.510 --> 02:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
that doesn't meet the minimum standards
 
02:05:50.689 --> 02:05:50.699 align:start position:0%
as a school board you can't approve
 
02:05:52.910 --> 02:05:52.920 align:start position:0%
um you know some private school that
 
02:05:52.920 --> 02:05:53.930 align:start position:0%
um you know some private school that
doesn't

02:05:53.930 --> 02:05:53.940 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
02:05:56.209 --> 02:05:56.219 align:start position:0%
agree to meet all of the federal
 
02:05:57.830 --> 02:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
obligations that your end State
 
02:05:59.270 --> 02:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
obligations that as a school board
 
02:06:01.070 --> 02:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
you're mandated to provide to your
 
02:06:01.080 --> 02:06:02.450 align:start position:0%
you're mandated to provide to your
students

02:06:02.450 --> 02:06:02.460 align:start position:0%
students
 
02:06:04.310 --> 02:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
so I don't know that that really clears
 
02:06:06.169 --> 02:06:06.179 align:start position:0%
up the concerns that are floating around
 
02:06:08.689 --> 02:06:08.699 align:start position:0%
about the amendment because I don't I
 
02:06:10.189 --> 02:06:10.199 align:start position:0%
haven't had time to really process that
 
02:06:11.990 --> 02:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
but I feel like it's very confusing at
 
02:06:13.370 --> 02:06:13.380 align:start position:0%
this point what is the intent
 
02:06:16.189 --> 02:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
representative land that's exactly what
 
02:06:17.870 --> 02:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
happened with the situation I'm talking
 
02:06:20.990 --> 02:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
about uh in Paramount
 
02:06:23.030 --> 02:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic
 
02:06:26.089 --> 02:06:26.099 align:start position:0%
students in Piermont eighth graders did
 
02:06:27.709 --> 02:06:27.719 align:start position:0%
not have the opportunity to go visit
 
02:06:31.070 --> 02:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
these receiving schools they did it
 
02:06:34.310 --> 02:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
online visitations
 
02:06:37.129 --> 02:06:37.139 align:start position:0%
so of the four students
 
02:06:40.729 --> 02:06:40.739 align:start position:0%
three of them you know for Saint Jay
 
02:06:42.709 --> 02:06:42.719 align:start position:0%
three of them opted to go to Saint J now
 
02:06:45.530 --> 02:06:45.540 align:start position:0%
one of them decided to go to Bradford
 
02:06:48.350 --> 02:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
High School over in Vermont Oxbow
 
02:06:50.689 --> 02:06:50.699 align:start position:0%
got there went through as a freshman
 
02:06:53.870 --> 02:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
found out this is not what I want or
 
02:06:56.930 --> 02:06:56.940 align:start position:0%
what I thought and had never had the
 
02:06:58.609 --> 02:06:58.619 align:start position:0%
opportunity to be there before
 
02:07:01.070 --> 02:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
came back and said I'd like to go with
 
02:07:03.410 --> 02:07:03.420 align:start position:0%
the other students which are in my class
 
02:07:06.770 --> 02:07:06.780 align:start position:0%
from eighth grade to Saint J in the
 
02:07:09.530 --> 02:07:09.540 align:start position:0%
interim though the contract agreement
 
02:07:12.410 --> 02:07:12.420 align:start position:0%
with Saint Jay went up
 
02:07:14.990 --> 02:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
this is where we are we're at the point
 
02:07:16.790 --> 02:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
now where the Piermont board's saying
 
02:07:18.950 --> 02:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
well we don't have that we're you know
 
02:07:21.229 --> 02:07:21.239 align:start position:0%
and we don't know if we can allow you to
 
02:07:23.629 --> 02:07:23.639 align:start position:0%
pay that 500 or a thousand dollar
 
02:07:23.639 --> 02:07:25.070 align:start position:0%
pay that 500 or a thousand dollar
difference

02:07:25.070 --> 02:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
difference
 
02:07:28.129 --> 02:07:28.139 align:start position:0%
and parents saying I will gladly do that
 
02:07:30.410 --> 02:07:30.420 align:start position:0%
if I can get them going with the other
 
02:07:32.810 --> 02:07:32.820 align:start position:0%
four three students seeing that there's
 
02:07:34.850 --> 02:07:34.860 align:start position:0%
transportation we can carpool it'll work
 
02:07:37.729 --> 02:07:37.739 align:start position:0%
out just fine that is what happened and
 
02:07:39.589 --> 02:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
that's what we're trying to avoid from
 
02:07:41.870 --> 02:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
happening again with this this language
 
02:07:45.350 --> 02:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
here well I appreciate that and I think
 
02:07:46.910 --> 02:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
I will say though from a school board
 
02:07:48.830 --> 02:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
perspective when you're entering into a
 
02:07:50.390 --> 02:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
tuition agreement with another school
 
02:07:52.510 --> 02:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
for what for these kinds of reasons
 
02:07:56.030 --> 02:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
there are many times where schools that
 
02:07:57.470 --> 02:07:57.480 align:start position:0%
you are sending students to that your
 
02:07:59.209 --> 02:07:59.219 align:start position:0%
tuition and kids to will reuse the
 
02:08:01.189 --> 02:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
tuition cost
 
02:08:03.649 --> 02:08:03.659 align:start position:0%
um as part of your agreement it would be
 
02:08:05.330 --> 02:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
reasonable to add in there that they
 
02:08:07.970 --> 02:08:07.980 align:start position:0%
can't just switch the cost mid-year or
 
02:08:09.530 --> 02:08:09.540 align:start position:0%
something like that you know those are
 
02:08:10.970 --> 02:08:10.980 align:start position:0%
built into your budget you would need to
 
02:08:13.310 --> 02:08:13.320 align:start position:0%
work that into your contract with this
 
02:08:15.470 --> 02:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
between the school districts that you
 
02:08:17.810 --> 02:08:17.820 align:start position:0%
are working with as to how you're going
 
02:08:21.050 --> 02:08:21.060 align:start position:0%
to handle changes in tuition I mean it's
 
02:08:24.229 --> 02:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
not uncommon for tuitions to be changed
 
02:08:26.750 --> 02:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
while you're you know mid-year because
 
02:08:28.370 --> 02:08:28.380 align:start position:0%
districts again especially if your
 
02:08:29.689 --> 02:08:29.699 align:start position:0%
tuition to other Public Schools
 
02:08:31.070 --> 02:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
everyone's doing their budgets in
 
02:08:33.770 --> 02:08:33.780 align:start position:0%
October if you know you are Central High
 
02:08:35.030 --> 02:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
School is going to increase their
 
02:08:37.250 --> 02:08:37.260 align:start position:0%
tuition rate for students coming from
 
02:08:39.350 --> 02:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
Auburn then they're going to say hey
 
02:08:41.149 --> 02:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
Auburn we're increasing our tuition
 
02:08:42.830 --> 02:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
rates next year just a heads up so that
 
02:08:44.810 --> 02:08:44.820 align:start position:0%
everybody can budget for that for the
 
02:08:47.270 --> 02:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
upcoming budget it's you know a year two
 
02:08:49.850 --> 02:08:49.860 align:start position:0%
years ahead but that should be within
 
02:08:51.350 --> 02:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
your tuition agreement between the
 
02:08:52.910 --> 02:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
school boards
 
02:08:55.189 --> 02:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
a local decision of the local school
 
02:08:57.050 --> 02:08:57.060 align:start position:0%
board to put that in the agreement
 
02:08:59.209 --> 02:08:59.219 align:start position:0%
rather than I would I would honestly
 
02:09:00.169 --> 02:09:00.179 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:09:01.669 --> 02:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
representative I would have to go back
 
02:09:04.430 --> 02:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
and check and see if there is a um
 
02:09:06.229 --> 02:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
specific statute that outlines what has
 
02:09:07.729 --> 02:09:07.739 align:start position:0%
to be in your tuition contract I don't
 
02:09:09.470 --> 02:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
know offhand honestly that's really fair
 
02:09:11.149 --> 02:09:11.159 align:start position:0%
it would probably know that answer right
 
02:09:12.350 --> 02:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
off the top of his head but I don't
 
02:09:14.390 --> 02:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
questions or any other questions from
 
02:09:16.430 --> 02:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
Becky uh representative
 
02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:17.629 align:start position:0%
Becky uh representative
so

02:09:17.629 --> 02:09:17.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:09:17.639 --> 02:09:18.649 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:09:18.649 --> 02:09:18.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:22.669 --> 02:09:22.679 align:start position:0%
if if a student wants to go to a school
 
02:09:25.250 --> 02:09:25.260 align:start position:0%
that's not in a tuition agreement
 
02:09:28.910 --> 02:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
with a local school district then that's
 
02:09:31.490 --> 02:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
the school board has no
 
02:09:32.990 --> 02:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
parent responsibility thank you for the
 
02:09:34.070 --> 02:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
question it would be the parents
 
02:09:34.080 --> 02:09:35.930 align:start position:0%
question it would be the parents
responsibility

02:09:35.930 --> 02:09:35.940 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
02:09:38.209 --> 02:09:38.219 align:start position:0%
if the school has approved programs that
 
02:09:40.070 --> 02:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
are approved the school district those
 
02:09:41.930 --> 02:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
are the choices and if a parent would
 
02:09:44.089 --> 02:09:44.099 align:start position:0%
like to have their child enrolled
 
02:09:45.350 --> 02:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
somewhere else they can withdraw from
 
02:09:46.430 --> 02:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
the school district and go and roll
 
02:09:48.050 --> 02:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
wherever the heck they want to be
 
02:09:50.330 --> 02:09:50.340 align:start position:0%
accepted no different than any parent
 
02:09:52.430 --> 02:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
take any money but there's no money
 
02:09:52.440 --> 02:09:53.950 align:start position:0%
take any money but there's no money
Associated

02:09:53.950 --> 02:09:53.960 align:start position:0%
Associated
 
02:09:57.649 --> 02:09:57.659 align:start position:0%
nor the town to pay for that tuition no
 
02:09:59.470 --> 02:09:59.480 align:start position:0%
not unless there was some you know very
 
02:10:01.850 --> 02:10:01.860 align:start position:0%
obscure you know special edition some
 
02:10:03.290 --> 02:10:03.300 align:start position:0%
other issue that has nothing to do with
 
02:10:06.229 --> 02:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
tuition programs thanks thank you very
 
02:10:07.790 --> 02:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
much for your input uh representative
 
02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
Damon do you have a yes one more
 
02:10:14.930 --> 02:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
so I'm just and I appreciate your help
 
02:10:18.890 --> 02:10:18.900 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering what happens when
 
02:10:20.350 --> 02:10:20.360 align:start position:0%
a parent
 
02:10:22.669 --> 02:10:22.679 align:start position:0%
wants their student to go to a school
 
02:10:24.770 --> 02:10:24.780 align:start position:0%
that is not currently
 
02:10:27.050 --> 02:10:27.060 align:start position:0%
one of the designated ones that their
 
02:10:30.350 --> 02:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
town has a contract with
 
02:10:33.169 --> 02:10:33.179 align:start position:0%
and the parent petitions the school
 
02:10:35.870 --> 02:10:35.880 align:start position:0%
board to say I want this school approved
 
02:10:38.330 --> 02:10:38.340 align:start position:0%
this is currently happening in two towns
 
02:10:40.250 --> 02:10:40.260 align:start position:0%
in my district
 
02:10:40.260 --> 02:10:41.570 align:start position:0%
in my district
um

02:10:41.570 --> 02:10:41.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:44.750 --> 02:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
is there any RSA or other criteria
 
02:10:44.760 --> 02:10:46.270 align:start position:0%
is there any RSA or other criteria
precedence

02:10:46.270 --> 02:10:46.280 align:start position:0%
precedence
 
02:10:48.649 --> 02:10:48.659 align:start position:0%
Force towns limiting the number of
 
02:10:51.169 --> 02:10:51.179 align:start position:0%
schools they will approve and contract
 
02:10:51.179 --> 02:10:52.850 align:start position:0%
schools they will approve and contract
with

02:10:52.850 --> 02:10:52.860 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:10:54.770 --> 02:10:54.780 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I don't know
 
02:10:57.129 --> 02:10:57.139 align:start position:0%
offhand that there is a limit
 
02:10:59.750 --> 02:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
I do know that any school that the local
 
02:11:01.310 --> 02:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
school board approved would have to meet
 
02:11:03.589 --> 02:11:03.599 align:start position:0%
certain criteria because the reason
 
02:11:05.689 --> 02:11:05.699 align:start position:0%
you're approving these schools is
 
02:11:07.189 --> 02:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
because you're saying you don't have a
 
02:11:09.830 --> 02:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
school that meets the minimum standards
 
02:11:12.169 --> 02:11:12.179 align:start position:0%
or that meets the appropriate you know
 
02:11:13.790 --> 02:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
guidelines that are mandated upon
 
02:11:15.649 --> 02:11:15.659 align:start position:0%
schools to be able to provide an option
 
02:11:17.629 --> 02:11:17.639 align:start position:0%
to all students to have a free
 
02:11:19.189 --> 02:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
appropriate public education at the
 
02:11:20.930 --> 02:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
minimum standard so you're saying as a
 
02:11:22.729 --> 02:11:22.739 align:start position:0%
district we don't have that we're
 
02:11:24.830 --> 02:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
offering you these other options that do
 
02:11:26.450 --> 02:11:26.460 align:start position:0%
have that and we're paying the tuition
 
02:11:29.270 --> 02:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
for that because we don't have it
 
02:11:31.070 --> 02:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
um so you would have to I think if you
 
02:11:32.870 --> 02:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
wanted a new school to be approved by
 
02:11:35.629 --> 02:11:35.639 align:start position:0%
your school board somehow make a case
 
02:11:38.270 --> 02:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
that you're not offering that through
 
02:11:41.330 --> 02:11:41.340 align:start position:0%
any other opportunity and most of the
 
02:11:43.010 --> 02:11:43.020 align:start position:0%
situations that it sounds like you've
 
02:11:44.510 --> 02:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
been talking about for the last half
 
02:11:48.410 --> 02:11:48.420 align:start position:0%
hour or so those options exist within
 
02:11:49.550 --> 02:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
the school district already because
 
02:11:50.689 --> 02:11:50.699 align:start position:0%
they've already got these other
 
02:11:52.550 --> 02:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
tuitioned programs that they've agreed
 
02:11:54.830 --> 02:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
to so you would have to somehow make a
 
02:11:58.010 --> 02:11:58.020 align:start position:0%
case that those weren't sufficient and
 
02:11:58.020 --> 02:11:58.850 align:start position:0%
case that those weren't sufficient and
it

02:11:58.850 --> 02:11:58.860 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:12:01.129 --> 02:12:01.139 align:start position:0%
I'll never say never on this committee
 
02:12:03.169 --> 02:12:03.179 align:start position:0%
but it would be very unusual that you
 
02:12:05.330 --> 02:12:05.340 align:start position:0%
would make a tuition agreement for one
 
02:12:05.340 --> 02:12:06.890 align:start position:0%
would make a tuition agreement for one
student

02:12:06.890 --> 02:12:06.900 align:start position:0%
student
 
02:12:09.290 --> 02:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
as opposed to all of your students as an
 
02:12:09.300 --> 02:12:10.930 align:start position:0%
as opposed to all of your students as an
option

02:12:10.930 --> 02:12:10.940 align:start position:0%
option
 
02:12:14.330 --> 02:12:14.340 align:start position:0%
see these agreements which they have
 
02:12:16.129 --> 02:12:16.139 align:start position:0%
these contracts
 
02:12:18.770 --> 02:12:18.780 align:start position:0%
they're very competitive contracts
 
02:12:21.709 --> 02:12:21.719 align:start position:0%
um if in fact you have a school of 25
 
02:12:25.430 --> 02:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
kids which are graduating the receiving
 
02:12:27.350 --> 02:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
School may say well we're going to give
 
02:12:31.129 --> 02:12:31.139 align:start position:0%
you this rate if you can give us 60 70
 
02:12:35.109 --> 02:12:35.119 align:start position:0%
or more of these students
 
02:12:37.850 --> 02:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
the the town like Paramount I'm talking
 
02:12:39.709 --> 02:12:39.719 align:start position:0%
about and I wrote down on a sheet here
 
02:12:41.209 --> 02:12:41.219 align:start position:0%
earlier some of the things they look at
 
02:12:45.470 --> 02:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
when they're approving the the the these
 
02:12:47.750 --> 02:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
tuition programs they look at the
 
02:12:49.729 --> 02:12:49.739 align:start position:0%
academic programming they look at the
 
02:12:51.950 --> 02:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
performance of the outcomes of
 
02:12:54.290 --> 02:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
achievement of that's receiving school
 
02:12:56.629 --> 02:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
they look at graduation rates they look
 
02:12:58.609 --> 02:12:58.619 align:start position:0%
at special education services they look
 
02:13:01.310 --> 02:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
at co-curricular activities they look at
 
02:13:04.910 --> 02:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
the issue of Transportation they look at
 
02:13:06.830 --> 02:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
uh even in in some of them for example
 
02:13:09.410 --> 02:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
one reason why a lot of the kids in in
 
02:13:12.290 --> 02:13:12.300 align:start position:0%
Piermont would go to Oxbow is that is
 
02:13:13.850 --> 02:13:13.860 align:start position:0%
where our Career Technical education
 
02:13:15.530 --> 02:13:15.540 align:start position:0%
center is located
 
02:13:17.810 --> 02:13:17.820 align:start position:0%
it's just like the kids in Colebrook you
 
02:13:19.129 --> 02:13:19.139 align:start position:0%
know they they go across the river to
 
02:13:21.770 --> 02:13:21.780 align:start position:0%
Canaan or down some go to Brattleboro uh
 
02:13:23.750 --> 02:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
so and they also look of course at the
 
02:13:25.669 --> 02:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
tuition costs if they get a big break
 
02:13:27.290 --> 02:13:27.300 align:start position:0%
that's where they're gonna you know
 
02:13:28.729 --> 02:13:28.739 align:start position:0%
that's going to be their primary school
 
02:13:30.589 --> 02:13:30.599 align:start position:0%
and that's what's happening up there
 
02:13:32.930 --> 02:13:32.940 align:start position:0%
right now where I am there's between
 
02:13:37.669 --> 02:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
Warren which is in SAU 23 they're trying
 
02:13:39.709 --> 02:13:39.719 align:start position:0%
to say well we want to send our kids to
 
02:13:41.270 --> 02:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
Woodsville because they're getting a
 
02:13:43.069 --> 02:13:43.079 align:start position:0%
better rate and there's others saying ah
 
02:13:44.330 --> 02:13:44.340 align:start position:0%
no no no we're going to send them the
 
02:13:45.830 --> 02:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
Rivendell and there's other parents
 
02:13:46.910 --> 02:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
saying no they're going to go down to
 
02:13:49.910 --> 02:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
Plymouth and so this is always going to
 
02:13:52.010 --> 02:13:52.020 align:start position:0%
be the way it is in all these districts
 
02:13:53.930 --> 02:13:53.940 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a lot coming in from
 
02:13:55.609 --> 02:13:55.619 align:start position:0%
parents saying here's where I want my
 
02:13:57.229 --> 02:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
kid to go but the board has
 
02:13:59.689 --> 02:13:59.699 align:start position:0%
responsibility in writing these
 
02:14:01.609 --> 02:14:01.619 align:start position:0%
contracts to look at all these issues I
 
02:14:04.430 --> 02:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
just mentioned along with the costs of
 
02:14:07.010 --> 02:14:07.020 align:start position:0%
that and that's the bottom line usually
 
02:14:12.129 --> 02:14:12.139 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:15.950 --> 02:14:15.960 align:start position:0%
I just have one more question so
 
02:14:18.530 --> 02:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
um with the tuition agreements that for
 
02:14:20.629 --> 02:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
example Candia has
 
02:14:23.209 --> 02:14:23.219 align:start position:0%
there is no out of the schools that
 
02:14:25.010 --> 02:14:25.020 align:start position:0%
they've identified there's no school
 
02:14:27.350 --> 02:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
that a parent couldn't send their
 
02:14:30.649 --> 02:14:30.659 align:start position:0%
student to that wasn't fully covered by
 
02:14:34.370 --> 02:14:34.380 align:start position:0%
this by the local taxes and and uh you
 
02:14:36.410 --> 02:14:36.420 align:start position:0%
know our adequate education grants in
 
02:14:38.030 --> 02:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
other words there would be no school
 
02:14:40.010 --> 02:14:40.020 align:start position:0%
that they would have to pay
 
02:14:42.350 --> 02:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
extra money in order to send their
 
02:14:44.149 --> 02:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
student there
 
02:14:45.950 --> 02:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
unless there was like a fee for
 
02:14:47.629 --> 02:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
basketball or something like that right
 
02:14:50.030 --> 02:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:14:51.890 --> 02:14:51.900 align:start position:0%
to my understanding yes there would be
 
02:14:51.900 --> 02:14:53.390 align:start position:0%
to my understanding yes there would be
no

02:14:53.390 --> 02:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:14:56.149 --> 02:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
um it's not a tiered option so to speak
 
02:14:57.350 --> 02:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
it's not like you know you get this
 
02:14:58.550 --> 02:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
amount of money and you chose this
 
02:15:00.229 --> 02:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
school but if you don't like you know
 
02:15:01.910 --> 02:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
that you can't go to one of the other
 
02:15:03.589 --> 02:15:03.599 align:start position:0%
approved Schools they're all approved
 
02:15:06.050 --> 02:15:06.060 align:start position:0%
schools and school programs by the local
 
02:15:07.729 --> 02:15:07.739 align:start position:0%
school board so there should not be any
 
02:15:09.950 --> 02:15:09.960 align:start position:0%
additional cost and many of these
 
02:15:12.890 --> 02:15:12.900 align:start position:0%
contracts it is a different tuition cost
 
02:15:15.470 --> 02:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
for students who are eligible for
 
02:15:17.030 --> 02:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
special education for example that are
 
02:15:18.290 --> 02:15:18.300 align:start position:0%
getting services that caught that
 
02:15:20.510 --> 02:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
tuition cost might cover some of those
 
02:15:21.830 --> 02:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
things so that cost might be different
 
02:15:23.510 --> 02:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
but none of that would be shifted back
 
02:15:25.669 --> 02:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
down onto the family
 
02:15:28.850 --> 02:15:28.860 align:start position:0%
um and I I you know again I think
 
02:15:30.890 --> 02:15:30.900 align:start position:0%
the confusion seems to be around the
 
02:15:32.870 --> 02:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
amendment in terms of what else you
 
02:15:34.370 --> 02:15:34.380 align:start position:0%
could do with this money other than
 
02:15:36.229 --> 02:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
you're entering and it's between school
 
02:15:39.410 --> 02:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
districts and other school districts not
 
02:15:41.209 --> 02:15:41.219 align:start position:0%
parents and school districts emergency
 
02:15:43.669 --> 02:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
life catastrophic Aid you mentioned this
 
02:15:45.649 --> 02:15:45.659 align:start position:0%
The Specialist is the responsibility of
 
02:15:47.270 --> 02:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
the resident District
 
02:15:49.250 --> 02:15:49.260 align:start position:0%
regardless what the tuition school is
 
02:15:50.930 --> 02:15:50.940 align:start position:0%
tuition school is not going to pay for
 
02:15:52.310 --> 02:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
that it's going to be the sending school
 
02:15:55.310 --> 02:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
that's that's in statute
 
02:15:57.290 --> 02:15:57.300 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your assistance
 
02:15:59.330 --> 02:15:59.340 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you are there any other
 
02:16:02.510 --> 02:16:02.520 align:start position:0%

one o'clock depending upon when this
 
02:33:35.630 --> 02:33:35.640 align:start position:0%

03:36:47.090 --> 03:36:47.100 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
03:36:49.070 --> 03:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
School District
 
03:36:50.870 --> 03:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
so we're looking at
 
03:36:53.450 --> 03:36:53.460 align:start position:0%
transforming this also into a school
 
03:36:56.389 --> 03:36:56.399 align:start position:0%
district this is a multi-step process
 
03:36:58.969 --> 03:36:58.979 align:start position:0%
and the first step is to hold a vote in
 
03:37:01.790 --> 03:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater Hebron and Groton to
 
03:37:04.190 --> 03:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
determine if our citizens want to
 
03:37:07.910 --> 03:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
establish a K-8 SAU
 
03:37:10.490 --> 03:37:10.500 align:start position:0%
the intent of this bill is to improve
 
03:37:13.550 --> 03:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
educational outcomes for children with
 
03:37:15.290 --> 03:37:15.300 align:start position:0%
an Innovative alternative to a
 
03:37:16.849 --> 03:37:16.859 align:start position:0%
traditional Middle School
 
03:37:19.309 --> 03:37:19.319 align:start position:0%
the goal is to reconfigure the Village
 
03:37:22.010 --> 03:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
School to a K-8 that's the eventual goal
 
03:37:23.690 --> 03:37:23.700 align:start position:0%
that they're working towards
 
03:37:25.790 --> 03:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
Studies have shown the fewer number of
 
03:37:28.010 --> 03:37:28.020 align:start position:0%
transition transitions children make
 
03:37:29.929 --> 03:37:29.939 align:start position:0%
before high school the greater
 
03:37:32.269 --> 03:37:32.279 align:start position:0%
Improvement of student performance I can
 
03:37:35.150 --> 03:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
attest to that as a principal for a
 
03:37:36.650 --> 03:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
number of years will remain of a k
 
03:37:39.710 --> 03:37:39.720 align:start position:0%
through eight those K-8 students go
 
03:37:41.809 --> 03:37:41.819 align:start position:0%
through a situation like that where
 
03:37:43.429 --> 03:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
teachers work with each other at
 
03:37:45.410 --> 03:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
different levels you oftentimes can talk
 
03:37:48.710 --> 03:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
to a fifth grade teacher uh maybe talks
 
03:37:50.150 --> 03:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
with a sixth grade teacher a sixth grade
 
03:37:51.950 --> 03:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
teacher said how did you ever figure
 
03:37:54.710 --> 03:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
Johnny out and fifth grade teacher said
 
03:37:56.809 --> 03:37:56.819 align:start position:0%
this is how I did it and you learn from
 
03:37:58.429 --> 03:37:58.439 align:start position:0%
each other that's one of the neat things
 
03:38:01.910 --> 03:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
about a K-8 school you have a similar
 
03:38:03.710 --> 03:38:03.720 align:start position:0%
culture there's less transition for
 
03:38:05.570 --> 03:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
students and the students get to know
 
03:38:07.309 --> 03:38:07.319 align:start position:0%
each other well that's both good and bad
 
03:38:10.490 --> 03:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
but it's a situation that I would say
 
03:38:12.590 --> 03:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
it's the best organizational structure
 
03:38:14.870 --> 03:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
that I've ever had I've had k-6s I've
 
03:38:18.590 --> 03:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
had K eights I've had three through six
 
03:38:20.510 --> 03:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
I've had four through six and I've had
 
03:38:22.969 --> 03:38:22.979 align:start position:0%
middle school and high school and the
 
03:38:26.330 --> 03:38:26.340 align:start position:0%
best fun I ever had was k through eight
 
03:38:28.130 --> 03:38:28.140 align:start position:0%
so they operate their own Elementary
 
03:38:30.349 --> 03:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
School and tuition into the Newfound
 
03:38:32.510 --> 03:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
area district for grades seven through
 
03:38:35.750 --> 03:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
twelve that's what they're aiming for
 
03:38:37.550 --> 03:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
um so that's a little bit about the
 
03:38:39.229 --> 03:38:39.239 align:start position:0%
background what this bill is trying to
 
03:38:42.229 --> 03:38:42.239 align:start position:0%
do they're trying to uh do this
 
03:38:44.630 --> 03:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
transition step from where they are
 
03:38:45.950 --> 03:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
where they're not a school district
 
03:38:48.530 --> 03:38:48.540 align:start position:0%
right now but they're also seeing when
 
03:38:52.070 --> 03:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
the students move from the K-8 into the
 
03:38:54.349 --> 03:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
middle school the math achievement
 
03:38:57.650 --> 03:38:57.660 align:start position:0%
scores do drop and learning drops I I
 
03:38:59.269 --> 03:38:59.279 align:start position:0%
don't know the total reasons for that
 
03:39:01.429 --> 03:39:01.439 align:start position:0%
but you know I'm sure that their folks
 
03:39:03.110 --> 03:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
here that may know that
 
03:39:04.849 --> 03:39:04.859 align:start position:0%
um it's not that
 
03:39:04.859 --> 03:39:05.469 align:start position:0%
um it's not that
um

03:39:05.469 --> 03:39:05.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:07.670 --> 03:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
I I don't want to say anything about
 
03:39:10.670 --> 03:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
what that but I do know that in going
 
03:39:13.670 --> 03:39:13.680 align:start position:0%
this direction they've assured me that
 
03:39:16.969 --> 03:39:16.979 align:start position:0%
there's whether there's a union there
 
03:39:19.969 --> 03:39:19.979 align:start position:0%
now the continued can they can reform
 
03:39:22.670 --> 03:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
and do that teachers that are hired in
 
03:39:24.650 --> 03:39:24.660 align:start position:0%
in the building right now will have the
 
03:39:26.330 --> 03:39:26.340 align:start position:0%
option be hired in the building in the
 
03:39:27.590 --> 03:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
future that's what they're looking at
 
03:39:28.910 --> 03:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
there's not going to be any loss of
 
03:39:32.389 --> 03:39:32.399 align:start position:0%
personnel the end result is that they
 
03:39:33.830 --> 03:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
want to have the ability to figure out
 
03:39:35.929 --> 03:39:35.939 align:start position:0%
twisting where they want students to go
 
03:39:38.030 --> 03:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
once they finish the Elementary grades k
 
03:39:39.050 --> 03:39:39.060 align:start position:0%
through eight
 
03:39:41.809 --> 03:39:41.819 align:start position:0%
and um so that's where we are with the
 
03:39:43.309 --> 03:39:43.319 align:start position:0%
bill I'd be glad to take any questions
 
03:39:46.130 --> 03:39:46.140 align:start position:0%

for that explanation without even
 
03:40:16.790 --> 03:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
looking at the merits of The Proposal
 
03:40:20.030 --> 03:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
here I have one question why is this
 
03:40:23.269 --> 03:40:23.279 align:start position:0%
proposal before us
 
03:40:26.389 --> 03:40:26.399 align:start position:0%
cannot cannot the study
 
03:40:28.370 --> 03:40:28.380 align:start position:0%
that they're asking for the three or
 
03:40:31.429 --> 03:40:31.439 align:start position:0%
four year study and the vote why does
 
03:40:34.490 --> 03:40:34.500 align:start position:0%
this have to be a legislative action
 
03:40:36.290 --> 03:40:36.300 align:start position:0%
I'm not looking at the merits I'm just
 
03:40:38.990 --> 03:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's a procedural question that I'm
 
03:40:42.050 --> 03:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
asking okay would you mind if we get
 
03:40:43.910 --> 03:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
that technical advice from them that
 
03:40:45.650 --> 03:40:45.660 align:start position:0%
would be great thank you so was it Mr
 
03:40:49.010 --> 03:40:49.020 align:start position:0%
Looney and Mr Berry please come forward
 
03:40:49.020 --> 03:40:53.030 align:start position:0%
Looney and Mr Berry please come forward
um

03:40:53.030 --> 03:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:55.010 --> 03:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
I think if you met both of these
 
03:40:56.929 --> 03:40:56.939 align:start position:0%
individual parts that is uh Virginia
 
03:40:58.309 --> 03:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
Barry's husband
 
03:41:02.750 --> 03:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of education and Bill Ludy
 
03:41:07.190 --> 03:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:14.030 --> 03:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:16.250 --> 03:41:16.260 align:start position:0%
so at the hearing
 
03:41:20.030 --> 03:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
um we presented a legal analysis
 
03:41:22.010 --> 03:41:22.020 align:start position:0%
um that essentially
 
03:41:25.309 --> 03:41:25.319 align:start position:0%
uh says that the legislature retains the
 
03:41:27.650 --> 03:41:27.660 align:start position:0%
authority over the formulation of public
 
03:41:31.490 --> 03:41:31.500 align:start position:0%
school districts and that was done by
 
03:41:33.729 --> 03:41:33.739 align:start position:0%
the legal advisor for
 
03:41:36.469 --> 03:41:36.479 align:start position:0%
the Hebron Bridgewater Village District
 
03:41:39.110 --> 03:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
that we've had in place for about 22
 
03:41:41.150 --> 03:41:41.160 align:start position:0%
years now just a follow-up thing yeah
 
03:41:45.349 --> 03:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
yes so you're saying that the study that
 
03:41:47.630 --> 03:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
that's proposed here I was a three-year
 
03:41:49.070 --> 03:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
four-year study before you have a vote
 
03:41:51.950 --> 03:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
of et cetera that that can't take place
 
03:41:54.830 --> 03:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
prior to any legislation or do you need
 
03:41:57.769 --> 03:41:57.779 align:start position:0%
the enabling legislation yes sir to to
 
03:41:59.809 --> 03:41:59.819 align:start position:0%
conduct that kind of a process that is
 
03:42:02.269 --> 03:42:02.279 align:start position:0%
correct sir yes we we need enabling
 
03:42:06.050 --> 03:42:06.060 align:start position:0%
legislation if you recall in 1997 the
 
03:42:08.150 --> 03:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
legislature passed a statute to create
 
03:42:11.090 --> 03:42:11.100 align:start position:0%
the Bridgewater Hebron Village District
 
03:42:13.309 --> 03:42:13.319 align:start position:0%
this is as the chairman mentioned this
 
03:42:14.450 --> 03:42:14.460 align:start position:0%
is a
 
03:42:17.269 --> 03:42:17.279 align:start position:0%
political unique political subdivision
 
03:42:20.570 --> 03:42:20.580 align:start position:0%
we have three elected Commissioners so
 
03:42:23.030 --> 03:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
our commissioners wanted to pursue
 
03:42:26.330 --> 03:42:26.340 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation to give our towns
 
03:42:29.330 --> 03:42:29.340 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to
 
03:42:32.330 --> 03:42:32.340 align:start position:0%
have a vote on whether or not we want to
 
03:42:34.010 --> 03:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
establish our own three-town school
 
03:42:37.250 --> 03:42:37.260 align:start position:0%
district and then our selectment
 
03:42:38.809 --> 03:42:38.819 align:start position:0%
according to the language in the bill
 
03:42:40.990 --> 03:42:41.000 align:start position:0%
would appoint committees
 
03:42:44.510 --> 03:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
to study how we would go about doing
 
03:42:48.530 --> 03:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
that and so this bill essentially
 
03:42:51.290 --> 03:42:51.300 align:start position:0%
is an enabling legislation to start that
 
03:42:55.490 --> 03:42:55.500 align:start position:0%
process given our unique situation as a
 
03:42:57.469 --> 03:42:57.479 align:start position:0%
village district and we own our own
 
03:42:57.479 --> 03:42:58.429 align:start position:0%
village district and we own our own
School

03:42:58.429 --> 03:42:58.439 align:start position:0%
School
 
03:43:02.090 --> 03:43:02.100 align:start position:0%
as far as we know there is no other
 
03:43:06.110 --> 03:43:06.120 align:start position:0%
towns in the entire state that has this
 
03:43:10.190 --> 03:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
unique legislative status as a village
 
03:43:10.200 --> 03:43:11.690 align:start position:0%
unique legislative status as a village
District

03:43:11.690 --> 03:43:11.700 align:start position:0%
District
 
03:43:14.570 --> 03:43:14.580 align:start position:0%
so just as a follow-up thing so because
 
03:43:17.210 --> 03:43:17.220 align:start position:0%
it was initiated by the legislature
 
03:43:18.830 --> 03:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
that's why you're here because that is
 
03:43:20.929 --> 03:43:20.939 align:start position:0%
correct in other words our legal advisor
 
03:43:23.090 --> 03:43:23.100 align:start position:0%
essentially said to us there's a there's
 
03:43:24.590 --> 03:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
a flaw
 
03:43:27.650 --> 03:43:27.660 align:start position:0%
in the original legislation and what
 
03:43:29.990 --> 03:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
this enabling legislation does is
 
03:43:32.450 --> 03:43:32.460 align:start position:0%
correct that flaw and brings us into
 
03:43:36.229 --> 03:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
alignment with the village District
 
03:43:38.809 --> 03:43:38.819 align:start position:0%
and once this enabling legislation has
 
03:43:41.269 --> 03:43:41.279 align:start position:0%
passed then it's entirely up to our
 
03:43:44.389 --> 03:43:44.399 align:start position:0%
towns to decide whether or not we want
 
03:43:46.190 --> 03:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
to establish our own Freetown school
 
03:43:48.349 --> 03:43:48.359 align:start position:0%
district and then the legislation was
 
03:43:51.490 --> 03:43:51.500 align:start position:0%
carefully written as a series of steps
 
03:43:55.190 --> 03:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
once that vote took place in order to
 
03:43:57.590 --> 03:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
achieve on the creation of our own
 
03:44:00.650 --> 03:44:00.660 align:start position:0%
school district and our own SAU
 
03:44:03.830 --> 03:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
and was that the letter that you
 
03:44:05.809 --> 03:44:05.819 align:start position:0%
provided US during the hearing process
 
03:44:09.170 --> 03:44:09.180 align:start position:0%
from Dean Eggert Wadley Starr and Peters
 
03:44:11.929 --> 03:44:11.939 align:start position:0%
here that is correct and his point was
 
03:44:14.389 --> 03:44:14.399 align:start position:0%
and for full you know stipulation here I
 
03:44:16.490 --> 03:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
am not a lawyer all right but I we we
 
03:44:18.410 --> 03:44:18.420 align:start position:0%
did hand out and I read into the record
 
03:44:20.269 --> 03:44:20.279 align:start position:0%
during the hearing
 
03:44:23.450 --> 03:44:23.460 align:start position:0%
This legal issue and we had 20 copies of
 
03:44:24.950 --> 03:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
the letter available for all of the
 
03:44:26.990 --> 03:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
members here but essentially what his
 
03:44:29.030 --> 03:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
legal opinion says is that you the
 
03:44:31.309 --> 03:44:31.319 align:start position:0%
legislature retained the authority to do
 
03:44:35.210 --> 03:44:35.220 align:start position:0%
this and then secondly he said this bill
 
03:44:38.150 --> 03:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
corrects a unique flaw in The
 
03:44:41.330 --> 03:44:41.340 align:start position:0%
Cooperative withdrawal process and
 
03:44:45.110 --> 03:44:45.120 align:start position:0%
finally he said as a local act this bill
 
03:44:48.110 --> 03:44:48.120 align:start position:0%
does not modify the general Provisions
 
03:44:50.210 --> 03:44:50.220 align:start position:0%
pertaining to any other school district
 
03:44:53.090 --> 03:44:53.100 align:start position:0%
trying with the with the RSA 195
 
03:44:54.590 --> 03:44:54.600 align:start position:0%
withdrawal process
 
03:44:56.690 --> 03:44:56.700 align:start position:0%
so again this is simply an enabling
 
03:44:58.790 --> 03:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation to allow our three
 
03:45:03.710 --> 03:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
towns to expand on that Statute in 1997
 
03:45:05.750 --> 03:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
creating the village district with our
 
03:45:08.330 --> 03:45:08.340 align:start position:0%
three elected Commissioners and move to
 
03:45:11.690 --> 03:45:11.700 align:start position:0%
a full School District in SAU and we
 
03:45:13.969 --> 03:45:13.979 align:start position:0%
present a testimony during the hearing
 
03:45:16.190 --> 03:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
on why we think that's not only good for
 
03:45:18.229 --> 03:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
Education outcomes but it's good for
 
03:45:21.290 --> 03:45:21.300 align:start position:0%
parents it's good for local control and
 
03:45:23.990 --> 03:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
we certainly hope that we'll get your
 
03:45:24.000 --> 03:45:25.790 align:start position:0%
we certainly hope that we'll get your
support

03:45:25.790 --> 03:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
support
 
03:45:28.250 --> 03:45:28.260 align:start position:0%
are there further questions for either
 
03:45:30.950 --> 03:45:30.960 align:start position:0%
yes representative luno yes thank you
 
03:45:33.590 --> 03:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chair and thanks for uh for
 
03:45:35.690 --> 03:45:35.700 align:start position:0%
being here today I know it's been a long
 
03:45:38.450 --> 03:45:38.460 align:start position:0%
morning uh here as well
 
03:45:43.130 --> 03:45:43.140 align:start position:0%
um but um but you know this is a a
 
03:45:45.650 --> 03:45:45.660 align:start position:0%
um you know rather unique type of Bill
 
03:45:48.650 --> 03:45:48.660 align:start position:0%
to come come before the committee and
 
03:45:51.469 --> 03:45:51.479 align:start position:0%
and I I do have a couple of questions if
 
03:45:53.450 --> 03:45:53.460 align:start position:0%
the chair would go ahead dulls me on
 
03:45:56.570 --> 03:45:56.580 align:start position:0%
this go ahead um the the first one is
 
03:46:01.630 --> 03:46:01.640 align:start position:0%
would the I I guess is there opposition
 
03:46:04.370 --> 03:46:04.380 align:start position:0%
within the Newfound Area School District
 
03:46:07.729 --> 03:46:07.739 align:start position:0%
to the withdrawal of Bridgewater uh
 
03:46:10.910 --> 03:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
Hebron and Groton and will that
 
03:46:10.920 --> 03:46:12.530 align:start position:0%
Hebron and Groton and will that
withdrawal

03:46:12.530 --> 03:46:12.540 align:start position:0%
withdrawal
 
03:46:17.050 --> 03:46:17.060 align:start position:0%
um will it withdrawal be uh predicated
 
03:46:22.010 --> 03:46:22.020 align:start position:0%
on a vote by the full Newfound Area
 
03:46:24.429 --> 03:46:24.439 align:start position:0%
School District
 
03:46:27.469 --> 03:46:27.479 align:start position:0%
so the answer to your questions
 
03:46:30.290 --> 03:46:30.300 align:start position:0%
um representative Leno is that
 
03:46:32.570 --> 03:46:32.580 align:start position:0%
um there's this is just my own personal
 
03:46:34.790 --> 03:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
view there's a mixed reaction throughout
 
03:46:36.830 --> 03:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
the school district but in our three
 
03:46:36.840 --> 03:46:38.110 align:start position:0%
the school district but in our three
towns

03:46:38.110 --> 03:46:38.120 align:start position:0%
towns
 
03:46:42.650 --> 03:46:42.660 align:start position:0%
254 people signed in in support of this
 
03:46:46.250 --> 03:46:46.260 align:start position:0%
bill during the testimony and there were
 
03:46:48.710 --> 03:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
four opposed so just based on that sort
 
03:46:51.229 --> 03:46:51.239 align:start position:0%
of rudimentary you know indication of
 
03:46:52.610 --> 03:46:52.620 align:start position:0%
whether or not there's support in our
 
03:46:55.370 --> 03:46:55.380 align:start position:0%
three towns there is it's unknown to me
 
03:46:57.170 --> 03:46:57.180 align:start position:0%
there's tremendous support in our three
 
03:46:59.630 --> 03:46:59.640 align:start position:0%
towns for this and our Selectmen all
 
03:47:01.010 --> 03:47:01.020 align:start position:0%
nine Selectmen we're here at the
 
03:47:02.870 --> 03:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
Committee hearing
 
03:47:04.370 --> 03:47:04.380 align:start position:0%
um and testified
 
03:47:07.250 --> 03:47:07.260 align:start position:0%
um I think quite eloquently
 
03:47:10.070 --> 03:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
um about why this makes sense not only
 
03:47:10.080 --> 03:47:11.450 align:start position:0%
um about why this makes sense not only
from

03:47:11.450 --> 03:47:11.460 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:47:13.910 --> 03:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
this unique legal status that we have
 
03:47:16.210 --> 03:47:16.220 align:start position:0%
and the fact that we own our own school
 
03:47:20.389 --> 03:47:20.399 align:start position:0%
but also we have a 300 mile square mile
 
03:47:23.750 --> 03:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
School District it's huge and our three
 
03:47:25.729 --> 03:47:25.739 align:start position:0%
towns are on the north end of it and a
 
03:47:28.130 --> 03:47:28.140 align:start position:0%
lot of the testimony that our citizens
 
03:47:30.769 --> 03:47:30.779 align:start position:0%
gave to your committee a few weeks ago
 
03:47:33.290 --> 03:47:33.300 align:start position:0%
said you know our kids spend two and a
 
03:47:35.870 --> 03:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
half hours on a bus and we could cut
 
03:47:38.570 --> 03:47:38.580 align:start position:0%
that down by making a smaller School
 
03:47:40.550 --> 03:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
District so our kids wouldn't have to
 
03:47:43.130 --> 03:47:43.140 align:start position:0%
drive by a middle school you know
 
03:47:45.110 --> 03:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
waiting at the middle school and to go
 
03:47:48.290 --> 03:47:48.300 align:start position:0%
another 30 minutes to get to um so just
 
03:47:50.510 --> 03:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
a school so so I can't answer your
 
03:47:52.790 --> 03:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
question about the because we haven't
 
03:47:55.550 --> 03:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
done any polling if you will about what
 
03:47:56.530 --> 03:47:56.540 align:start position:0%
the other
 
03:47:59.269 --> 03:47:59.279 align:start position:0%
towns think but this would not require
 
03:48:01.490 --> 03:48:01.500 align:start position:0%
this bill would require just the votes
 
03:48:04.490 --> 03:48:04.500 align:start position:0%
of our three towns so so just to be
 
03:48:09.110 --> 03:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
clear uh Mr chair this um this is more
 
03:48:11.450 --> 03:48:11.460 align:start position:0%
than enabling legislation
 
03:48:13.969 --> 03:48:13.979 align:start position:0%
in line six through eight on the first
 
03:48:17.030 --> 03:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
page the towns of Bridgewater Hebron are
 
03:48:19.130 --> 03:48:19.140 align:start position:0%
hereby authorized to withdraw from the
 
03:48:21.050 --> 03:48:21.060 align:start position:0%
Newfound Area School District and
 
03:48:22.610 --> 03:48:22.620 align:start position:0%
establish a public school district and
 
03:48:24.410 --> 03:48:24.420 align:start position:0%
buys that comprise of the geographical
 
03:48:26.690 --> 03:48:26.700 align:start position:0%
limits of the aforementioned three towns
 
03:48:26.700 --> 03:48:28.849 align:start position:0%
limits of the aforementioned three towns
period

03:48:28.849 --> 03:48:28.859 align:start position:0%
period
 
03:48:30.769 --> 03:48:30.779 align:start position:0%
um so so
 
03:48:35.410 --> 03:48:35.420 align:start position:0%
does does that provision in here
 
03:48:39.050 --> 03:48:39.060 align:start position:0%
complete the withdrawal of these three
 
03:48:39.060 --> 03:48:40.190 align:start position:0%
complete the withdrawal of these three
towns

03:48:40.190 --> 03:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
towns
 
03:48:42.349 --> 03:48:42.359 align:start position:0%
from the I mean from a from a legal
 
03:48:44.570 --> 03:48:44.580 align:start position:0%
standpoint does it complete the with the
 
03:48:47.150 --> 03:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
the authorization of the withdrawal of
 
03:48:49.550 --> 03:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
these three towns from the Newfound Area
 
03:48:53.690 --> 03:48:53.700 align:start position:0%
School District without a vote of Adam
 
03:48:55.370 --> 03:48:55.380 align:start position:0%
at a meeting
 
03:48:59.269 --> 03:48:59.279 align:start position:0%
of the Newfound Area School District and
 
03:49:02.110 --> 03:49:02.120 align:start position:0%
all the towns that comprise it line 14
 
03:49:04.670 --> 03:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
says the career and this is after the
 
03:49:07.010 --> 03:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
one that you you've quoted sir
 
03:49:08.630 --> 03:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
um the creation of this new Public
 
03:49:10.610 --> 03:49:10.620 align:start position:0%
School District shall be contingent upon
 
03:49:12.349 --> 03:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
a majority vote in each of the three
 
03:49:15.290 --> 03:49:15.300 align:start position:0%
towns right right and I've got that
 
03:49:17.809 --> 03:49:17.819 align:start position:0%
right underlined as well so that's not
 
03:49:19.729 --> 03:49:19.739 align:start position:0%
the withdrawal that's the next step
 
03:49:22.309 --> 03:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
that's the creation of the district and
 
03:49:26.570 --> 03:49:26.580 align:start position:0%
the vote is only from the people that
 
03:49:29.150 --> 03:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
reside voters in those three towns
 
03:49:31.910 --> 03:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's correct not voters throughout the
 
03:49:34.490 --> 03:49:34.500 align:start position:0%
Newfound Area School District correct so
 
03:49:38.269 --> 03:49:38.279 align:start position:0%
so my concern and it's a a deeply held
 
03:49:40.130 --> 03:49:40.140 align:start position:0%
concern and this comes out of my
 
03:49:44.210 --> 03:49:44.220 align:start position:0%
Commerce time Mr chair is that is that
 
03:49:46.849 --> 03:49:46.859 align:start position:0%
these three towns are currently in a in
 
03:49:49.969 --> 03:49:49.979 align:start position:0%
an agreement
 
03:49:53.269 --> 03:49:53.279 align:start position:0%
with the Newfound Area School District
 
03:49:55.729 --> 03:49:55.739 align:start position:0%
and this bill
 
03:49:55.739 --> 03:49:57.469 align:start position:0%
and this bill
is

03:49:57.469 --> 03:49:57.479 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:49:59.929 --> 03:49:59.939 align:start position:0%
having legislative action
 
03:50:02.510 --> 03:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
to essentially interfere with that
 
03:50:02.520 --> 03:50:04.250 align:start position:0%
to essentially interfere with that
agreement

03:50:04.250 --> 03:50:04.260 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
03:50:06.410 --> 03:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
I and I'm not arguing on them you know
 
03:50:08.630 --> 03:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
as representative Miler said I I think
 
03:50:11.570 --> 03:50:11.580 align:start position:0%
the case you're making is is strong for
 
03:50:14.570 --> 03:50:14.580 align:start position:0%
the three towns to withdraw but I'm
 
03:50:17.389 --> 03:50:17.399 align:start position:0%
wondering I mean I'm really concerned if
 
03:50:20.570 --> 03:50:20.580 align:start position:0%
if if this will become serve as
 
03:50:24.050 --> 03:50:24.060 align:start position:0%
precedent for for state government to
 
03:50:25.370 --> 03:50:25.380 align:start position:0%
get involved with right yeah I answer
 
03:50:27.710 --> 03:50:27.720 align:start position:0%
that question yeah yeah according to our
 
03:50:29.510 --> 03:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
legal advisor
 
03:50:31.429 --> 03:50:31.439 align:start position:0%
um and I will again I read this into the
 
03:50:31.439 --> 03:50:32.210 align:start position:0%
um and I will again I read this into the
record

03:50:32.210 --> 03:50:32.220 align:start position:0%
record
 
03:50:35.030 --> 03:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
um Let me let me go through it again
 
03:50:42.550 --> 03:50:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:45.290 --> 03:50:45.300 align:start position:0%
and I'll be happy to provide you with a
 
03:50:47.570 --> 03:50:47.580 align:start position:0%
copy of this legal analysis that might
 
03:50:49.490 --> 03:50:49.500 align:start position:0%
help answer the the questions better
 
03:50:52.070 --> 03:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
than I can do but aside from the
 
03:50:54.170 --> 03:50:54.180 align:start position:0%
legislature retaining the authority to
 
03:50:56.030 --> 03:50:56.040 align:start position:0%
do this
 
03:50:58.969 --> 03:50:58.979 align:start position:0%
um it it essentially says this law this
 
03:51:02.090 --> 03:51:02.100 align:start position:0%
is a local act it does not modify the
 
03:51:04.130 --> 03:51:04.140 align:start position:0%
general Provisions pertaining to other
 
03:51:06.110 --> 03:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District when it's
 
03:51:09.110 --> 03:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
all process and the reason that this is
 
03:51:11.510 --> 03:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
the case is this is a very unique set of
 
03:51:11.520 --> 03:51:13.130 align:start position:0%
the case is this is a very unique set of
facts

03:51:13.130 --> 03:51:13.140 align:start position:0%
facts
 
03:51:15.410 --> 03:51:15.420 align:start position:0%
we have a statute that created a village
 
03:51:15.420 --> 03:51:17.630 align:start position:0%
we have a statute that created a village
District

03:51:17.630 --> 03:51:17.640 align:start position:0%
District
 
03:51:19.729 --> 03:51:19.739 align:start position:0%
we've been leasing we built our own
 
03:51:19.739 --> 03:51:21.349 align:start position:0%
we've been leasing we built our own
School

03:51:21.349 --> 03:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
School
 
03:51:23.690 --> 03:51:23.700 align:start position:0%
trust about what eight million dollars
 
03:51:25.550 --> 03:51:25.560 align:start position:0%
back now two thousand
 
03:51:29.030 --> 03:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
it costs about five right we have a
 
03:51:31.670 --> 03:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
separate line item on our Town's tax
 
03:51:31.680 --> 03:51:33.290 align:start position:0%
separate line item on our Town's tax
bill

03:51:33.290 --> 03:51:33.300 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:51:36.229 --> 03:51:36.239 align:start position:0%
that you know where you have your local
 
03:51:38.330 --> 03:51:38.340 align:start position:0%
property tax your Statewide education
 
03:51:41.030 --> 03:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
property tax and the third line item is
 
03:51:43.070 --> 03:51:43.080 align:start position:0%
Village District tax
 
03:51:46.010 --> 03:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
and we tax our citizens to the tune of
 
03:51:49.670 --> 03:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
175 to 200 000 a year just Bridgewater
 
03:51:52.610 --> 03:51:52.620 align:start position:0%
and Hebron not the other five towns in
 
03:51:53.870 --> 03:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
the school district
 
03:51:56.269 --> 03:51:56.279 align:start position:0%
to take care of repair maintenance and
 
03:51:58.550 --> 03:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
Capital Improvements we've built a
 
03:52:01.370 --> 03:52:01.380 align:start position:0%
greenhouse industrial Greenhouse we put
 
03:52:04.550 --> 03:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
new roofs on new boilers the school the
 
03:52:06.769 --> 03:52:06.779 align:start position:0%
Newfound Area School District pays for
 
03:52:09.229 --> 03:52:09.239 align:start position:0%
the custodial services in their larger
 
03:52:11.929 --> 03:52:11.939 align:start position:0%
contract but our citizens are taxed and
 
03:52:15.229 --> 03:52:15.239 align:start position:0%
paid for the um upkeep and Capital
 
03:52:18.349 --> 03:52:18.359 align:start position:0%
Improvements of the school so if I may
 
03:52:21.050 --> 03:52:21.060 align:start position:0%
quote from our legal advisor at first
 
03:52:23.870 --> 03:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
blush there may be reluctance on the
 
03:52:26.570 --> 03:52:26.580 align:start position:0%
part of some to adopt this bill
 
03:52:28.849 --> 03:52:28.859 align:start position:0%
due to the fact that it creates a more
 
03:52:32.750 --> 03:52:32.760 align:start position:0%
nuanced withdrawal process however
 
03:52:35.870 --> 03:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
this bill applies to a local situation
 
03:52:39.590 --> 03:52:39.600 align:start position:0%
where a separate municipality owns the
 
03:52:41.870 --> 03:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
building in which the children are
 
03:52:45.729 --> 03:52:45.739 align:start position:0%
educated it is not capable of repetition
 
03:52:48.830 --> 03:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
and represents a truly unique set of
 
03:52:48.840 --> 03:52:50.690 align:start position:0%
and represents a truly unique set of
facts

03:52:50.690 --> 03:52:50.700 align:start position:0%
facts
 
03:52:52.849 --> 03:52:52.859 align:start position:0%
that's the best way I can answer your
 
03:52:58.190 --> 03:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
question yeah yeah no thanks and and
 
03:52:59.990 --> 03:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
and I guess
 
03:53:00.000 --> 03:53:00.710 align:start position:0%
and I guess
um

03:53:00.710 --> 03:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:04.510 --> 03:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
yeah don't wait wait short of
 
03:53:08.750 --> 03:53:08.760 align:start position:0%
well I I I guess it I mean it sounds it
 
03:53:12.170 --> 03:53:12.180 align:start position:0%
sounds pretty clear to me that that
 
03:53:15.769 --> 03:53:15.779 align:start position:0%
the the involvement of Bridgewater have
 
03:53:18.110 --> 03:53:18.120 align:start position:0%
run and and and
 
03:53:20.630 --> 03:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
um growth in in the Newfound Area School
 
03:53:24.050 --> 03:53:24.060 align:start position:0%
District isn't working out for the the
 
03:53:26.630 --> 03:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
the people in those three towns
 
03:53:30.110 --> 03:53:30.120 align:start position:0%
um and the students too and and so long
 
03:53:33.490 --> 03:53:33.500 align:start position:0%
bus rides we spend a lot of money
 
03:53:35.990 --> 03:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
maintaining school that's used
 
03:53:41.330 --> 03:53:41.340 align:start position:0%
four four K-5 for the district right for
 
03:53:44.929 --> 03:53:44.939 align:start position:0%
for the district including kids that
 
03:53:47.389 --> 03:53:47.399 align:start position:0%
live in other towns
 
03:53:47.399 --> 03:53:49.370 align:start position:0%
live in other towns
and

03:53:49.370 --> 03:53:49.380 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:53:52.370 --> 03:53:52.380 align:start position:0%
um and that
 
03:53:52.380 --> 03:53:54.650 align:start position:0%
um and that
that

03:53:54.650 --> 03:53:54.660 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:53:56.870 --> 03:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
essentially I mean what what appears to
 
03:54:00.530 --> 03:54:00.540 align:start position:0%
me and again I'm I'm I I sympathize with
 
03:54:04.309 --> 03:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
with your case but but I I can't
 
03:54:07.250 --> 03:54:07.260 align:start position:0%
separate this from from essentially an
 
03:54:11.809 --> 03:54:11.819 align:start position:0%
Ask of the legislature to intervene with
 
03:54:15.170 --> 03:54:15.180 align:start position:0%
a with an existing Cooperative uh
 
03:54:18.530 --> 03:54:18.540 align:start position:0%
agreement uh between each of the the
 
03:54:20.990 --> 03:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
three towns and the Newfound Area School
 
03:54:25.550 --> 03:54:25.560 align:start position:0%
District and and while I while I respect
 
03:54:27.229 --> 03:54:27.239 align:start position:0%
um Dean Eggert
 
03:54:29.689 --> 03:54:29.699 align:start position:0%
um you know his paragraph at first blush
 
03:54:32.510 --> 03:54:32.520 align:start position:0%
on this and and you know Dean's been our
 
03:54:34.550 --> 03:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
attorney in Hopkinton you know from from
 
03:54:38.929 --> 03:54:38.939 align:start position:0%
time to time too and and and I my wife's
 
03:54:41.809 --> 03:54:41.819 align:start position:0%
an attorney so a lawyer so I I
 
03:54:44.990 --> 03:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
understand you know what lawyers do
 
03:54:47.210 --> 03:54:47.220 align:start position:0%
um that that
 
03:54:47.220 --> 03:54:48.469 align:start position:0%
um that that
I'm

03:54:48.469 --> 03:54:48.479 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
03:54:51.110 --> 03:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
I I guess I'm not
 
03:54:53.710 --> 03:54:53.720 align:start position:0%
I I don't understand why this situation
 
03:54:59.110 --> 03:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
is any different than any other
 
03:55:02.630 --> 03:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District agreement
 
03:55:06.830 --> 03:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
by virtue of the the legality of the
 
03:55:09.729 --> 03:55:09.739 align:start position:0%
agreement itself and not by the
 
03:55:13.490 --> 03:55:13.500 align:start position:0%
situation of owning schools K-5 we pay
 
03:55:15.229 --> 03:55:15.239 align:start position:0%
for all the operating costs you know
 
03:55:17.809 --> 03:55:17.819 align:start position:0%
terms that that may have sounded good
 
03:55:20.570 --> 03:55:20.580 align:start position:0%
back when you got into the agreement but
 
03:55:22.370 --> 03:55:22.380 align:start position:0%
um you know back in
 
03:55:26.929 --> 03:55:26.939 align:start position:0%
97 back in 97 but but now have sort of
 
03:55:30.530 --> 03:55:30.540 align:start position:0%
worn thin and and I guess I I I don't
 
03:55:34.030 --> 03:55:34.040 align:start position:0%
see from attorney eggert's letter
 
03:55:38.570 --> 03:55:38.580 align:start position:0%
how the uh how the framework of the
 
03:55:40.929 --> 03:55:40.939 align:start position:0%
agreement is somehow
 
03:55:43.849 --> 03:55:43.859 align:start position:0%
different enough from the Frameworks and
 
03:55:45.710 --> 03:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
other agreement in other Co-op
 
03:55:47.689 --> 03:55:47.699 align:start position:0%
agreements throughout the state that
 
03:55:50.150 --> 03:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
would that would require
 
03:55:52.610 --> 03:55:52.620 align:start position:0%
um legislative uh
 
03:55:55.990 --> 03:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
uh action to to to
 
03:55:57.889 --> 03:55:57.899 align:start position:0%
essentially break the agreement because
 
03:56:00.349 --> 03:56:00.359 align:start position:0%
that's what's happening in in line six
 
03:56:03.530 --> 03:56:03.540 align:start position:0%
through eight all right make a comment
 
03:56:05.330 --> 03:56:05.340 align:start position:0%
uh first this is really good for kids
 
03:56:07.309 --> 03:56:07.319 align:start position:0%
right off the bat
 
03:56:10.010 --> 03:56:10.020 align:start position:0%
it was not a problem about having a vote
 
03:56:12.349 --> 03:56:12.359 align:start position:0%
of the school district when we turned
 
03:56:14.750 --> 03:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
around and suggested building a school
 
03:56:16.490 --> 03:56:16.500 align:start position:0%
and turning around and leasing it back
 
03:56:18.290 --> 03:56:18.300 align:start position:0%
to them and they've had educational
 
03:56:19.670 --> 03:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
control so we've had a very good
 
03:56:21.710 --> 03:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
separation of church and state we don't
 
03:56:23.809 --> 03:56:23.819 align:start position:0%
want to run a school however what
 
03:56:26.210 --> 03:56:26.220 align:start position:0%
happens now is is basically it's going
 
03:56:27.889 --> 03:56:27.899 align:start position:0%
you know it's like a helicopter at the
 
03:56:29.870 --> 03:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
same and no one's going to change this
 
03:56:31.130 --> 03:56:31.140 align:start position:0%
unless we turn around and make some
 
03:56:32.510 --> 03:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
changes we've wanted to work with the
 
03:56:33.889 --> 03:56:33.899 align:start position:0%
school district we will continue to work
 
03:56:35.330 --> 03:56:35.340 align:start position:0%
with the school district
 
03:56:37.550 --> 03:56:37.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of being being a separate
 
03:56:39.110 --> 03:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
District but they that's a home district
 
03:56:41.269 --> 03:56:41.279 align:start position:0%
and so no one's going to turn around and
 
03:56:42.830 --> 03:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
we have a history in the last 22 years
 
03:56:45.229 --> 03:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
of never ever turning them down for
 
03:56:47.990 --> 03:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
anything they wanted in that school
 
03:56:49.910 --> 03:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
okay and that will continue
 
03:56:52.070 --> 03:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
and it won't be on a piece of paper is
 
03:56:54.410 --> 03:56:54.420 align:start position:0%
because a little competition in this
 
03:56:56.090 --> 03:56:56.100 align:start position:0%
otherwise we're going to turn around and
 
03:56:57.710 --> 03:56:57.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to have the same exact mold
 
03:56:59.929 --> 03:56:59.939 align:start position:0%
that we have presently and nothing will
 
03:57:01.250 --> 03:57:01.260 align:start position:0%
move forward
 
03:57:03.410 --> 03:57:03.420 align:start position:0%
in these particular cases and they're
 
03:57:06.229 --> 03:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
already you know when there was we've
 
03:57:07.969 --> 03:57:07.979 align:start position:0%
lost 500 kids but at the time they were
 
03:57:10.010 --> 03:57:10.020 align:start position:0%
packed at the gills and the solution we
 
03:57:11.330 --> 03:57:11.340 align:start position:0%
came up with we couldn't get the other
 
03:57:13.849 --> 03:57:13.859 align:start position:0%
towns because of diverse this the way
 
03:57:16.010 --> 03:57:16.020 align:start position:0%
this seven Town district is pulling in
 
03:57:18.170 --> 03:57:18.180 align:start position:0%
different directions we had no way of
 
03:57:19.910 --> 03:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
turning around and solving the
 
03:57:21.889 --> 03:57:21.899 align:start position:0%
overcrowding that was at the time
 
03:57:24.650 --> 03:57:24.660 align:start position:0%
and so we came here because of that
 
03:57:27.530 --> 03:57:27.540 align:start position:0%
issue specifically and we've turned
 
03:57:29.870 --> 03:57:29.880 align:start position:0%
around and done a really unique job here
 
03:57:31.849 --> 03:57:31.859 align:start position:0%
and so all we're asking now is to
 
03:57:33.769 --> 03:57:33.779 align:start position:0%
continue that unique job and you'll find
 
03:57:35.450 --> 03:57:35.460 align:start position:0%
that when the other towns see that you
 
03:57:36.469 --> 03:57:36.479 align:start position:0%
can turn around and have a k through
 
03:57:39.590 --> 03:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
eight they will not vote for a K-8
 
03:57:42.110 --> 03:57:42.120 align:start position:0%
they've already turned us down two times
 
03:57:43.550 --> 03:57:43.560 align:start position:0%
and it will continue to stay okay
 
03:57:45.889 --> 03:57:45.899 align:start position:0%
through five and in fact we don't even
 
03:57:47.809 --> 03:57:47.819 align:start position:0%
know if they'll do that if and pull kids
 
03:57:49.849 --> 03:57:49.859 align:start position:0%
out of the school it's it isn't just
 
03:57:52.130 --> 03:57:52.140 align:start position:0%
that the other towns can come to the
 
03:57:54.410 --> 03:57:54.420 align:start position:0%
school of that no the the district
 
03:57:56.510 --> 03:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
agreement that we have presently turns
 
03:57:59.450 --> 03:57:59.460 align:start position:0%
around as an addendum effectively turns
 
03:58:01.370 --> 03:58:01.380 align:start position:0%
around and mandates that if they if if
 
03:58:04.189 --> 03:58:04.199 align:start position:0%
we only if I a number of kids in our
 
03:58:06.229 --> 03:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
school drops in half that school will
 
03:58:08.330 --> 03:58:08.340 align:start position:0%
always be full because they'll come in
 
03:58:10.309 --> 03:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
from the other towns to turn around and
 
03:58:12.050 --> 03:58:12.060 align:start position:0%
bust them in from say Bristol the next
 
03:58:14.450 --> 03:58:14.460 align:start position:0%
door neighbor or from Alexandria
 
03:58:16.729 --> 03:58:16.739 align:start position:0%
so it is not an evil thing it doesn't
 
03:58:17.750 --> 03:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
have anything that's going to have
 
03:58:20.570 --> 03:58:20.580 align:start position:0%
anybody else to turn around and try to
 
03:58:22.910 --> 03:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
Super exceed any of the authorities in
 
03:58:24.769 --> 03:58:24.779 align:start position:0%
any other District but at the very
 
03:58:26.929 --> 03:58:26.939 align:start position:0%
beginning we stepped outside of our
 
03:58:28.370 --> 03:58:28.380 align:start position:0%
agreements and if you can find it in
 
03:58:30.050 --> 03:58:30.060 align:start position:0%
communities that have stepped outside of
 
03:58:32.510 --> 03:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
their agreements voluntarily
 
03:58:34.910 --> 03:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
to do this but I can tell you that if we
 
03:58:36.410 --> 03:58:36.420 align:start position:0%
just turn around and go back and ask to
 
03:58:38.689 --> 03:58:38.699 align:start position:0%
do anything it comes down to the
 
03:58:41.269 --> 03:58:41.279 align:start position:0%
basically just one size fits all
 
03:58:43.250 --> 03:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
and it will not change and it's the
 
03:58:45.170 --> 03:58:45.180 align:start position:0%
other the other thing here is no one's
 
03:58:46.610 --> 03:58:46.620 align:start position:0%
going to get hurt by this and the ones
 
03:58:48.070 --> 03:58:48.080 align:start position:0%
that will benefit will be the children
 
03:58:50.990 --> 03:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
representative Lino again
 
03:58:52.729 --> 03:58:52.739 align:start position:0%
um Dean couldn't be here today because
 
03:58:54.950 --> 03:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
he was in poor so sort of at a
 
03:58:57.050 --> 03:58:57.060 align:start position:0%
disadvantage in trying to
 
03:59:00.710 --> 03:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
um explain his his big reasoning here
 
03:59:02.809 --> 03:59:02.819 align:start position:0%
but paragraph two in the letter is the
 
03:59:04.610 --> 03:59:04.620 align:start position:0%
best that I can do
 
03:59:04.620 --> 03:59:06.250 align:start position:0%
best that I can do
um

03:59:06.250 --> 03:59:06.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:09.290 --> 03:59:09.300 align:start position:0%
your question about the larger
 
03:59:11.570 --> 03:59:11.580 align:start position:0%
Cooperative School District he says that
 
03:59:13.070 --> 03:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
this corrects
 
03:59:15.769 --> 03:59:15.779 align:start position:0%
a unique flaw in The Cooperative
 
03:59:19.070 --> 03:59:19.080 align:start position:0%
withdrawal process because the nature of
 
03:59:21.889 --> 03:59:21.899 align:start position:0%
our separate political entity there's no
 
03:59:24.590 --> 03:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
other place in the in the state that has
 
03:59:27.469 --> 03:59:27.479 align:start position:0%
a village District that built and owns
 
03:59:29.809 --> 03:59:29.819 align:start position:0%
and operates its own School maintenance
 
03:59:32.150 --> 03:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
wise and repair wise and has three
 
03:59:34.250 --> 03:59:34.260 align:start position:0%
elected Commissioners so he thinks that
 
03:59:37.309 --> 03:59:37.319 align:start position:0%
this bill will correct that flaw and
 
03:59:40.550 --> 03:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
realign us with the statutes that are
 
03:59:42.950 --> 03:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
for Cooperative school districts all
 
03:59:45.650 --> 03:59:45.660 align:start position:0%
right and by by rearranging our
 
03:59:47.630 --> 03:59:47.640 align:start position:0%
relationship with the Bridgewater Hebron
 
03:59:49.550 --> 03:59:49.560 align:start position:0%
Village District that three
 
03:59:52.070 --> 03:59:52.080 align:start position:0%
Commissioners that are elected for
 
03:59:53.630 --> 03:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
certain number of terms two and three
 
03:59:55.070 --> 03:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
and four year terms
 
03:59:57.290 --> 03:59:57.300 align:start position:0%
that's the best explanation I can give
 
03:59:59.630 --> 03:59:59.640 align:start position:0%
to your answer and it's unfortunate that
 
04:00:01.370 --> 04:00:01.380 align:start position:0%
he's in court today because I think he
 
04:00:02.929 --> 04:00:02.939 align:start position:0%
would have been able to expound a little
 
04:00:05.090 --> 04:00:05.100 align:start position:0%
bit more on that but paragraph two I
 
04:00:07.550 --> 04:00:07.560 align:start position:0%
think is an attempt to answer your your
 
04:00:07.560 --> 04:00:09.769 align:start position:0%
think is an attempt to answer your your
question

04:00:09.769 --> 04:00:09.779 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:00:14.870 --> 04:00:14.880 align:start position:0%
Mr Looney um back in 1997
 
04:00:18.110 --> 04:00:18.120 align:start position:0%
when HB 436 then
 
04:00:21.830 --> 04:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
identified this special Village District
 
04:00:24.889 --> 04:00:24.899 align:start position:0%
was there any discussion done that you
 
04:00:27.769 --> 04:00:27.779 align:start position:0%
may know I I see Senator Rubens was on
 
04:00:31.010 --> 04:00:31.020 align:start position:0%
he's still around but was there any
 
04:00:31.020 --> 04:00:32.229 align:start position:0%
he's still around but was there any
um

04:00:32.229 --> 04:00:32.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:35.870 --> 04:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
any discussion regarding Maybe
 
04:00:39.889 --> 04:00:39.899 align:start position:0%
making it also a school district
 
04:00:41.929 --> 04:00:41.939 align:start position:0%
at the same time
 
04:00:44.530 --> 04:00:44.540 align:start position:0%
not at that time not at that time okay
 
04:00:47.630 --> 04:00:47.640 align:start position:0%
is there anything in this legislation
 
04:00:50.990 --> 04:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
that's going to be detrimental to
 
04:00:54.349 --> 04:00:54.359 align:start position:0%
Newfound no no we don't think so it's
 
04:00:56.689 --> 04:00:56.699 align:start position:0%
because we own our own school there's
 
04:00:58.610 --> 04:00:58.620 align:start position:0%
going to be no settlement of assets and
 
04:01:00.710 --> 04:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
liabilities we don't have to buy our
 
04:01:02.389 --> 04:01:02.399 align:start position:0%
school back
 
04:01:04.370 --> 04:01:04.380 align:start position:0%
um and we had we presented testimony
 
04:01:08.210 --> 04:01:08.220 align:start position:0%
representative Leno um on at the hearing
 
04:01:10.610 --> 04:01:10.620 align:start position:0%
where we have a we have actually an
 
04:01:13.010 --> 04:01:13.020 align:start position:0%
elected budget Newfound Area School
 
04:01:14.870 --> 04:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
District budget official behind me and
 
04:01:17.809 --> 04:01:17.819 align:start position:0%
then the Bridgewater elected budget
 
04:01:17.819 --> 04:01:19.370 align:start position:0%
then the Bridgewater elected budget
committee

04:01:19.370 --> 04:01:19.380 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:01:22.630 --> 04:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
um person presented a
 
04:01:26.510 --> 04:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
budget issue or the economic aspects of
 
04:01:28.370 --> 04:01:28.380 align:start position:0%
this by saying we're simply going to
 
04:01:28.380 --> 04:01:29.510 align:start position:0%
this by saying we're simply going to
shift

04:01:29.510 --> 04:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
shift
 
04:01:32.210 --> 04:01:32.220 align:start position:0%
the costs the operational cost of our
 
04:01:33.530 --> 04:01:33.540 align:start position:0%
three towns
 
04:01:35.929 --> 04:01:35.939 align:start position:0%
I believe the budget person who
 
04:01:39.229 --> 04:01:39.239 align:start position:0%
testified said that right now our three
 
04:01:41.809 --> 04:01:41.819 align:start position:0%
towns are 15 percent
 
04:01:45.710 --> 04:01:45.720 align:start position:0%
of the student population in the greater
 
04:01:48.590 --> 04:01:48.600 align:start position:0%
Newfound Area School District and we
 
04:01:51.889 --> 04:01:51.899 align:start position:0%
represent about 16 percent of the cost
 
04:01:53.750 --> 04:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
so we thought this through very
 
04:01:56.809 --> 04:01:56.819 align:start position:0%
carefully and if we're allowed to create
 
04:01:58.790 --> 04:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
our own School District to correct that
 
04:02:01.490 --> 04:02:01.500 align:start position:0%
deficiency that Dean Eggert pointed out
 
04:02:06.410 --> 04:02:06.420 align:start position:0%
that flaw then there's little to no cost
 
04:02:08.990 --> 04:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
to the Newfound Area School District in
 
04:02:10.969 --> 04:02:10.979 align:start position:0%
fact There's an opportunity for them
 
04:02:13.550 --> 04:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
because we would have to enter into
 
04:02:16.130 --> 04:02:16.140 align:start position:0%
tuition agreements to send our high
 
04:02:19.490 --> 04:02:19.500 align:start position:0%
school kids to Newfound or Plymouth and
 
04:02:21.650 --> 04:02:21.660 align:start position:0%
we have approximately 47 high school
 
04:02:23.389 --> 04:02:23.399 align:start position:0%
kids that would equate to if you use
 
04:02:25.130 --> 04:02:25.140 align:start position:0%
nineteen thousand five hundred that
 
04:02:26.809 --> 04:02:26.819 align:start position:0%
would create a revenue stream for
 
04:02:28.429 --> 04:02:28.439 align:start position:0%
Newfound Area School District of about
 
04:02:30.710 --> 04:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
eight hundred thousand dollars a year
 
04:02:33.410 --> 04:02:33.420 align:start position:0%
we also have in the bill that we would
 
04:02:35.389 --> 04:02:35.399 align:start position:0%
enter into service contracts with the
 
04:02:37.010 --> 04:02:37.020 align:start position:0%
Newfound Area School District because we
 
04:02:38.750 --> 04:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
would be a small a smaller School
 
04:02:41.210 --> 04:02:41.220 align:start position:0%
District geographically and with student
 
04:02:44.990 --> 04:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
enrollment where we would pay them
 
04:02:48.530 --> 04:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
to handle all of our back office work
 
04:02:51.769 --> 04:02:51.779 align:start position:0%
and we know from our I mean Hebron has
 
04:02:54.110 --> 04:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
500 people folks it's a small little
 
04:02:54.120 --> 04:02:55.490 align:start position:0%
500 people folks it's a small little
town

04:02:55.490 --> 04:02:55.500 align:start position:0%
town
 
04:02:57.349 --> 04:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
um you know Groton has about the salmon
 
04:02:59.389 --> 04:02:59.399 align:start position:0%
I think Bridgewater has about about a
 
04:03:01.130 --> 04:03:01.140 align:start position:0%
thousands about a thousand
 
04:03:03.050 --> 04:03:03.060 align:start position:0%
so it's a small community and we know
 
04:03:06.170 --> 04:03:06.180 align:start position:0%
and our our citizens know that we would
 
04:03:08.410 --> 04:03:08.420 align:start position:0%
have to in fact raise taxes to do this
 
04:03:11.870 --> 04:03:11.880 align:start position:0%
we want to put an addition on the school
 
04:03:13.429 --> 04:03:13.439 align:start position:0%
we think it would cost us about a
 
04:03:15.590 --> 04:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
million a million and a half dollars the
 
04:03:18.889 --> 04:03:18.899 align:start position:0%
pl the school was built in 2000 with
 
04:03:21.530 --> 04:03:21.540 align:start position:0%
expansion in mind the plumbing is
 
04:03:22.969 --> 04:03:22.979 align:start position:0%
already in the ground there's two
 
04:03:24.950 --> 04:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
boilers all the HVAC is you know the
 
04:03:27.290 --> 04:03:27.300 align:start position:0%
plumbing is ready to go so we our
 
04:03:30.110 --> 04:03:30.120 align:start position:0%
citizens are willing to raise taxes to
 
04:03:31.910 --> 04:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
put an addition on the school to create
 
04:03:34.309 --> 04:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
a k through eight again for all the
 
04:03:36.469 --> 04:03:36.479 align:start position:0%
education reasons that are people who
 
04:03:38.750 --> 04:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
came and testified a few weeks ago on
 
04:03:41.630 --> 04:03:41.640 align:start position:0%
why a K-8 is a good idea so we're
 
04:03:44.269 --> 04:03:44.279 align:start position:0%
willing to put the cost for all this
 
04:03:46.910 --> 04:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
but we need something to enable this to
 
04:03:46.920 --> 04:03:48.290 align:start position:0%
but we need something to enable this to
happen

04:03:48.290 --> 04:03:48.300 align:start position:0%
happen
 
04:03:53.150 --> 04:03:53.160 align:start position:0%
um because where as as selectman Murphy
 
04:03:55.969 --> 04:03:55.979 align:start position:0%
said we're in a situation now by this
 
04:03:57.469 --> 04:03:57.479 align:start position:0%
unique situation where we not only own
 
04:03:58.670 --> 04:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
our own school but we have this
 
04:04:00.469 --> 04:04:00.479 align:start position:0%
political subdivision what we're simply
 
04:04:03.889 --> 04:04:03.899 align:start position:0%
trying to do is expand on that to create
 
04:04:07.510 --> 04:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
a official School District
 
04:04:09.950 --> 04:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you thank you
 
04:04:13.490 --> 04:04:13.500 align:start position:0%
um you you just mentioned that um that
 
04:04:15.410 --> 04:04:15.420 align:start position:0%
if you were separate districts and you
 
04:04:16.910 --> 04:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
you certainly wouldn't you'd have a k
 
04:04:19.250 --> 04:04:19.260 align:start position:0%
solution within the district but you'd
 
04:04:22.910 --> 04:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
need a a 912 uh nine to twelve High
 
04:04:24.950 --> 04:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
School solution and and one of those
 
04:04:26.929 --> 04:04:26.939 align:start position:0%
could be tuitioning
 
04:04:30.050 --> 04:04:30.060 align:start position:0%
um back to the Newfound Area School
 
04:04:32.689 --> 04:04:32.699 align:start position:0%
District High School uh at a cost of
 
04:04:34.189 --> 04:04:34.199 align:start position:0%
maybe around eight hundred thousand
 
04:04:37.250 --> 04:04:37.260 align:start position:0%
dollars how much currently is um are the
 
04:04:40.490 --> 04:04:40.500 align:start position:0%
three towns contributing revenue-wise so
 
04:04:43.969 --> 04:04:43.979 align:start position:0%
local property tax wise to the um to the
 
04:04:47.330 --> 04:04:47.340 align:start position:0%
uh uh to the the new fund District
 
04:04:49.670 --> 04:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
what's the question you have no I think
 
04:04:51.590 --> 04:04:51.600 align:start position:0%
you wanted to know which each Town
 
04:04:53.450 --> 04:04:53.460 align:start position:0%
contributes yeah just just sort of
 
04:04:56.870 --> 04:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
roughly yeah of this in ADM system it's
 
04:04:58.670 --> 04:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
100 ADM
 
04:05:00.410 --> 04:05:00.420 align:start position:0%
so there is no there's no property
 
04:05:02.689 --> 04:05:02.699 align:start position:0%
values associated with it that's in your
 
04:05:04.070 --> 04:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
agreement there's articles of agreement
 
04:05:06.170 --> 04:05:06.180 align:start position:0%
well is this potty that's in the
 
04:05:08.570 --> 04:05:08.580 align:start position:0%
Articles of agreement uh per pupils all
 
04:05:11.330 --> 04:05:11.340 align:start position:0%
based on ADM yes
 
04:05:14.570 --> 04:05:14.580 align:start position:0%
so representative and I I if I hear your
 
04:05:16.309 --> 04:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
question correctly
 
04:05:20.570 --> 04:05:20.580 align:start position:0%
if you take our local property tax
 
04:05:23.150 --> 04:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
the Statewide education property tax and
 
04:05:25.189 --> 04:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
then the separate tax that Bridgewater
 
04:05:29.210 --> 04:05:29.220 align:start position:0%
and Hebron have to maintain the struggle
 
04:05:32.269 --> 04:05:32.279 align:start position:0%
um we have 48 students
 
04:05:34.670 --> 04:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
and that equates to about twenty one
 
04:05:36.410 --> 04:05:36.420 align:start position:0%
thousand seven hundred and sixty nine
 
04:05:39.590 --> 04:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per student to
 
04:05:41.689 --> 04:05:41.699 align:start position:0%
um that we contribute to the Newfound
 
04:05:43.790 --> 04:05:43.800 align:start position:0%
Area School District
 
04:05:48.429 --> 04:05:48.439 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater is about 19 285 and Hebron
 
04:05:51.050 --> 04:05:51.060 align:start position:0%
correction Groton is about
 
04:05:53.210 --> 04:05:53.220 align:start position:0%
um thirteen thousand fourteen thousand
 
04:05:53.220 --> 04:05:54.229 align:start position:0%
um thirteen thousand fourteen thousand
dollars

04:05:54.229 --> 04:05:54.239 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:05:57.110 --> 04:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
so that's how much we currently
 
04:05:59.269 --> 04:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
contribute so it's a lot more than eight
 
04:06:00.830 --> 04:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars in in the
 
04:06:04.070 --> 04:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
aggregate not eight hundred thousand it
 
04:06:06.170 --> 04:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
depends on what the tuition agreement
 
04:06:13.990 --> 04:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:17.510 --> 04:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
do you know if um if the Newfound Area
 
04:06:20.330 --> 04:06:20.340 align:start position:0%
School District currently has any debt
 
04:06:23.210 --> 04:06:23.220 align:start position:0%
I think it's I think they're out of debt
 
04:06:23.220 --> 04:06:24.490 align:start position:0%
I think it's I think they're out of debt
so

04:06:24.490 --> 04:06:24.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:06:26.809 --> 04:06:26.819 align:start position:0%
even if they weren't we'd be obligated
 
04:06:29.330 --> 04:06:29.340 align:start position:0%
to turn around and pay that portion off
 
04:06:32.750 --> 04:06:32.760 align:start position:0%
and we did they did a um uh it's quite a
 
04:06:33.889 --> 04:06:33.899 align:start position:0%
while ago now so it should have been
 
04:06:36.110 --> 04:06:36.120 align:start position:0%
amatized by now they turned around and
 
04:06:37.849 --> 04:06:37.859 align:start position:0%
did some upgrades in their heating
 
04:06:40.130 --> 04:06:40.140 align:start position:0%
systems across all their schools and
 
04:06:42.170 --> 04:06:42.180 align:start position:0%
then bonded it up in 20 or 30 years I
 
04:06:43.910 --> 04:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
think it's all paid for but even if that
 
04:06:45.950 --> 04:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
wasn't the case we would turn around and
 
04:06:47.809 --> 04:06:47.819 align:start position:0%
that would be Our obligation to pay that
 
04:06:51.170 --> 04:06:51.180 align:start position:0%
off the um what effectively this does is
 
04:06:53.570 --> 04:06:53.580 align:start position:0%
to turn around and and make a
 
04:06:55.610 --> 04:06:55.620 align:start position:0%
seven-member board a four and a
 
04:06:57.889 --> 04:06:57.899 align:start position:0%
three-member board and by that you get
 
04:06:59.750 --> 04:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
you're making the decision making a
 
04:07:01.189 --> 04:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
little cleaner and easier to work with
 
04:07:03.110 --> 04:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
you know how it is and just getting
 
04:07:05.150 --> 04:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
agreements in committees when they're
 
04:07:07.729 --> 04:07:07.739 align:start position:0%
large and they also have different
 
04:07:09.229 --> 04:07:09.239 align:start position:0%
points of view because we're so far
 
04:07:12.050 --> 04:07:12.060 align:start position:0%
apart so this improves decision making
 
04:07:14.090 --> 04:07:14.100 align:start position:0%
it improves the ability to turn onto a
 
04:07:15.950 --> 04:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
different model and has that different
 
04:07:18.290 --> 04:07:18.300 align:start position:0%
model if it's and I believe it'll be
 
04:07:20.750 --> 04:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
successful uh would turn around and
 
04:07:22.309 --> 04:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
motivate the other towns to do different
 
04:07:23.870 --> 04:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
things when we moved in into this
 
04:07:27.170 --> 04:07:27.180 align:start position:0%
agreement uh schools went up and schools
 
04:07:29.570 --> 04:07:29.580 align:start position:0%
are significantly high in the school and
 
04:07:31.910 --> 04:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
it's helped the elementary schools and
 
04:07:33.410 --> 04:07:33.420 align:start position:0%
and pull up their stuff so there's been
 
04:07:36.469 --> 04:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
no negative downturn on this at all so
 
04:07:39.349 --> 04:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
in terms of past history and there's no
 
04:07:41.929 --> 04:07:41.939 align:start position:0%
intention for us quite frankly uh I'm
 
04:07:44.389 --> 04:07:44.399 align:start position:0%
the one that says you know I don't think
 
04:07:45.950 --> 04:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
anybody wants to run a school they're
 
04:07:48.170 --> 04:07:48.180 align:start position:0%
very very difficult very complicated to
 
04:07:50.330 --> 04:07:50.340 align:start position:0%
run a school but they've done a really
 
04:07:52.969 --> 04:07:52.979 align:start position:0%
good job in a physical plant and all we
 
04:07:54.530 --> 04:07:54.540 align:start position:0%
want to do is facilitate that and move
 
04:07:56.990 --> 04:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
forward without hurting anybody else and
 
04:07:59.330 --> 04:07:59.340 align:start position:0%
no one is going to get it and that I
 
04:08:01.790 --> 04:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
think is obviously the the sense of
 
04:08:04.729 --> 04:08:04.739 align:start position:0%
concern that that that we have not being
 
04:08:07.309 --> 04:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
feet on the ground you know on what's
 
04:08:10.490 --> 04:08:10.500 align:start position:0%
going on here any senses to what the the
 
04:08:12.170 --> 04:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
um and I know I'm getting down to the
 
04:08:13.910 --> 04:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
weeds I apologize for the members of the
 
04:08:15.590 --> 04:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
committee to to
 
04:08:17.349 --> 04:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
um and Mr chair
 
04:08:20.809 --> 04:08:20.819 align:start position:0%
of equalized property valuations per
 
04:08:24.469 --> 04:08:24.479 align:start position:0%
pupil and how that may um may be
 
04:08:25.849 --> 04:08:25.859 align:start position:0%
different across and I don't even know
 
04:08:27.950 --> 04:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
how many member towns there are the
 
04:08:31.010 --> 04:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
Newfoundland School District but but um
 
04:08:34.309 --> 04:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
uh for example this committee has heard
 
04:08:36.710 --> 04:08:36.720 align:start position:0%
testimony about how when Cooperative
 
04:08:39.110 --> 04:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
districts of many Cooperative districts
 
04:08:41.870 --> 04:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
were originally formed
 
04:08:44.210 --> 04:08:44.220 align:start position:0%
um many of the districts included some
 
04:08:46.550 --> 04:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
towns with with high property values
 
04:08:48.769 --> 04:08:48.779 align:start position:0%
along with some towns with low property
 
04:08:52.090 --> 04:08:52.100 align:start position:0%
values and that was designed to to to
 
04:08:55.130 --> 04:08:55.140 align:start position:0%
make make
 
04:08:59.090 --> 04:08:59.100 align:start position:0%
Public School more affordable to to all
 
04:09:01.550 --> 04:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
of the towns involved so when we're
 
04:09:04.670 --> 04:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
talking about about withdrawal from a
 
04:09:06.650 --> 04:09:06.660 align:start position:0%
from a district
 
04:09:09.410 --> 04:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm wondering about what's what's
 
04:09:11.750 --> 04:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
being withdrawn and what's what's left
 
04:09:15.830 --> 04:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
and what that does to property taxes in
 
04:09:19.550 --> 04:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
the communities that are left and
 
04:09:23.090 --> 04:09:23.100 align:start position:0%
you know I for one would want to see a
 
04:09:25.429 --> 04:09:25.439 align:start position:0%
much much more detailed analysis we've
 
04:09:27.590 --> 04:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
already done that yeah no I'm I'm not
 
04:09:28.910 --> 04:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
but I'm just saying that we just had it
 
04:09:32.330 --> 04:09:32.340 align:start position:0%
we just had a review of the property tax
 
04:09:35.330 --> 04:09:35.340 align:start position:0%
system through the towns and we set up a
 
04:09:37.070 --> 04:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
separate study committee for that study
 
04:09:39.170 --> 04:09:39.180 align:start position:0%
committee came back with effectively no
 
04:09:40.670 --> 04:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
decision because the current one is the
 
04:09:41.870 --> 04:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
fairest one that we could come up with
 
04:09:44.929 --> 04:09:44.939 align:start position:0%
which is everyone pays between 19 to 21
 
04:09:48.530 --> 04:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
000 in spite of evaluations around if I
 
04:09:49.790 --> 04:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
was to ask which has the biggest
 
04:09:52.370 --> 04:09:52.380 align:start position:0%
evaluation it would actually be that the
 
04:09:54.830 --> 04:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
adjoining town of Bristol but if I ask
 
04:09:56.990 --> 04:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
people what who is the richest town
 
04:09:58.550 --> 04:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
around the continent and support then
 
04:09:59.750 --> 04:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
they'd say it would be Bridgewater or
 
04:10:00.950 --> 04:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
Heber because of the tax rate
 
04:10:04.429 --> 04:10:04.439 align:start position:0%
differences so even even because the psf
 
04:10:06.469 --> 04:10:06.479 align:start position:0%
tax rate differences the tax rate is
 
04:10:08.689 --> 04:10:08.699 align:start position:0%
lower in Bridgewater and Hebron and but
 
04:10:10.550 --> 04:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
the tax base and Bristol is quite a bit
 
04:10:10.560 --> 04:10:11.510 align:start position:0%
the tax base and Bristol is quite a bit
higher

04:10:11.510 --> 04:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
higher
 
04:10:14.510 --> 04:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
but in general that we already reviewed
 
04:10:17.210 --> 04:10:17.220 align:start position:0%
that uh in the study committee that was
 
04:10:19.189 --> 04:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
uh brought up and we just finished back
 
04:10:21.710 --> 04:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
in August and a report was put out so
 
04:10:23.689 --> 04:10:23.699 align:start position:0%
that you know as far as
 
04:10:25.849 --> 04:10:25.859 align:start position:0%
um will it have an impact on the
 
04:10:27.530 --> 04:10:27.540 align:start position:0%
Newfound Area School District that will
 
04:10:30.250 --> 04:10:30.260 align:start position:0%
have no Financial impact whatsoever
 
04:10:34.729 --> 04:10:34.739 align:start position:0%
so no not no tax no impact and
 
04:10:36.590 --> 04:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
representative I know on your earlier
 
04:10:36.600 --> 04:10:38.030 align:start position:0%
representative I know on your earlier
question

04:10:38.030 --> 04:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:10:41.090 --> 04:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
um on on tuition agreements currently
 
04:10:43.130 --> 04:10:43.140 align:start position:0%
the Newfound high school has a capacity
 
04:10:46.450 --> 04:10:46.460 align:start position:0%
for uh 500 students
 
04:10:49.910 --> 04:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
320 are enrolled right now and while 40
 
04:10:52.070 --> 04:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
of that 320 are the high school kids
 
04:10:54.349 --> 04:10:54.359 align:start position:0%
from our town so there's a there's a big
 
04:10:57.650 --> 04:10:57.660 align:start position:0%
hole there and we have said in all of
 
04:10:59.870 --> 04:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
our we we've spoken to
 
04:11:03.490 --> 04:11:03.500 align:start position:0%
um we provided Point papers data
 
04:11:05.809 --> 04:11:05.819 align:start position:0%
analyzes to our three school board
 
04:11:07.849 --> 04:11:07.859 align:start position:0%
members from Bridgewater Hebron and
 
04:11:10.010 --> 04:11:10.020 align:start position:0%
Groton and
 
04:11:13.250 --> 04:11:13.260 align:start position:0%
um we think that by going to this having
 
04:11:15.670 --> 04:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
this legislation to help us move along
 
04:11:18.889 --> 04:11:18.899 align:start position:0%
we do it in complete cooperation with
 
04:11:21.410 --> 04:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
the Newfound Area School District we had
 
04:11:23.450 --> 04:11:23.460 align:start position:0%
a budget person come in with the
 
04:11:25.189 --> 04:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
analysis during the hearing and saying
 
04:11:27.170 --> 04:11:27.180 align:start position:0%
there's little to no cost
 
04:11:29.450 --> 04:11:29.460 align:start position:0%
um economic cost to the Newfound area
 
04:11:31.670 --> 04:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
school district and the education
 
04:11:34.250 --> 04:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
outcomes we know from studies about k
 
04:11:37.370 --> 04:11:37.380 align:start position:0%
through eight are just you know huge so
 
04:11:39.229 --> 04:11:39.239 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation will help us
 
04:11:41.750 --> 04:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
start the ball rolling and we fully
 
04:11:43.729 --> 04:11:43.739 align:start position:0%
intend to work in Total cooperation with
 
04:11:45.469 --> 04:11:45.479 align:start position:0%
the Newfound Area School District if
 
04:11:47.510 --> 04:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
this legislation is passed and that's
 
04:11:50.269 --> 04:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
why there's a four-year period and so
 
04:11:53.210 --> 04:11:53.220 align:start position:0%
many steps that you have to go through
 
04:11:56.450 --> 04:11:56.460 align:start position:0%
um so that's where we are we've done a
 
04:11:58.309 --> 04:11:58.319 align:start position:0%
lot of the analysis already but our the
 
04:12:00.950 --> 04:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
bill will actually authorizes our
 
04:12:03.050 --> 04:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
selectment in our three towns to set up
 
04:12:05.929 --> 04:12:05.939 align:start position:0%
committees right to take the data that
 
04:12:07.490 --> 04:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
we've already done
 
04:12:10.309 --> 04:12:10.319 align:start position:0%
to try to have this best outcome for our
 
04:12:13.309 --> 04:12:13.319 align:start position:0%
kids and then they will expand on that
 
04:12:15.710 --> 04:12:15.720 align:start position:0%
step by step according to this piece of
 
04:12:17.750 --> 04:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
legislation I hope that helps yeah well
 
04:12:20.030 --> 04:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm I'm certain that that that
 
04:12:22.550 --> 04:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
the three towns are going to do a very
 
04:12:25.849 --> 04:12:25.859 align:start position:0%
competent and and solid job of that I'm
 
04:12:28.250 --> 04:12:28.260 align:start position:0%
worried about what happens in in the
 
04:12:31.670 --> 04:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
other towns and and and I'm sorry I I
 
04:12:36.110 --> 04:12:36.120 align:start position:0%
missed what you're are you with I I am a
 
04:12:39.590 --> 04:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
I was appointed by my town to serve on
 
04:12:41.630 --> 04:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
the study committee that looked at the
 
04:12:44.150 --> 04:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
apportionment formula then the district
 
04:12:44.160 --> 04:12:45.530 align:start position:0%
apportionment formula then the district
commissioners

04:12:45.530 --> 04:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
04:12:50.450 --> 04:12:50.460 align:start position:0%
asked me to continue that work
 
04:12:52.550 --> 04:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
um because of the knowledge that I
 
04:12:53.990 --> 04:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
gained from serving on that committee
 
04:12:56.150 --> 04:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
for seven months to continue to assist
 
04:12:59.889 --> 04:12:59.899 align:start position:0%
in this legislative okay and and um and
 
04:13:05.689 --> 04:13:05.699 align:start position:0%
have has what was was is the this
 
04:13:08.150 --> 04:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
legislation here was this developed in
 
04:13:10.670 --> 04:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
collaboration with with let's say the
 
04:13:12.290 --> 04:13:12.300 align:start position:0%
superintendent and the business
 
04:13:14.870 --> 04:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
administrator at Newfound area the chain
 
04:13:17.389 --> 04:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
of Commander if you want a retired naval
 
04:13:19.490 --> 04:13:19.500 align:start position:0%
officer um was the village District
 
04:13:23.110 --> 04:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
commission yep took this upon themselves
 
04:13:25.910 --> 04:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
to ask to start the legislative relief
 
04:13:28.490 --> 04:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
so has this committee heard oh that's
 
04:13:30.170 --> 04:13:30.180 align:start position:0%
that's yeah you know you're getting a
 
04:13:31.729 --> 04:13:31.739 align:start position:0%
dialogue going in yeah no I know I
 
04:13:34.729 --> 04:13:34.739 align:start position:0%
appreciate it um yeah so I make one
 
04:13:36.889 --> 04:13:36.899 align:start position:0%
comment we we ended up in two different
 
04:13:39.889 --> 04:13:39.899 align:start position:0%
occasions in the last 20 years to ask to
 
04:13:41.210 --> 04:13:41.220 align:start position:0%
turn around and convert the school to a
 
04:13:43.910 --> 04:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
k through k through eight
 
04:13:45.650 --> 04:13:45.660 align:start position:0%
um and and both you know and the second
 
04:13:48.229 --> 04:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
one was in terms of withdrawal we
 
04:13:49.849 --> 04:13:49.859 align:start position:0%
withdrew from the whole idea when
 
04:13:52.010 --> 04:13:52.020 align:start position:0%
because there was a possibility that the
 
04:13:54.050 --> 04:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
other school can the kids from the other
 
04:13:55.910 --> 04:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
towns that come to that presently come
 
04:13:58.309 --> 04:13:58.319 align:start position:0%
to that school they would not come which
 
04:14:00.290 --> 04:14:00.300 align:start position:0%
we found that kind of unusual
 
04:14:02.689 --> 04:14:02.699 align:start position:0%
but at that time we withdrew from it
 
04:14:04.729 --> 04:14:04.739 align:start position:0%
because the history has been a really
 
04:14:07.010 --> 04:14:07.020 align:start position:0%
good relationship there's no reason to
 
04:14:08.210 --> 04:14:08.220 align:start position:0%
turn around and think that this is going
 
04:14:11.269 --> 04:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
to hurt anybody and the only there we
 
04:14:13.729 --> 04:14:13.739 align:start position:0%
will not be able to go to K-8 I've been
 
04:14:17.030 --> 04:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
a Stockman for 45 years
 
04:14:18.950 --> 04:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
and God only knows how I did that but
 
04:14:22.010 --> 04:14:22.020 align:start position:0%
but anyways and the commissioner on this
 
04:14:22.020 --> 04:14:22.969 align:start position:0%
but anyways and the commissioner on this
thing

04:14:22.969 --> 04:14:22.979 align:start position:0%
thing
 
04:14:26.330 --> 04:14:26.340 align:start position:0%
this this gives people some choice
 
04:14:28.309 --> 04:14:28.319 align:start position:0%
it's not at the expense of anybody else
 
04:14:29.929 --> 04:14:29.939 align:start position:0%
and if it was at the expense of anybody
 
04:14:32.750 --> 04:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
else I wouldn't be here right now it's
 
04:14:34.550 --> 04:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
not gonna it's gonna be neutral we had
 
04:14:35.990 --> 04:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
no reason to turn around and have to
 
04:14:38.269 --> 04:14:38.279 align:start position:0%
step outside the contractor the initial
 
04:14:38.279 --> 04:14:39.710 align:start position:0%
step outside the contractor the initial
Charter

04:14:39.710 --> 04:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
Charter
 
04:14:41.570 --> 04:14:41.580 align:start position:0%
um they already have another school
 
04:14:43.729 --> 04:14:43.739 align:start position:0%
district in this which is the Hill
 
04:14:46.010 --> 04:14:46.020 align:start position:0%
School District that stepped away from
 
04:14:49.130 --> 04:14:49.140 align:start position:0%
Franklin and then they tuition into the
 
04:14:51.290 --> 04:14:51.300 align:start position:0%
sixth through the 6th through 12th grade
 
04:14:54.170 --> 04:14:54.180 align:start position:0%
in Newfound Area School District so this
 
04:14:55.969 --> 04:14:55.979 align:start position:0%
is not something that it and in fact
 
04:14:57.050 --> 04:14:57.060 align:start position:0%
they're trying to get them to join
 
04:14:58.309 --> 04:14:58.319 align:start position:0%
apparently but I don't know what the
 
04:15:00.349 --> 04:15:00.359 align:start position:0%
politics of that are there is nothing
 
04:15:02.269 --> 04:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
that has ever gone on in this that has
 
04:15:03.590 --> 04:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
turned around a bit at the expense of
 
04:15:04.969 --> 04:15:04.979 align:start position:0%
another town
 
04:15:08.210 --> 04:15:08.220 align:start position:0%
ever this legislation was crafted just
 
04:15:10.849 --> 04:15:10.859 align:start position:0%
to do the exact same thing not to impact
 
04:15:13.550 --> 04:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
negatively either education wise or cost
 
04:15:16.130 --> 04:15:16.140 align:start position:0%
of taxes or anything else so that we can
 
04:15:17.689 --> 04:15:17.699 align:start position:0%
turn around and move forward and be a
 
04:15:19.729 --> 04:15:19.739 align:start position:0%
leader in the education business
 
04:15:21.769 --> 04:15:21.779 align:start position:0%
and it gives parents some choice and if
 
04:15:23.630 --> 04:15:23.640 align:start position:0%
parents if they if we have open seats
 
04:15:25.130 --> 04:15:25.140 align:start position:0%
and somebody doesn't want to go to the
 
04:15:26.210 --> 04:15:26.220 align:start position:0%
middle school they can turn around
 
04:15:27.349 --> 04:15:27.359 align:start position:0%
certainly have the option of being
 
04:15:30.050 --> 04:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
coming come here and the best the best
 
04:15:33.170 --> 04:15:33.180 align:start position:0%
model would be the SAU model right now
 
04:15:35.450 --> 04:15:35.460 align:start position:0%
when you're a single school district is
 
04:15:37.250 --> 04:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
basically that there is no SAU board the
 
04:15:38.570 --> 04:15:38.580 align:start position:0%
SAU bought in the Cooperative School
 
04:15:40.729 --> 04:15:40.739 align:start position:0%
daughter joined this would give us the
 
04:15:42.710 --> 04:15:42.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to turn around in two two
 
04:15:44.689 --> 04:15:44.699 align:start position:0%
School District board then you would
 
04:15:46.429 --> 04:15:46.439 align:start position:0%
have three people from each side being
 
04:15:48.290 --> 04:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
on the SAU board for administrative
 
04:15:50.330 --> 04:15:50.340 align:start position:0%
costs there's no sense for us to turn
 
04:15:52.550 --> 04:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
around and try to reinvent the wheel of
 
04:15:54.229 --> 04:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
the talented people who turn around it
 
04:15:56.150 --> 04:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
represents and work in the school
 
04:15:57.530 --> 04:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
district itself
 
04:15:59.990 --> 04:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
okay the superintendent other business
 
04:16:01.670 --> 04:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
managers other people who do the payroll
 
04:16:03.889 --> 04:16:03.899 align:start position:0%
the union contracts and so on no one's
 
04:16:05.150 --> 04:16:05.160 align:start position:0%
going to lose their jobs some kids are
 
04:16:07.130 --> 04:16:07.140 align:start position:0%
going to get pushed out and so on that's
 
04:16:08.750 --> 04:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
fantastic you're very benign you have
 
04:16:10.490 --> 04:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
any questions I do
 
04:16:13.370 --> 04:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
um I was looking back in my notes at the
 
04:16:16.189 --> 04:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
at the hearing and uh superintendent
 
04:16:19.849 --> 04:16:19.859 align:start position:0%
Couture in his testimony said that
 
04:16:19.859 --> 04:16:20.929 align:start position:0%
Couture in his testimony said that
um

04:16:20.929 --> 04:16:20.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:23.090 --> 04:16:23.100 align:start position:0%
that the that this particular Bill had
 
04:16:26.570 --> 04:16:26.580 align:start position:0%
never been presented to him or this the
 
04:16:28.729 --> 04:16:28.739 align:start position:0%
school board has that been resolved do
 
04:16:31.010 --> 04:16:31.020 align:start position:0%
they have you had meetings since then
 
04:16:33.769 --> 04:16:33.779 align:start position:0%
that has resolved it seemed like there
 
04:16:37.729 --> 04:16:37.739 align:start position:0%
was some real animosity uh there in at
 
04:16:39.590 --> 04:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
least in my notes they've had all of the
 
04:16:41.090 --> 04:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
information that we gave them they've
 
04:16:43.490 --> 04:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
had no meetings on it
 
04:16:46.670 --> 04:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
yeah all of the um Point papers that we
 
04:16:47.809 --> 04:16:47.819 align:start position:0%
developed from the village District
 
04:16:50.090 --> 04:16:50.100 align:start position:0%
commission have been distributed to all
 
04:16:51.590 --> 04:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
the school current seven-member school
 
04:16:53.330 --> 04:16:53.340 align:start position:0%
board and
 
04:16:55.969 --> 04:16:55.979 align:start position:0%
um and so I think everyone is sort of
 
04:16:57.650 --> 04:16:57.660 align:start position:0%
waiting to see
 
04:16:59.809 --> 04:16:59.819 align:start position:0%
whether or not this legislation passes
 
04:17:02.929 --> 04:17:02.939 align:start position:0%
all right and then we all intend to work
 
04:17:06.650 --> 04:17:06.660 align:start position:0%
together to um to to make this um change
 
04:17:09.229 --> 04:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
uh the best way that we can
 
04:17:11.269 --> 04:17:11.279 align:start position:0%
what happens to this legislation in four
 
04:17:13.550 --> 04:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
years time nothing's happening
 
04:17:15.950 --> 04:17:15.960 align:start position:0%
we stay in the school district so this
 
04:17:18.110 --> 04:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
legislation goes away it's there's an
 
04:17:20.030 --> 04:17:20.040 align:start position:0%
exploration my understanding from Dean
 
04:17:22.550 --> 04:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
is there's an expiration on this in four
 
04:17:24.769 --> 04:17:24.779 align:start position:0%
years okay
 
04:17:25.969 --> 04:17:25.979 align:start position:0%
what are the questions from the
 
04:17:25.979 --> 04:17:28.670 align:start position:0%
what are the questions from the
committee

04:17:28.670 --> 04:17:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:32.510 --> 04:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
yes repson Woodcock Anthony gentleman I
 
04:17:33.889 --> 04:17:33.899 align:start position:0%
was looking through my notes as well the
 
04:17:35.990 --> 04:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
only I remember distinctly I wrote it
 
04:17:36.000 --> 04:17:37.130 align:start position:0%
only I remember distinctly I wrote it
twice

04:17:37.130 --> 04:17:37.140 align:start position:0%
twice
 
04:17:39.530 --> 04:17:39.540 align:start position:0%
um and maybe you can refresh because
 
04:17:41.689 --> 04:17:41.699 align:start position:0%
representative Luna wasn't here the
 
04:17:46.550 --> 04:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
superintendent uh from the uh town uh
 
04:17:48.290 --> 04:17:48.300 align:start position:0%
from Newfound era was the only one who
 
04:17:50.030 --> 04:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
spoke basically from the school district
 
04:17:53.630 --> 04:17:53.640 align:start position:0%
and he was adamantly opposed
 
04:17:56.030 --> 04:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
um and I don't have I have some of his
 
04:17:57.650 --> 04:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
quotes but I don't I couldn't capture
 
04:17:59.870 --> 04:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
the exact reason why I was adamantly
 
04:18:03.170 --> 04:18:03.180 align:start position:0%
opposed can you just refresh me on that
 
04:18:03.180 --> 04:18:04.150 align:start position:0%
opposed can you just refresh me on that
um well

04:18:04.150 --> 04:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
um well
 
04:18:07.130 --> 04:18:07.140 align:start position:0%
over the last 22 years we've had five
 
04:18:09.710 --> 04:18:09.720 align:start position:0%
superintendents including him okay so
 
04:18:12.050 --> 04:18:12.060 align:start position:0%
you know the in the problem with the
 
04:18:14.030 --> 04:18:14.040 align:start position:0%
school district is that the seven towns
 
04:18:16.189 --> 04:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
tend to pull in different directions in
 
04:18:17.870 --> 04:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
there he was aware we tried to get him
 
04:18:20.210 --> 04:18:20.220 align:start position:0%
as well more aware of it but the reality
 
04:18:22.250 --> 04:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
is is that I don't know what his
 
04:18:24.889 --> 04:18:24.899 align:start position:0%
opposition is at this point in time but
 
04:18:26.870 --> 04:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
basically it's easier to keep the same
 
04:18:29.269 --> 04:18:29.279 align:start position:0%
existing structure this Cooperative
 
04:18:31.250 --> 04:18:31.260 align:start position:0%
school district is easier to manage and
 
04:18:33.050 --> 04:18:33.060 align:start position:0%
say yes I do 40h which I was a
 
04:18:34.790 --> 04:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
consultant about 10 years on the
 
04:18:36.950 --> 04:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
technology stuff
 
04:18:40.010 --> 04:18:40.020 align:start position:0%
um the uh you have one school board to
 
04:18:41.630 --> 04:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
deal with and so on but Plymouth has
 
04:18:43.729 --> 04:18:43.739 align:start position:0%
multiple school boards that they have to
 
04:18:45.950 --> 04:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
work with and so on but it puts the
 
04:18:48.950 --> 04:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
decision making closer to the the people
 
04:18:51.590 --> 04:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
in the in the in those adjoining towns
 
04:18:54.410 --> 04:18:54.420 align:start position:0%
it's easier to pass legislation than the
 
04:18:56.090 --> 04:18:56.100 align:start position:0%
town so you turn around and past budgets
 
04:18:58.130 --> 04:18:58.140 align:start position:0%
and so on because I see it you don't
 
04:19:01.309 --> 04:19:01.319 align:start position:0%
erase uh the the identity of the town
 
04:19:02.750 --> 04:19:02.760 align:start position:0%
when you're sitting on a seven-membered
 
04:19:05.809 --> 04:19:05.819 align:start position:0%
group we have a we have a not only is a
 
04:19:07.130 --> 04:19:07.140 align:start position:0%
large District but it's also a
 
04:19:09.889 --> 04:19:09.899 align:start position:0%
significantly different uh socioeconomic
 
04:19:12.170 --> 04:19:12.180 align:start position:0%
background so basically it's very hard
 
04:19:14.570 --> 04:19:14.580 align:start position:0%
to get anything done in this thing I
 
04:19:16.910 --> 04:19:16.920 align:start position:0%
mean if if we were if we didn't step up
 
04:19:19.250 --> 04:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
to the plate to build a school back into
 
04:19:21.830 --> 04:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
in in 2000
 
04:19:23.570 --> 04:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have voted to turn around
 
04:19:26.689 --> 04:19:26.699 align:start position:0%
and expand and build a new building
 
04:19:29.210 --> 04:19:29.220 align:start position:0%
guaranteed you know that's just because
 
04:19:31.610 --> 04:19:31.620 align:start position:0%
the fact is is that they they have a
 
04:19:34.370 --> 04:19:34.380 align:start position:0%
they they seem to be supportive of their
 
04:19:36.170 --> 04:19:36.180 align:start position:0%
own School District but he's only been
 
04:19:38.150 --> 04:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
in the business about three years or so
 
04:19:40.610 --> 04:19:40.620 align:start position:0%
in the in the job but there's a there's
 
04:19:41.990 --> 04:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
there's different personalities in
 
04:19:43.189 --> 04:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
different and different likes and
 
04:19:43.199 --> 04:19:44.330 align:start position:0%
different and different likes and
dislikes

04:19:44.330 --> 04:19:44.340 align:start position:0%
dislikes
 
04:19:46.670 --> 04:19:46.680 align:start position:0%
so for us to turn around and step out of
 
04:19:49.610 --> 04:19:49.620 align:start position:0%
the district and build the school and
 
04:19:51.349 --> 04:19:51.359 align:start position:0%
hand over the educational quality
 
04:19:53.510 --> 04:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
they've done a terrific job we're not
 
04:19:54.530 --> 04:19:54.540 align:start position:0%
going to turn around and upset that
 
04:19:57.530 --> 04:19:57.540 align:start position:0%
airport okay okay thank you thank you Mr
 
04:19:59.750 --> 04:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
chair you're welcome I've been by the
 
04:20:01.790 --> 04:20:01.800 align:start position:0%
school and it's a beautiful school
 
04:20:05.030 --> 04:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
um why is it that you all are willing to
 
04:20:07.010 --> 04:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
lease that facility which is so
 
04:20:13.450 --> 04:20:13.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:15.830 --> 04:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
wonderful facility why are you willing
 
04:20:18.410 --> 04:20:18.420 align:start position:0%
to lease this out to the Newfound school
 
04:20:20.870 --> 04:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
district at just a dollar a year
 
04:20:20.880 --> 04:20:24.849 align:start position:0%
district at just a dollar a year
uh

04:20:24.849 --> 04:20:24.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:28.309 --> 04:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
well you know we have an advantage in
 
04:20:31.130 --> 04:20:31.140 align:start position:0%
terms of tax base and basically stood up
 
04:20:32.809 --> 04:20:32.819 align:start position:0%
to the plate and said we should help out
 
04:20:35.630 --> 04:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
and so uh why we why would we turn
 
04:20:37.490 --> 04:20:37.500 align:start position:0%
around and build a school to put our
 
04:20:40.309 --> 04:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
kids in even as a minority and then turn
 
04:20:42.410 --> 04:20:42.420 align:start position:0%
around and try to charge them a much
 
04:20:43.910 --> 04:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
higher rate or try to amortize the cost
 
04:20:45.530 --> 04:20:45.540 align:start position:0%
of the building off of it
 
04:20:45.540 --> 04:20:47.450 align:start position:0%
of the building off of it
so

04:20:47.450 --> 04:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:20:49.250 --> 04:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
um and we've been fairly clever in terms
 
04:20:51.050 --> 04:20:51.060 align:start position:0%
of building infrastructure over the
 
04:20:53.330 --> 04:20:53.340 align:start position:0%
years and paying for it as we go so it
 
04:20:54.590 --> 04:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
just seemed to be the natural thing to
 
04:20:56.450 --> 04:20:56.460 align:start position:0%
do is it you know we're not looking to
 
04:20:58.550 --> 04:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
take something from anybody and that
 
04:21:00.110 --> 04:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
won't build good neighbors
 
04:21:01.729 --> 04:21:01.739 align:start position:0%
if you turn around and just turn around
 
04:21:04.670 --> 04:21:04.680 align:start position:0%
and try to you know we have we want to
 
04:21:06.590 --> 04:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
do this and if that your expense it
 
04:21:07.969 --> 04:21:07.979 align:start position:0%
hasn't been that way in 20 years and it
 
04:21:09.769 --> 04:21:09.779 align:start position:0%
will not happen it's built into our
 
04:21:12.110 --> 04:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
contracts and so on there are some
 
04:21:13.490 --> 04:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
limits in terms of some of these things
 
04:21:15.889 --> 04:21:15.899 align:start position:0%
but for the most part the only thing I
 
04:21:17.269 --> 04:21:17.279 align:start position:0%
think there was anything really major in
 
04:21:19.670 --> 04:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
it was the fact that
 
04:21:19.680 --> 04:21:20.929 align:start position:0%
it was the fact that
um

04:21:20.929 --> 04:21:20.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:22.910 --> 04:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
when we transport kids that we didn't
 
04:21:25.130 --> 04:21:25.140 align:start position:0%
want you know if it'd be hard to sell
 
04:21:27.110 --> 04:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
the the bond issue if I if I say well
 
04:21:29.510 --> 04:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
your kid your child will you go to the
 
04:21:30.710 --> 04:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
town of New Hampton School because
 
04:21:34.070 --> 04:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
they're closer so we put in that closet
 
04:21:36.050 --> 04:21:36.060 align:start position:0%
said they have to come here and the only
 
04:21:37.729 --> 04:21:37.739 align:start position:0%
other Clause that's changed over lost 20
 
04:21:39.769 --> 04:21:39.779 align:start position:0%
some odd years was that if you have 15
 
04:21:42.849 --> 04:21:42.859 align:start position:0%
kids in a classroom in New Hampton
 
04:21:47.389 --> 04:21:47.399 align:start position:0%
Bristol Danbury uh and Danbury and
 
04:21:49.969 --> 04:21:49.979 align:start position:0%
they're all at 15 we don't want 25 in a
 
04:21:49.979 --> 04:21:51.469 align:start position:0%
they're all at 15 we don't want 25 in a
classroom

04:21:51.469 --> 04:21:51.479 align:start position:0%
classroom
 
04:21:52.729 --> 04:21:52.739 align:start position:0%
um and that was put in there to turn
 
04:21:54.349 --> 04:21:54.359 align:start position:0%
around and say whatever the average is
 
04:21:56.269 --> 04:21:56.279 align:start position:0%
and all your other elementary schools
 
04:21:58.490 --> 04:21:58.500 align:start position:0%
then the classroom structure should be
 
04:22:00.650 --> 04:22:00.660 align:start position:0%
about and they they might float up a
 
04:22:02.150 --> 04:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
little bit down there we also took over
 
04:22:07.429 --> 04:22:07.439 align:start position:0%
all of these space facilities for
 
04:22:08.630 --> 04:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
um preschool
 
04:22:10.849 --> 04:22:10.859 align:start position:0%
we offered just recently to turn around
 
04:22:13.250 --> 04:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
and consider building another couple of
 
04:22:15.050 --> 04:22:15.060 align:start position:0%
classrooms on the building to
 
04:22:17.330 --> 04:22:17.340 align:start position:0%
accommodate kids with um
 
04:22:21.050 --> 04:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
yeah I was a significant disabilities
 
04:22:21.060 --> 04:22:22.130 align:start position:0%
yeah I was a significant disabilities
yeah

04:22:22.130 --> 04:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:22:24.950 --> 04:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
um developmental disabilities so to turn
 
04:22:26.570 --> 04:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
around and make that that works and so
 
04:22:29.330 --> 04:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
we've you know we're not gonna you know
 
04:22:31.250 --> 04:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
um it's just sharing everything with
 
04:22:34.250 --> 04:22:34.260 align:start position:0%
everybody else thank you that's what I'm
 
04:22:36.650 --> 04:22:36.660 align:start position:0%
looking for are there further questions
 
04:22:38.530 --> 04:22:38.540 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
04:22:42.170 --> 04:22:42.180 align:start position:0%
okay yes representing cascadden
 
04:22:43.550 --> 04:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
um just something that I'm struggling
 
04:22:45.290 --> 04:22:45.300 align:start position:0%
with a little bit and I think I
 
04:22:47.570 --> 04:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
understand the whole request or the
 
04:22:49.729 --> 04:22:49.739 align:start position:0%
needs are
 
04:22:52.309 --> 04:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
and we have laws on the books for
 
04:22:55.370 --> 04:22:55.380 align:start position:0%
withdrawal process and if that law is
 
04:22:57.710 --> 04:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
not applicable to this type of situation
 
04:23:01.030 --> 04:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
maybe there needs to be a law that is
 
04:23:04.010 --> 04:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
what what I what I'm uncomfortable with
 
04:23:07.250 --> 04:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
is that specific towns and then thinking
 
04:23:08.929 --> 04:23:08.939 align:start position:0%
of the North Country I think of the town
 
04:23:11.570 --> 04:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
of Milan in the Milan Village School
 
04:23:16.790 --> 04:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
in a similar situation so if we agree to
 
04:23:19.370 --> 04:23:19.380 align:start position:0%
three towns and then we get another
 
04:23:21.769 --> 04:23:21.779 align:start position:0%
request is there any applicability I
 
04:23:23.269 --> 04:23:23.279 align:start position:0%
mean should I be concerned about that
 
04:23:25.790 --> 04:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
yes it just opens the door is a unique
 
04:23:27.650 --> 04:23:27.660 align:start position:0%
difference here as it's been alluded to
 
04:23:29.450 --> 04:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
by both the men in front of us well I
 
04:23:32.929 --> 04:23:32.939 align:start position:0%
heard that at the by Statute we did this
 
04:23:36.650 --> 04:23:36.660 align:start position:0%
back in 1997 yeah and made them a
 
04:23:38.210 --> 04:23:38.220 align:start position:0%
special district
 
04:23:40.969 --> 04:23:40.979 align:start position:0%
and whereas the towns you're talking
 
04:23:43.849 --> 04:23:43.859 align:start position:0%
about aren't that okay this is the only
 
04:23:46.130 --> 04:23:46.140 align:start position:0%
place in the state of New Hampshire
 
04:23:49.370 --> 04:23:49.380 align:start position:0%
that is what they are uh I can't think
 
04:23:51.349 --> 04:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
of any other well I in even in my own
 
04:23:53.870 --> 04:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
town Woodsville the only reason why we
 
04:23:56.269 --> 04:23:56.279 align:start position:0%
had a highway department for a village
 
04:23:59.150 --> 04:23:59.160 align:start position:0%
district is was done by statutory law
 
04:24:02.809 --> 04:24:02.819 align:start position:0%
here in the house in the Senate but that
 
04:24:04.729 --> 04:24:04.739 align:start position:0%
there's only a few places where that
 
04:24:06.830 --> 04:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
type of thing has occurred okay and in
 
04:24:08.630 --> 04:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
this regard this is the only place where
 
04:24:11.090 --> 04:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
this one is so then this law would undo
 
04:24:13.610 --> 04:24:13.620 align:start position:0%
that well this law is going to try to
 
04:24:16.429 --> 04:24:16.439 align:start position:0%
correct correct what was done what we
 
04:24:19.849 --> 04:24:19.859 align:start position:0%
have and what appears was done three
 
04:24:21.530 --> 04:24:21.540 align:start position:0%
quarters away and didn't go the other
 
04:24:23.269 --> 04:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
quarter by doing what they could and
 
04:24:25.729 --> 04:24:25.739 align:start position:0%
then you really are a participant as a
 
04:24:28.070 --> 04:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
member in that SAU because you are a
 
04:24:30.349 --> 04:24:30.359 align:start position:0%
separate School District which they
 
04:24:31.969 --> 04:24:31.979 align:start position:0%
don't have that but they have everything
 
04:24:33.590 --> 04:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
that most school districts do have
 
04:24:36.410 --> 04:24:36.420 align:start position:0%
except the authority to do what they do
 
04:24:39.110 --> 04:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
what they want to do yeah okay yeah all
 
04:24:41.689 --> 04:24:41.699 align:start position:0%
right represent Balboni uh just a
 
04:24:43.729 --> 04:24:43.739 align:start position:0%
follow-up to uh representative Cass
 
04:24:45.410 --> 04:24:45.420 align:start position:0%
cabin was talking about so basically the
 
04:24:47.689 --> 04:24:47.699 align:start position:0%
difference is that was was formed by the
 
04:24:50.809 --> 04:24:50.819 align:start position:0%
legislature whereas other saus and
 
04:24:52.610 --> 04:24:52.620 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school districts are formed
 
04:24:55.910 --> 04:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
with the consent of the towns is that
 
04:24:56.870 --> 04:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
the difference it's a whole different
 
04:24:59.630 --> 04:24:59.640 align:start position:0%
process okay the the those other school
 
04:25:02.150 --> 04:25:02.160 align:start position:0%
districts and sau's were formed
 
04:25:03.349 --> 04:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
initially when this process
 
04:25:06.469 --> 04:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
reorganization of Satan probably if your
 
04:25:08.570 --> 04:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
wife could probably tell me a whole lot
 
04:25:10.610 --> 04:25:10.620 align:start position:0%
more about that because I wasn't here in
 
04:25:12.889 --> 04:25:12.899 align:start position:0%
the state of town I was you know four
 
04:25:15.170 --> 04:25:15.180 align:start position:0%
thousand five miles from here so but
 
04:25:17.809 --> 04:25:17.819 align:start position:0%
it's a whole different
 
04:25:20.510 --> 04:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
statutory area than what they have this
 
04:25:23.030 --> 04:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
is so unique it's unusual The Village
 
04:25:25.790 --> 04:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
District statutes that exist in audit
 
04:25:28.309 --> 04:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
into what we did would have to buy out
 
04:25:29.689 --> 04:25:29.699 align:start position:0%
the school or the facility you're
 
04:25:31.670 --> 04:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
04:25:33.530 --> 04:25:33.540 align:start position:0%
you know they don't own they don't own
 
04:25:35.030 --> 04:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
the land they don't own the buildings
 
04:25:37.849 --> 04:25:37.859 align:start position:0%
and so on and that's not to me a big
 
04:25:39.410 --> 04:25:39.420 align:start position:0%
deal I think the educational component
 
04:25:41.570 --> 04:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
of is more important but if you turn
 
04:25:43.010 --> 04:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
around and said you have towns that have
 
04:25:45.830 --> 04:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
a village District school that's a name
 
04:25:48.590 --> 04:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
it is no it has no political subdivision
 
04:25:51.830 --> 04:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
it has no ownership to it because it
 
04:25:53.410 --> 04:25:53.420 align:start position:0%
would be owned by the school district
 
04:25:55.790 --> 04:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
and so you if you were to turn around
 
04:25:57.170 --> 04:25:57.180 align:start position:0%
and withdraw from the school district
 
04:25:59.689 --> 04:25:59.699 align:start position:0%
your first obligation is to pay off the
 
04:26:01.309 --> 04:26:01.319 align:start position:0%
debt and I think the next one would be
 
04:26:03.469 --> 04:26:03.479 align:start position:0%
to convince them to either give you the
 
04:26:05.450 --> 04:26:05.460 align:start position:0%
school back or to buy the school back
 
04:26:06.710 --> 04:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
and that would there would be a lot of
 
04:26:06.720 --> 04:26:08.830 align:start position:0%
and that would there would be a lot of
hurdles

04:26:08.830 --> 04:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
hurdles
 
04:26:11.030 --> 04:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
can I just ask him one more quick
 
04:26:13.070 --> 04:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
question right so just okay I live in
 
04:26:16.490 --> 04:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
Rye and I'm a part of an SAU and in why
 
04:26:19.130 --> 04:26:19.140 align:start position:0%
we own our school we have two of them
 
04:26:20.990 --> 04:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
and and there is a process for
 
04:26:22.550 --> 04:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
withdrawal from the district I'm just
 
04:26:25.309 --> 04:26:25.319 align:start position:0%
trying to wrap my head around how your
 
04:26:27.590 --> 04:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
process is different that's what I was
 
04:26:29.750 --> 04:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
trying to get at it was it or with the
 
04:26:33.590 --> 04:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
origination they're not a town okay
 
04:26:35.990 --> 04:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
Village District it's just like a fire
 
04:26:38.929 --> 04:26:38.939 align:start position:0%
district or a water district they're a
 
04:26:42.469 --> 04:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
village District that's a whole like in
 
04:26:45.349 --> 04:26:45.359 align:start position:0%
my town we got five districts within
 
04:26:47.929 --> 04:26:47.939 align:start position:0%
Haverhill Woodsville is a fire district
 
04:26:51.889 --> 04:26:51.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:57.070 --> 04:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:00.530 --> 04:27:00.540 align:start position:0%
yes this is you sir would it be fair
 
04:27:04.189 --> 04:27:04.199 align:start position:0%
then to summarize this that there is no
 
04:27:07.429 --> 04:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
other legislation uh for withdrawal any
 
04:27:09.229 --> 04:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
of the private school districts they'll
 
04:27:11.570 --> 04:27:11.580 align:start position:0%
be impacted any other any other
 
04:27:13.309 --> 04:27:13.319 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school district will not be
 
04:27:15.649 --> 04:27:15.659 align:start position:0%
impacted by this that's all the fall
 
04:27:18.229 --> 04:27:18.239 align:start position:0%
this is the only singular one this is
 
04:27:19.729 --> 04:27:19.739 align:start position:0%
not going to have anything to do with
 
04:27:21.290 --> 04:27:21.300 align:start position:0%
Cooperative school districts
 
04:27:24.050 --> 04:27:24.060 align:start position:0%
disillusionment or withdrawing Etc yep
 
04:27:26.689 --> 04:27:26.699 align:start position:0%

04:27:38.689 --> 04:27:38.699 align:start position:0%
you might check to see if there's a room
 
04:27:43.729 --> 04:27:43.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:45.889 --> 04:27:45.899 align:start position:0%

anymore

04:28:12.490 --> 04:28:12.500 align:start position:0%

04:51:50.810 --> 04:51:50.820 align:start position:0%
rep representative McDonald
 
04:51:54.170 --> 04:51:54.180 align:start position:0%
yes thank you this spill is needed at
 
04:51:55.970 --> 04:51:55.980 align:start position:0%
this time as we heard substantial
 
04:51:59.390 --> 04:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
testimony from many constituents across
 
04:52:00.890 --> 04:52:00.900 align:start position:0%
the state saying that they felt
 
04:52:03.350 --> 04:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
personally targeted and that this
 
04:52:06.050 --> 04:52:06.060 align:start position:0%
legislation would help them and it is
 
04:52:08.270 --> 04:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
also necessary for preventing Free
 
04:52:11.448 --> 04:52:11.458 align:start position:0%
Speech zones whereas in certain areas of
 
04:52:13.430 --> 04:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
a campus it's okay to have free speech
 
04:52:15.288 --> 04:52:15.298 align:start position:0%
and in the rest of the University could
 
04:52:17.150 --> 04:52:17.160 align:start position:0%
designate that it's not
 
04:52:19.490 --> 04:52:19.500 align:start position:0%
and in addition I'd like to remind the
 
04:52:21.470 --> 04:52:21.480 align:start position:0%
committee that this has bipartisan
 
04:52:25.430 --> 04:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
support in bipartisan sponsors as well
 
04:52:27.890 --> 04:52:27.900 align:start position:0%
and in addition I do have an amendment
 
04:52:34.430 --> 04:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
to put forward thank you okay so uh who
 
04:52:36.948 --> 04:52:36.958 align:start position:0%

04:52:36.958 --> 04:52:38.390 align:start position:0%
second that or representative that's
correct

04:52:38.390 --> 04:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:52:41.030 --> 04:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
um representative uh McDonald you said
 
04:52:43.490 --> 04:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
you had an amendment yes did you pass it
 
04:52:44.868 --> 04:52:44.878 align:start position:0%
around please so we can see what that's
 
04:52:50.570 --> 04:52:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:53.510 --> 04:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
the amendments are coming around it is a
 
04:52:55.490 --> 04:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
simple so why should we still everybody
 
04:52:59.570 --> 04:52:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:01.730 --> 04:53:01.740 align:start position:0%
you might just expedite things try to
 
04:53:04.368 --> 04:53:04.378 align:start position:0%
show me the line maybe where the changes
 
04:53:07.550 --> 04:53:07.560 align:start position:0%
may occur or or change or whatever you
 
04:53:12.350 --> 04:53:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:12.360 --> 04:53:22.368 align:start position:0%
 
everything

04:53:22.368 --> 04:53:22.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:29.570 --> 04:53:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:29.580 --> 04:53:33.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:53:33.470 --> 04:53:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:37.368 --> 04:53:37.378 align:start position:0%
okay I believe those are getting around
 
04:53:37.378 --> 04:53:45.550 align:start position:0%
okay I believe those are getting around
okay

04:53:45.550 --> 04:53:45.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:47.770 --> 04:53:47.780 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:53:50.390 --> 04:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
I'm bringing this amendment forward on
 
04:53:51.830 --> 04:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
behalf of the Prime sponsor
 
04:53:54.830 --> 04:53:54.840 align:start position:0%
representative property Mueller
 
04:53:57.288 --> 04:53:57.298 align:start position:0%
it changes one word if you look online
 
04:54:00.170 --> 04:54:00.180 align:start position:0%
free of the amendment it says any person
 
04:54:02.810 --> 04:54:02.820 align:start position:0%
or student organization
 
04:54:04.190 --> 04:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
that is a change from Student
 
04:54:08.330 --> 04:54:08.340 align:start position:0%
Association to student organization this
 
04:54:10.610 --> 04:54:10.620 align:start position:0%
was recommended by a number of attorneys
 
04:54:12.288 --> 04:54:12.298 align:start position:0%
and lawyers presence
 
04:54:14.330 --> 04:54:14.340 align:start position:0%
saying that this will keep the language
 
04:54:16.730 --> 04:54:16.740 align:start position:0%
more consistent and more clarity and
 
04:54:23.690 --> 04:54:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:28.550 --> 04:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:30.830 --> 04:54:30.840 align:start position:0%
so it only changes that one line line
 
04:54:34.070 --> 04:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:42.590 --> 04:54:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:44.510 --> 04:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
okay then it's in keeping with the
 
04:54:45.890 --> 04:54:45.900 align:start position:0%
definition on page two student
 
04:54:45.900 --> 04:54:52.690 align:start position:0%
definition on page two student
organization

04:54:52.690 --> 04:54:52.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:54.830 --> 04:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
04:54:57.530 --> 04:54:57.540 align:start position:0%
yes representative Tanner we've had
 
04:55:00.110 --> 04:55:00.120 align:start position:0%
several bills in the past on free speech
 
04:55:01.690 --> 04:55:01.700 align:start position:0%
on campus
 
04:55:05.990 --> 04:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
and when uh and I've been on a
 
04:55:08.510 --> 04:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee for that and our State
 
04:55:11.990 --> 04:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
University's Plymouth Keen uh UNH have
 
04:55:14.750 --> 04:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
done a tremendous job updating their
 
04:55:17.690 --> 04:55:17.700 align:start position:0%
their procedures and policies uh and
 
04:55:19.430 --> 04:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
actually we're to the point where
 
04:55:21.170 --> 04:55:21.180 align:start position:0%
they're approved by a group called fire
 
04:55:24.230 --> 04:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
which was a big Free Speech one one of
 
04:55:26.150 --> 04:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
the areas that I particularly had
 
04:55:28.430 --> 04:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
problems with was the outdoor areas of
 
04:55:31.310 --> 04:55:31.320 align:start position:0%
the campus the campus includes
 
04:55:34.250 --> 04:55:34.260 align:start position:0%
dormitories and learning areas and
 
04:55:38.270 --> 04:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
having taught on on campus before that
 
04:55:40.610 --> 04:55:40.620 align:start position:0%
just having lawnmowers and stuff outside
 
04:55:44.208 --> 04:55:44.218 align:start position:0%
the campus windows can really interfere
 
04:55:46.128 --> 04:55:46.138 align:start position:0%
with what you're doing and I ca I just
 
04:55:48.590 --> 04:55:48.600 align:start position:0%
can't imagine having protests by the
 
04:55:50.030 --> 04:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
dormitories where you're trying to sleep
 
04:55:51.830 --> 04:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
or you're trying to to
 
04:55:51.840 --> 04:55:52.628 align:start position:0%
or you're trying to to
um

04:55:52.628 --> 04:55:52.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:56.690 --> 04:55:56.700 align:start position:0%
study or even classes if it's allowed in
 
04:55:59.150 --> 04:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
raucous uh protest this University
 
04:56:01.670 --> 04:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
protests usually are
 
04:56:01.680 --> 04:56:02.330 align:start position:0%
protests usually are
um

04:56:02.330 --> 04:56:02.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:04.850 --> 04:56:04.860 align:start position:0%
and and that's one of my issues with uh
 
04:56:06.830 --> 04:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
with the Bill thank you thank you
 
04:56:11.030 --> 04:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent Miler thank
 
04:56:13.490 --> 04:56:13.500 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
04:56:16.430 --> 04:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
one of the things I've learned in my
 
04:56:16.440 --> 04:56:17.930 align:start position:0%
one of the things I've learned in my
lifetime

04:56:17.930 --> 04:56:17.940 align:start position:0%
lifetime
 
04:56:20.030 --> 04:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
as old as it might be
 
04:56:21.890 --> 04:56:21.900 align:start position:0%
is that there are two sides to every
 
04:56:21.900 --> 04:56:23.868 align:start position:0%
is that there are two sides to every
story

04:56:23.868 --> 04:56:23.878 align:start position:0%
story
 
04:56:26.810 --> 04:56:26.820 align:start position:0%
and we ended the uh hearing last time
 
04:56:30.410 --> 04:56:30.420 align:start position:0%
with some students from UNH law that
 
04:56:33.050 --> 04:56:33.060 align:start position:0%
were concerned about how they were dealt
 
04:56:35.628 --> 04:56:35.638 align:start position:0%
with in their application
 
04:56:37.970 --> 04:56:37.980 align:start position:0%
and so what I did is I called Dean
 
04:56:37.980 --> 04:56:39.230 align:start position:0%
and so what I did is I called Dean
Cooper

04:56:39.230 --> 04:56:39.240 align:start position:0%
Cooper
 
04:56:41.750 --> 04:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
who was the assistant Dean at the law
 
04:56:41.760 --> 04:56:43.010 align:start position:0%
who was the assistant Dean at the law
school

04:56:43.010 --> 04:56:43.020 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:56:46.850 --> 04:56:46.860 align:start position:0%
Mr Cooper is the one who sits on the
 
04:56:49.368 --> 04:56:49.378 align:start position:0%
student bar that basically authorizes
 
04:56:52.610 --> 04:56:52.620 align:start position:0%
all the various organizations on campus
 
04:56:55.430 --> 04:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
and so here here is what I found from
 
04:56:55.440 --> 04:56:56.990 align:start position:0%
and so here here is what I found from
him

04:56:56.990 --> 04:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
him
 
04:56:59.150 --> 04:56:59.160 align:start position:0%
the group that we that was referenced
 
04:57:01.310 --> 04:57:01.320 align:start position:0%
here which they never gave their name is
 
04:57:05.448 --> 04:57:05.458 align:start position:0%
called the free exercise coalition
 
04:57:07.970 --> 04:57:07.980 align:start position:0%
they made their application to the
 
04:57:10.128 --> 04:57:10.138 align:start position:0%
university for recognition
 
04:57:13.490 --> 04:57:13.500 align:start position:0%
in the late November
 
04:57:17.030 --> 04:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
late November is just before finals and
 
04:57:20.270 --> 04:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
before the re the holiday recess
 
04:57:22.670 --> 04:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
the next meeting that was scheduled was
 
04:57:25.010 --> 04:57:25.020 align:start position:0%
in January
 
04:57:28.070 --> 04:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
at that November meeting
 
04:57:31.850 --> 04:57:31.860 align:start position:0%
the student Bar Association thought they
 
04:57:33.830 --> 04:57:33.840 align:start position:0%
needed more information before they
 
04:57:35.390 --> 04:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
would act on it
 
04:57:37.670 --> 04:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
they did their due diligence
 
04:57:40.368 --> 04:57:40.378 align:start position:0%
and when they met in January
 
04:57:42.708 --> 04:57:42.718 align:start position:0%
this group was authorized as an
 
04:57:45.230 --> 04:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
organization on campus
 
04:57:47.810 --> 04:57:47.820 align:start position:0%
so there wasn't an implication by them
 
04:57:49.670 --> 04:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
that they weren't authorized but we
 
04:57:51.830 --> 04:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
never asked the question were you
 
04:57:53.990 --> 04:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
ultimately authorized so we now know
 
04:57:56.090 --> 04:57:56.100 align:start position:0%
that they help them they are authorized
 
04:57:59.330 --> 04:57:59.340 align:start position:0%
and in fact the process that was
 
04:58:02.628 --> 04:58:02.638 align:start position:0%
followed for their authorization is the
 
04:58:04.430 --> 04:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
normal process that you go through at
 
04:58:06.610 --> 04:58:06.620 align:start position:0%
the evidently at the law school
 
04:58:08.750 --> 04:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
you should also know that there's a
 
04:58:10.610 --> 04:58:10.620 align:start position:0%
Jewish law Association
 
04:58:12.770 --> 04:58:12.780 align:start position:0%
and there's also a Christian legal
 
04:58:12.780 --> 04:58:14.930 align:start position:0%
and there's also a Christian legal
Society

04:58:14.930 --> 04:58:14.940 align:start position:0%
Society
 
04:58:17.090 --> 04:58:17.100 align:start position:0%
I think one of the and at the same time
 
04:58:19.070 --> 04:58:19.080 align:start position:0%
that they were dealing with an issue in
 
04:58:20.510 --> 04:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
the November meeting there was a group
 
04:58:21.650 --> 04:58:21.660 align:start position:0%
that wanted to have a Spanish
 
04:58:24.948 --> 04:58:24.958 align:start position:0%
organization and that organization has
 
04:58:27.350 --> 04:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
yet to be authorized
 
04:58:30.590 --> 04:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
so I think to try to to bring at least
 
04:58:32.868 --> 04:58:32.878 align:start position:0%
that piece of the conclusion of it which
 
04:58:34.070 --> 04:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
bothered me a little bit when I was
 
04:58:37.128 --> 04:58:37.138 align:start position:0%
hearing the feedback was that a the
 
04:58:40.430 --> 04:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
process was followed be there ultimately
 
04:58:43.850 --> 04:58:43.860 align:start position:0%
uh authorized so from a standpoint of
 
04:58:45.470 --> 04:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
being discriminated against which is
 
04:58:47.208 --> 04:58:47.218 align:start position:0%
what kind of what I was hearing from the
 
04:58:49.550 --> 04:58:49.560 align:start position:0%
group they clearly weren't discriminated
 
04:58:51.350 --> 04:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
against they are basically dealt with in
 
04:58:52.970 --> 04:58:52.980 align:start position:0%
an appropriate way through the
 
04:58:54.650 --> 04:58:54.660 align:start position:0%
procedures that the that the university
 
04:58:57.050 --> 04:58:57.060 align:start position:0%
that the law school follows so I just
 
04:58:58.550 --> 04:58:58.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to have that for the record Mr
 
04:58:58.560 --> 04:59:00.288 align:start position:0%
wanted to have that for the record Mr
chair

04:59:00.288 --> 04:59:00.298 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:59:03.590 --> 04:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
so in in filing that uh Professor Milo
 
04:59:05.230 --> 04:59:05.240 align:start position:0%
at the Spanish group
 
04:59:09.050 --> 04:59:09.060 align:start position:0%
uh did do you have to have a professor
 
04:59:11.448 --> 04:59:11.458 align:start position:0%
sponsoring your organization or somebody
 
04:59:13.850 --> 04:59:13.860 align:start position:0%
from the college doing that or how's
 
04:59:16.010 --> 04:59:16.020 align:start position:0%
that work I don't know that I do know
 
04:59:18.170 --> 04:59:18.180 align:start position:0%
that once you authorized you I think the
 
04:59:20.750 --> 04:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
school gives them the organization 200
 
04:59:23.208 --> 04:59:23.218 align:start position:0%
or something to to operate the program
 
04:59:39.050 --> 04:59:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:42.948 --> 04:59:42.958 align:start position:0%
thank you if I may yes yeah I would just
 
04:59:44.750 --> 04:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
like to follow up now that I've got that
 
04:59:48.110 --> 04:59:48.120 align:start position:0%
history here uh I would just Echo what
 
04:59:50.990 --> 04:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh representative uh tanneris said is
 
04:59:53.570 --> 04:59:53.580 align:start position:0%
that we have had this issue before this
 
04:59:56.448 --> 04:59:56.458 align:start position:0%
committee a number of times in fact at
 
04:59:57.948 --> 04:59:57.958 align:start position:0%
one point in time there was some serious
 
05:00:00.770 --> 05:00:00.780 align:start position:0%
concerns about how the University was in
 
05:00:03.550 --> 05:00:03.560 align:start position:0%
fact handling uh free speech on campus
 
05:00:06.350 --> 05:00:06.360 align:start position:0%
uh our understanding is basically
 
05:00:08.208 --> 05:00:08.218 align:start position:0%
through the testimony that we heard that
 
05:00:12.230 --> 05:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
day that the university has in fact uh
 
05:00:15.830 --> 05:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
dealt with this issue they ranked 16 out
 
05:00:19.490 --> 05:00:19.500 align:start position:0%
of 203 uh universities or schools that
 
05:00:22.730 --> 05:00:22.740 align:start position:0%
the fire uh monitors and they've either
 
05:00:24.350 --> 05:00:24.360 align:start position:0%
they've admitted that this that they
 
05:00:26.390 --> 05:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
have done a good job and frankly I don't
 
05:00:29.510 --> 05:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
see the need for this particular bill at
 
05:00:31.610 --> 05:00:31.620 align:start position:0%
this point in time because of the the
 
05:00:33.470 --> 05:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
good due diligence that the university
 
05:00:35.390 --> 05:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
has done to provide free speech on
 
05:00:39.170 --> 05:00:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:42.770 --> 05:00:42.780 align:start position:0%
from yes representative uh we're dry
 
05:00:46.030 --> 05:00:46.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I've got my
 
05:00:48.170 --> 05:00:48.180 align:start position:0%
handouts from that day and they're like
 
05:00:50.930 --> 05:00:50.940 align:start position:0%
six or seven pages listed free exercise
 
05:00:53.810 --> 05:00:53.820 align:start position:0%
Coalition introducing the people from
 
05:00:55.910 --> 05:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
that group so I
 
05:00:58.070 --> 05:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
can't believe we didn't know who they
 
05:01:00.350 --> 05:01:00.360 align:start position:0%
were I think what they took exception to
 
05:01:02.150 --> 05:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
was the way that they were treated not
 
05:01:04.490 --> 05:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
necessarily how long it took for them to
 
05:01:06.948 --> 05:01:06.958 align:start position:0%
get recognized as a group but some of
 
05:01:12.410 --> 05:01:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:15.890 --> 05:01:15.900 align:start position:0%
uh Rough Waters trying to get um
 
05:01:18.590 --> 05:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
acceptance at the University I believe
 
05:01:19.970 --> 05:01:19.980 align:start position:0%
that that was
 
05:01:22.070 --> 05:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
more of a um
 
05:01:24.530 --> 05:01:24.540 align:start position:0%
a problem than how long it took them to
 
05:01:26.570 --> 05:01:26.580 align:start position:0%
get their affiliation thank you
 
05:01:28.310 --> 05:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher
 
05:01:30.770 --> 05:01:30.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and just defer a
 
05:01:32.270 --> 05:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
client here I'll further clarify that
 
05:01:32.280 --> 05:01:32.990 align:start position:0%
client here I'll further clarify that
point

05:01:32.990 --> 05:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
point
 
05:01:34.850 --> 05:01:34.860 align:start position:0%
um for this student organization I
 
05:01:36.650 --> 05:01:36.660 align:start position:0%
believe they did make it clear that they
 
05:01:38.150 --> 05:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
were ultimately recognized after having
 
05:01:40.430 --> 05:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
an attorney get involved I believe their
 
05:01:42.350 --> 05:01:42.360 align:start position:0%
primary concern was that they were
 
05:01:44.868 --> 05:01:44.878 align:start position:0%
subject to significant disparaging
 
05:01:47.030 --> 05:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
remarks and bullying
 
05:01:48.708 --> 05:01:48.718 align:start position:0%
um including from members of student
 
05:01:51.170 --> 05:01:51.180 align:start position:0%
government per their testimony and
 
05:01:52.910 --> 05:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
further that their sincerely held
 
05:01:55.550 --> 05:01:55.560 align:start position:0%
beliefs in their statement was subject
 
05:01:58.250 --> 05:01:58.260 align:start position:0%
to excessive scrutiny and took
 
05:02:01.570 --> 05:02:01.580 align:start position:0%
significant uh do doing to get approved
 
05:02:04.310 --> 05:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
as a student group so I don't think the
 
05:02:05.690 --> 05:02:05.700 align:start position:0%
issue was that they weren't approved or
 
05:02:07.070 --> 05:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
that they didn't have their name on it
 
05:02:11.090 --> 05:02:11.100 align:start position:0%
but rather that behavior so to go a
 
05:02:12.410 --> 05:02:12.420 align:start position:0%
little further into into what this bill
 
05:02:14.390 --> 05:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
does I was one of the people who was
 
05:02:16.550 --> 05:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
interested in watching a commentator
 
05:02:20.810 --> 05:02:20.820 align:start position:0%
back in 2016 who was uh who was shouted
 
05:02:22.570 --> 05:02:22.580 align:start position:0%
down at the University of New Hampshire
 
05:02:25.910 --> 05:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
and I I wasn't able to uh to enjoy that
 
05:02:27.830 --> 05:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
event unfortunately because despite
 
05:02:30.170 --> 05:02:30.180 align:start position:0%
security being present they allowed the
 
05:02:33.288 --> 05:02:33.298 align:start position:0%
event to be interrupted and this is a
 
05:02:34.850 --> 05:02:34.860 align:start position:0%
pattern that has happened not not only
 
05:02:37.368 --> 05:02:37.378 align:start position:0%
at certain schools here but across the
 
05:02:40.610 --> 05:02:40.620 align:start position:0%
country and I applaud the university
 
05:02:43.010 --> 05:02:43.020 align:start position:0%
that it has done better that it has
 
05:02:44.990 --> 05:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
improved its score and this is an
 
05:02:46.250 --> 05:02:46.260 align:start position:0%
excellent thing but I would remind you
 
05:02:48.190 --> 05:02:48.200 align:start position:0%
all that we are coming up on another
 
05:02:50.868 --> 05:02:50.878 align:start position:0%
presidential election season and it was
 
05:02:52.550 --> 05:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
during the last presidential election
 
05:02:55.070 --> 05:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
season that everything went off the
 
05:02:59.030 --> 05:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
rails and I think we really stand to see
 
05:03:00.830 --> 05:03:00.840 align:start position:0%
these kind of things possibly happening
 
05:03:00.840 --> 05:03:01.850 align:start position:0%
these kind of things possibly happening
again

05:03:01.850 --> 05:03:01.860 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:03:04.430 --> 05:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
in the next election season within the
 
05:03:06.708 --> 05:03:06.718 align:start position:0%
next year or so if we don't do something
 
05:03:09.110 --> 05:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
to actually prevent that
 
05:03:12.590 --> 05:03:12.600 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent cascadden
 
05:03:15.110 --> 05:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
um my thoughts are we are an elected
 
05:03:17.448 --> 05:03:17.458 align:start position:0%
public body and we should be supporting
 
05:03:20.390 --> 05:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
the university system I mean so I feel
 
05:03:22.310 --> 05:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
strongly that if the the university
 
05:03:22.320 --> 05:03:24.128 align:start position:0%
strongly that if the the university
system

05:03:24.128 --> 05:03:24.138 align:start position:0%
system
 
05:03:26.990 --> 05:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
is against this Bell that I feel is an
 
05:03:28.670 --> 05:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
elected official
 
05:03:30.650 --> 05:03:30.660 align:start position:0%
it's a public school and I don't think
 
05:03:32.750 --> 05:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
we should be voting for interest groups
 
05:03:35.330 --> 05:03:35.340 align:start position:0%
we're voting for the public so I
 
05:03:39.350 --> 05:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:42.190 --> 05:03:42.200 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher or you had your hand
 
05:03:44.990 --> 05:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
apologies just clarify on that point I I
 
05:03:48.050 --> 05:03:48.060 align:start position:0%
think the interest group if there is any
 
05:03:51.948 --> 05:03:51.958 align:start position:0%
interest group here is is not the public
 
05:03:55.070 --> 05:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
who elected us who we have a right to or
 
05:03:58.070 --> 05:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
a duty rather to represent but a
 
05:03:59.570 --> 05:03:59.580 align:start position:0%
university would be an interest group
 
05:04:03.050 --> 05:04:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:06.410 --> 05:04:06.420 align:start position:0%
representative Ford thank you Mr chair
 
05:04:06.420 --> 05:04:08.448 align:start position:0%
representative Ford thank you Mr chair
yeah

05:04:08.448 --> 05:04:08.458 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:04:10.128 --> 05:04:10.138 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:04:10.138 --> 05:04:12.530 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

05:04:12.530 --> 05:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:16.430 --> 05:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
am I ready now I know are you I don't
 
05:04:19.910 --> 05:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
know this is a question that's broader
 
05:04:22.670 --> 05:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
than anything I've heard except perhaps
 
05:04:26.990 --> 05:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
uh Mr belcher's comments on now it's
 
05:04:29.750 --> 05:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
really a question of what is a
 
05:04:34.430 --> 05:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
university without freedom of expression
 
05:04:36.948 --> 05:04:36.958 align:start position:0%
and whether or not there's an incident
 
05:04:40.368 --> 05:04:40.378 align:start position:0%
that somehow should be objected to or
 
05:04:40.378 --> 05:04:41.750 align:start position:0%
that somehow should be objected to or
not

05:04:41.750 --> 05:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:04:44.628 --> 05:04:44.638 align:start position:0%
nah that's like saying should we vote
 
05:04:46.730 --> 05:04:46.740 align:start position:0%
against murder well it hasn't happened
 
05:04:48.350 --> 05:04:48.360 align:start position:0%
yet so I guess we don't need an
 
05:04:50.150 --> 05:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
objection to it
 
05:04:54.470 --> 05:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
no this destroys a university if it does
 
05:04:55.970 --> 05:04:55.980 align:start position:0%
not exist
 
05:04:59.030 --> 05:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
whether it's one-on-one Groupon group
 
05:05:02.628 --> 05:05:02.638 align:start position:0%
whatever if you cannot discuss it you
 
05:05:06.230 --> 05:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
really don't have a university
 
05:05:10.128 --> 05:05:10.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:12.410 --> 05:05:12.420 align:start position:0%
that's what they're there for to discuss
 
05:05:17.030 --> 05:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
any and all ideas without any barriers
 
05:05:17.040 --> 05:05:20.810 align:start position:0%
any and all ideas without any barriers
whatsoever

05:05:20.810 --> 05:05:20.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:23.390 --> 05:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
otherwise you can't learn
 
05:05:26.510 --> 05:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:28.550 --> 05:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
05:05:31.128 --> 05:05:31.138 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh two things
 
05:05:35.050 --> 05:05:35.060 align:start position:0%
first I think we had testimony from the
 
05:05:37.868 --> 05:05:37.878 align:start position:0%
first Liberty
 
05:05:40.490 --> 05:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
organizations lawyer
 
05:05:43.010 --> 05:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
um as well as his written testimony that
 
05:05:47.868 --> 05:05:47.878 align:start position:0%
the issue was with the uh SBA
 
05:05:50.288 --> 05:05:50.298 align:start position:0%
um in relation to the um
 
05:05:52.810 --> 05:05:52.820 align:start position:0%
FEC Coalition
 
05:05:56.270 --> 05:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
and according to his written testimony
 
05:05:59.990 --> 05:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
after attorneys representing the uh
 
05:06:02.750 --> 05:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
Christian legal Society wrote to you
 
05:06:07.250 --> 05:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
this is to Dean Shane Cooper did UNH
 
05:06:10.368 --> 05:06:10.378 align:start position:0%
formally recognize this student group
 
05:06:13.090 --> 05:06:13.100 align:start position:0%
um secondly I I think that
 
05:06:16.128 --> 05:06:16.138 align:start position:0%
policies are nice but policies come and
 
05:06:19.670 --> 05:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
go I think if it is in statute we are a
 
05:06:24.770 --> 05:06:24.780 align:start position:0%
lot better off as a state and with our
 
05:06:24.780 --> 05:06:25.868 align:start position:0%
lot better off as a state and with our
public

05:06:25.868 --> 05:06:25.878 align:start position:0%
public
 
05:06:29.990 --> 05:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
universities and I will note that there
 
05:06:33.970 --> 05:06:33.980 align:start position:0%
are a number of areas in here where it
 
05:06:36.610 --> 05:06:36.620 align:start position:0%
provides for
 
05:06:39.590 --> 05:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable restrictions to be placed by
 
05:06:42.110 --> 05:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
the um by an institution of Higher
 
05:06:45.110 --> 05:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
Learning for instance May maintain and
 
05:06:47.090 --> 05:06:47.100 align:start position:0%
enforce reasonable time place manner
 
05:06:47.100 --> 05:06:48.250 align:start position:0%
enforce reasonable time place manner
restrictions

05:06:48.250 --> 05:06:48.260 align:start position:0%
restrictions
 
05:06:51.910 --> 05:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
applicable public forums Etc
 
05:06:54.410 --> 05:06:54.420 align:start position:0%
any person who wishes to engage in
 
05:06:57.708 --> 05:06:57.718 align:start position:0%
non-commercial expressive activity on
 
05:07:00.890 --> 05:07:00.900 align:start position:0%
campus should be free be permitted to do
 
05:07:02.448 --> 05:07:02.458 align:start position:0%
so freely as long as the person's
 
05:07:05.208 --> 05:07:05.218 align:start position:0%
conduct is not unlawful and is not
 
05:07:07.490 --> 05:07:07.500 align:start position:0%
materially or substantially disrupt the
 
05:07:09.410 --> 05:07:09.420 align:start position:0%
functioning of the institution
 
05:07:13.930 --> 05:07:13.940 align:start position:0%
um so I think this language in this bill
 
05:07:18.530 --> 05:07:18.540 align:start position:0%
Works to both freedom of Stu freedom of
 
05:07:21.110 --> 05:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
speech for students and others on campus
 
05:07:25.788 --> 05:07:25.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:25.798 --> 05:07:28.690 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:07:28.690 --> 05:07:28.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:31.730 --> 05:07:31.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh given that
 
05:07:33.948 --> 05:07:33.958 align:start position:0%
explanation uh
 
05:07:35.810 --> 05:07:35.820 align:start position:0%
two of the people who have discussed
 
05:07:38.150 --> 05:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
this talked about disparaging remarks
 
05:07:41.570 --> 05:07:41.580 align:start position:0%
that were made on campus uh is there
 
05:07:43.310 --> 05:07:43.320 align:start position:0%
anything this bill is going to keep an
 
05:07:44.930 --> 05:07:44.940 align:start position:0%
individual from making disparaging
 
05:07:47.570 --> 05:07:47.580 align:start position:0%
remarks about an organization or or
 
05:07:49.070 --> 05:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
another individual based on
 
05:07:51.830 --> 05:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
representative Cornett cordelli's last
 
05:07:53.990 --> 05:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
quote I I would assume not I would
 
05:07:55.910 --> 05:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
assume you that's fine that the
 
05:07:58.190 --> 05:07:58.200 align:start position:0%
disparaging remarks depending on your
 
05:08:00.470 --> 05:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
political philosophy or whatever are
 
05:08:00.480 --> 05:08:02.750 align:start position:0%
political philosophy or whatever are
five

05:08:02.750 --> 05:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
five
 
05:08:05.868 --> 05:08:05.878 align:start position:0%
and right this is all about freedom of
 
05:08:07.850 --> 05:08:07.860 align:start position:0%
speech so um you know I think that's
 
05:08:10.010 --> 05:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about
 
05:08:12.310 --> 05:08:12.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps on woodcock
 
05:08:16.070 --> 05:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh I I am for free of speech and I think
 
05:08:17.868 --> 05:08:17.878 align:start position:0%
the university has representative Foley
 
05:08:20.150 --> 05:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
says the place to have that that being
 
05:08:22.850 --> 05:08:22.860 align:start position:0%
said we're talking about one small
 
05:08:25.788 --> 05:08:25.798 align:start position:0%
instance of the entire University system
 
05:08:29.270 --> 05:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
has come to our attention
 
05:08:31.850 --> 05:08:31.860 align:start position:0%
um it's like a pebble in the ocean if we
 
05:08:34.788 --> 05:08:34.798 align:start position:0%
have if we have if we have two three
 
05:08:38.690 --> 05:08:38.700 align:start position:0%
four five ten people concerned
 
05:08:41.270 --> 05:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
there's something there but what was it
 
05:08:42.948 --> 05:08:42.958 align:start position:0%
it was corrected several years ago and
 
05:08:45.050 --> 05:08:45.060 align:start position:0%
there's a process now I think I don't
 
05:08:46.430 --> 05:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
think this is appropriate for us to
 
05:08:50.208 --> 05:08:50.218 align:start position:0%
respond in this manner with a hammer uh
 
05:08:53.150 --> 05:08:53.160 align:start position:0%
versus the tap the tabs are the the the
 
05:08:55.910 --> 05:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
D the school start of several years ago
 
05:08:58.250 --> 05:08:58.260 align:start position:0%
he fixed it this is one process that was
 
05:09:00.410 --> 05:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
that was a skew
 
05:09:02.510 --> 05:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
um and you know his kids kids go before
 
05:09:05.030 --> 05:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
the kids on a board uh I think this is
 
05:09:07.850 --> 05:09:07.860 align:start position:0%
just too much uh overreach thank you
 
05:09:09.530 --> 05:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
Mercy McDonald
 
05:09:11.750 --> 05:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair to address that
 
05:09:13.850 --> 05:09:13.860 align:start position:0%
previous comment that this is an
 
05:09:17.090 --> 05:09:17.100 align:start position:0%
isolated Incident That's not the case 17
 
05:09:19.490 --> 05:09:19.500 align:start position:0%
states have passed similar laws because
 
05:09:21.350 --> 05:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
there's a national need for this and
 
05:09:23.690 --> 05:09:23.700 align:start position:0%
ACLU supports this bill in New Hampshire
 
05:09:25.910 --> 05:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
because there's a demonstrated need so
 
05:09:28.430 --> 05:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
that's not the case thank you
 
05:09:31.190 --> 05:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
representative yes go ahead I always
 
05:09:32.868 --> 05:09:32.878 align:start position:0%
wanted not to get a debate with you uh
 
05:09:34.970 --> 05:09:34.980 align:start position:0%
representative but I'm not worried about
 
05:09:36.770 --> 05:09:36.780 align:start position:0%
the other side with these states I worry
 
05:09:37.970 --> 05:09:37.980 align:start position:0%
about the incidents of New Hampshire
 
05:09:40.730 --> 05:09:40.740 align:start position:0%
which has been won last year amongst
 
05:09:42.350 --> 05:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
what do you say five kids Association
 
05:09:44.448 --> 05:09:44.458 align:start position:0%
I'm not suggesting is Right fear or
 
05:09:45.770 --> 05:09:45.780 align:start position:0%
anything I'm just suggesting we don't
 
05:09:49.190 --> 05:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
take the hammer at this point thank you
 
05:09:53.050 --> 05:09:53.060 align:start position:0%
uh rev some balbuni I'm representing the
 
05:09:56.930 --> 05:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
ACLU statement that he was presented
 
05:09:58.430 --> 05:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
um there actually was no documentation
 
05:10:00.110 --> 05:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
of that and when I went back to the
 
05:10:02.330 --> 05:10:02.340 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill and asked for that I
 
05:10:04.368 --> 05:10:04.378 align:start position:0%
did not receive it even though the uh
 
05:10:06.128 --> 05:10:06.138 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
05:10:08.570 --> 05:10:08.580 align:start position:0%
representative from the ACLU New
 
05:10:10.128 --> 05:10:10.138 align:start position:0%
Hampshire was attached to that email so
 
05:10:12.288 --> 05:10:12.298 align:start position:0%
I haven't seen anything from ACLU
 
05:10:14.868 --> 05:10:14.878 align:start position:0%
regarding this bill
 
05:10:17.448 --> 05:10:17.458 align:start position:0%
representative about leckis and then
 
05:10:20.448 --> 05:10:20.458 align:start position:0%
representing Belcher
 
05:10:23.150 --> 05:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
this just as a quick response I have
 
05:10:25.788 --> 05:10:25.798 align:start position:0%
heard from numerous students about
 
05:10:29.030 --> 05:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
issues including not that was the first
 
05:10:31.550 --> 05:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
I heard about that issue but um
 
05:10:33.470 --> 05:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
including when I first got elected
 
05:10:36.948 --> 05:10:36.958 align:start position:0%
people came specifically to me to report
 
05:10:38.810 --> 05:10:38.820 align:start position:0%
what was going on at their universities
 
05:10:38.820 --> 05:10:40.730 align:start position:0%
what was going on at their universities
but

05:10:40.730 --> 05:10:40.740 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:10:40.740 --> 05:10:42.190 align:start position:0%
but
things

05:10:42.190 --> 05:10:42.200 align:start position:0%
things
 
05:10:44.810 --> 05:10:44.820 align:start position:0%
administrators change administrations
 
05:10:48.350 --> 05:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
change cultures change some schools are
 
05:10:50.208 --> 05:10:50.218 align:start position:0%
doing better in our state some schools
 
05:10:51.910 --> 05:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
are slipping the other direction
 
05:10:54.350 --> 05:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
opposite of the way they were
 
05:10:57.470 --> 05:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
but do you remember the testimony of the
 
05:10:59.930 --> 05:10:59.940 align:start position:0%
person who said in their state
 
05:11:02.270 --> 05:11:02.280 align:start position:0%
they said oh we don't have this need
 
05:11:04.670 --> 05:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
even though they had the opportunity to
 
05:11:07.368 --> 05:11:07.378 align:start position:0%
pass it and then things blew up like two
 
05:11:09.830 --> 05:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
years later and they said we wish we
 
05:11:11.868 --> 05:11:11.878 align:start position:0%
would have passed it when it wasn't an
 
05:11:14.448 --> 05:11:14.458 align:start position:0%
issue because now it's an issue and we
 
05:11:16.250 --> 05:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
don't even have anything on the books to
 
05:11:19.430 --> 05:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
help us through it and so the idea is to
 
05:11:20.990 --> 05:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
pass this now
 
05:11:23.810 --> 05:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
while we don't have as much of an issue
 
05:11:25.610 --> 05:11:25.620 align:start position:0%
as we did in the past
 
05:11:28.010 --> 05:11:28.020 align:start position:0%
so that hopefully we won't have two
 
05:11:30.288 --> 05:11:30.298 align:start position:0%
years from now or next year or whenever
 
05:11:32.990 --> 05:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
an issue because this will be on the
 
05:11:34.788 --> 05:11:34.798 align:start position:0%
books at a time when we're not
 
05:11:37.490 --> 05:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
mid-conflict it's much easier to pass
 
05:11:42.890 --> 05:11:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:45.250 --> 05:11:45.260 align:start position:0%
so first one we'll quickly
 
05:11:45.260 --> 05:11:47.170 align:start position:0%
so first one we'll quickly
representative

05:11:47.170 --> 05:11:47.180 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:11:50.510 --> 05:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
lad as a member of the
 
05:11:52.430 --> 05:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
College Council
 
05:11:54.830 --> 05:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
trustees trust whatever that term is yes
 
05:11:56.810 --> 05:11:56.820 align:start position:0%
you being that person
 
05:11:58.550 --> 05:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
um is there a perspective from your view
 
05:12:01.070 --> 05:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
from that umbrella group
 
05:12:03.350 --> 05:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
the trustees I can't speak for the
 
05:12:05.690 --> 05:12:05.700 align:start position:0%
trustees because I'm a single just like
 
05:12:07.550 --> 05:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
a single selectman can't speak for the
 
05:12:08.990 --> 05:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
select board the trustee you've seen
 
05:12:10.970 --> 05:12:10.980 align:start position:0%
this issue Army or the trustee you've
 
05:12:12.470 --> 05:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
seen this issue
 
05:12:14.690 --> 05:12:14.700 align:start position:0%
as an issue
 
05:12:18.470 --> 05:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
I I've not discussed this issue as a
 
05:12:21.410 --> 05:12:21.420 align:start position:0%
trustee with other trustees I have not
 
05:12:23.448 --> 05:12:23.458 align:start position:0%
seen it on the docket okay thank you
 
05:12:25.250 --> 05:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher thank you Mr
 
05:12:26.390 --> 05:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
chair I just wanted to quickly address
 
05:12:28.310 --> 05:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
the issue of the disparaging remarks
 
05:12:29.810 --> 05:12:29.820 align:start position:0%
that we had heard about and the issue of
 
05:12:31.250 --> 05:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
free speech
 
05:12:33.230 --> 05:12:33.240 align:start position:0%
um we need to be very clear about who
 
05:12:35.230 --> 05:12:35.240 align:start position:0%
whose speech is being protected here
 
05:12:38.868 --> 05:12:38.878 align:start position:0%
because the people have Free Speech but
 
05:12:41.868 --> 05:12:41.878 align:start position:0%
government does not have free speech so
 
05:12:43.788 --> 05:12:43.798 align:start position:0%
when somebody is acting as an agent of
 
05:12:45.708 --> 05:12:45.718 align:start position:0%
the government such as on a school
 
05:12:48.948 --> 05:12:48.958 align:start position:0%
honest public school council or board or
 
05:12:50.810 --> 05:12:50.820 align:start position:0%
whatever they don't have the right to
 
05:12:52.310 --> 05:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
free speech you just disparage
 
05:12:54.650 --> 05:12:54.660 align:start position:0%
Christians or anyone else as they as
 
05:12:56.690 --> 05:12:56.700 align:start position:0%
they see fit they that's actually
 
05:12:56.700 --> 05:12:58.910 align:start position:0%
they see fit they that's actually
discrimination

05:12:58.910 --> 05:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
05:13:00.708 --> 05:13:00.718 align:start position:0%
um so we need to be very careful about
 
05:13:04.490 --> 05:13:04.500 align:start position:0%
who is whose speech is being protected
 
05:13:06.890 --> 05:13:06.900 align:start position:0%
further discussion wait okay represent
 
05:13:08.510 --> 05:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
luno yeah thank you very much on the
 
05:13:10.730 --> 05:13:10.740 align:start position:0%
subject of discrimination and let's talk
 
05:13:13.970 --> 05:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
about that so looking at
 
05:13:17.990 --> 05:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
bottom of page two line 36.
 
05:13:21.288 --> 05:13:21.298 align:start position:0%
and 37 going through the top of page 3
 
05:13:25.610 --> 05:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
down to line six and what that reads is
 
05:13:25.620 --> 05:13:26.770 align:start position:0%
down to line six and what that reads is
that

05:13:26.770 --> 05:13:26.780 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:13:29.690 --> 05:13:29.700 align:start position:0%
no institutions for higher ed shall deny
 
05:13:32.690 --> 05:13:32.700 align:start position:0%
a religious political or ideological
 
05:13:34.850 --> 05:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
student organization any benefit blah
 
05:13:36.128 --> 05:13:36.138 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah
 
05:13:38.150 --> 05:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
based on the expression of the
 
05:13:41.330 --> 05:13:41.340 align:start position:0%
organization including so this is no
 
05:13:43.970 --> 05:13:43.980 align:start position:0%
Institute of higher education shall deny
 
05:13:46.788 --> 05:13:46.798 align:start position:0%
student organization including any
 
05:13:48.770 --> 05:13:48.780 align:start position:0%
requirement that the leaders are members
 
05:13:51.350 --> 05:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
of such organizations we're not talking
 
05:13:53.990 --> 05:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
about the student organization affirm
 
05:13:55.550 --> 05:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
and adhere to that organization
 
05:13:58.250 --> 05:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
sincerely held beliefs comply with the
 
05:14:00.530 --> 05:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
organization's standard of conduct or
 
05:14:02.270 --> 05:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
further the organization's Mission or
 
05:14:03.948 --> 05:14:03.958 align:start position:0%
purpose as defined by the student
 
05:14:08.208 --> 05:14:08.218 align:start position:0%
organization so what that is saying is
 
05:14:11.570 --> 05:14:11.580 align:start position:0%
that is that the student organization
 
05:14:14.270 --> 05:14:14.280 align:start position:0%
um would um would would
 
05:14:16.610 --> 05:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
they have to be would have to be
 
05:14:18.890 --> 05:14:18.900 align:start position:0%
recognized by The Institute of higher
 
05:14:21.430 --> 05:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
education and that student organization
 
05:14:25.368 --> 05:14:25.378 align:start position:0%
would through this Clause right here be
 
05:14:28.010 --> 05:14:28.020 align:start position:0%
absolutely capable
 
05:14:30.770 --> 05:14:30.780 align:start position:0%
um of discriminating based on protected
 
05:14:33.890 --> 05:14:33.900 align:start position:0%
classes of um of you know we've talked
 
05:14:35.930 --> 05:14:35.940 align:start position:0%
about them about about them here I think
 
05:14:38.448 --> 05:14:38.458 align:start position:0%
we all know what we're talking about and
 
05:14:39.770 --> 05:14:39.780 align:start position:0%
um and that's that's blatant
 
05:14:41.930 --> 05:14:41.940 align:start position:0%
discrimination and that's blatantly
 
05:14:44.270 --> 05:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
putting the university system and the
 
05:14:46.190 --> 05:14:46.200 align:start position:0%
community college system in a place
 
05:14:48.890 --> 05:14:48.900 align:start position:0%
where where they
 
05:14:51.350 --> 05:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
um you know if they if they provide
 
05:14:53.510 --> 05:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
organizations with I don't know what it
 
05:14:56.510 --> 05:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
is 200 500 something something like that
 
05:14:58.010 --> 05:14:58.020 align:start position:0%
that they would have to provide
 
05:15:00.590 --> 05:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
organizations that discriminate
 
05:15:00.600 --> 05:15:01.190 align:start position:0%
organizations that discriminate
um

05:15:01.190 --> 05:15:01.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:15:02.510 --> 05:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
um based on
 
05:15:05.150 --> 05:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
protected classes both federally and in
 
05:15:06.590 --> 05:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
state law
 
05:15:09.708 --> 05:15:09.718 align:start position:0%
um uh with uh with taxpayer money I I
 
05:15:12.170 --> 05:15:12.180 align:start position:0%
would suggest that that may be the
 
05:15:15.948 --> 05:15:15.958 align:start position:0%
reason why lines 24-26 are in there
 
05:15:18.650 --> 05:15:18.660 align:start position:0%
which is the severability clause in this
 
05:15:23.030 --> 05:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
but uh but clearly clearly I think any
 
05:15:27.170 --> 05:15:27.180 align:start position:0%
of us who who believe in in
 
05:15:29.868 --> 05:15:29.878 align:start position:0%
um in non-discrimination
 
05:15:32.948 --> 05:15:32.958 align:start position:0%
would would feel that
 
05:15:36.110 --> 05:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
the provisions from page two down lines
 
05:15:39.110 --> 05:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
36 through 37 and at the top of Page
 
05:15:41.990 --> 05:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
Three lines one through six would uh
 
05:15:44.810 --> 05:15:44.820 align:start position:0%
would need to be um stricken from
 
05:15:46.970 --> 05:15:46.980 align:start position:0%
um this bill
 
05:15:48.830 --> 05:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
05:15:50.208 --> 05:15:50.218 align:start position:0%
um I disagree
 
05:15:52.368 --> 05:15:52.378 align:start position:0%
um I think uh if you look at our Human
 
05:15:55.850 --> 05:15:55.860 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission statutes there is a
 
05:15:57.830 --> 05:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
religious exemption
 
05:15:59.868 --> 05:15:59.878 align:start position:0%
um so that religious exempt religious
 
05:16:03.830 --> 05:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:03.840 --> 05:16:04.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:16:04.550 --> 05:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:07.330 --> 05:16:07.340 align:start position:0%
have members who
 
05:16:10.910 --> 05:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
abide by their faith adhere to their
 
05:16:10.920 --> 05:16:12.288 align:start position:0%
abide by their faith adhere to their
faith

05:16:12.288 --> 05:16:12.298 align:start position:0%
faith
 
05:16:14.830 --> 05:16:14.840 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know if
 
05:16:19.190 --> 05:16:19.200 align:start position:0%
the one of these groups the FEC
 
05:16:22.690 --> 05:16:22.700 align:start position:0%
um you know would want uh atheists
 
05:16:25.910 --> 05:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
as members of their group maybe that
 
05:16:27.770 --> 05:16:27.780 align:start position:0%
group might because they were pretty
 
05:16:31.070 --> 05:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
much non-denominational as I recall but
 
05:16:33.650 --> 05:16:33.660 align:start position:0%
um there is in statute a religious
 
05:16:33.660 --> 05:16:35.510 align:start position:0%
um there is in statute a religious
exemption

05:16:35.510 --> 05:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
05:16:35.520 --> 05:16:36.530 align:start position:0%
exemption
yeah

05:16:36.530 --> 05:16:36.540 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:16:38.990 --> 05:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
okay uh we we still haven't done
 
05:16:41.150 --> 05:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
anything on the amendment yet and that's
 
05:16:44.208 --> 05:16:44.218 align:start position:0%
just a one-word Amendment so what we
 
05:16:47.270 --> 05:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
ought to do is try Park that away one
 
05:16:49.550 --> 05:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
way or the other and then then we can go
 
05:16:52.070 --> 05:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
on and have a discussion wherever that
 
05:16:54.110 --> 05:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
takes us
 
05:16:54.120 --> 05:16:56.208 align:start position:0%
takes us
so

05:16:56.208 --> 05:16:56.218 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:16:58.310 --> 05:16:58.320 align:start position:0%

05:18:15.730 --> 05:18:15.740 align:start position:0%

05:18:24.170 --> 05:18:24.180 align:start position:0%
it says nothing contained in this
 
05:18:25.910 --> 05:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
chapter shall be construed to borrow any
 
05:18:28.810 --> 05:18:28.820 align:start position:0%

05:18:42.170 --> 05:18:42.180 align:start position:0%
with a religious organization from
 
05:18:43.970 --> 05:18:43.980 align:start position:0%
limiting admission to or giving
 
05:18:45.830 --> 05:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
preference to persons of the same
 
05:18:48.470 --> 05:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
religion or denomination or from making
 
05:18:51.230 --> 05:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
such selection is as is calculated by
 
05:18:53.270 --> 05:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
such organization to promote the
 
05:18:55.550 --> 05:18:55.560 align:start position:0%
religious principles for which it is
 
05:18:59.390 --> 05:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:59.400 --> 05:19:00.830 align:start position:0%
 
with

05:19:00.830 --> 05:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:19:03.590 --> 05:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
where where is where is the
 
05:19:03.600 --> 05:19:05.448 align:start position:0%
where where is where is the
discriminatory

05:19:05.448 --> 05:19:05.458 align:start position:0%
discriminatory
 
05:19:07.368 --> 05:19:07.378 align:start position:0%
section in there
 
05:19:09.708 --> 05:19:09.718 align:start position:0%
I mean you you know I I think contained
 
05:19:12.410 --> 05:19:12.420 align:start position:0%
in this chapter shall be construed to
 
05:19:14.150 --> 05:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
fire any religious organization from
 
05:19:16.190 --> 05:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
doing any of those things that was
 
05:19:18.230 --> 05:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
written under exceptions
 
05:19:21.170 --> 05:19:21.180 align:start position:0%
when we were looking at that whole
 
05:19:24.470 --> 05:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
area and this is an exception where you
 
05:19:27.110 --> 05:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
can do certain things right but there's
 
05:19:29.390 --> 05:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
also renting a property and right right
 
05:19:34.250 --> 05:19:34.260 align:start position:0%
and anybody can can can can can can do
 
05:19:36.230 --> 05:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
those things but you but it's not saying
 
05:19:39.110 --> 05:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
that you can discriminate against
 
05:19:43.070 --> 05:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
um against others and and and in the in
 
05:19:45.590 --> 05:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
the section that I cited here
 
05:19:49.670 --> 05:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
um uh yes it would it would apply to to
 
05:19:51.650 --> 05:19:51.660 align:start position:0%
any of the protected classes whether
 
05:19:54.110 --> 05:19:54.120 align:start position:0%
that's religious or whether that's race
 
05:19:56.390 --> 05:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
or whether that's gender or gender
 
05:19:59.750 --> 05:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
entity or or ethnicity if you wanted to
 
05:20:03.230 --> 05:20:03.240 align:start position:0%
have a a student organization that was
 
05:20:06.770 --> 05:20:06.780 align:start position:0%
um for white people only then and um and
 
05:20:10.430 --> 05:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
in order to um to to and and you put in
 
05:20:11.868 --> 05:20:11.878 align:start position:0%
to receive
 
05:20:14.930 --> 05:20:14.940 align:start position:0%
funds from the University system they
 
05:20:18.288 --> 05:20:18.298 align:start position:0%
couldn't deny you those funds
 
05:20:21.530 --> 05:20:21.540 align:start position:0%
um and they could not require you to um
 
05:20:24.010 --> 05:20:24.020 align:start position:0%
to to accept
 
05:20:26.810 --> 05:20:26.820 align:start position:0%
you know people who maybe didn't comply
 
05:20:29.810 --> 05:20:29.820 align:start position:0%
maybe didn't fall into the white guy
 
05:20:34.550 --> 05:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
only uh category and um and and because
 
05:20:37.430 --> 05:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
it says here that um that the member
 
05:20:39.350 --> 05:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
that the uh
 
05:20:42.050 --> 05:20:42.060 align:start position:0%
that you that the university system or
 
05:20:43.850 --> 05:20:43.860 align:start position:0%
the community college system would not
 
05:20:45.770 --> 05:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
be able to have any requirement that the
 
05:20:49.010 --> 05:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
leaders or members of such organization
 
05:20:52.010 --> 05:20:52.020 align:start position:0%
um uh affirming
 
05:20:54.288 --> 05:20:54.298 align:start position:0%
make sure every
 
05:20:58.250 --> 05:20:58.260 align:start position:0%
no public interest shall deny and then
 
05:21:00.050 --> 05:21:00.060 align:start position:0%
all the words
 
05:21:01.788 --> 05:21:01.798 align:start position:0%
um based on
 
05:21:04.550 --> 05:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
any requirement that leaders or or of
 
05:21:06.948 --> 05:21:06.958 align:start position:0%
such organization uh affirm and adhere
 
05:21:08.868 --> 05:21:08.878 align:start position:0%
to that organization sincerely held
 
05:21:11.270 --> 05:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
belief let's say they're sincerely held
 
05:21:13.788 --> 05:21:13.798 align:start position:0%
belief or thing beliefs are things that
 
05:21:17.510 --> 05:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
we find abhorrent and and our and and
 
05:21:20.150 --> 05:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
um uh and discriminate against uh
 
05:21:22.430 --> 05:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
protected classes the university system
 
05:21:26.090 --> 05:21:26.100 align:start position:0%
would still have to recognize that as a
 
05:21:28.270 --> 05:21:28.280 align:start position:0%
um as a as a student
 
05:21:32.510 --> 05:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
organization and and so I I'll I'll I'll
 
05:21:35.390 --> 05:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
I'll defer to representative cordelli
 
05:21:37.490 --> 05:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
when it comes to the the religious
 
05:21:41.448 --> 05:21:41.458 align:start position:0%
exemption uh language in the um human
 
05:21:44.150 --> 05:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
rights statute but uh but again I'm not
 
05:21:46.250 --> 05:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
quite sure how that language relates to
 
05:21:49.910 --> 05:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
what's uh what's being put forth here
 
05:21:53.448 --> 05:21:53.458 align:start position:0%
with respect to um clearly something
 
05:21:55.128 --> 05:21:55.138 align:start position:0%
that would allow an organization to
 
05:21:55.138 --> 05:21:56.390 align:start position:0%
that would allow an organization to
discriminate

05:21:56.390 --> 05:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
discriminate
 
05:21:58.610 --> 05:21:58.620 align:start position:0%
against protected classes I have a
 
05:22:00.948 --> 05:22:00.958 align:start position:0%
question maybe uh either somebody here
 
05:22:04.190 --> 05:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
can help me or maybe Mr Cronin can we
 
05:22:05.868 --> 05:22:05.878 align:start position:0%
know that on a number of universities
 
05:22:08.030 --> 05:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
including ours we have Greek fraternity
 
05:22:08.040 --> 05:22:09.530 align:start position:0%
including ours we have Greek fraternity
sororities

05:22:09.530 --> 05:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
sororities
 
05:22:12.410 --> 05:22:12.420 align:start position:0%
and when I was up at Orono we had the
 
05:22:12.420 --> 05:22:13.910 align:start position:0%
and when I was up at Orono we had the
agriculture

05:22:13.910 --> 05:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
agriculture
 
05:22:16.490 --> 05:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
fraternity I can't remember what the
 
05:22:19.190 --> 05:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
Greek nomenclature was for that
 
05:22:19.200 --> 05:22:19.970 align:start position:0%
Greek nomenclature was for that
um

05:22:19.970 --> 05:22:19.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:23.570 --> 05:22:23.580 align:start position:0%
uh but they had sort of the requirement
 
05:22:24.890 --> 05:22:24.900 align:start position:0%
built in
 
05:22:26.990 --> 05:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
that in order to be a member of this you
 
05:22:29.330 --> 05:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
had to be an AG major or you had to be a
 
05:22:29.340 --> 05:22:30.650 align:start position:0%
had to be an AG major or you had to be a
farmer

05:22:30.650 --> 05:22:30.660 align:start position:0%
farmer
 
05:22:32.990 --> 05:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
um if if I wanted to get in there not
 
05:22:34.850 --> 05:22:34.860 align:start position:0%
wanting to be either of those or either
 
05:22:41.930 --> 05:22:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:45.110 --> 05:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
okay well as long as you're accepting
 
05:22:46.490 --> 05:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
you know
 
05:22:50.390 --> 05:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
yeah as long as you're accepting uh
 
05:22:52.310 --> 05:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
gender you know you're not denying a
 
05:22:53.868 --> 05:22:53.878 align:start position:0%
based on gender or any of the other
 
05:22:57.948 --> 05:22:57.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:59.570 --> 05:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
sure that may have come up somewhere
 
05:23:02.570 --> 05:23:02.580 align:start position:0%
along the way but perhaps
 
05:23:04.190 --> 05:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
well I had something else that I wanted
 
05:23:06.770 --> 05:23:06.780 align:start position:0%
to point out but I do want to just say
 
05:23:09.230 --> 05:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
so it's okay to discriminate as long as
 
05:23:11.448 --> 05:23:11.458 align:start position:0%
you're not discriminating against a
 
05:23:15.670 --> 05:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
protected class so some classes are
 
05:23:18.890 --> 05:23:18.900 align:start position:0%
I guess more protected than others but
 
05:23:22.850 --> 05:23:22.860 align:start position:0%
what I what my point was one of the
 
05:23:25.788 --> 05:23:25.798 align:start position:0%
organizations that came and talked to us
 
05:23:28.730 --> 05:23:28.740 align:start position:0%
was open to anybody membership wise
 
05:23:31.010 --> 05:23:31.020 align:start position:0%
their issue with this with what was
 
05:23:35.448 --> 05:23:35.458 align:start position:0%
being required was that their leader
 
05:23:38.448 --> 05:23:38.458 align:start position:0%
by the school was they were saying that
 
05:23:41.090 --> 05:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
the leader could protect you could
 
05:23:43.910 --> 05:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
completely disagree with them
 
05:23:46.310 --> 05:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
and they couldn't require that their
 
05:23:49.070 --> 05:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
leader agreed with the precepts in that
 
05:23:51.050 --> 05:23:51.060 align:start position:0%
case it was a religious organization and
 
05:23:53.270 --> 05:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
they wanted their leader to be of that
 
05:23:55.730 --> 05:23:55.740 align:start position:0%
religion they said the organization and
 
05:23:58.610 --> 05:23:58.620 align:start position:0%
they were very happy to take anybody
 
05:24:00.350 --> 05:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
because that was part of the point of
 
05:24:02.990 --> 05:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
the organization but the leader should
 
05:24:05.990 --> 05:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
be of the same of of the beliefs of the
 
05:24:08.890 --> 05:24:08.900 align:start position:0%
thing and just as a
 
05:24:12.910 --> 05:24:12.920 align:start position:0%
example if you had a young
 
05:24:15.948 --> 05:24:15.958 align:start position:0%
Democrats on campus facility in an
 
05:24:17.750 --> 05:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
organization you would not want a
 
05:24:19.970 --> 05:24:19.980 align:start position:0%
republican to be forced to have a
 
05:24:22.490 --> 05:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
republican as your leader
 
05:24:25.010 --> 05:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
just you know because you would want
 
05:24:27.170 --> 05:24:27.180 align:start position:0%
them to be a Democrat because that's
 
05:24:45.970 --> 05:24:45.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:50.150 --> 05:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
that was the whole that was the leaders
 
05:24:51.830 --> 05:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
elected by the members of the
 
05:24:51.840 --> 05:24:52.650 align:start position:0%
elected by the members of the
organization

05:24:52.650 --> 05:24:52.660 align:start position:0%
organization
 
05:24:52.660 --> 05:24:53.770 align:start position:0%
organization
[Music]

05:24:53.770 --> 05:24:53.780 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:24:57.530 --> 05:24:57.540 align:start position:0%
the University was not going to grant
 
05:25:00.770 --> 05:25:00.780 align:start position:0%
them an ability to be on there if they
 
05:25:04.250 --> 05:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
insisted that their leader was adhered
 
05:25:06.770 --> 05:25:06.780 align:start position:0%
to their beliefs that's that was
 
05:25:06.780 --> 05:25:09.288 align:start position:0%
to their beliefs that's that was
specifically

05:25:09.288 --> 05:25:09.298 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
05:25:11.750 --> 05:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
um that testimony was specifically
 
05:25:15.948 --> 05:25:15.958 align:start position:0%
towards this piece right here so
 
05:25:17.650 --> 05:25:17.660 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher
 
05:25:20.150 --> 05:25:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I I think it's
 
05:25:21.288 --> 05:25:21.298 align:start position:0%
important to get to the heart of this
 
05:25:22.368 --> 05:25:22.378 align:start position:0%
issue a little bit when it comes to
 
05:25:23.750 --> 05:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
these talk about discrimination in
 
05:25:26.030 --> 05:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
student groups the most appropriate
 
05:25:27.948 --> 05:25:27.958 align:start position:0%
thing to look at is not is not federal
 
05:25:29.570 --> 05:25:29.580 align:start position:0%
law or state law it's the Constitution
 
05:25:32.810 --> 05:25:32.820 align:start position:0%
and once again who has rights in the
 
05:25:34.910 --> 05:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution the institution doesn't
 
05:25:37.128 --> 05:25:37.138 align:start position:0%
have rights therefore it has to treat
 
05:25:39.948 --> 05:25:39.958 align:start position:0%
people as under sect or under amendment
 
05:25:42.350 --> 05:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
14 equal protection as well as federal
 
05:25:45.170 --> 05:25:45.180 align:start position:0%
law anti-discrimination law it has to
 
05:25:47.330 --> 05:25:47.340 align:start position:0%
treat people equally people however
 
05:25:50.270 --> 05:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
individual people have rights including
 
05:25:52.670 --> 05:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
the freedom of Association
 
05:25:54.830 --> 05:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
and like it or not that does Grant
 
05:25:56.628 --> 05:25:56.638 align:start position:0%
people individual people the right to
 
05:25:58.910 --> 05:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
discriminate if they choose to do so
 
05:26:01.010 --> 05:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
and it just it's it's part of being an
 
05:26:02.868 --> 05:26:02.878 align:start position:0%
American you don't have to like what
 
05:26:04.250 --> 05:26:04.260 align:start position:0%
they're doing but you can't get rid of
 
05:26:05.570 --> 05:26:05.580 align:start position:0%
people because you don't like what you
 
05:26:07.070 --> 05:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
think you can't deny them equal access
 
05:26:08.750 --> 05:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
to the institutions because you don't
 
05:26:10.190 --> 05:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
like what they think
 
05:26:11.628 --> 05:26:11.638 align:start position:0%
that's that's the difference in
 
05:26:13.490 --> 05:26:13.500 align:start position:0%
government and people
 
05:26:17.810 --> 05:26:17.820 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli uh thank you
 
05:26:20.150 --> 05:26:20.160 align:start position:0%

05:26:23.030 --> 05:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
look up it's the uh
 
05:26:28.788 --> 05:26:28.798 align:start position:0%

05:26:38.690 --> 05:26:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:42.470 --> 05:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
um related to religion
 
05:26:46.070 --> 05:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
um it provides for
 
05:26:46.080 --> 05:26:46.850 align:start position:0%
um it provides for
um

05:26:46.850 --> 05:26:46.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:48.890 --> 05:26:48.900 align:start position:0%
leadership of religious student groups
 
05:26:51.470 --> 05:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
similar to other student groups such as
 
05:26:52.970 --> 05:26:52.980 align:start position:0%
political student groups the equal
 
05:26:55.070 --> 05:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
access act permits religious student
 
05:26:57.170 --> 05:26:57.180 align:start position:0%
groups to allow only members of their
 
05:26:58.490 --> 05:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
religion to serve in leadership
 
05:27:01.310 --> 05:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
positions if these leadership positions
 
05:27:02.930 --> 05:27:02.940 align:start position:0%
are positions that affect the religious
 
05:27:04.670 --> 05:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
content of the speech at the group

similar to student groups such as

05:27:14.810 --> 05:27:14.820 align:start position:0%

05:28:29.340 --> 05:28:30.530 align:start position:0%
because uh this this is an important

issue
 
05:28:33.050 --> 05:28:33.060 align:start position:0%
and there are obviously some problems
 
05:28:34.190 --> 05:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
that we've got with some of the
 
05:28:35.750 --> 05:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
languages been pointed out in our
 
05:28:35.760 --> 05:28:36.770 align:start position:0%
languages been pointed out in our
discussion

05:28:36.770 --> 05:28:36.780 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
05:28:40.070 --> 05:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
I would move to retain this bill when I
 
05:28:43.010 --> 05:28:43.020 align:start position:0%
would assume that uh Mr Cronin would be
 
05:28:46.490 --> 05:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
willing to work with uh the group to try
 
05:28:48.590 --> 05:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
to look at this language to see if we
 
05:28:51.410 --> 05:28:51.420 align:start position:0%
might be able to ferret something out of
 
05:28:53.448 --> 05:28:53.458 align:start position:0%
the language so I would I would move to
 
05:28:57.890 --> 05:28:57.900 align:start position:0%
retain is there a second second
 
05:29:02.090 --> 05:29:02.100 align:start position:0%
person uh Myler proposes we retain this
 
05:29:04.850 --> 05:29:04.860 align:start position:0%
bill second by representative Damon
 
05:29:07.430 --> 05:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
05:29:08.628 --> 05:29:08.638 align:start position:0%
from either
 
05:29:13.150 --> 05:29:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:17.150 --> 05:29:17.160 align:start position:0%
could we hear from uh uh Mr Clark well I
 
05:29:19.128 --> 05:29:19.138 align:start position:0%
think we know where the the universities
 
05:29:20.570 --> 05:29:20.580 align:start position:0%
already let us know that where they feel
 
05:29:24.470 --> 05:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
on this bill okay so I thank you
 
05:29:33.350 --> 05:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:35.330 --> 05:29:35.340 align:start position:0%

could move forward and also try and move
 
05:29:49.250 --> 05:29:49.260 align:start position:0%
this issue along as opposed to uh
 
05:29:51.670 --> 05:29:51.680 align:start position:0%

we'll write the itl

05:32:09.230 --> 05:32:09.240 align:start position:0%

skipping over 331 Army okay
 
05:32:18.230 --> 05:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
um so the first bill would take up is
 
05:32:20.448 --> 05:32:20.458 align:start position:0%
the next one down 432 relative to
 
05:32:22.490 --> 05:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
participation in the education Freedom
 
05:32:25.788 --> 05:32:25.798 align:start position:0%

05:32:31.850 --> 05:32:31.860 align:start position:0%
did we jump over 61 yeah oh okay I'll go
 
05:32:33.230 --> 05:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
back up
 
05:32:36.170 --> 05:32:36.180 align:start position:0%
uh hb61 relative teaching on
 
05:32:38.330 --> 05:32:38.340 align:start position:0%
discrimination in the public schools and
 
05:32:40.910 --> 05:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
discrimination and public workplaces uh
 
05:32:43.610 --> 05:32:43.620 align:start position:0%
representative cordiello you uh I move
 
05:32:47.090 --> 05:32:47.100 align:start position:0%
in expedient to legislate
 
05:32:49.930 --> 05:32:49.940 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
05:32:53.030 --> 05:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
Belcher can I get the bill up first okay
 
05:32:58.250 --> 05:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
so we're on HB 61 motions made itl by
 
05:33:00.770 --> 05:33:00.780 align:start position:0%
representative and
 
05:33:10.368 --> 05:33:10.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:12.948 --> 05:33:12.958 align:start position:0%
the sponsor on that sponsor of the nick
 
05:33:15.650 --> 05:33:15.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:20.090 --> 05:33:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:22.250 --> 05:33:22.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
05:33:25.490 --> 05:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
um so it seems like a really long time
 
05:33:28.550 --> 05:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
since that hearing over in the big Hall
 
05:33:34.250 --> 05:33:34.260 align:start position:0%
a lot of people came to that hearing uh
 
05:33:34.260 --> 05:33:37.610 align:start position:0%
a lot of people came to that hearing uh
and

05:33:37.610 --> 05:33:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:41.090 --> 05:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
what remains clear in my mind is that
 
05:33:43.490 --> 05:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
there were many
 
05:33:46.128 --> 05:33:46.138 align:start position:0%
teachers and people who spoke about
 
05:33:50.208 --> 05:33:50.218 align:start position:0%
teachers and there was
 
05:33:54.650 --> 05:33:54.660 align:start position:0%
a lot of fear that by teaching on
 
05:33:56.390 --> 05:33:56.400 align:start position:0%
certain historical topics related to
 
05:33:59.270 --> 05:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
race that these teachers were risking
 
05:34:01.368 --> 05:34:01.378 align:start position:0%
their jobs
 
05:34:05.390 --> 05:34:05.400 align:start position:0%
and for that reason they supported
 
05:34:05.400 --> 05:34:07.670 align:start position:0%
and for that reason they supported
repealing

05:34:07.670 --> 05:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
repealing
 
05:34:09.948 --> 05:34:09.958 align:start position:0%
the original Law
 
05:34:12.410 --> 05:34:12.420 align:start position:0%
which just to remind you
 
05:34:15.050 --> 05:34:15.060 align:start position:0%
is actually if you have your book it's
 
05:34:17.150 --> 05:34:17.160 align:start position:0%
on page 530 I think it's important to
 
05:34:19.190 --> 05:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
look at the original Law because this
 
05:34:22.610 --> 05:34:22.620 align:start position:0%
bill is suggesting that we repeal it
 
05:34:25.010 --> 05:34:25.020 align:start position:0%
so what are we repealing one of the
 
05:34:27.230 --> 05:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
things that all so concerned me in the
 
05:34:29.990 --> 05:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
hearing was that I felt that a lot of
 
05:34:30.000 --> 05:34:31.070 align:start position:0%
hearing was that I felt that a lot of
the

05:34:31.070 --> 05:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:34:33.650 --> 05:34:33.660 align:start position:0%
people who testified were unfamiliar
 
05:34:37.970 --> 05:34:37.980 align:start position:0%
with the law that they wanted repealed
 
05:34:44.050 --> 05:34:44.060 align:start position:0%
there was a disconnect between hb61 and
 
05:34:44.060 --> 05:34:45.890 align:start position:0%
there was a disconnect between hb61 and
193.40.

05:34:45.890 --> 05:34:45.900 align:start position:0%
193.40.
 
05:34:48.708 --> 05:34:48.718 align:start position:0%
the bill to be repealed
 
05:34:51.050 --> 05:34:51.060 align:start position:0%
so I think it's very important
 
05:34:53.090 --> 05:34:53.100 align:start position:0%
um to
 
05:34:54.770 --> 05:34:54.780 align:start position:0%
understand everything that's in that
 
05:34:57.350 --> 05:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
bill okay I will read it but I mean
 
05:34:59.030 --> 05:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
you're probably familiar with it I
 
05:35:01.730 --> 05:35:01.740 align:start position:0%
certainly studied it I studied it hard
 
05:35:03.350 --> 05:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
um this bill is really important to me
 
05:35:06.170 --> 05:35:06.180 align:start position:0%
as far as not having it passed because I
 
05:35:08.270 --> 05:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
come at this from a sort of a unique
 
05:35:10.910 --> 05:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
perspective having been a teacher not
 
05:35:12.650 --> 05:35:12.660 align:start position:0%
just a teacher I was an English teacher
 
05:35:14.390 --> 05:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
and I actually I feel like I'm in class
 
05:35:16.670 --> 05:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
again the reason I have these books with
 
05:35:19.730 --> 05:35:19.740 align:start position:0%
me is they were in my backpack because I
 
05:35:21.650 --> 05:35:21.660 align:start position:0%
am you know as you know I'm a
 
05:35:24.770 --> 05:35:24.780 align:start position:0%
assistant Library director and The
 
05:35:26.868 --> 05:35:26.878 align:start position:0%
Dudley Tucker library now I'm no longer
 
05:35:28.850 --> 05:35:28.860 align:start position:0%
a teacher I am a teacher though I feel
 
05:35:31.810 --> 05:35:31.820 align:start position:0%
like in all my capacities I am a teacher
 
05:35:35.930 --> 05:35:35.940 align:start position:0%
whether I'm a writer or I uh working in
 
05:35:37.970 --> 05:35:37.980 align:start position:0%
a library or my previous role as an
 
05:35:39.708 --> 05:35:39.718 align:start position:0%
adjunct English instructor
 
05:35:43.610 --> 05:35:43.620 align:start position:0%
and so for quite a few years I taught
 
05:35:45.350 --> 05:35:45.360 align:start position:0%
class in 19th century American
 
05:35:47.750 --> 05:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
autobiographical literature and for a
 
05:35:49.430 --> 05:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
month we spent
 
05:35:52.070 --> 05:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
talking about slave narratives
 
05:35:54.890 --> 05:35:54.900 align:start position:0%
and Frederick Douglass especially and he
 
05:35:56.890 --> 05:35:56.900 align:start position:0%
was mentioned at the hearing
 
05:35:59.090 --> 05:35:59.100 align:start position:0%
in my current position as library
 
05:36:01.250 --> 05:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
assistant Library director I'm in charge
 
05:36:03.770 --> 05:36:03.780 align:start position:0%
of programming and um
 
05:36:05.750 --> 05:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
for my first program I actually chose to
 
05:36:07.910 --> 05:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
talk about what I know about slave
 
05:36:10.430 --> 05:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
narratives about a week ago just to kind
 
05:36:11.990 --> 05:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
of remind me myself of all the the
 
05:36:12.000 --> 05:36:13.430 align:start position:0%
of remind me myself of all the the
content

05:36:13.430 --> 05:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
content
 
05:36:15.350 --> 05:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:36:17.030 --> 05:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
you know ask myself gee should I have
 
05:36:21.470 --> 05:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
fear being fired and no not at all you
 
05:36:22.910 --> 05:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
can talk about all the horrors of
 
05:36:24.410 --> 05:36:24.420 align:start position:0%
slavery and you can talk about all these
 
05:36:26.448 --> 05:36:26.458 align:start position:0%
subjects okay
 
05:36:26.458 --> 05:36:27.948 align:start position:0%
subjects okay
um

05:36:27.948 --> 05:36:27.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:36:31.490 --> 05:36:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:33.708 --> 05:36:33.718 align:start position:0%
we've all hoped that there's nothing so
 
05:36:34.910 --> 05:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
what I found was there was a disconnect
 
05:36:34.920 --> 05:36:36.410 align:start position:0%
what I found was there was a disconnect
between

05:36:36.410 --> 05:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
between
 
05:36:36.420 --> 05:36:39.948 align:start position:0%
between
hb61

05:36:39.948 --> 05:36:39.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:43.190 --> 05:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
um and the law it seeks to repeal in
 
05:36:44.868 --> 05:36:44.878 align:start position:0%
fact remember the question kept coming
 
05:36:46.550 --> 05:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
up with representative leckis introduced
 
05:36:48.590 --> 05:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
and then I echoed it was asked several
 
05:36:51.650 --> 05:36:51.660 align:start position:0%
times and nobody that I can recall had a
 
05:36:53.090 --> 05:36:53.100 align:start position:0%
satisfying answer
 
05:36:57.708 --> 05:36:57.718 align:start position:0%
as to what in not 193 40.
 
05:37:01.128 --> 05:37:01.138 align:start position:0%
prohibits the teaching of these subjects
 
05:37:03.788 --> 05:37:03.798 align:start position:0%
it in fact there was
 
05:37:07.190 --> 05:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
also a lot of talk about the vagueness
 
05:37:09.350 --> 05:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
of it
 
05:37:11.330 --> 05:37:11.340 align:start position:0%
I don't think so I think it's pretty cut
 
05:37:12.948 --> 05:37:12.958 align:start position:0%
and dry and if not
 
05:37:15.590 --> 05:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
you'll recall the department I have this
 
05:37:17.868 --> 05:37:17.878 align:start position:0%
in here I'm I could assume you all have
 
05:37:20.330 --> 05:37:20.340 align:start position:0%
it the frequently asked questions or
 
05:37:22.670 --> 05:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
maybe I copied it but on the DOA down
 
05:37:26.150 --> 05:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
the doe website it actually explains
 
05:37:26.160 --> 05:37:27.230 align:start position:0%
the doe website it actually explains
what

05:37:27.230 --> 05:37:27.240 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:37:29.750 --> 05:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
are you prohibited from teaching there's
 
05:37:32.208 --> 05:37:32.218 align:start position:0%
a question number three does the law
 
05:37:33.830 --> 05:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
prohibit teachers from teaching US
 
05:37:36.470 --> 05:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
history no nothing prohibits the
 
05:37:37.910 --> 05:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
teaching of historical subjects
 
05:37:39.650 --> 05:37:39.660 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to slavery
 
05:37:41.510 --> 05:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
treatment of Native American population
 
05:37:44.030 --> 05:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
Jim Crow laws segregation treatment of
 
05:37:46.128 --> 05:37:46.138 align:start position:0%
women goes on and on civil rights
 
05:37:48.410 --> 05:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
movement um black
 
05:37:50.930 --> 05:37:50.940 align:start position:0%
oh well then it goes on to even say it's
 
05:37:52.430 --> 05:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
not just historical subjects you can
 
05:37:54.530 --> 05:37:54.540 align:start position:0%
teach contemporary you can teach on
 
05:37:56.750 --> 05:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
these current event topics nor does
 
05:37:58.730 --> 05:37:58.740 align:start position:0%
anything prohibit discussions related to
 
05:38:00.590 --> 05:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
current events included but not limited
 
05:38:03.050 --> 05:38:03.060 align:start position:0%
to Black lives matter movement which is
 
05:38:05.448 --> 05:38:05.458 align:start position:0%
something very you know contemporary
 
05:38:05.458 --> 05:38:06.890 align:start position:0%
something very you know contemporary
um

05:38:06.890 --> 05:38:06.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:06.900 --> 05:38:08.208 align:start position:0%
um
so

05:38:08.208 --> 05:38:08.218 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:38:10.190 --> 05:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
you know it was a while ago we had that
 
05:38:11.930 --> 05:38:11.940 align:start position:0%
hearing just wanted to kind of remind
 
05:38:14.270 --> 05:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
you all get us out there
 
05:38:15.970 --> 05:38:15.980 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me that supporters of
 
05:38:19.610 --> 05:38:19.620 align:start position:0%
hb61 want to repeal
 
05:38:21.890 --> 05:38:21.900 align:start position:0%
RSA 19340 for a reason that doesn't
 
05:38:21.900 --> 05:38:23.930 align:start position:0%
RSA 19340 for a reason that doesn't
exist

05:38:23.930 --> 05:38:23.940 align:start position:0%
exist
 
05:38:26.510 --> 05:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
um and so that
 
05:38:29.570 --> 05:38:29.580 align:start position:0%
logically would make this inexpedient to
 
05:38:29.580 --> 05:38:31.550 align:start position:0%
logically would make this inexpedient to
legislate

05:38:31.550 --> 05:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
05:38:35.030 --> 05:38:35.040 align:start position:0%

further discussion president Belcher
 
05:39:51.770 --> 05:39:51.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and I would just
 
05:39:53.390 --> 05:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
briefly know that the the reason this
 
05:39:55.368 --> 05:39:55.378 align:start position:0%
law was brought in the first place
 
05:39:57.350 --> 05:39:57.360 align:start position:0%
is because there was a very real
 
05:40:00.470 --> 05:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
practice happening and it wasn't oh it
 
05:40:02.390 --> 05:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
wasn't Universal to all of these sorts
 
05:40:03.948 --> 05:40:03.958 align:start position:0%
of trainings but in some of these types
 
05:40:06.610 --> 05:40:06.620 align:start position:0%
of trainings they were devolving into
 
05:40:10.128 --> 05:40:10.138 align:start position:0%
deeply indoctrinational sessions of
 
05:40:10.138 --> 05:40:11.230 align:start position:0%
deeply indoctrinational sessions of
political

05:40:11.230 --> 05:40:11.240 align:start position:0%
political
 
05:40:14.270 --> 05:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
religious and ideological concerns that
 
05:40:15.890 --> 05:40:15.900 align:start position:0%
were being mandated on people on
 
05:40:18.530 --> 05:40:18.540 align:start position:0%
Children's Schools and employees
 
05:40:20.750 --> 05:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
in many cases these things mirrored
 
05:40:23.270 --> 05:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
maoist struggle sessions and it was
 
05:40:25.010 --> 05:40:25.020 align:start position:0%
completely inappropriate and that is
 
05:40:27.288 --> 05:40:27.298 align:start position:0%
what this has been to stop you can still
 
05:40:27.298 --> 05:40:28.190 align:start position:0%
what this has been to stop you can still
teach

05:40:28.190 --> 05:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
teach
 
05:40:31.310 --> 05:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
any of these things from a value-neutral
 
05:40:31.320 --> 05:40:33.350 align:start position:0%
any of these things from a value-neutral
position

05:40:33.350 --> 05:40:33.360 align:start position:0%
position
 
05:40:36.050 --> 05:40:36.060 align:start position:0%
you just can't make people feel bad
 
05:40:38.990 --> 05:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
because of the color of their skin or
 
05:40:40.490 --> 05:40:40.500 align:start position:0%
their race or gender or anything else
 
05:40:42.948 --> 05:40:42.958 align:start position:0%
that's what it does
 
05:40:45.590 --> 05:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent miler
 
05:40:47.750 --> 05:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair oh this all sounds
 
05:40:51.110 --> 05:40:51.120 align:start position:0%
really nice doesn't it nice and clean
 
05:40:54.470 --> 05:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
if you talk to a teacher recently
 
05:40:56.208 --> 05:40:56.218 align:start position:0%
you talked to a teacher recently about
 
05:40:56.218 --> 05:40:57.590 align:start position:0%
you talked to a teacher recently about
teaching

05:40:57.590 --> 05:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
teaching
 
05:41:00.708 --> 05:41:00.718 align:start position:0%
oh I can talk I can I can uh teach about
 
05:41:03.110 --> 05:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
slavery I can teach about this but we're
 
05:41:05.330 --> 05:41:05.340 align:start position:0%
forgetting one important thing here
 
05:41:07.490 --> 05:41:07.500 align:start position:0%
it's not what I teach
 
05:41:10.730 --> 05:41:10.740 align:start position:0%
but it's how I pr how I'm perceived when
 
05:41:11.990 --> 05:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
I'm teaching it
 
05:41:14.390 --> 05:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
so you've got a group of Liberty women
 
05:41:16.788 --> 05:41:16.798 align:start position:0%
out here that have a bonus of 500 for
 
05:41:18.650 --> 05:41:18.660 align:start position:0%
the first one that they take to the
 
05:41:20.868 --> 05:41:20.878 align:start position:0%
court you've got over in judiciary today
 
05:41:23.930 --> 05:41:23.940 align:start position:0%
talking about a uh subpoena power for
 
05:41:26.690 --> 05:41:26.700 align:start position:0%
the our good friend uh the commission of
 
05:41:28.310 --> 05:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
Education that can bring any teacher
 
05:41:30.050 --> 05:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
they want to once he gets a call from a
 
05:41:31.970 --> 05:41:31.980 align:start position:0%
from a parent
 
05:41:34.970 --> 05:41:34.980 align:start position:0%
just one parent we're not talking about
 
05:41:37.490 --> 05:41:37.500 align:start position:0%
a group of parents just one parent and
 
05:41:39.110 --> 05:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
he can subpoena a teacher if this thing
 
05:41:39.120 --> 05:41:40.730 align:start position:0%
he can subpoena a teacher if this thing
passes

05:41:40.730 --> 05:41:40.740 align:start position:0%
passes
 
05:41:44.208 --> 05:41:44.218 align:start position:0%
this is this has provided a cloak around
 
05:41:47.810 --> 05:41:47.820 align:start position:0%
teachers that is that is
 
05:41:47.820 --> 05:41:49.490 align:start position:0%
teachers that is that is
suffocating

05:41:49.490 --> 05:41:49.500 align:start position:0%
suffocating
 
05:41:52.070 --> 05:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
their ability to basically we talked
 
05:41:54.410 --> 05:41:54.420 align:start position:0%
about free speech to have some free
 
05:41:55.910 --> 05:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
teaching here
 
05:41:57.830 --> 05:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
and this is a very important issue
 
05:42:00.948 --> 05:42:00.958 align:start position:0%
because we've got a problem of uh I've
 
05:42:04.190 --> 05:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
asked myself this uh this often what I
 
05:42:06.170 --> 05:42:06.180 align:start position:0%
have one my would I recommend one of my
 
05:42:08.690 --> 05:42:08.700 align:start position:0%
kids to be a teacher today
 
05:42:11.090 --> 05:42:11.100 align:start position:0%
I can honestly say no
 
05:42:13.850 --> 05:42:13.860 align:start position:0%
because of pressure is like this
 
05:42:16.128 --> 05:42:16.138 align:start position:0%
the removal of this bill is very
 
05:42:18.410 --> 05:42:18.420 align:start position:0%
important to the education of our
 
05:42:20.990 --> 05:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
children notwithstanding what Mr Belcher
 
05:42:23.030 --> 05:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
said I mean if there was a teacher out
 
05:42:24.590 --> 05:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
there who was in it nobody wants to have
 
05:42:27.470 --> 05:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
a children indoctrinated I don't want
 
05:42:28.970 --> 05:42:28.980 align:start position:0%
that I don't want a teacher next to me
 
05:42:30.350 --> 05:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
doing that
 
05:42:32.150 --> 05:42:32.160 align:start position:0%
but that's a management question when
 
05:42:34.190 --> 05:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
that comes up you don't need a bill to
 
05:42:36.288 --> 05:42:36.298 align:start position:0%
deal with that
 
05:42:39.050 --> 05:42:39.060 align:start position:0%
this bill we have to remember how it was
 
05:42:39.060 --> 05:42:40.368 align:start position:0%
this bill we have to remember how it was
passed

05:42:40.368 --> 05:42:40.378 align:start position:0%
passed
 
05:42:43.010 --> 05:42:43.020 align:start position:0%
this bill was not before the house
 
05:42:48.430 --> 05:42:48.440 align:start position:0%
it came before a uh division uh hb2
 
05:42:50.510 --> 05:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
slicked in there
 
05:42:55.970 --> 05:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:58.550 --> 05:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
this just needs to be repealed you just
 
05:42:59.990 --> 05:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
don't understand the teachers I've
 
05:43:01.310 --> 05:43:01.320 align:start position:0%
talked with
 
05:43:03.050 --> 05:43:03.060 align:start position:0%
are fearful
 
05:43:04.788 --> 05:43:04.798 align:start position:0%
and the last thing I want to do is I
 
05:43:06.410 --> 05:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
have a teacher out there is that's
 
05:43:08.330 --> 05:43:08.340 align:start position:0%
fearful of whether teaching if they're
 
05:43:10.850 --> 05:43:10.860 align:start position:0%
acting out if they're misbehaving there
 
05:43:12.288 --> 05:43:12.298 align:start position:0%
are procedures to deal with that
 
05:43:14.510 --> 05:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
particular individual I go back to what
 
05:43:16.670 --> 05:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
the representative Woodcock said we
 
05:43:18.350 --> 05:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
don't need a hammer
 
05:43:23.150 --> 05:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:25.368 --> 05:43:25.378 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions or
 
05:43:28.788 --> 05:43:28.798 align:start position:0%
discussion Arlene yes so a parent can
 
05:43:30.948 --> 05:43:30.958 align:start position:0%
certainly accuse that's gonna you know
 
05:43:34.190 --> 05:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
they're a parent accused as a teacher
 
05:43:37.368 --> 05:43:37.378 align:start position:0%
or something related to this
 
05:43:39.650 --> 05:43:39.660 align:start position:0%
goes to
 
05:43:39.660 --> 05:43:41.690 align:start position:0%
goes to
Court

05:43:41.690 --> 05:43:41.700 align:start position:0%
Court
 
05:43:44.750 --> 05:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
what again it's the same question that
 
05:43:46.690 --> 05:43:46.700 align:start position:0%
keeps coming up
 
05:43:51.470 --> 05:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
193.40 page 530 what in this law
 
05:43:53.868 --> 05:43:53.878 align:start position:0%
is objectionable
 
05:43:55.730 --> 05:43:55.740 align:start position:0%
you talk about fear again you talk about
 
05:43:57.170 --> 05:43:57.180 align:start position:0%
teachers being afraid that's what we
 
05:43:58.730 --> 05:43:58.740 align:start position:0%
heard over and over again in the
 
05:44:01.548 --> 05:44:01.558 align:start position:0%
hearings there's a disconnect
 
05:44:03.530 --> 05:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
cite me some what in this law is
 
05:44:03.540 --> 05:44:06.310 align:start position:0%
cite me some what in this law is
objectionable

05:44:06.310 --> 05:44:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:10.010 --> 05:44:10.020 align:start position:0%

05:44:16.980 --> 05:44:18.110 align:start position:0%
that uh that question that was just put
down

05:44:18.110 --> 05:44:18.120 align:start position:0%

05:44:20.868 --> 05:44:20.878 align:start position:0%

05:44:35.030 --> 05:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
up to uh to tell us what a great idea
 
05:44:37.190 --> 05:44:37.200 align:start position:0%

people from all across the state who
 
05:45:11.448 --> 05:45:11.458 align:start position:0%
were offended by the limitations that
 
05:45:14.570 --> 05:45:14.580 align:start position:0%
are being imposed on on public school
 
05:45:17.690 --> 05:45:17.700 align:start position:0%
teachers by um by the the current state
 
05:45:19.368 --> 05:45:19.378 align:start position:0%
what was jammed into the current state
 
05:45:23.570 --> 05:45:23.580 align:start position:0%
budget but um but of the um of of all
 
05:45:28.730 --> 05:45:28.740 align:start position:0%

January 12th at our hearing reps fall
 
05:45:37.128 --> 05:45:37.138 align:start position:0%
there were a number that that really um
 
05:45:38.470 --> 05:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
really I think
 
05:45:42.830 --> 05:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
made strong Impressions but uh but one
 
05:45:45.470 --> 05:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
that really summed it up very well was
 
05:45:48.830 --> 05:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
uh Reverend Reverend Gail
 
05:45:53.930 --> 05:45:53.940 align:start position:0%
um Kenny of Kanan who's um with the um
 
05:45:58.128 --> 05:45:58.138 align:start position:0%
with the UCC and on the Justice uh board
 
05:46:00.170 --> 05:46:00.180 align:start position:0%
there and and she's a former School
 
05:46:03.048 --> 05:46:03.058 align:start position:0%
Board chair and uh and she said you know
 
05:46:05.750 --> 05:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill 544 which I think was the
 
05:46:08.208 --> 05:46:08.218 align:start position:0%
basis for um what was jammed into the
 
05:46:09.948 --> 05:46:09.958 align:start position:0%
the budget it's part of a national
 
05:46:12.530 --> 05:46:12.540 align:start position:0%
movement to stoke fear of public schools
 
05:46:14.868 --> 05:46:14.878 align:start position:0%
and it's not grounded in truth or fact
 
05:46:17.390 --> 05:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
and here's the part I highlighted and
 
05:46:21.230 --> 05:46:21.240 align:start position:0%
it's not the words in 544 but it's what
 
05:46:23.990 --> 05:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
it's doing it's what it's doing to
 
05:46:26.208 --> 05:46:26.218 align:start position:0%
public school teachers it's what it's
 
05:46:26.218 --> 05:46:27.590 align:start position:0%
public school teachers it's what it's
doing

05:46:27.590 --> 05:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
doing
 
05:46:31.010 --> 05:46:31.020 align:start position:0%
um to to create create a bounty as was
 
05:46:32.510 --> 05:46:32.520 align:start position:0%

teaching over a decade now but I still
 
05:47:26.330 --> 05:47:26.340 align:start position:0%
have some friends that are teaching and
 
05:47:28.430 --> 05:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
I know of two cases
 
05:47:31.190 --> 05:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
and that if I know of too there must be
 
05:47:34.548 --> 05:47:34.558 align:start position:0%
a lot more across the state one teacher
 
05:47:37.368 --> 05:47:37.378 align:start position:0%
was a teacher of AP History course
 
05:47:40.128 --> 05:47:40.138 align:start position:0%
who in the last week of her
 
05:47:42.830 --> 05:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
AP History course before they were going
 
05:47:44.690 --> 05:47:44.700 align:start position:0%
for their exam
 
05:47:46.490 --> 05:47:46.500 align:start position:0%
a parent made a complaint to the
 
05:47:48.650 --> 05:47:48.660 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to our
 
05:47:52.270 --> 05:47:52.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner who then immediately
 
05:47:55.430 --> 05:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
initiated an investigation which took
 
05:47:57.170 --> 05:47:57.180 align:start position:0%
her out of that classroom she was no
 
05:48:00.048 --> 05:48:00.058 align:start position:0%
longer allowed to teach that AP class or
 
05:48:03.490 --> 05:48:03.500 align:start position:0%
prepare them for their AP History exam
 
05:48:06.350 --> 05:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
went on for two weeks the the
 
05:48:09.708 --> 05:48:09.718 align:start position:0%
documentation that was required
 
05:48:12.288 --> 05:48:12.298 align:start position:0%
um she was totally exonerated from it
 
05:48:14.390 --> 05:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
I had another situation
 
05:48:16.788 --> 05:48:16.798 align:start position:0%
where I attended a school board meeting
 
05:48:18.470 --> 05:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
and talked to the assistant
 
05:48:21.350 --> 05:48:21.360 align:start position:0%
superintendent who just spent again
 
05:48:23.030 --> 05:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
another two weeks
 
05:48:25.548 --> 05:48:25.558 align:start position:0%
taking a teacher out of a classroom
 
05:48:28.430 --> 05:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
was uh in Junior High
 
05:48:31.570 --> 05:48:31.580 align:start position:0%

05:48:34.680 --> 05:48:36.170 align:start position:0%
investigation complaint was totally
exonerated

05:48:36.170 --> 05:48:36.180 align:start position:0%
exonerated
 
05:48:38.270 --> 05:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
what happens to the other teachers that
 
05:48:39.890 --> 05:48:39.900 align:start position:0%
are teaching in that building
 
05:48:42.048 --> 05:48:42.058 align:start position:0%
that sees that happening and that's part
 
05:48:44.930 --> 05:48:44.940 align:start position:0%
of the that's part of the plan is to
 
05:48:47.530 --> 05:48:47.540 align:start position:0%
intimidate to say that teachers
 
05:48:51.650 --> 05:48:51.660 align:start position:0%
inculcate to say that teachers
 
05:48:55.430 --> 05:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
um compel to express a belief in compel
 
05:48:58.850 --> 05:48:58.860 align:start position:0%
students to express a belief in to say
 
05:49:02.270 --> 05:49:02.280 align:start position:0%
we indoctrinate kids I we had a guy here
 
05:49:05.810 --> 05:49:05.820 align:start position:0%
who was teacher I believe in Concord or
 
05:49:11.230 --> 05:49:11.240 align:start position:0%
or John Stark who said if only if only
 
05:49:15.170 --> 05:49:15.180 align:start position:0%
you had that much influence over kids
 
05:49:17.930 --> 05:49:17.940 align:start position:0%
you can't get them to do things you
 
05:49:20.390 --> 05:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
can't get them to you know it takes a
 
05:49:22.910 --> 05:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
lot of activity and a lot of
 
05:49:22.920 --> 05:49:24.730 align:start position:0%
lot of activity and a lot of
um

05:49:24.730 --> 05:49:24.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:28.850 --> 05:49:28.860 align:start position:0%
you know professional art to try and
 
05:49:32.150 --> 05:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
teach kids and have them to totally
 
05:49:35.510 --> 05:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
understand different situations and and
 
05:49:38.448 --> 05:49:38.458 align:start position:0%
you use different methods to do that and
 
05:49:42.470 --> 05:49:42.480 align:start position:0%
there are kids and there are parents who
 
05:49:45.770 --> 05:49:45.780 align:start position:0%
um are going to have different views on
 
05:49:48.170 --> 05:49:48.180 align:start position:0%
how things are happening they you might
 
05:49:51.230 --> 05:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
have a class of 30 and you might have
 
05:49:53.750 --> 05:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
one or two kids in that class that don't
 
05:49:55.670 --> 05:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
understand things and so you're you're
 
05:49:58.850 --> 05:49:58.860 align:start position:0%
trying to work with them separately and
 
05:50:01.010 --> 05:50:01.020 align:start position:0%
sometimes I mean I've met I've met
 
05:50:04.670 --> 05:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
students that I taught 30 years ago that
 
05:50:07.788 --> 05:50:07.798 align:start position:0%
remember things that happened in class
 
05:50:10.730 --> 05:50:10.740 align:start position:0%
that were really key to to what to
 
05:50:13.250 --> 05:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
change their thinking or whatever
 
05:50:13.260 --> 05:50:14.150 align:start position:0%
change their thinking or whatever
um

05:50:14.150 --> 05:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:50:16.610 --> 05:50:16.620 align:start position:0%
that I had no idea
 
05:50:19.070 --> 05:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
no idea that I'd even made that
 
05:50:20.868 --> 05:50:20.878 align:start position:0%
difference and it was positive
 
05:50:22.490 --> 05:50:22.500 align:start position:0%
difference I mean it was a it was a
 
05:50:25.128 --> 05:50:25.138 align:start position:0%
young man who was in the service went
 
05:50:26.510 --> 05:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
into the service right out of high
 
05:50:28.610 --> 05:50:28.620 align:start position:0%
school he came from a family that didn't
 
05:50:31.250 --> 05:50:31.260 align:start position:0%
have much money and he was a pretty
 
05:50:34.610 --> 05:50:34.620 align:start position:0%
bright kid and went into the service and
 
05:50:36.310 --> 05:50:36.320 align:start position:0%
said he would have never made it through
 
05:50:38.990 --> 05:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
uh basic training had it not been from
 
05:50:41.810 --> 05:50:41.820 align:start position:0%
for the media for the exercises we did
 
05:50:44.510 --> 05:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
in health class on Stress Management
 
05:50:47.750 --> 05:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
and I know that that that uh I had no
 
05:50:47.760 --> 05:50:49.010 align:start position:0%
and I know that that that uh I had no
idea

05:50:49.010 --> 05:50:49.020 align:start position:0%
idea
 
05:50:49.020 --> 05:50:50.448 align:start position:0%
idea
so

05:50:50.448 --> 05:50:50.458 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:50:53.690 --> 05:50:53.700 align:start position:0%
um the whole purpose of this of of this
 
05:50:56.090 --> 05:50:56.100 align:start position:0%
whole thing and you heard it when they
 
05:50:58.910 --> 05:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
talked about 61 is that it's the
 
05:51:01.128 --> 05:51:01.138 align:start position:0%
vagueness of this law and the way it's
 
05:51:03.708 --> 05:51:03.718 align:start position:0%
set up to say no pupil in any public
 
05:51:05.390 --> 05:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
school in the state shall be taught
 
05:51:09.110 --> 05:51:09.120 align:start position:0%
instructed inculcated or compelled which
 
05:51:11.690 --> 05:51:11.700 align:start position:0%
indicates to me that they think that
 
05:51:14.030 --> 05:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
this law is set up because teachers do
 
05:51:14.040 --> 05:51:14.750 align:start position:0%
this law is set up because teachers do
that

05:51:14.750 --> 05:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:51:17.990 --> 05:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
and I saw somebody holding a sign out
 
05:51:20.930 --> 05:51:20.940 align:start position:0%
today trust teachers and teachers and
 
05:51:24.350 --> 05:51:24.360 align:start position:0%
nurses used to be at the top of the
 
05:51:27.170 --> 05:51:27.180 align:start position:0%
trust list and if you ask probably
 
05:51:29.868 --> 05:51:29.878 align:start position:0%
anybody now teaching they feel at the
 
05:51:31.070 --> 05:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
bottom of the list and the reason
 
05:51:32.690 --> 05:51:32.700 align:start position:0%
they're at the bottom of the list is not
 
05:51:35.208 --> 05:51:35.218 align:start position:0%
because they've changed it's because of
 
05:51:38.330 --> 05:51:38.340 align:start position:0%
the war on public education and the war
 
05:51:40.850 --> 05:51:40.860 align:start position:0%
on public education teachers and this
 
05:51:44.270 --> 05:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
bill is like the key to it and that's
 
05:51:47.150 --> 05:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
why people took time off work we don't
 
05:51:50.208 --> 05:51:50.218 align:start position:0%
often see teachers in this in this
 
05:51:53.510 --> 05:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
committee we don't often see students
 
05:51:56.208 --> 05:51:56.218 align:start position:0%
from public school because they're at
 
05:51:59.270 --> 05:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
school and they're working okay
 
05:52:02.208 --> 05:52:02.218 align:start position:0%
that's why we don't see them people took
 
05:52:05.448 --> 05:52:05.458 align:start position:0%
time off from work value you know they
 
05:52:07.730 --> 05:52:07.740 align:start position:0%
only get a limited number of days and
 
05:52:10.730 --> 05:52:10.740 align:start position:0%
they took time off of work to come and
 
05:52:14.330 --> 05:52:14.340 align:start position:0%
talk and say how bad this bill was
 
05:52:16.548 --> 05:52:16.558 align:start position:0%
and so if you don't think this bill is
 
05:52:19.430 --> 05:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
has had an effect on the teaching
 
05:52:21.708 --> 05:52:21.718 align:start position:0%
um profession in New Hampshire you're
 
05:52:21.718 --> 05:52:24.530 align:start position:0%
um profession in New Hampshire you're
crazy

05:52:24.530 --> 05:52:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:28.368 --> 05:52:28.378 align:start position:0%
further questions from represented dry
 
05:52:30.490 --> 05:52:30.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:52:36.110 --> 05:52:36.120 align:start position:0%
I got an email from a neighbor who
 
05:52:37.548 --> 05:52:37.558 align:start position:0%
is on the other side of the political
 
05:52:41.330 --> 05:52:41.340 align:start position:0%
fence from me but uh asked Where I Stood
 
05:52:42.470 --> 05:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
05:52:44.030 --> 05:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
and it was not too long after the
 
05:52:44.040 --> 05:52:45.070 align:start position:0%
and it was not too long after the
hearing

05:52:45.070 --> 05:52:45.080 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
05:52:47.810 --> 05:52:47.820 align:start position:0%
it was preface it by saying that they
 
05:52:50.270 --> 05:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
respected my integrity
 
05:52:52.788 --> 05:52:52.798 align:start position:0%
and that really made me want to
 
05:52:54.890 --> 05:52:54.900 align:start position:0%
investigate this very carefully because
 
05:52:56.448 --> 05:52:56.458 align:start position:0%
I really did want to do this with a
 
05:52:58.190 --> 05:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
matter of integrity
 
05:53:01.430 --> 05:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh I sat through the long hearing with
 
05:53:03.830 --> 05:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
all the rest of you and we got this
 
05:53:06.410 --> 05:53:06.420 align:start position:0%
last bunch of papers from director
 
05:53:08.330 --> 05:53:08.340 align:start position:0%
Malachi from the Human Rights Commission
 
05:53:10.250 --> 05:53:10.260 align:start position:0%
and so I didn't have a chance to go
 
05:53:13.368 --> 05:53:13.378 align:start position:0%
through it uh until the hearing was over
 
05:53:15.590 --> 05:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
right so I asked myself a couple of
 
05:53:17.990 --> 05:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
questions I I too saw the disconnect
 
05:53:19.670 --> 05:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
between the the people who were
 
05:53:22.250 --> 05:53:22.260 align:start position:0%
testifying uh of the fear that they had
 
05:53:23.570 --> 05:53:23.580 align:start position:0%
in the classroom
 
05:53:27.650 --> 05:53:27.660 align:start position:0%
and but a lot of them I just couldn't in
 
05:53:29.330 --> 05:53:29.340 align:start position:0%
some ways when they got up to speak I
 
05:53:30.650 --> 05:53:30.660 align:start position:0%
didn't know whether they were in favor
 
05:53:33.350 --> 05:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
of the repeal or or not
 
05:53:35.510 --> 05:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
um but they were just expressing
 
05:53:40.368 --> 05:53:40.378 align:start position:0%
their experiences uh so I had no idea at
 
05:53:42.948 --> 05:53:42.958 align:start position:0%
that point what teachers or anybody else
 
05:53:44.510 --> 05:53:44.520 align:start position:0%
had been given
 
05:53:46.368 --> 05:53:46.378 align:start position:0%
for instruction
 
05:53:48.230 --> 05:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
with this law
 
05:53:51.650 --> 05:53:51.660 align:start position:0%
and so I've finally got to look at this
 
05:53:54.230 --> 05:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
large section here with the section from
 
05:53:58.548 --> 05:53:58.558 align:start position:0%
uh attorney formilla and the long page
 
05:54:01.128 --> 05:54:01.138 align:start position:0%
page after page because it sounded like
 
05:54:03.170 --> 05:54:03.180 align:start position:0%
there was nothing from the Department of
 
05:54:06.350 --> 05:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
Ed at all I read this which has a long
 
05:54:08.990 --> 05:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
section of instruction I went to the doe
 
05:54:11.208 --> 05:54:11.218 align:start position:0%
website and saw this frequently asked
 
05:54:14.090 --> 05:54:14.100 align:start position:0%
questions so
 
05:54:17.390 --> 05:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
I don't know what else they could say
 
05:54:20.868 --> 05:54:20.878 align:start position:0%
it's right there in black and white
 
05:54:23.868 --> 05:54:23.878 align:start position:0%
that was a question for me is
 
05:54:25.368 --> 05:54:25.378 align:start position:0%
um they complained that there was no
 
05:54:26.868 --> 05:54:26.878 align:start position:0%
instruction I'm looking at the
 
05:54:30.048 --> 05:54:30.058 align:start position:0%
instruction about it so if you yeah
 
05:54:32.628 --> 05:54:32.638 align:start position:0%
maybe they need to explain it better I
 
05:54:35.090 --> 05:54:35.100 align:start position:0%
don't know but I don't know why
 
05:54:37.330 --> 05:54:37.340 align:start position:0%
you can't read what's in black and white
 
05:54:39.830 --> 05:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
so I asked this the next question is
 
05:54:42.350 --> 05:54:42.360 align:start position:0%
okay so is everybody being then taken
 
05:54:44.270 --> 05:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
into the before the commission on human
 
05:54:46.910 --> 05:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
rights and I went up to the director at
 
05:54:48.650 --> 05:54:48.660 align:start position:0%
least I asked her right after the the
 
05:54:51.890 --> 05:54:51.900 align:start position:0%
Committee hearing and I said what you
 
05:54:51.900 --> 05:54:52.670 align:start position:0%
Committee hearing and I said what you
know

05:54:52.670 --> 05:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:54:54.770 --> 05:54:54.780 align:start position:0%
how many how many cases do you have what
 
05:54:57.170 --> 05:54:57.180 align:start position:0%
do you got and if she can't tell me the
 
05:55:00.470 --> 05:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
number but there are some but it didn't
 
05:55:03.170 --> 05:55:03.180 align:start position:0%
get me the impression that they were
 
05:55:04.910 --> 05:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
going to be lined up their docket was
 
05:55:07.310 --> 05:55:07.320 align:start position:0%
full for the next four years it was just
 
05:55:09.470 --> 05:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
there are some so I asked the next
 
05:55:12.230 --> 05:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
obvious question I said how many make it
 
05:55:15.770 --> 05:55:15.780 align:start position:0%
past that first step like a complaint
 
05:55:18.410 --> 05:55:18.420 align:start position:0%
and she said we have an active case
 
05:55:21.410 --> 05:55:21.420 align:start position:0%
right now that's been gone past the
 
05:55:24.530 --> 05:55:24.540 align:start position:0%
prima facie evidence stage and they said
 
05:55:27.170 --> 05:55:27.180 align:start position:0%
okay so it's not like it's not there
 
05:55:30.170 --> 05:55:30.180 align:start position:0%
there's evidence that it disappears but
 
05:55:33.230 --> 05:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
it doesn't to me seem like it is the
 
05:55:36.410 --> 05:55:36.420 align:start position:0%
overwhelming problem that I was given to
 
05:55:39.590 --> 05:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
leave or that was feared you know in the
 
05:55:41.510 --> 05:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
conversation that we had with the public
 
05:55:45.470 --> 05:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
in the hearing and I have not yet been
 
05:55:47.868 --> 05:55:47.878 align:start position:0%
satisfied that there's not been any
 
05:55:50.270 --> 05:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
instruction from the Department of Ed or
 
05:55:52.128 --> 05:55:52.138 align:start position:0%
the commission on human rights on either
 
05:55:55.570 --> 05:55:55.580 align:start position:0%
how the Prof process works or what's
 
05:55:58.910 --> 05:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
available you know what is permitted to
 
05:56:01.010 --> 05:56:01.020 align:start position:0%
teach and where do you draw the line I
 
05:56:03.350 --> 05:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
think it's here I don't know how to
 
05:56:06.048 --> 05:56:06.058 align:start position:0%
connect the two sides
 
05:56:08.628 --> 05:56:08.638 align:start position:0%
but I I have asked myself every question
 
05:56:10.850 --> 05:56:10.860 align:start position:0%
that I thought of to ask and I have
 
05:56:14.330 --> 05:56:14.340 align:start position:0%
Satisfied by myself that
 
05:56:17.510 --> 05:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
there are answers to those questions so
 
05:56:19.850 --> 05:56:19.860 align:start position:0%
I'm coming down the fact that I don't
 
05:56:22.730 --> 05:56:22.740 align:start position:0%
think we need to repeal this
 
05:56:25.310 --> 05:56:25.320 align:start position:0%
maybe we need to work on
 
05:56:27.770 --> 05:56:27.780 align:start position:0%
how to address the fears of people that
 
05:56:30.230 --> 05:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
are in the classroom
 
05:56:33.048 --> 05:56:33.058 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
05:56:33.058 --> 05:56:35.570 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
Belcher

05:56:35.570 --> 05:56:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:38.708 --> 05:56:38.718 align:start position:0%
I've been puzzling over this ever since
 
05:56:43.310 --> 05:56:43.320 align:start position:0%
the first repeal was made last year
 
05:56:45.170 --> 05:56:45.180 align:start position:0%
I actually
 
05:56:47.868 --> 05:56:47.878 align:start position:0%
um a teacher that had come up and
 
05:56:49.610 --> 05:56:49.620 align:start position:0%
everybody loved and said I wished you
 
05:56:52.310 --> 05:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
were my teacher I had just handwritten
 
05:56:56.208 --> 05:56:56.218 align:start position:0%
out what the law said and presented it
 
05:57:00.048 --> 05:57:00.058 align:start position:0%
to him as a just the words and I said so
 
05:57:02.030 --> 05:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
if I put in this law what would you
 
05:57:04.010 --> 05:57:04.020 align:start position:0%
think of it and he took it and he said
 
05:57:07.610 --> 05:57:07.620 align:start position:0%
oh this is excellent this is very good I
 
05:57:09.410 --> 05:57:09.420 align:start position:0%
said that's the lie you're asking to
 
05:57:12.110 --> 05:57:12.120 align:start position:0%
repeal really
 
05:57:15.048 --> 05:57:15.058 align:start position:0%
and and he didn't find any problem with
 
05:57:17.150 --> 05:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
the words I know the teachers are all
 
05:57:19.430 --> 05:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
feeling this that's why last year I kept
 
05:57:22.190 --> 05:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
asking if there's no problem with what's
 
05:57:25.970 --> 05:57:25.980 align:start position:0%
in the law where is the problem and
 
05:57:28.490 --> 05:57:28.500 align:start position:0%
finally most people oh well I don't know
 
05:57:30.048 --> 05:57:30.058 align:start position:0%
nobody could give me an answer until
 
05:57:32.690 --> 05:57:32.700 align:start position:0%
finally one man said there is nothing
 
05:57:34.910 --> 05:57:34.920 align:start position:0%
wrong with the law there's nothing wrong
 
05:57:37.610 --> 05:57:37.620 align:start position:0%
with the words in the law the problem is
 
05:57:40.190 --> 05:57:40.200 align:start position:0%
all the information that's going on out
 
05:57:40.200 --> 05:57:41.030 align:start position:0%
all the information that's going on out
there

05:57:41.030 --> 05:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
there
 
05:57:41.040 --> 05:57:43.850 align:start position:0%
there
and

05:57:43.850 --> 05:57:43.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:46.250 --> 05:57:46.260 align:start position:0%
and the information that's going on out
 
05:57:47.930 --> 05:57:47.940 align:start position:0%
there that's a problem isn't what the
 
05:57:51.350 --> 05:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
doe put out and it isn't what the
 
05:57:53.868 --> 05:57:53.878 align:start position:0%
commission for human rights put out so
 
05:57:57.890 --> 05:57:57.900 align:start position:0%
the question is who is causing all these
 
05:58:01.490 --> 05:58:01.500 align:start position:0%
teachers to be afraid who is it's not
 
05:58:04.548 --> 05:58:04.558 align:start position:0%
the law so we're going to repeal a law
 
05:58:07.010 --> 05:58:07.020 align:start position:0%
because there's all this misinformation
 
05:58:09.350 --> 05:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
out there if I would a wonderful
 
05:58:12.350 --> 05:58:12.360 align:start position:0%
precedent to set if I'm a criminal and I
 
05:58:14.270 --> 05:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
don't like Allah or if I think a law
 
05:58:16.610 --> 05:58:16.620 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be on the books I just have to
 
05:58:17.448 --> 05:58:17.458 align:start position:0%
spread all the information
 
05:58:20.030 --> 05:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
misinformation I want and then we have
 
05:58:22.010 --> 05:58:22.020 align:start position:0%
to repeal it because everybody's afraid
 
05:58:23.868 --> 05:58:23.878 align:start position:0%
they're going to break it but the other
 
05:58:26.270 --> 05:58:26.280 align:start position:0%
part of that was your example of two
 
05:58:26.280 --> 05:58:27.890 align:start position:0%
part of that was your example of two
teachers

05:58:27.890 --> 05:58:27.900 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
05:58:31.070 --> 05:58:31.080 align:start position:0%
who were taken for two weeks and and
 
05:58:33.048 --> 05:58:33.058 align:start position:0%
checked to see you know because somebody
 
05:58:34.788 --> 05:58:34.798 align:start position:0%
complained and they were checked and
 
05:58:37.090 --> 05:58:37.100 align:start position:0%
they were exonerated this happens
 
05:58:40.548 --> 05:58:40.558 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to do just with this it can
 
05:58:42.470 --> 05:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
have to do whatever complaint a parent
 
05:58:44.750 --> 05:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
has I've seen it with our principal
 
05:58:48.708 --> 05:58:48.718 align:start position:0%
recently he at a student assembly he did
 
05:58:52.548 --> 05:58:52.558 align:start position:0%
nothing wrong but somebody complained he
 
05:58:55.730 --> 05:58:55.740 align:start position:0%
was he was not principal you know then
 
05:58:58.010 --> 05:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
this is near this is near the start of
 
05:58:58.970 --> 05:58:58.980 align:start position:0%
the year
 
05:59:01.490 --> 05:59:01.500 align:start position:0%
he was suspended by the superintendent
 
05:59:04.070 --> 05:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
until things could be checked on it had
 
05:59:05.510 --> 05:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with this it was
 
05:59:08.690 --> 05:59:08.700 align:start position:0%
completely different it happens that's
 
05:59:11.690 --> 05:59:11.700 align:start position:0%
what you do when somebody complains but
 
05:59:14.570 --> 05:59:14.580 align:start position:0%
again this year I was listening very
 
05:59:16.430 --> 05:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
clearly what are the teachers saying
 
05:59:18.410 --> 05:59:18.420 align:start position:0%
they're afraid they're afraid they're
 
05:59:20.150 --> 05:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
afraid of losing their job they're
 
05:59:22.548 --> 05:59:22.558 align:start position:0%
afraid that if somebody
 
05:59:25.208 --> 05:59:25.218 align:start position:0%
says they made me feel uncomfortable
 
05:59:28.250 --> 05:59:28.260 align:start position:0%
I'll lose my job and I'm like where is
 
05:59:31.010 --> 05:59:31.020 align:start position:0%
this coming from the
 
05:59:33.110 --> 05:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
it's not in the law that they're going
 
05:59:34.970 --> 05:59:34.980 align:start position:0%
to lose their job because somebody made
 
05:59:38.150 --> 05:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
them feel uncomfortable if what's in the
 
05:59:40.368 --> 05:59:40.378 align:start position:0%
law is they go before
 
05:59:42.410 --> 05:59:42.420 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire commission for human
 
05:59:44.990 --> 05:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
rights the United they figure out
 
05:59:48.470 --> 05:59:48.480 align:start position:0%
whether or not which for the most case
 
05:59:51.530 --> 05:59:51.540 align:start position:0%
the people the few that have come
 
05:59:54.410 --> 05:59:54.420 align:start position:0%
have have not even continued on from
 
05:59:56.628 --> 05:59:56.638 align:start position:0%
that they don't go before the doe and
 
05:59:59.690 --> 05:59:59.700 align:start position:0%
unless the commission for human rights
 
06:00:02.510 --> 06:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
finds issues I talked to that lady
 
06:00:05.390 --> 06:00:05.400 align:start position:0%
afterwards I ask her specifically what
 
06:00:08.448 --> 06:00:08.458 align:start position:0%
the process was because some teacher
 
06:00:11.170 --> 06:00:11.180 align:start position:0%
told me no they go before the doe first
 
06:00:14.930 --> 06:00:14.940 align:start position:0%
I went to the commission and she said no
 
06:00:17.570 --> 06:00:17.580 align:start position:0%
they do not they do not until the
 
06:00:20.868 --> 06:00:20.878 align:start position:0%
commission has figured out whether or
 
06:00:24.948 --> 06:00:24.958 align:start position:0%
not there is reasonable cause or I'm not
 
06:00:28.610 --> 06:00:28.620 align:start position:0%
sure I got the right words but then they
 
06:00:31.730 --> 06:00:31.740 align:start position:0%
would go into further and so most have
 
06:00:34.190 --> 06:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
not as she said there was one that was
 
06:00:34.200 --> 06:00:35.390 align:start position:0%
not as she said there was one that was
pending

06:00:35.390 --> 06:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
pending
 
06:00:38.030 --> 06:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
so I was asking myself where is all this
 
06:00:40.430 --> 06:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
fear coming from what goes on at our
 
06:00:40.440 --> 06:00:41.690 align:start position:0%
fear coming from what goes on at our
colleges

06:00:41.690 --> 06:00:41.700 align:start position:0%
colleges
 
06:00:43.850 --> 06:00:43.860 align:start position:0%
what just happened at one of our
 
06:00:47.270 --> 06:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
colleges some student felt uncomfortable
 
06:00:50.270 --> 06:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
because of what a conservative Professor
 
06:00:52.010 --> 06:00:52.020 align:start position:0%
had said
 
06:00:55.190 --> 06:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
and the professor was immediately fired
 
06:00:57.650 --> 06:00:57.660 align:start position:0%
and even the head of his Department said
 
06:01:00.470 --> 06:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
there was nothing wrong with what he
 
06:01:25.448 --> 06:01:25.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:27.708 --> 06:01:27.718 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
06:01:31.190 --> 06:01:31.200 align:start position:0%
Allison Bob I as a former social studies
 
06:01:33.590 --> 06:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
teacher I I would just
 
06:01:35.510 --> 06:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
and for those of you who don't think
 
06:01:37.490 --> 06:01:37.500 align:start position:0%
there's been an impact on instruction in
 
06:01:40.970 --> 06:01:40.980 align:start position:0%
the state I would say bring 50 randomly
 
06:01:42.890 --> 06:01:42.900 align:start position:0%
selected social studies teachers from
 
06:01:44.390 --> 06:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
high schools in the state and come in
 
06:01:47.208 --> 06:01:47.218 align:start position:0%
here and ask them a question do you
 
06:01:49.250 --> 06:01:49.260 align:start position:0%
asked the question whether or not they
 
06:01:50.690 --> 06:01:50.700 align:start position:0%
have changed what they're doing in the
 
06:01:54.650 --> 06:01:54.660 align:start position:0%
classroom and you won't like the answer
 
06:01:57.288 --> 06:01:57.298 align:start position:0%
president or represent Damon you had
 
06:01:59.090 --> 06:01:59.100 align:start position:0%
your hand up to
 
06:02:01.970 --> 06:02:01.980 align:start position:0%
I don't know thank you Mr chair
 
06:02:05.270 --> 06:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
so my dad who's 93 years old and still
 
06:02:09.110 --> 06:02:09.120 align:start position:0%
intact of Mind although frail
 
06:02:13.010 --> 06:02:13.020 align:start position:0%
is retired social studies teacher
 
06:02:15.590 --> 06:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
and I am here partly because he taught
 
06:02:19.850 --> 06:02:19.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:22.788 --> 06:02:22.798 align:start position:0%
I'm here partly because he taught how to
 
06:02:24.948 --> 06:02:24.958 align:start position:0%
be a critical thinker
 
06:02:27.470 --> 06:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
how to take information from different
 
06:02:28.970 --> 06:02:28.980 align:start position:0%
points of view
 
06:02:31.128 --> 06:02:31.138 align:start position:0%
I had him as a teacher when I was a
 
06:02:32.930 --> 06:02:32.940 align:start position:0%
seventh grader I don't think that
 
06:02:35.090 --> 06:02:35.100 align:start position:0%
happens these days but
 
06:02:37.070 --> 06:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
three out of my four siblings and I had
 
06:02:41.990 --> 06:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:45.288 --> 06:02:45.298 align:start position:0%
he would bring for example articles from
 
06:02:47.390 --> 06:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
the Christian Science monitor this was
 
06:02:51.230 --> 06:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:52.850 --> 06:02:52.860 align:start position:0%
and bring
 
06:02:55.190 --> 06:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
all sorts of resources from all
 
06:02:56.990 --> 06:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
different points of view for us to read
 
06:03:01.430 --> 06:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:03.948 --> 06:03:03.958 align:start position:0%
an I've had conversations with him quite
 
06:03:05.510 --> 06:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
a few this winter
 
06:03:07.368 --> 06:03:07.378 align:start position:0%
about this bill
 
06:03:10.430 --> 06:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
and said could you teach the way you
 
06:03:12.110 --> 06:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
used to teach
 
06:03:15.048 --> 06:03:15.058 align:start position:0%
comfortably and feeling safe with your
 
06:03:18.288 --> 06:03:18.298 align:start position:0%
ear teaching credentials and he said and
 
06:03:20.510 --> 06:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
my dad was a really committed teacher
 
06:03:23.030 --> 06:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
and then served on his school board for
 
06:03:25.070 --> 06:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
20 years after he retired
 
06:03:28.250 --> 06:03:28.260 align:start position:0%
education is at his heart and soul
 
06:03:30.288 --> 06:03:30.298 align:start position:0%
and he said I wouldn't have still been a
 
06:03:32.510 --> 06:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
teacher that's what our teachers are
 
06:03:36.230 --> 06:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
facing today we need to repeal this law
 
06:03:38.110 --> 06:03:38.120 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell
 
06:03:41.810 --> 06:03:41.820 align:start position:0%
just to maybe wipe um teachers or find

what came out following the state's
 
06:03:45.830 --> 06:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
establishment of a website to report
 
06:03:48.048 --> 06:03:48.058 align:start position:0%
violations of a new anti-divisive
 
06:03:50.390 --> 06:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
subject law the New Hampshire chapter of
 
06:03:52.730 --> 06:03:52.740 align:start position:0%
moms for Liberty tweeted that it would
 
06:03:55.250 --> 06:03:55.260 align:start position:0%
pay 500 to the first person to
 
06:03:57.708 --> 06:03:57.718 align:start position:0%
successfully catch a teacher breaking
 
06:04:00.410 --> 06:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
the new law
 
06:04:00.420 --> 06:04:02.990 align:start position:0%
the new law
and

06:04:02.990 --> 06:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:06.170 --> 06:04:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:09.230 --> 06:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
well that's just they did put out a
 
06:04:11.510 --> 06:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
bounty on teachers if you could catch
 
06:04:14.510 --> 06:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
them and report them on the state's
 
06:04:16.610 --> 06:04:16.620 align:start position:0%
website they'd give you five hundred
 
06:04:18.288 --> 06:04:18.298 align:start position:0%
dollars so I think that would add
 
06:04:20.090 --> 06:04:20.100 align:start position:0%
something to teachers being afraid of
 
06:04:21.530 --> 06:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
what they're teaching in class because
 
06:04:23.750 --> 06:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
there's bounties on them
 
06:04:23.760 --> 06:04:25.610 align:start position:0%
there's bounties on them
representative

06:04:25.610 --> 06:04:25.620 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:04:28.490 --> 06:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
thank you first of all I feel really
 
06:04:31.070 --> 06:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
badly that teachers feel that way and I
 
06:04:33.770 --> 06:04:33.780 align:start position:0%
am acutely aware that there are multiple
 
06:04:35.690 --> 06:04:35.700 align:start position:0%
of professions that feel like they are
 
06:04:38.330 --> 06:04:38.340 align:start position:0%
under profoundly intense scrutiny these
 
06:04:40.190 --> 06:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
days so it's certainly not just teachers
 
06:04:43.128 --> 06:04:43.138 align:start position:0%
who are experiencing that but I've had
 
06:04:45.830 --> 06:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
I've been really thinking long and hard
 
06:04:47.990 --> 06:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
I had a conversation when I was um
 
06:04:48.000 --> 06:04:49.548 align:start position:0%
I had a conversation when I was um
canvassing

06:04:49.548 --> 06:04:49.558 align:start position:0%
canvassing
 
06:04:52.430 --> 06:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
I had somebody ask me how I felt about a
 
06:04:55.010 --> 06:04:55.020 align:start position:0%
certain class of people and I literally
 
06:04:58.128 --> 06:04:58.138 align:start position:0%
answered him I said it's really sad that
 
06:05:00.830 --> 06:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
we have to enumerate certain groups of
 
06:05:03.948 --> 06:05:03.958 align:start position:0%
people in our constitution because if we
 
06:05:06.830 --> 06:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
all treated each and every person like a
 
06:05:09.350 --> 06:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
human being we wouldn't be looking at
 
06:05:11.750 --> 06:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
them as groups of people
 
06:05:15.430 --> 06:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
so and was trying to summarize
 
06:05:18.230 --> 06:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
193.40 and thank you representative dry
 
06:05:20.448 --> 06:05:20.458 align:start position:0%
for reminding me about the frequently
 
06:05:23.390 --> 06:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
asked questions page on the doe website
 
06:05:25.128 --> 06:05:25.138 align:start position:0%
which was made in conjunction with the
 
06:05:26.510 --> 06:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
commission for human rights and
 
06:05:28.128 --> 06:05:28.138 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice
 
06:05:30.288 --> 06:05:30.298 align:start position:0%
and they have a little text box that
 
06:05:33.708 --> 06:05:33.718 align:start position:0%
says in short do not teach that a person
 
06:05:35.990 --> 06:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
or a group is inherently oppressive
 
06:05:39.288 --> 06:05:39.298 align:start position:0%
Superior inferior racist or sexist
 
06:05:42.070 --> 06:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
teach and treat all equally and without
 
06:05:45.230 --> 06:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
discrimination and that summarizes it
 
06:05:48.830 --> 06:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
all in two sentences if you just treat
 
06:05:50.750 --> 06:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
each and every person like a human being
 
06:05:54.948 --> 06:05:54.958 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't need 193.40 we wouldn't need
 
06:05:57.350 --> 06:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
the second part of article two which was
 
06:06:00.890 --> 06:06:00.900 align:start position:0%
amended in 1974 and we wouldn't be
 
06:06:03.310 --> 06:06:03.320 align:start position:0%
fighting this right now thank you
 
06:06:07.548 --> 06:06:07.558 align:start position:0%
further discussion represent Belcher
 
06:06:13.010 --> 06:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:15.230 --> 06:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
you've heard that teachers have so
 
06:06:17.448 --> 06:06:17.458 align:start position:0%
little influence over students that they
 
06:06:18.948 --> 06:06:18.958 align:start position:0%
can't possibly get them to do anything
 
06:06:20.990 --> 06:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
in the classroom but they also have so
 
06:06:22.190 --> 06:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
much influence over them that they can
 
06:06:24.410 --> 06:06:24.420 align:start position:0%
touch them and change their lives
 
06:06:27.650 --> 06:06:27.660 align:start position:0%
we've heard that this law is totally
 
06:06:29.270 --> 06:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
unnecessary because these things just
 
06:06:31.010 --> 06:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
don't happen and they're not being done
 
06:06:34.610 --> 06:06:34.620 align:start position:0%
yet it's so stifling that teachers
 
06:06:37.128 --> 06:06:37.138 align:start position:0%
cannot possibly do their jobs while this
 
06:06:38.448 --> 06:06:38.458 align:start position:0%
law is in place
 
06:06:41.030 --> 06:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
we've heard that teacher trust is at an
 
06:06:42.230 --> 06:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
all-time low
 
06:06:44.090 --> 06:06:44.100 align:start position:0%
but we've heard that nothing has changed
 
06:06:45.470 --> 06:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
in education but I want to challenge
 
06:06:47.270 --> 06:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
that last part that nothing has changed
 
06:06:49.010 --> 06:06:49.020 align:start position:0%
in education
 
06:06:53.270 --> 06:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
over the last 20 plus years Paulo Fieri
 
06:06:55.810 --> 06:06:55.820 align:start position:0%
has become one of the most cited
 
06:06:59.090 --> 06:06:59.100 align:start position:0%
individuals in education colleges with
 
06:07:01.070 --> 06:07:01.080 align:start position:0%
his books the politics of education and
 
06:07:03.770 --> 06:07:03.780 align:start position:0%
pedagogy of the oppressed
 
06:07:05.510 --> 06:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
over the last same period of time
 
06:07:08.390 --> 06:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
critical theories and post-modernism has
 
06:07:12.288 --> 06:07:12.298 align:start position:0%
been imported into our schools in
 
06:07:13.670 --> 06:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
various ways
 
06:07:15.830 --> 06:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
it is leading to problems with children
 
06:07:17.628 --> 06:07:17.638 align:start position:0%
and is leading the problems with
 
06:07:17.638 --> 06:07:18.650 align:start position:0%
and is leading the problems with
teachers

06:07:18.650 --> 06:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
06:07:20.570 --> 06:07:20.580 align:start position:0%
I don't think any of them want to be
 
06:07:22.610 --> 06:07:22.620 align:start position:0%
dealing with this stuff
 
06:07:24.410 --> 06:07:24.420 align:start position:0%
it's that's where we're at right now and
 
06:07:25.670 --> 06:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
that's why we have to put these
 
06:07:27.590 --> 06:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
protections and keep these Protections
 
06:07:31.010 --> 06:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
in place until we can fix the underlying
 
06:07:34.310 --> 06:07:34.320 align:start position:0%
problems for now we absolutely need to
 
06:07:35.930 --> 06:07:35.940 align:start position:0%
keep this
 
06:07:37.910 --> 06:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion
 
06:07:39.948 --> 06:07:39.958 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
06:07:42.350 --> 06:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
I just don't live in your world
 
06:07:43.788 --> 06:07:43.798 align:start position:0%
that's for sure
 
06:07:43.798 --> 06:07:45.948 align:start position:0%
that's for sure
because

06:07:45.948 --> 06:07:45.958 align:start position:0%
because
 
06:07:48.470 --> 06:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
you know you you see everything in Black
 
06:07:50.030 --> 06:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
and White and it's not black and white
 
06:07:52.070 --> 06:07:52.080 align:start position:0%
and neither is teaching and teaching
 
06:07:55.190 --> 06:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
teaching students at a variety of
 
06:07:58.430 --> 06:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
students from a variety of backgrounds
 
06:08:00.530 --> 06:08:00.540 align:start position:0%
not only in social studies but in other
 
06:08:02.810 --> 06:08:02.820 align:start position:0%
skills other skill areas or other
 
06:08:05.390 --> 06:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
teaching areas teaching English teaching
 
06:08:08.868 --> 06:08:08.878 align:start position:0%
fiction uh letting them read books like
 
06:08:11.208 --> 06:08:11.218 align:start position:0%
to Kill a Mockingbird and then you know
 
06:08:14.090 --> 06:08:14.100 align:start position:0%
now that it's on the banned list or one
 
06:08:17.090 --> 06:08:17.100 align:start position:0%
of the books to be banned
 
06:08:19.670 --> 06:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
um I bet if you think back to your
 
06:08:21.410 --> 06:08:21.420 align:start position:0%
school time that there were different
 
06:08:24.708 --> 06:08:24.718 align:start position:0%
times when you read books or you had a
 
06:08:27.770 --> 06:08:27.780 align:start position:0%
exercise in class perhaps or even you
 
06:08:30.410 --> 06:08:30.420 align:start position:0%
had a research paper where whatever you
 
06:08:32.930 --> 06:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
as you were growing up had a big
 
06:08:35.510 --> 06:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
impression upon you and you came into
 
06:08:38.150 --> 06:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
class and you were able to bounce ideas
 
06:08:40.128 --> 06:08:40.138 align:start position:0%
back and forth with the teacher that's
 
06:08:42.350 --> 06:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
really important
 
06:08:45.170 --> 06:08:45.180 align:start position:0%
once you set it up so that
 
06:08:48.830 --> 06:08:48.840 align:start position:0%
anybody that that that feels the least
 
06:08:51.410 --> 06:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
little bit complaint
 
06:08:54.650 --> 06:08:54.660 align:start position:0%
can can make you lose your job I mean
 
06:08:56.868 --> 06:08:56.878 align:start position:0%
when I was teaching you lost your job if
 
06:08:58.390 --> 06:08:58.400 align:start position:0%
you were immoral
 
06:09:01.430 --> 06:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
insubordinate or incompetent
 
06:09:03.048 --> 06:09:03.058 align:start position:0%
those were the three things that's in
 
06:09:05.390 --> 06:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
the book as well and all of a sudden now
 
06:09:08.510 --> 06:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
it's if if I run an activity where some
 
06:09:10.610 --> 06:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
kid goes home and says wow I feel like
 
06:09:12.948 --> 06:09:12.958 align:start position:0%
you know I'm inferior to
 
06:09:15.470 --> 06:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
to some other class
 
06:09:18.350 --> 06:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
and the parent goes absolutely Bonkers
 
06:09:19.970 --> 06:09:19.980 align:start position:0%
and sends a complaint to the Department
 
06:09:22.250 --> 06:09:22.260 align:start position:0%
of Education and the department of
 
06:09:24.470 --> 06:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
education does get the complaints and
 
06:09:27.170 --> 06:09:27.180 align:start position:0%
they refer them over to either the AG's
 
06:09:30.110 --> 06:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
office or to the office of Human Rights
 
06:09:32.770 --> 06:09:32.780 align:start position:0%
and yes the office of human rights does
 
06:09:34.850 --> 06:09:34.860 align:start position:0%
investigate some of those but while
 
06:09:36.470 --> 06:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
that's going on
 
06:09:38.990 --> 06:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
at the local school district the person
 
06:09:40.788 --> 06:09:40.798 align:start position:0%
is suspended from their classes maybe
 
06:09:43.970 --> 06:09:43.980 align:start position:0%
with pay maybe not although mostly
 
06:09:46.128 --> 06:09:46.138 align:start position:0%
probably with pay but they they lose
 
06:09:48.530 --> 06:09:48.540 align:start position:0%
that two weeks of teaching they're under
 
06:09:51.170 --> 06:09:51.180 align:start position:0%
under scrutiny I mean how would you like
 
06:09:53.330 --> 06:09:53.340 align:start position:0%
to have that happen to you just get
 
06:09:55.910 --> 06:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
yanked out and say okay somebody made
 
06:09:58.010 --> 06:09:58.020 align:start position:0%
this complaint now you have to justify
 
06:10:00.048 --> 06:10:00.058 align:start position:0%
your teaching you have to justify what
 
06:10:02.690 --> 06:10:02.700 align:start position:0%
you did you have to get
 
06:10:05.150 --> 06:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
a lawyer probably because your
 
06:10:07.670 --> 06:10:07.680 align:start position:0%
livelihood depends upon it if they take
 
06:10:09.708 --> 06:10:09.718 align:start position:0%
away your teaching credential
 
06:10:12.110 --> 06:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
your whatever money you've spent for
 
06:10:13.970 --> 06:10:13.980 align:start position:0%
college whatever you've dedicated your
 
06:10:17.208 --> 06:10:17.218 align:start position:0%
life to is taken away from you
 
06:10:19.788 --> 06:10:19.798 align:start position:0%
that's why this this bill is so serious
 
06:10:22.490 --> 06:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
so so seriously bad
 
06:10:24.170 --> 06:10:24.180 align:start position:0%
if I may just respond to that one piece
 
06:10:25.548 --> 06:10:25.558 align:start position:0%
real quick
 
06:10:27.650 --> 06:10:27.660 align:start position:0%
um you brought up a good point which is
 
06:10:29.750 --> 06:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
Teachers would lose their jobs for being
 
06:10:29.760 --> 06:10:31.128 align:start position:0%
Teachers would lose their jobs for being
immoral

06:10:31.128 --> 06:10:31.138 align:start position:0%
immoral
 
06:10:33.350 --> 06:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
but then you gave the example of if a
 
06:10:35.390 --> 06:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
student feels bad because they're part
 
06:10:37.310 --> 06:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
of some class if they're made to feel
 
06:10:39.590 --> 06:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
bad and I just want to say that teaching
 
06:10:41.868 --> 06:10:41.878 align:start position:0%
child to feel bad because of a Class A
 
06:10:45.170 --> 06:10:45.180 align:start position:0%
skin color is deeply immoral
 
06:10:47.810 --> 06:10:47.820 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about reading a book Like To
 
06:10:51.048 --> 06:10:51.058 align:start position:0%
Kill a Mockingbird and realizing that at
 
06:10:53.150 --> 06:10:53.160 align:start position:0%
that I lived in a community that was all
 
06:10:53.160 --> 06:10:54.288 align:start position:0%
that I lived in a community that was all
white

06:10:54.288 --> 06:10:54.298 align:start position:0%
white
 
06:10:56.390 --> 06:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
I never had contact with black people
 
06:10:58.730 --> 06:10:58.740 align:start position:0%
and when I read that book I felt bad
 
06:10:59.990 --> 06:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
about it
 
06:11:02.868 --> 06:11:02.878 align:start position:0%
that's and and I should and it was a
 
06:11:05.150 --> 06:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
learning experience for me and that was
 
06:11:07.070 --> 06:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
that's a learning experience that's
 
06:11:08.448 --> 06:11:08.458 align:start position:0%
something that
 
06:11:11.208 --> 06:11:11.218 align:start position:0%
that made me a better person and made me
 
06:11:14.208 --> 06:11:14.218 align:start position:0%
understand the world better out of my
 
06:11:17.868 --> 06:11:17.878 align:start position:0%

06:11:22.610 --> 06:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
thank you I just how many of you have
 
06:11:24.530 --> 06:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
been in a staff meeting like lately with
 
06:11:26.090 --> 06:11:26.100 align:start position:0%
public school teachers how many of you
 
06:11:27.890 --> 06:11:27.900 align:start position:0%
have sat in the lunchroom with public
 
06:11:30.590 --> 06:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
school teachers and asked about this law
 
06:11:32.628 --> 06:11:32.638 align:start position:0%
this is known from the teachers feel as
 
06:11:34.970 --> 06:11:34.980 align:start position:0%
the band Concepts law
 
06:11:36.708 --> 06:11:36.718 align:start position:0%
I just challenge you to go talk to
 
06:11:39.890 --> 06:11:39.900 align:start position:0%
teachers before you make a decision
 
06:11:41.810 --> 06:11:41.820 align:start position:0%
represent miler
 
06:11:43.850 --> 06:11:43.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just want to pick
 
06:11:46.128 --> 06:11:46.138 align:start position:0%
up on a point that representative Tanner
 
06:11:50.930 --> 06:11:50.940 align:start position:0%
talked about the issue here is is the is
 
06:11:53.750 --> 06:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
the law but it is the perception
 
06:11:57.230 --> 06:11:57.240 align:start position:0%
in other words if I feel one way about
 
06:12:00.350 --> 06:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
the result of it that's one thing but
 
06:12:02.390 --> 06:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
another person say I don't like what you
 
06:12:05.570 --> 06:12:05.580 align:start position:0%
just did I compile a complaint it is it
 
06:12:08.208 --> 06:12:08.218 align:start position:0%
is the the ability
 
06:12:11.930 --> 06:12:11.940 align:start position:0%
to bring people to to tasks when they're
 
06:12:14.110 --> 06:12:14.120 align:start position:0%
doing what they've been doing for years
 
06:12:16.670 --> 06:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
and an individual can do that we just
 
06:12:18.948 --> 06:12:18.958 align:start position:0%
had a situation here in Concord
 
06:12:22.310 --> 06:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
where a person a convicted felon goes in
 
06:12:24.770 --> 06:12:24.780 align:start position:0%
and complains about an art teacher here
 
06:12:27.948 --> 06:12:27.958 align:start position:0%
in town because the way he dressed and
 
06:12:30.170 --> 06:12:30.180 align:start position:0%
he automatically gets he automatically
 
06:12:33.410 --> 06:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
gets an investigation the kids love them
 
06:12:35.150 --> 06:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
the parents love them but this one
 
06:12:37.250 --> 06:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
person because he didn't like the way
 
06:12:39.948 --> 06:12:39.958 align:start position:0%
that person dressed caused a complaint
 
06:12:42.770 --> 06:12:42.780 align:start position:0%
had nothing to do with his teaching
 
06:12:45.948 --> 06:12:45.958 align:start position:0%
that is the problem here it's the
 
06:12:48.530 --> 06:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
perception that people have of what's
 
06:12:50.628 --> 06:12:50.638 align:start position:0%
happening and as representative Tanner
 
06:12:52.910 --> 06:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
said if a child goes home and says you
 
06:12:54.650 --> 06:12:54.660 align:start position:0%
know I really felt uncomfortable nobody
 
06:12:56.930 --> 06:12:56.940 align:start position:0%
else in class felt uncomfortable a
 
06:12:59.270 --> 06:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
parent can compile a complaint
 
06:13:02.030 --> 06:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's the that's the onerous
 
06:13:03.890 --> 06:13:03.900 align:start position:0%
situation that's happening in education
 
06:13:06.230 --> 06:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
today on this issue that's why this
 
06:13:09.110 --> 06:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
needs to be repealed
 
06:13:11.030 --> 06:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative woodcock
 
06:13:12.708 --> 06:13:12.718 align:start position:0%
Mega trim a lot
 
06:13:12.718 --> 06:13:14.270 align:start position:0%
Mega trim a lot
um

06:13:14.270 --> 06:13:14.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:13:16.190 --> 06:13:16.200 align:start position:0%
a few days ago we're talking about the
 
06:13:18.830 --> 06:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
school board public hearings public
 
06:13:18.840 --> 06:13:20.150 align:start position:0%
school board public hearings public
meetings

06:13:20.150 --> 06:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
06:13:22.010 --> 06:13:22.020 align:start position:0%
and the reality was we're talking about
 
06:13:22.020 --> 06:13:24.470 align:start position:0%
and the reality was we're talking about
covet

06:13:24.470 --> 06:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
covet
 
06:13:26.868 --> 06:13:26.878 align:start position:0%
and masking
 
06:13:28.850 --> 06:13:28.860 align:start position:0%
this law reminds this this bill reminder
 
06:13:31.548 --> 06:13:31.558 align:start position:0%
that uh same way
 
06:13:35.330 --> 06:13:35.340 align:start position:0%
when this came before us uh and as a
 
06:13:38.650 --> 06:13:38.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:40.970 --> 06:13:40.980 align:start position:0%
overabundance of critical race Theory
 
06:13:40.980 --> 06:13:42.410 align:start position:0%
overabundance of critical race Theory
dialogue

06:13:42.410 --> 06:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
dialogue
 
06:13:44.868 --> 06:13:44.878 align:start position:0%
that's where it came from
 
06:13:47.990 --> 06:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
and what we heard people say was
 
06:13:50.868 --> 06:13:50.878 align:start position:0%
sitting there racism is real in this
 
06:13:50.878 --> 06:13:52.430 align:start position:0%
sitting there racism is real in this
state

06:13:52.430 --> 06:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:13:54.890 --> 06:13:54.900 align:start position:0%
we need to promote conversation
 
06:13:56.750 --> 06:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
we heard people say
 
06:13:58.610 --> 06:13:58.620 align:start position:0%
when teachers can make students feel
 
06:14:00.650 --> 06:14:00.660 align:start position:0%
safe they can talk more and have more
 
06:14:02.930 --> 06:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
risks and more learning that's what we
 
06:14:04.250 --> 06:14:04.260 align:start position:0%
heard we heard the Manchester school
 
06:14:07.368 --> 06:14:07.378 align:start position:0%
boys saying over this law is consciously
 
06:14:09.288 --> 06:14:09.298 align:start position:0%
or unconsciously causing credibility
 
06:14:12.350 --> 06:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
issue with our teachers and the public
 
06:14:14.868 --> 06:14:14.878 align:start position:0%
teachers are professionals
 
06:14:18.350 --> 06:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
we need to allow them to work their work
 
06:14:20.990 --> 06:14:21.000 align:start position:0%
in the classroom and help students grow
 
06:14:23.750 --> 06:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
help students how to learn to discuss
 
06:14:26.270 --> 06:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
and until we open that range of
 
06:14:26.280 --> 06:14:27.410 align:start position:0%
and until we open that range of
opportunity

06:14:27.410 --> 06:14:27.420 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
06:14:30.830 --> 06:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
then we can make teachers make teaching
 
06:14:32.750 --> 06:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
a profession that people do not want to
 
06:14:37.190 --> 06:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
go in and are untrusted we need to start
 
06:14:39.170 --> 06:14:39.180 align:start position:0%
correcting this and this is not doing it
 
06:14:42.650 --> 06:14:42.660 align:start position:0%
this is this is an impingement on public
 
06:14:45.010 --> 06:14:45.020 align:start position:0%
education it
 
06:14:48.830 --> 06:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
curtails dialogue it curtails Innovation
 
06:14:51.288 --> 06:14:51.298 align:start position:0%
it makes us teach a narrow view of
 
06:14:54.288 --> 06:14:54.298 align:start position:0%
history and I don't think this is uh
 
06:14:57.650 --> 06:14:57.660 align:start position:0%
helpful I understand the intent may seem
 
06:14:58.970 --> 06:14:58.980 align:start position:0%
like there's nothing in the law that
 
06:15:00.770 --> 06:15:00.780 align:start position:0%
says that's that is bad you can just
 
06:15:02.810 --> 06:15:02.820 align:start position:0%
talk around the issues that's not the
 
06:15:05.448 --> 06:15:05.458 align:start position:0%
reality in the classroom thank you Mr
 
06:15:08.170 --> 06:15:08.180 align:start position:0%
chair you're welcome Jefferson Hall
 
06:15:09.948 --> 06:15:09.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:15:11.510 --> 06:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
um I I would take those 20 social
 
06:15:13.368 --> 06:15:13.378 align:start position:0%
studies teachers that representative
 
06:15:15.650 --> 06:15:15.660 align:start position:0%
elephants talked about and I would also
 
06:15:17.990 --> 06:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
ask them if two years ago did they know
 
06:15:20.930 --> 06:15:20.940 align:start position:0%
what CRT was did they know a divisive
 
06:15:22.910 --> 06:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
Concepts were I think every one of them
 
06:15:26.448 --> 06:15:26.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:31.548 --> 06:15:31.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:33.288 --> 06:15:33.298 align:start position:0%
we're dancing around a number of
 
06:15:36.230 --> 06:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
different things in this discussion
 
06:15:38.810 --> 06:15:38.820 align:start position:0%
probably at the core of it is the
 
06:15:41.750 --> 06:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
critical race Theory teaching which is
 
06:15:44.390 --> 06:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
currently caught in most of the
 
06:15:48.890 --> 06:15:48.900 align:start position:0%
universities as fact not as Theory as
 
06:15:48.900 --> 06:15:51.410 align:start position:0%
universities as fact not as Theory as
fact

06:15:51.410 --> 06:15:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:53.510 --> 06:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
and then the teachers who are taught
 
06:15:56.570 --> 06:15:56.580 align:start position:0%
that go into the schools and teach it as
 
06:15:56.580 --> 06:15:58.788 align:start position:0%
that go into the schools and teach it as
fact

06:15:58.788 --> 06:15:58.798 align:start position:0%
fact
 
06:16:01.610 --> 06:16:01.620 align:start position:0%
but it's not fact
 
06:16:05.948 --> 06:16:05.958 align:start position:0%
it's Theory generated out of the Harvard
 
06:16:11.208 --> 06:16:11.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:13.788 --> 06:16:13.798 align:start position:0%
a sociology lab now what are you doing
 
06:16:16.390 --> 06:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
here I've taken a lot of lab courses
 
06:16:19.070 --> 06:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
none in sociology
 
06:16:21.890 --> 06:16:21.900 align:start position:0%
we have a hypothesis which is just an
 
06:16:23.750 --> 06:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
idea of speculation
 
06:16:27.110 --> 06:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
you test it against things you determine
 
06:16:31.368 --> 06:16:31.378 align:start position:0%
what is a truth or what is fact
 
06:16:34.368 --> 06:16:34.378 align:start position:0%
you don't take what is an assumption or
 
06:16:37.190 --> 06:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
something worth thinking about
 
06:16:42.890 --> 06:16:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:45.650 --> 06:16:45.660 align:start position:0%
that's the primary flaw critical race
 
06:16:45.660 --> 06:16:46.850 align:start position:0%
that's the primary flaw critical race
Theory

06:16:46.850 --> 06:16:46.860 align:start position:0%
Theory
 
06:16:50.270 --> 06:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
it assumes that because some white
 
06:16:50.280 --> 06:16:51.470 align:start position:0%
it assumes that because some white
people

06:16:51.470 --> 06:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
people
 
06:16:51.480 --> 06:16:54.230 align:start position:0%
people
were

06:16:54.230 --> 06:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
were
 
06:16:54.240 --> 06:16:55.330 align:start position:0%
were
um

06:16:55.330 --> 06:16:55.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:16:58.430 --> 06:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
involved in racial and other kinds of
 
06:16:58.440 --> 06:17:00.708 align:start position:0%
involved in racial and other kinds of
deprivation

06:17:00.708 --> 06:17:00.718 align:start position:0%
deprivation
 
06:17:03.170 --> 06:17:03.180 align:start position:0%
that white people do that
 
06:17:07.910 --> 06:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:10.430 --> 06:17:10.440 align:start position:0%
you're drawing a generalization from a
 
06:17:12.350 --> 06:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
particular fact
 
06:17:14.930 --> 06:17:14.940 align:start position:0%
all white people are not racist because
 
06:17:19.208 --> 06:17:19.218 align:start position:0%
some white people have been a racist
 
06:17:22.368 --> 06:17:22.378 align:start position:0%
Aristotle yes I know he was a white male
 
06:17:27.830 --> 06:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:31.070 --> 06:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
it's a reasoning
 
06:17:33.230 --> 06:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
playing in some
 
06:17:35.570 --> 06:17:35.580 align:start position:0%
and people are not taught that
 
06:17:37.730 --> 06:17:37.740 align:start position:0%
and they're also taught to believe that
 
06:17:40.368 --> 06:17:40.378 align:start position:0%
because people did this of a certain day
 
06:17:44.030 --> 06:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
that their children are also guilty
 
06:17:50.510 --> 06:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:55.010 --> 06:17:55.020 align:start position:0%
I disagree entirely with that I lived in
 
06:17:58.610 --> 06:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:02.090 --> 06:18:02.100 align:start position:0%
I lived in racially segregated school
 
06:18:02.100 --> 06:18:04.788 align:start position:0%
I lived in racially segregated school
areas

06:18:04.788 --> 06:18:04.798 align:start position:0%
areas
 
06:18:07.190 --> 06:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
I lived in towns where the black people
 
06:18:08.868 --> 06:18:08.878 align:start position:0%
lived down the street and the white
 
06:18:13.610 --> 06:18:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:16.430 --> 06:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
I lived in the world where
 
06:18:18.590 --> 06:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
black people weren't allowed to carry
 
06:18:21.530 --> 06:18:21.540 align:start position:0%
knives they could only carry personal
 
06:18:23.570 --> 06:18:23.580 align:start position:0%
Improvement things so They Carried
 
06:18:27.470 --> 06:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
razors strapped around their neck
 
06:18:32.208 --> 06:18:32.218 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:35.510 --> 06:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
the woman who reared me as a child had
 
06:18:38.030 --> 06:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
to carry an ice pick because it was
 
06:18:40.910 --> 06:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
illegal to carry a knife
 
06:18:44.090 --> 06:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
I learned that at age six when she was
 
06:18:46.850 --> 06:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
cleaning out her purse one day at the
 
06:18:50.570 --> 06:18:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:53.448 --> 06:18:53.458 align:start position:0%
yes there are some terrible evil heinous
 
06:18:55.610 --> 06:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
horrible whatever work word you want
 
06:18:58.128 --> 06:18:58.138 align:start position:0%
things that happened in that
 
06:19:01.910 --> 06:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
but people did not become racist
 
06:19:04.250 --> 06:19:04.260 align:start position:0%
because their father our parents or
 
06:19:06.890 --> 06:19:06.900 align:start position:0%
grandparents or whatever was a racist
 
06:19:09.288 --> 06:19:09.298 align:start position:0%
not everybody
 
06:19:13.910 --> 06:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
I'm sure some did they're humans
 
06:19:17.330 --> 06:19:17.340 align:start position:0%
but I was at a camp one night run by the
 
06:19:22.430 --> 06:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:25.070 --> 06:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
and we were having to find ways to get
 
06:19:27.830 --> 06:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
the black campers back to their homes
 
06:19:30.770 --> 06:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
because people were rioting and burning
 
06:19:32.510 --> 06:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
down The Parks
 
06:19:40.850 --> 06:19:40.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:42.590 --> 06:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
and they were trying to get these black
 
06:19:47.510 --> 06:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:50.750 --> 06:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
so all those generalizations just stick
 
06:19:52.970 --> 06:19:52.980 align:start position:0%
in my crawl
 
06:19:56.030 --> 06:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
I don't like sloppy reasoning and I
 
06:19:57.830 --> 06:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
particularly don't like it when it
 
06:20:00.948 --> 06:20:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:03.230 --> 06:20:03.240 align:start position:0%
and whether they're teachers in some
 
06:20:06.048 --> 06:20:06.058 align:start position:0%
research our students
 
06:20:08.090 --> 06:20:08.100 align:start position:0%
they don't need to be taught that they
 
06:20:12.590 --> 06:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:14.810 --> 06:20:14.820 align:start position:0%
what's wrong with some portion of this
 
06:20:16.788 --> 06:20:16.798 align:start position:0%
law is they're talking about teaching on
 
06:20:20.030 --> 06:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
what the hell does teach on me
 
06:20:22.788 --> 06:20:22.798 align:start position:0%
does it mean explain learn about
 
06:20:22.798 --> 06:20:25.250 align:start position:0%
does it mean explain learn about
understand

06:20:25.250 --> 06:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
understand
 
06:20:27.890 --> 06:20:27.900 align:start position:0%
just on the subject of
 
06:20:33.170 --> 06:20:33.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:36.410 --> 06:20:36.420 align:start position:0%
it needs to be explicit
 
06:20:39.170 --> 06:20:39.180 align:start position:0%
and it be there needs to be explicit at
 
06:20:44.628 --> 06:20:44.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:46.850 --> 06:20:46.860 align:start position:0%
and yes not all teachers are taught
 
06:20:46.860 --> 06:20:48.770 align:start position:0%
and yes not all teachers are taught
logic

06:20:48.770 --> 06:20:48.780 align:start position:0%
logic
 
06:20:51.770 --> 06:20:51.780 align:start position:0%
how many teachers in New Hampshire teach
 
06:20:54.170 --> 06:20:54.180 align:start position:0%
without having studied a foreign
 
06:20:57.650 --> 06:20:57.660 align:start position:0%
language teach that in English
 
06:21:00.708 --> 06:21:00.718 align:start position:0%
I dropped the pencil my fault
 
06:21:04.548 --> 06:21:04.558 align:start position:0%
but in Spanish it just fell
 
06:21:06.708 --> 06:21:06.718 align:start position:0%
it just fell
 
06:21:09.048 --> 06:21:09.058 align:start position:0%
and so you try to teach a kid who speaks
 
06:21:13.070 --> 06:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
Spanish to convict himself of fault
 
06:21:15.230 --> 06:21:15.240 align:start position:0%
without understanding that he thinks of
 
06:21:16.548 --> 06:21:16.558 align:start position:0%
it that way
 
06:21:19.910 --> 06:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
are you prepared to teach that student
 
06:21:19.920 --> 06:21:21.350 align:start position:0%
are you prepared to teach that student
no

06:21:21.350 --> 06:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
no
 
06:21:22.850 --> 06:21:22.860 align:start position:0%
but there's no foreign language
 
06:21:26.530 --> 06:21:26.540 align:start position:0%
requirement in any uh education program
 
06:21:29.510 --> 06:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
probably in this state and in many many
 
06:21:29.520 --> 06:21:32.030 align:start position:0%
probably in this state and in many many
others

06:21:32.030 --> 06:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
others
 
06:21:34.670 --> 06:21:34.680 align:start position:0%
but the point about this is we really
 
06:21:38.390 --> 06:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
need to be more explicit more honest
 
06:21:44.270 --> 06:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:46.548 --> 06:21:46.558 align:start position:0%
and there's not nearly enough research
 
06:21:49.190 --> 06:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
has been done about what it's like to
 
06:21:51.590 --> 06:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
live in a racist Society
 
06:21:53.510 --> 06:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
but I can tell you there's a lot more
 
06:21:56.708 --> 06:21:56.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:59.570 --> 06:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
if you grow up as I did and many of you
 
06:22:01.430 --> 06:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
did with a parent who's in a small
 
06:22:01.440 --> 06:22:03.470 align:start position:0%
did with a parent who's in a small
business

06:22:03.470 --> 06:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
business
 
06:22:06.830 --> 06:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
you dared not speak out lest your entire
 
06:22:12.170 --> 06:22:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:14.030 --> 06:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
your father's business would shrink
 
06:22:18.890 --> 06:22:18.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:22.368 --> 06:22:22.378 align:start position:0%
so is that racist is that fear
 
06:22:24.830 --> 06:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
is that what
 
06:22:26.930 --> 06:22:26.940 align:start position:0%
I don't know I don't know I have the
 
06:22:30.288 --> 06:22:30.298 align:start position:0%
answer for that but I've lived it
 
06:22:32.868 --> 06:22:32.878 align:start position:0%
it's real
 
06:22:34.730 --> 06:22:34.740 align:start position:0%
and when you start telling me Oh people
 
06:22:37.670 --> 06:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
were racist just because because
 
06:22:40.310 --> 06:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
you're not convincing me
 
06:22:43.788 --> 06:22:43.798 align:start position:0%
I've met the real died in the wood scary
 
06:22:43.798 --> 06:22:46.368 align:start position:0%
I've met the real died in the wood scary
racist

06:22:46.368 --> 06:22:46.378 align:start position:0%
racist
 
06:22:50.270 --> 06:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:52.670 --> 06:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
and the simplistic teaching just doesn't
 
06:22:54.830 --> 06:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
cut it and that's not the fault of the
 
06:22:58.190 --> 06:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
teacher is what they were taught
 
06:23:00.850 --> 06:23:00.860 align:start position:0%
it's less than honest universities
 
06:23:05.390 --> 06:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
universities who are not doing research
 
06:23:07.788 --> 06:23:07.798 align:start position:0%
they want to be professors
 
06:23:10.070 --> 06:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
but they train as teachers
 
06:23:12.350 --> 06:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
and then they stop professing they stop
 
06:23:15.470 --> 06:23:15.480 align:start position:0%
doing research
 
06:23:17.750 --> 06:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
the real flaw in the universities is
 
06:23:20.208 --> 06:23:20.218 align:start position:0%
they don't require the professors to do
 
06:23:23.208 --> 06:23:23.218 align:start position:0%
research and publish you publish to
 
06:23:26.330 --> 06:23:26.340 align:start position:0%
expose your ideas to the criticism of
 
06:23:28.310 --> 06:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
other people in the field
 
06:23:32.150 --> 06:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
to test them to challenge them to prove
 
06:23:34.250 --> 06:23:34.260 align:start position:0%
whether or not you really should teach
 
06:23:34.260 --> 06:23:37.788 align:start position:0%
whether or not you really should teach
that

06:23:37.788 --> 06:23:37.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:40.670 --> 06:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
there's where the flow is
 
06:23:42.708 --> 06:23:42.718 align:start position:0%
the teachers are not well served because
 
06:23:44.628 --> 06:23:44.638 align:start position:0%
they're not as well taught as they
 
06:23:48.948 --> 06:23:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:50.868 --> 06:23:50.878 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any free is there
 
06:23:54.650 --> 06:23:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:57.708 --> 06:23:57.718 align:start position:0%
not seeing any uh yes reps and cordial
 
06:23:59.628 --> 06:23:59.638 align:start position:0%
one last thought because I'm I'm really
 
06:23:59.638 --> 06:24:01.730 align:start position:0%
one last thought because I'm I'm really
concerned

06:24:01.730 --> 06:24:01.740 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
06:24:04.310 --> 06:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
um where the lawmakers
 
06:24:07.548 --> 06:24:07.558 align:start position:0%
are we going to judge our laws by how
 
06:24:09.530 --> 06:24:09.540 align:start position:0%
they make people feel
 
06:24:11.510 --> 06:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
are we going to judge our laws by the
 
06:24:13.430 --> 06:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
letter of the law what is in here now I
 
06:24:15.890 --> 06:24:15.900 align:start position:0%
asked a question like I don't know it
 
06:24:17.750 --> 06:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
seems like an hour ago a long time ago I
 
06:24:21.788 --> 06:24:21.798 align:start position:0%
said what in 193 40s objectional
 
06:24:23.810 --> 06:24:23.820 align:start position:0%
objectionable representative Tanner
 
06:24:27.288 --> 06:24:27.298 align:start position:0%
started reading Roman numeral one but I
 
06:24:29.208 --> 06:24:29.218 align:start position:0%
mean that's just no people in any public
 
06:24:30.530 --> 06:24:30.540 align:start position:0%
school in the state shall be taught
 
06:24:32.570 --> 06:24:32.580 align:start position:0%
instructed inculcated or compelled and
 
06:24:34.610 --> 06:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
then you sort of stop
 
06:24:36.708 --> 06:24:36.718 align:start position:0%
the Crux of it is it sort of leaves you
 
06:24:39.410 --> 06:24:39.420 align:start position:0%
hanging it's hot what and then you have
 
06:24:42.948 --> 06:24:42.958 align:start position:0%
a b c d where what's wrong
 
06:24:44.868 --> 06:24:44.878 align:start position:0%
tell me somebody because if you can't
 
06:24:49.190 --> 06:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:52.090 --> 06:24:52.100 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
06:24:57.288 --> 06:24:57.298 align:start position:0%
okay I think we're ready to go into the
 
06:25:00.368 --> 06:25:00.378 align:start position:0%
voting stage of this so it's
 
06:25:03.230 --> 06:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
hb61 relative teaching on discrimination
 
06:25:05.448 --> 06:25:05.458 align:start position:0%
in public schools and discrimination in
 
06:25:07.190 --> 06:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
public workplaces
 
06:25:10.970 --> 06:25:10.980 align:start position:0%
and the motion on the table is to what
 
06:25:17.090 --> 06:25:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:19.670 --> 06:25:19.680 align:start position:0%

um yes okay folks we're ready to go
 
06:39:34.788 --> 06:39:34.798 align:start position:0%
ahead with the we have these two bills
 
06:39:38.208 --> 06:39:38.218 align:start position:0%
left HB 432 is a bill relative to the
 
06:39:39.708 --> 06:39:39.718 align:start position:0%
participation in the education Freedom
 
06:39:41.628 --> 06:39:41.638 align:start position:0%
accounts program
 
06:39:41.638 --> 06:39:43.510 align:start position:0%
accounts program
um

06:39:43.510 --> 06:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:39:46.250 --> 06:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
331 we're holding that off because of
 
06:39:48.110 --> 06:39:48.120 align:start position:0%
the see what happens in the house floor
 
06:39:48.120 --> 06:39:49.970 align:start position:0%
the see what happens in the house floor
tomorrow

06:39:49.970 --> 06:39:49.980 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
06:39:52.570 --> 06:39:52.580 align:start position:0%
with the similar bill
 
06:39:56.650 --> 06:39:56.660 align:start position:0%
so HP 432
 
06:39:59.330 --> 06:39:59.340 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli he recognized
 
06:40:02.868 --> 06:40:02.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:07.310 --> 06:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:10.730 --> 06:40:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:13.128 --> 06:40:13.138 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher makes the motion
 
06:40:16.788 --> 06:40:16.798 align:start position:0%
to second second that
 
06:40:20.628 --> 06:40:20.638 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli made the motion
 
06:40:20.638 --> 06:40:28.128 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli made the motion
yes

06:40:28.128 --> 06:40:28.138 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:29.330 --> 06:40:29.340 align:start position:0%
just like being on the airplane
 
06:40:31.868 --> 06:40:31.878 align:start position:0%
representative Hall
 
06:40:39.110 --> 06:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:40:42.530 --> 06:40:42.540 align:start position:0%
okay representative cordelli
 
06:40:47.208 --> 06:40:47.218 align:start position:0%
um this this bill requires uh their
 
06:40:47.218 --> 06:40:48.410 align:start position:0%
um this this bill requires uh their
family

06:40:48.410 --> 06:40:48.420 align:start position:0%
family
 
06:40:51.788 --> 06:40:51.798 align:start position:0%
um have their um uh income
 
06:40:55.070 --> 06:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
eligibility checked uh annually
 
06:40:57.230 --> 06:40:57.240 align:start position:0%
um I think that's going to be a hardship
 
06:41:00.110 --> 06:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
for uh some families who have
 
06:41:02.628 --> 06:41:02.638 align:start position:0%
um income that might go up and down in a
 
06:41:04.788 --> 06:41:04.798 align:start position:0%
real estate agent
 
06:41:04.798 --> 06:41:05.990 align:start position:0%
real estate agent
Etc

06:41:05.990 --> 06:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
06:41:07.868 --> 06:41:07.878 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
06:41:10.670 --> 06:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
possibly make the child a yo-yo in terms
 
06:41:13.010 --> 06:41:13.020 align:start position:0%
of being kicked out of the program than
 
06:41:15.048 --> 06:41:15.058 align:start position:0%
being allowed in ETC based on the
 
06:41:18.430 --> 06:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
Family's income that fluctuates
 
06:41:21.770 --> 06:41:21.780 align:start position:0%
uh uh further discussion from yeah we
 
06:41:23.868 --> 06:41:23.878 align:start position:0%
we're just going to keep it so we'll
 
06:41:25.910 --> 06:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
just be representative cordelli and me
 
06:41:27.830 --> 06:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
right and then we'll go okay I was just
 
06:41:29.868 --> 06:41:29.878 align:start position:0%
going to cool with a second of it yes we
 
06:41:32.628 --> 06:41:32.638 align:start position:0%
can do that what we've agreed upon in
 
06:41:34.128 --> 06:41:34.138 align:start position:0%
this bill because we know where we're
 
06:41:36.948 --> 06:41:36.958 align:start position:0%
going on it is that it's going to be
 
06:41:38.628 --> 06:41:38.638 align:start position:0%
just two people speaking representing
 
06:41:40.128 --> 06:41:40.138 align:start position:0%
Cornelia and representative luno and
 
06:41:42.048 --> 06:41:42.058 align:start position:0%
then we're going to go into the voting
 
06:41:42.058 --> 06:41:44.330 align:start position:0%
then we're going to go into the voting
mode

06:41:44.330 --> 06:41:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:44.340 --> 06:41:45.470 align:start position:0%
 
result

06:41:45.470 --> 06:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
result
 
06:41:47.390 --> 06:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
and then we probably won't need any
 
06:41:51.948 --> 06:41:51.958 align:start position:0%
speeches on the next motion so so
 
06:41:53.930 --> 06:41:53.940 align:start position:0%
um what uh what representative cordelli
 
06:41:56.930 --> 06:41:56.940 align:start position:0%
said is that uh that this bill does in
 
06:41:58.970 --> 06:41:58.980 align:start position:0%
fact require annual income
 
06:41:58.980 --> 06:42:00.470 align:start position:0%
fact require annual income
recertification

06:42:00.470 --> 06:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
recertification
 
06:42:03.410 --> 06:42:03.420 align:start position:0%
um for families with students in the um
 
06:42:05.990 --> 06:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
in the education Freedom account uh
 
06:42:07.850 --> 06:42:07.860 align:start position:0%
program it doesn't make any change with
 
06:42:10.490 --> 06:42:10.500 align:start position:0%
respect to what that income level is but
 
06:42:12.470 --> 06:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
it's an annual recertification the same
 
06:42:15.350 --> 06:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
thing that we do with Medicaid and snap
 
06:42:18.110 --> 06:42:18.120 align:start position:0%
and so many other programs
 
06:42:20.750 --> 06:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
um that that once they're um but but the
 
06:42:24.590 --> 06:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
difference the difference is that with
 
06:42:26.990 --> 06:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
um uh with annual income certification
 
06:42:27.000 --> 06:42:28.310 align:start position:0%
um uh with annual income certification
here

06:42:28.310 --> 06:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:42:28.320 --> 06:42:28.850 align:start position:0%
here
um

06:42:28.850 --> 06:42:28.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:42:31.910 --> 06:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
if your your income Rises and you no
 
06:42:33.948 --> 06:42:33.958 align:start position:0%
longer qualify for the for the state
 
06:42:36.230 --> 06:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
voucher you're the student doesn't get
 
06:42:38.090 --> 06:42:38.100 align:start position:0%
bugster it doesn't get kicked out of
 
06:42:40.010 --> 06:42:40.020 align:start position:0%
school or anything like that when that
 
06:42:41.448 --> 06:42:41.458 align:start position:0%
happens when you're in Medicaid or snap
 
06:42:43.190 --> 06:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
you get kicked out of Medicaid you get
 
06:42:45.170 --> 06:42:45.180 align:start position:0%
kicked out of snap
 
06:42:47.810 --> 06:42:47.820 align:start position:0%
um uh but uh but the the student does
 
06:42:50.690 --> 06:42:50.700 align:start position:0%
not get kicked out of their um of their
 
06:42:54.110 --> 06:42:54.120 align:start position:0%
their uh you know private private school
 
06:42:58.788 --> 06:42:58.798 align:start position:0%
and um and so uh so you know for for for
 
06:43:01.310 --> 06:43:01.320 align:start position:0%
these reasons for fairness for taxpayer
 
06:43:03.708 --> 06:43:03.718 align:start position:0%
fairness and consistent with um with the
 
06:43:06.708 --> 06:43:06.718 align:start position:0%
governor's comments that um that uh that
 
06:43:09.110 --> 06:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
he supports reasonable guard rails on
 
06:43:11.750 --> 06:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
the um the EFA program
 
06:43:14.990 --> 06:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
um uh I hope people will defeat the itl
 
06:43:17.690 --> 06:43:17.700 align:start position:0%
and will support an OTP thank you thank
 
06:43:19.730 --> 06:43:19.740 align:start position:0%

program by students with disabilities we
 
06:45:58.868 --> 06:45:58.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:00.770 --> 06:46:00.780 align:start position:0%

06:46:22.968 --> 06:46:22.978 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:46:22.978 --> 06:46:25.730 align:start position:0%
okay
um

06:46:25.730 --> 06:46:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:28.310 --> 06:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
would you like to offer that uh yeah I'd
 
06:46:35.510 --> 06:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:38.170 --> 06:46:38.180 align:start position:0%
I like to pass
 
06:46:41.150 --> 06:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
now the motion I got a system made we
 
06:46:42.830 --> 06:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
need to have a second on that motion
 
06:46:45.230 --> 06:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
zero zero seven seven seven eight it's
 
06:46:47.030 --> 06:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
an amendment presented by representative
 
06:46:50.930 --> 06:46:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:55.310 --> 06:46:55.320 align:start position:0%
okay that's good okay Mr chair yeah just
 
06:46:56.810 --> 06:46:56.820 align:start position:0%
so that because I think there's two
 
06:46:59.150 --> 06:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
amendments right that are going to be
 
06:47:01.910 --> 06:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
proposed yes before we take votes on any
 
06:47:04.490 --> 06:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
amendment can we can we have discussion
 
06:47:07.730 --> 06:47:07.740 align:start position:0%
on on two on the two amendments I see no
 
06:47:10.968 --> 06:47:10.978 align:start position:0%
reason why not okay thank you
 
06:47:14.448 --> 06:47:14.458 align:start position:0%
yes I have one other amendment that was
 
06:47:16.548 --> 06:47:16.558 align:start position:0%
earlier oh there's another one in there
 
06:47:18.190 --> 06:47:18.200 align:start position:0%
too yeah
 
06:47:22.128 --> 06:47:22.138 align:start position:0%
I'll just explain my amendment is fixing
 
06:47:24.708 --> 06:47:24.718 align:start position:0%
my other Amendment because the RSA was
 
06:47:26.810 --> 06:47:26.820 align:start position:0%
wrong and Jen caught it because it's
 
06:47:31.190 --> 06:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
supposed to be RSA 194 Dash F colon 4
 
06:47:34.490 --> 06:47:34.500 align:start position:0%
not B so my amendment was just fixing
 
06:47:37.610 --> 06:47:37.620 align:start position:0%
the B to an F
 
06:47:38.770 --> 06:47:38.780 align:start position:0%
so so
 
06:47:41.990 --> 06:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
let's have let's just have uh represent
 
06:47:43.968 --> 06:47:43.978 align:start position:0%
cordelli explain his Amendment and then
 
06:47:48.788 --> 06:47:48.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:51.468 --> 06:47:51.478 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account allows for
 
06:47:53.690 --> 06:47:53.700 align:start position:0%
many different options for parents for
 
06:47:56.510 --> 06:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
educational uh options
 
06:47:59.750 --> 06:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
um uh anything from homeschooling to
 
06:48:02.868 --> 06:48:02.878 align:start position:0%
online courses a private school
 
06:48:04.670 --> 06:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
Etc and each have different
 
06:48:08.448 --> 06:48:08.458 align:start position:0%
ramifications in terms of services for a
 
06:48:10.788 --> 06:48:10.798 align:start position:0%
child with disability so it gets very
 
06:48:12.850 --> 06:48:12.860 align:start position:0%
complicated even a private school
 
06:48:16.968 --> 06:48:16.978 align:start position:0%
placement by the parent has different uh
 
06:48:20.150 --> 06:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
criteria different abilities or Services
 
06:48:22.910 --> 06:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
uh based on whether the private school
 
06:48:26.208 --> 06:48:26.218 align:start position:0%
is profit or non-profit
 
06:48:26.218 --> 06:48:27.590 align:start position:0%
is profit or non-profit
um

06:48:27.590 --> 06:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:48:31.610 --> 06:48:31.620 align:start position:0%
so I I thought the simplest approach
 
06:48:34.430 --> 06:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
for everybody involved was to have the
 
06:48:36.770 --> 06:48:36.780 align:start position:0%
Bureau of special ed write up an
 
06:48:39.948 --> 06:48:39.958 align:start position:0%
explanation of the rights for students
 
06:48:42.890 --> 06:48:42.900 align:start position:0%
with disabilities who take an EFA and go
 
06:48:45.288 --> 06:48:45.298 align:start position:0%
through all those options
 
06:48:47.270 --> 06:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
um in the explanation they come up with
 
06:48:49.010 --> 06:48:49.020 align:start position:0%
rather than us trying to do it in
 
06:48:49.020 --> 06:48:51.350 align:start position:0%
rather than us trying to do it in
statute

06:48:51.350 --> 06:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
statute
 
06:48:53.390 --> 06:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
okay represent Cornell can you please
 
06:48:57.288 --> 06:48:57.298 align:start position:0%
explain years then mine was just I think
 
06:49:00.288 --> 06:49:00.298 align:start position:0%
more specific to one
 
06:49:00.298 --> 06:49:01.150 align:start position:0%
more specific to one
um

06:49:01.150 --> 06:49:01.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:49:03.890 --> 06:49:03.900 align:start position:0%
group of
 
06:49:07.070 --> 06:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
schools that parents might Place their
 
06:49:07.080 --> 06:49:07.610 align:start position:0%
schools that parents might Place their
um

06:49:07.610 --> 06:49:07.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:49:10.850 --> 06:49:10.860 align:start position:0%
students with a disability and mine just
 
06:49:13.548 --> 06:49:13.558 align:start position:0%
specifically dealt with for-profit
 
06:49:16.850 --> 06:49:16.860 align:start position:0%
private schools which don't have to
 
06:49:20.030 --> 06:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
um which don't have to provide any kind
 
06:49:23.270 --> 06:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
of special ed services and my concern
 
06:49:26.990 --> 06:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
was that parents have be told that and
 
06:49:29.650 --> 06:49:29.660 align:start position:0%
be aware of it before placing their
 
06:49:34.730 --> 06:49:34.740 align:start position:0%
children there and actually as long I
 
06:49:37.310 --> 06:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
guess rep cordelli will have to fix the
 
06:49:39.650 --> 06:49:39.660 align:start position:0%
B to an F
 
06:49:43.190 --> 06:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
um because we're on RSA but I I think
 
06:49:44.810 --> 06:49:44.820 align:start position:0%
that would be taken care of in the
 
06:49:47.990 --> 06:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
enrollment process but as I guess I have
 
06:49:48.000 --> 06:49:49.610 align:start position:0%
enrollment process but as I guess I have
no

06:49:49.610 --> 06:49:49.620 align:start position:0%
no
 
06:49:52.968 --> 06:49:52.978 align:start position:0%
cordelli's Amendment as long as it it's
 
06:49:57.190 --> 06:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
listed out that the for-profit you know
 
06:50:02.330 --> 06:50:02.340 align:start position:0%
every placement is explained I I guess I
 
06:50:05.090 --> 06:50:05.100 align:start position:0%
have no problem with that because you
 
06:50:06.708 --> 06:50:06.718 align:start position:0%
you should cover for-profit for
 
06:50:08.750 --> 06:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
non-profit though
 
06:50:12.890 --> 06:50:12.900 align:start position:0%
um uh this whole process of dividing the
 
06:50:15.708 --> 06:50:15.718 align:start position:0%
federal income for that Resident School
 
06:50:17.930 --> 06:50:17.940 align:start position:0%
District dividing by the number of
 
06:50:21.288 --> 06:50:21.298 align:start position:0%
special edu students that one or two
 
06:50:23.628 --> 06:50:23.638 align:start position:0%
students who go into the private school
 
06:50:26.390 --> 06:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
they get a percentage based on the
 
06:50:28.968 --> 06:50:28.978 align:start position:0%
division about the federal income and
 
06:50:32.150 --> 06:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
they get a service plan and so it it
 
06:50:34.190 --> 06:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
gets rather involved as opposed to
 
06:50:37.310 --> 06:50:37.320 align:start position:0%
students who take a different EFA option
 
06:50:37.320 --> 06:50:38.750 align:start position:0%
students who take a different EFA option
yeah

06:50:38.750 --> 06:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
06:50:41.690 --> 06:50:41.700 align:start position:0%
actually if the nonprofit the non-profit
 
06:50:43.910 --> 06:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
if there are six students and four of
 
06:50:45.530 --> 06:50:45.540 align:start position:0%
them have one disability and two of the
 
06:50:47.090 --> 06:50:47.100 align:start position:0%
other but all the money is taken up by
 
06:50:49.190 --> 06:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
the four the other two don't get any so
 
06:50:51.110 --> 06:50:51.120 align:start position:0%
if that's all written out and given to a
 
06:50:53.448 --> 06:50:53.458 align:start position:0%
parent before they do it
 
06:50:56.390 --> 06:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
I'm okay with that
 
06:50:58.208 --> 06:50:58.218 align:start position:0%
so a further discussion from
 
06:51:01.310 --> 06:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
representative I see your hand thank you
 
06:51:02.448 --> 06:51:02.458 align:start position:0%

um has um I I I believe
 
06:51:07.020 --> 06:51:07.850 align:start position:0%
um has um I I I believe
um

06:51:07.850 --> 06:51:07.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:51:10.368 --> 06:51:10.378 align:start position:0%
uh representative Cornell's amendment I
 
06:51:13.010 --> 06:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
think was was was that drafted in in
 
06:51:15.530 --> 06:51:15.540 align:start position:0%
coordination with um with attorneys
 
06:51:15.540 --> 06:51:18.910 align:start position:0%
coordination with um with attorneys
Allen

06:51:18.910 --> 06:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:21.890 --> 06:51:21.900 align:start position:0%
or with with Bonnet with Bonnie uh
 
06:51:24.410 --> 06:51:24.420 align:start position:0%
Dunham so so somebody that that
 
06:51:27.048 --> 06:51:27.058 align:start position:0%
specializes in in special education and
 
06:51:28.910 --> 06:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
special education law and I was
 
06:51:31.548 --> 06:51:31.558 align:start position:0%
wondering if the same thing was done
 
06:51:33.230 --> 06:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
um with representative
 
06:51:36.708 --> 06:51:36.718 align:start position:0%
um cordelli's uh amendment I I got
 
06:51:40.128 --> 06:51:40.138 align:start position:0%
um uh right up from uh Rebecca Fredette
 
06:51:41.930 --> 06:51:41.940 align:start position:0%
about the different options for private
 
06:51:44.330 --> 06:51:44.340 align:start position:0%
school placing placement based on
 
06:51:46.730 --> 06:51:46.740 align:start position:0%
whether it's for-profit or non-profit
 
06:51:49.430 --> 06:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
and at that point I decided
 
06:51:52.190 --> 06:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
let me take a step back and let them
 
06:51:54.530 --> 06:51:54.540 align:start position:0%
write it up and if anything changes
 
06:51:57.048 --> 06:51:57.058 align:start position:0%
they'll take care of the maintenance of
 
06:51:59.448 --> 06:51:59.458 align:start position:0%
the instruction manual for the special
 
06:52:01.310 --> 06:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
ed students thank you that that clears
 
06:52:04.548 --> 06:52:04.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:07.910 --> 06:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
so before we go anywhere then uh let's
 
06:52:09.170 --> 06:52:09.180 align:start position:0%
just have sort of like a general
 
06:52:11.448 --> 06:52:11.458 align:start position:0%
consensus uh where where are folks
 
06:52:13.070 --> 06:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
leaning right now in terms of which
 
06:52:13.080 --> 06:52:15.410 align:start position:0%
leaning right now in terms of which
amendment

06:52:15.410 --> 06:52:15.420 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
06:52:15.420 --> 06:52:19.190 align:start position:0%
amendment
yes

06:52:19.190 --> 06:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:22.788 --> 06:52:22.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:25.548 --> 06:52:25.558 align:start position:0%
but in uh representative cordelli's
 
06:52:25.558 --> 06:52:27.530 align:start position:0%
but in uh representative cordelli's
Amendment

06:52:27.530 --> 06:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
06:52:30.288 --> 06:52:30.298 align:start position:0%
so is this a written explanation that
 
06:52:33.890 --> 06:52:33.900 align:start position:0%
the department would come up with one
 
06:52:35.750 --> 06:52:35.760 align:start position:0%
written statement that addresses
 
06:52:37.968 --> 06:52:37.978 align:start position:0%
everything or is this a different
 
06:52:39.890 --> 06:52:39.900 align:start position:0%
statement for different student
 
06:52:42.468 --> 06:52:42.478 align:start position:0%
situations I was not clear from what you
 
06:52:44.090 --> 06:52:44.100 align:start position:0%
said right
 
06:52:47.390 --> 06:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
um an explanation of the rights for all
 
06:52:48.890 --> 06:52:48.900 align:start position:0%
the education options that are available
 
06:52:51.530 --> 06:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
under the EFA program so it'd be one
 
06:52:52.910 --> 06:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
document right
 
06:52:55.368 --> 06:52:55.378 align:start position:0%
thank you for clarifying
 
06:52:57.170 --> 06:52:57.180 align:start position:0%
because when the scholarship
 
06:53:00.230 --> 06:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
organization hands out this document the
 
06:53:02.390 --> 06:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
parent might not be sure at that point
 
06:53:04.850 --> 06:53:04.860 align:start position:0%
which option and whether it's a private
 
06:53:06.890 --> 06:53:06.900 align:start position:0%
school that's for-profit or non-profit
 
06:53:09.048 --> 06:53:09.058 align:start position:0%
or Etc
 
06:53:11.110 --> 06:53:11.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes
 
06:53:13.788 --> 06:53:13.798 align:start position:0%
so then I may have misunderstood what
 
06:53:16.788 --> 06:53:16.798 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell just said
 
06:53:18.590 --> 06:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
when you were speaking about if there
 
06:53:20.448 --> 06:53:20.458 align:start position:0%
were six students and four had one
 
06:53:22.910 --> 06:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
situation and two had another
 
06:53:25.730 --> 06:53:25.740 align:start position:0%
that if the four were paid for there
 
06:53:27.048 --> 06:53:27.058 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be there might not be enough
 
06:53:28.730 --> 06:53:28.740 align:start position:0%
left for the other two did I hear that
 
06:53:30.350 --> 06:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
correctly and so
 
06:53:32.750 --> 06:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if one document applies to
 
06:53:34.310 --> 06:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
all students it sounds like it depends
 
06:53:37.750 --> 06:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:40.430 --> 06:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
it's the way the the federal funds are
 
06:53:44.390 --> 06:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
distributed for special ed in placements
 
06:53:48.590 --> 06:53:48.600 align:start position:0%
so so it's not the same funding process
 
06:53:50.570 --> 06:53:50.580 align:start position:0%
that you have for our students in
 
06:53:52.310 --> 06:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
regular Space special ed in a public
 
06:53:52.320 --> 06:53:53.930 align:start position:0%
regular Space special ed in a public
school

06:53:53.930 --> 06:53:53.940 align:start position:0%
school
 
06:53:56.090 --> 06:53:56.100 align:start position:0%
the money that's divided up is just the
 
06:53:58.490 --> 06:53:58.500 align:start position:0%
federal funds they're from PI so I
 
06:54:00.410 --> 06:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
understand that okay may I have one more
 
06:54:01.968 --> 06:54:01.978 align:start position:0%
yes sure
 
06:54:04.930 --> 06:54:04.940 align:start position:0%
so I'm trying to understand how one
 
06:54:08.448 --> 06:54:08.458 align:start position:0%
standardized document is going to inform
 
06:54:10.310 --> 06:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
a parent
 
06:54:12.350 --> 06:54:12.360 align:start position:0%
what will and will not be covered for
 
06:54:15.048 --> 06:54:15.058 align:start position:0%
their particular student
 
06:54:16.910 --> 06:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
it just sounds like it's different in
 
06:54:18.770 --> 06:54:18.780 align:start position:0%
different circumstances am I incorrect
 
06:54:21.170 --> 06:54:21.180 align:start position:0%
about that
 
06:54:24.708 --> 06:54:24.718 align:start position:0%
uh yes it's based on what education
 
06:54:28.430 --> 06:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
option the uh parents the parent chooses
 
06:54:30.310 --> 06:54:30.320 align:start position:0%
for their child
 
06:54:33.048 --> 06:54:33.058 align:start position:0%
the options would be different in terms
 
06:54:35.628 --> 06:54:35.638 align:start position:0%
of the services available or not
 
06:54:35.638 --> 06:54:37.968 align:start position:0%
of the services available or not
available

06:54:37.968 --> 06:54:37.978 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:40.368 --> 06:54:40.378 align:start position:0%
but I I think it can be done in a
 
06:54:42.650 --> 06:54:42.660 align:start position:0%
one-page document
 
06:54:46.250 --> 06:54:46.260 align:start position:0%
the document I got from uh uh special ed
 
06:54:48.770 --> 06:54:48.780 align:start position:0%
director for debt for private schools
 
06:54:52.788 --> 06:54:52.798 align:start position:0%
was like two-thirds of a page
 
06:54:54.890 --> 06:54:54.900 align:start position:0%
thank you represent Belcher
 
06:54:56.510 --> 06:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and it's a little
 
06:54:58.730 --> 06:54:58.740 align:start position:0%
late today so I just want to take a look
 
06:55:00.048 --> 06:55:00.058 align:start position:0%
at this and make sure I'm seeing this
 
06:55:01.490 --> 06:55:01.500 align:start position:0%
correctly and you can correct me if I'm
 
06:55:02.810 --> 06:55:02.820 align:start position:0%
mistaken here
 
06:55:05.270 --> 06:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at um rep Cornell's
 
06:55:05.280 --> 06:55:06.410 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at um rep Cornell's
Amendment

06:55:06.410 --> 06:55:06.420 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
06:55:08.750 --> 06:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
um bidding on line five
 
06:55:11.030 --> 06:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
it says participation participation in
 
06:55:12.890 --> 06:55:12.900 align:start position:0%
the EFA program is a parental placement
 
06:55:15.830 --> 06:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
under 20 USC and now let's skip down to
 
06:55:18.288 --> 06:55:18.298 align:start position:0%
line eight starting at the end a
 
06:55:20.930 --> 06:55:20.940 align:start position:0%
parental placement under idea means a
 
06:55:23.150 --> 06:55:23.160 align:start position:0%
parental placement by blah blah the
 
06:55:25.190 --> 06:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
definition of an elementary school under
 
06:55:28.128 --> 06:55:28.138 align:start position:0%
20 USC section 14016 so when I go to
 
06:55:28.138 --> 06:55:28.910 align:start position:0%
20 USC section 14016 so when I go to
that

06:55:28.910 --> 06:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:55:31.968 --> 06:55:31.978 align:start position:0%
it defines an elementary school and an
 
06:55:35.810 --> 06:55:35.820 align:start position:0%
uh as a non-profit institution is that
 
06:55:38.030 --> 06:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
is that the correct thing that this
 
06:55:39.650 --> 06:55:39.660 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have the effect of limiting
 
06:55:43.310 --> 06:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
disabled students to using efas only in
 
06:55:47.510 --> 06:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:51.770 --> 06:55:51.780 align:start position:0%
but I I think not wanting to speak for
 
06:55:53.930 --> 06:55:53.940 align:start position:0%
representative I think the intent is
 
06:55:57.170 --> 06:55:57.180 align:start position:0%
that um it would provide
 
06:55:59.990 --> 06:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
um the explanation for how the services
 
06:56:03.430 --> 06:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
are to be provided if it's a non-profit
 
06:56:07.610 --> 06:56:07.620 align:start position:0%
private school it doesn't say
 
06:56:10.610 --> 06:56:10.620 align:start position:0%
um non-profit there but um it it's
 
06:56:13.990 --> 06:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
non-profit in the definitions that are
 
06:56:18.968 --> 06:56:18.978 align:start position:0%
included in the uh Amendment yeah
 
06:56:23.150 --> 06:56:23.160 align:start position:0%
and Mr chair yes so so
 
06:56:25.430 --> 06:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
um you know I obviously I've learned a
 
06:56:28.548 --> 06:56:28.558 align:start position:0%
lot about what or and I'm learning a lot
 
06:56:30.708 --> 06:56:30.718 align:start position:0%
about what all these different options
 
06:56:34.850 --> 06:56:34.860 align:start position:0%
can be so so I can I appreciate rep what
 
06:56:36.530 --> 06:56:36.540 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli is trying to do
 
06:56:38.590 --> 06:56:38.600 align:start position:0%
in terms of not not
 
06:56:41.150 --> 06:56:41.160 align:start position:0%
only providing
 
06:56:44.330 --> 06:56:44.340 align:start position:0%
um what uh what a student's rights may
 
06:56:46.368 --> 06:56:46.378 align:start position:0%
be in certain options but in all the
 
06:56:48.410 --> 06:56:48.420 align:start position:0%
options and I think it does get
 
06:56:51.530 --> 06:56:51.540 align:start position:0%
complicated quickly when uh when an EFA
 
06:56:54.170 --> 06:56:54.180 align:start position:0%
student maybe a part-time student in
 
06:56:56.390 --> 06:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
their resident School District maybe a
 
06:57:00.170 --> 06:57:00.180 align:start position:0%
full-time student in a public school dis
 
06:57:03.890 --> 06:57:03.900 align:start position:0%
in a out of District public school and
 
06:57:06.948 --> 06:57:06.958 align:start position:0%
then in a private school for profit in a
 
06:57:09.110 --> 06:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
private school non-profit in a home
 
06:57:09.120 --> 06:57:10.030 align:start position:0%
private school non-profit in a home
school

06:57:10.030 --> 06:57:10.040 align:start position:0%
school
 
06:57:12.770 --> 06:57:12.780 align:start position:0%
and then of course all combinations of
 
06:57:14.868 --> 06:57:14.878 align:start position:0%
those where they may be a part-time
 
06:57:18.110 --> 06:57:18.120 align:start position:0%
student in their resident Public School
 
06:57:21.110 --> 06:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
District and and I think that they
 
06:57:23.208 --> 06:57:23.218 align:start position:0%
probably have different rights under
 
06:57:27.110 --> 06:57:27.120 align:start position:0%
idea and and the and there's probably
 
06:57:30.230 --> 06:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
other combinations of things too so so I
 
06:57:33.890 --> 06:57:33.900 align:start position:0%
think it probably is beyond the um the
 
06:57:37.128 --> 06:57:37.138 align:start position:0%
you know I I I think it it it it sits
 
06:57:39.708 --> 06:57:39.718 align:start position:0%
with should sit with the expertise
 
06:57:43.310 --> 06:57:43.320 align:start position:0%
um of uh of somebody that
 
06:57:45.530 --> 06:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
you know it's doing this and can update
 
06:57:51.048 --> 06:57:51.058 align:start position:0%
it right so so so I I change yeah right
 
06:57:53.628 --> 06:57:53.638 align:start position:0%
right and and um and capabilities too
 
06:57:56.628 --> 06:57:56.638 align:start position:0%
and so I I would um uh representative
 
06:57:58.368 --> 06:57:58.378 align:start position:0%
Cornell sounds
 
06:58:00.890 --> 06:58:00.900 align:start position:0%
supportive of Representative cordelli's
 
06:58:03.650 --> 06:58:03.660 align:start position:0%
Amendment and uh and you know I would be
 
06:58:06.288 --> 06:58:06.298 align:start position:0%
supportive of that too
 
06:58:08.628 --> 06:58:08.638 align:start position:0%
yes representative dry thank you Mr
 
06:58:10.310 --> 06:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
chairman so
 
06:58:12.110 --> 06:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
um if this is kind of a generalized
 
06:58:16.850 --> 06:58:16.860 align:start position:0%
explanation am I correct that uh a
 
06:58:19.190 --> 06:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
parent could take their special case to
 
06:58:20.690 --> 06:58:20.700 align:start position:0%
the person who is in charge of special
 
06:58:23.330 --> 06:58:23.340 align:start position:0%
education support there to find out the
 
06:58:26.448 --> 06:58:26.458 align:start position:0%
the details for their particular child I
 
06:58:30.190 --> 06:58:30.200 align:start position:0%
I'm sure in addition the department
 
06:58:33.468 --> 06:58:33.478 align:start position:0%
has been appropriated funds for an EFA
 
06:58:35.628 --> 06:58:35.638 align:start position:0%
administrator they've been having
 
06:58:37.670 --> 06:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
difficulty finding someone for that
 
06:58:40.128 --> 06:58:40.138 align:start position:0%
position but I'm sure that person would
 
06:58:42.530 --> 06:58:42.540 align:start position:0%
act as an interim intermediary to
 
06:58:44.868 --> 06:58:44.878 align:start position:0%
getting the special ed director involved
 
06:58:50.810 --> 06:58:50.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:58:52.910 --> 06:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
any further discussion from the
