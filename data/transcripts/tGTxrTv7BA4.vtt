everyone and February 18th meeting of
 
00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 align:start position:0%
the science technology and energy
 
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
committee we're hearing having public
 
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 align:start position:0%
hearings on five different bills this
 
00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 align:start position:0%
morning and this
 
00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
afternoon and we also are going to have
 
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 align:start position:0%
an executive session this afternoon from
 
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 align:start position:0%
1 to
 
00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
whenever so we'll start in just a moment
 
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
but first I'd ask you all to rise and
 
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
join representative Swanson as he leads
 
00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
the United States of America to the
 
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.469 align:start position:0%
the United States of America to the
stands

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:36.479 align:start position:0%
stands
 
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
Nation indivisible with liy and justice
 
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:46.230 align:start position:0%
Nation indivisible with liy and justice
for

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 align:start position:0%
all okay so it'll be a busy morning I
 
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 align:start position:0%
suspect and uh so I think we should get
 
00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
started so I'm going to open a public
 
00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill
 
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
692 relative to utility compan companes
 
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
adopting Advanced meters and I'm going
 
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 align:start position:0%
to call on the prime sponsor of the
 
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
legislation representative McGee to
 
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
introduce it to us morning cat uh good
 
00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chairman and uh good morning
 
00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
members of science technology and energy
 
00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:16.759 align:start position:0%
um I'm cat McGee I represent Hillsboro
 
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
35 which is Hollis New Hampshire um
 
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
excuse my voice I have a little bit of a
 
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
cold um HB 692 is an extension of Prior
 
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
bills that we've attempted to put in to
 
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 align:start position:0%
uh get a handle on when our technology
 
00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
will be upgraded and advanced enough for
 
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
us to be able to partake in truly
 
00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:40.039 align:start position:0%
competitive markets so you'll notice on
 
00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 align:start position:0%
the first page of the bill the analysis
 
00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:43.639 align:start position:0%
says that this bill requires the
 
00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:45.919 align:start position:0%
electric distribution utilities under
 
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
the Pu which have not yet implemented or
 
00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:51.479 align:start position:0%
are not in the process of implementing
 
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:53.240 align:start position:0%
interval and advanced meter
 
00:06:56.189 --> 00:06:56.199 align:start position:0%
functionality to develop a plan to make
 
00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
such metering available to customers on
 
00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:01.720 align:start position:0%
an opt-in basis basis the reason it's
 
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
designed that way is that in the past uh
 
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
you know we've been made aware of the
 
00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
fact that when all of the meters for any
 
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
particular utility are replaced at the
 
00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:15.400 align:start position:0%
same time there's a significant cost to
 
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
that and uh we're not looking to
 
00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:24.039 align:start position:0%
mandate uh upgrade costs that will uh
 
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
impact rate payer bills but we know that
 
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
these advancements are coming and we
 
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
don't have a plan currently so that we
 
00:07:37.469 --> 00:07:37.479 align:start position:0%
understand um when we will be done with
 
00:07:39.309 --> 00:07:39.319 align:start position:0%
uh this migration and when we will
 
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
basically have the functionality that is
 
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
so needed uh to create those competitive
 
00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:47.919 align:start position:0%
markets that we keep talking about so uh
 
00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:50.120 align:start position:0%
in the first section of the bill on page
 
00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
one section one findings and
 
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
purpose it just talks about allowing the
 
00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
energy markets to to be fulfilled in
 
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
terms of their
 
00:08:02.869 --> 00:08:02.879 align:start position:0%
complexity uh by providing technologies
 
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:06.440 align:start position:0%
that will um enable the features that
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
are needed for us to reconcile what
 
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
energy is being used and what value is
 
00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:12.919 align:start position:0%
appropriate for that
 
00:08:16.469 --> 00:08:16.479 align:start position:0%
energy um and this part two says uh or
 
00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
section two says until the utilities
 
00:08:21.469 --> 00:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
upgrade their infrastructure uh to
 
00:08:23.149 --> 00:08:23.159 align:start position:0%
enable accurate load settlement
 
00:08:25.550 --> 00:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
practices we limit meaningful energy
 
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
planning sty lowering cost or cost
 
00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:29.960 align:start position:0%
lowering projects
 
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
and prevent um accurate valuation of
 
00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
distributed assets that prohib that
 
00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:39.560 align:start position:0%
prohibit us from basically demand
 
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
lowering management so there are all
 
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
these uh functions that we can't get to
 
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:47.200 align:start position:0%
if the technology is inhibiting our
 
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
ability to to do that so the idea is
 
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
that we want some clarity around uh what
 
00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
capacities folks are going to be able to
 
00:09:00.829 --> 00:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
have and when they will be able to have
 
00:09:05.389 --> 00:09:05.399 align:start position:0%
those um so we're basically asking that
 
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
if a utility is not in a position at
 
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:11.320 align:start position:0%
this point to offer Advanced
 
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
metering uh capabilities which include
 
00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
um you know interval metering that is
 
00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:19.160 align:start position:0%
conasur it with what the iso New England
 
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:22.120 align:start position:0%
requires or load settlement practices
 
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
that um enable additional features for
 
00:09:28.389 --> 00:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
competitive suppliers then we're asking
 
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:31.720 align:start position:0%
them to produce plan so the bill asks
 
00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
for uh I think a date of November
 
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
2026 to provide a plan to the Public
 
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission that will allow us
 
00:09:42.269 --> 00:09:42.279 align:start position:0%
to know what the timeline is for us
 
00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
being able to convert remaining meters
 
00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
the other thing that this bill does that
 
00:09:50.069 --> 00:09:50.079 align:start position:0%
and I've spoken with um eversource I
 
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
provided them with a copy of the bill a
 
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
couple of months ago and we've had a
 
00:09:56.509 --> 00:09:56.519 align:start position:0%
conversation in between there seems to
 
00:09:59.710 --> 00:09:59.720 align:start position:0%
be a little bit of uh conten between the
 
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
folks who are really anxious for us to
 
00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:03.560 align:start position:0%
have this capability which is basically
 
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
the competitive suppliers um who who
 
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
need um this level of granularity in
 
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
order to function the way they would
 
00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:12.680 align:start position:0%
like to with pricing
 
00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:17.320 align:start position:0%
signals um and the utilities in terms of
 
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:20.680 align:start position:0%
whether as the utilities are replacing
 
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
meters that come up for replacement each
 
00:10:27.069 --> 00:10:27.079 align:start position:0%
year um whether they can replace those
 
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
meters with Advanced meters so they
 
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
don't have to to replace them all at one
 
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:33.160 align:start position:0%
time that is their practice generally
 
00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
especially at eversource which is the
 
00:10:36.949 --> 00:10:36.959 align:start position:0%
largest um utility
 
00:10:39.389 --> 00:10:39.399 align:start position:0%
provider um they normally replace them
 
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
all at the same time but because they
 
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
are uh replacing at least a handful of
 
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
meters in the in the few thousands maybe
 
00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:51.959 align:start position:0%
five or 6 thousand a year um this bill
 
00:10:53.629 --> 00:10:53.639 align:start position:0%
asks that they come up with a plan to
 
00:10:56.269 --> 00:10:56.279 align:start position:0%
allow those meters to become Advanced
 
00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
meters as we go um and that it would be
 
00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:01.519 align:start position:0%
the option of the
 
00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:04.600 align:start position:0%
individual um to opt into having that
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
meter and they would pay for any
 
00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
difference in the cost of replacing it
 
00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:11.639 align:start position:0%
with an um an older meter that doesn't
 
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
have the advanced capabilities uh they
 
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
would play that pay that difference so
 
00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:17.240 align:start position:0%
that it's not shifted onto other rate
 
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:21.160 align:start position:0%
payers so the bill tries to answer a lot
 
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
of the gaps in us trying to move towards
 
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
technologies that would be useful to the
 
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:30.760 align:start position:0%
competitive market and and um I know
 
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
there are folks who will be able to
 
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
speak to the specifics on the utilities
 
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
part and also from the perspective of
 
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
the um you know Community power
 
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
aggregators so I think that's probably
 
00:11:45.629 --> 00:11:45.639 align:start position:0%
all I need to say in um in introduction
 
00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
of the bill and if anybody has any
 
00:11:49.829 --> 00:11:49.839 align:start position:0%
questions I'll try to answer them thank
 
00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
you for that introduction we appreciate
 
00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:54.040 align:start position:0%
that and thank you for bringing this
 
00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:57.160 align:start position:0%
bill forward so I have a question
 
00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
shouldn't this be covered by the
 
00:11:58.680 --> 00:11:59.750 align:start position:0%
shouldn't this be covered by the
integrated

00:11:59.750 --> 00:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
integrated
 
00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:03.720 align:start position:0%
distribution resource planning that we
 
00:12:05.629 --> 00:12:05.639 align:start position:0%
uh asked the utilities to do a couple
 
00:12:05.639 --> 00:12:06.910 align:start position:0%
uh asked the utilities to do a couple
years

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:06.920 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
ago um that's a good question and I
 
00:12:13.189 --> 00:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
don't think we specified that but
 
00:12:14.949 --> 00:12:14.959 align:start position:0%
certainly I would think as a planner
 
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
myself if we were doing integrated
 
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
planning that that should be a component
 
00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
of it maybe the utilities can answer
 
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
specifically uh whether there is such a
 
00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:25.240 align:start position:0%
plan already and whether this is a
 
00:12:27.069 --> 00:12:27.079 align:start position:0%
component of it I don't know I think
 
00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
passing this bill would ensure that it
 
00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
would be part of the planning which is
 
00:12:32.269 --> 00:12:32.279 align:start position:0%
what I'm hoping to
 
00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:34.480 align:start position:0%
do okay further questions for
 
00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:40.509 --> 00:12:40.519 align:start position:0%
Harrington thank you thank you for
 
00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:43.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question um just a a couple of
 
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
quick things uh you mentioned that this
 
00:12:48.509 --> 00:12:48.519 align:start position:0%
would be done as meters needed to
 
00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
replace so we're looking at a small very
 
00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:53.519 align:start position:0%
small amount of meters because some
 
00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:54.920 align:start position:0%
people that will get replacement meters
 
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
will say I don't want to pay extra for a
 
00:12:58.629 --> 00:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
interval meter because I don't even know
 
00:12:59.949 --> 00:12:59.959 align:start position:0%
what it does
 
00:13:02.269 --> 00:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
um so we're looking at how many years
 
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
before you would see a significant
 
00:13:06.269 --> 00:13:06.279 align:start position:0%
impact on the amount of meters out there
 
00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
it sounds like would take for a very
 
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:11.720 align:start position:0%
long time that's true um I I think that
 
00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:15.480 align:start position:0%
the that eversource has a plan to
 
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
replace all meters with AMI and we're
 
00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:20.600 align:start position:0%
we're in a queue um because they service
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
other states besides New Hampshire and I
 
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
think we're the last to have the
 
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:26.240 align:start position:0%
replacement which which is projected in
 
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
about five years so
 
00:13:31.189 --> 00:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
um Connecticut and Massachusetts I think
 
00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
are ahead of us uh for full replacement
 
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:37.000 align:start position:0%
to to get to get to that better
 
00:13:40.509 --> 00:13:40.519 align:start position:0%
technology um and you're correct that in
 
00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:42.440 align:start position:0%
that interim period in the interim five
 
00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:44.440 align:start position:0%
years you'd have a handful of meters
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
each year I guess the idea was at the
 
00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
way the plan works now is those meters
 
00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
would not be replaced
 
00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:56.600 align:start position:0%
with uh with smarter meters I guess is
 
00:14:00.189 --> 00:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
the quick way to an Ami meter they not
 
00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
planned to be replaced with improved
 
00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
meter because the um utility doesn't
 
00:14:08.829 --> 00:14:08.839 align:start position:0%
currently have a backend that supports
 
00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
them they do drive by meter readings and
 
00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:13.839 align:start position:0%
they would have to change that practice
 
00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
all at once my understanding is that if
 
00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
you adopt an Ami meter you can um it can
 
00:14:25.509 --> 00:14:25.519 align:start position:0%
be supported through uh a Wi-Fi you know
 
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
a cloud-based app in the interim and the
 
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
utilities would have to modify in order
 
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
to accept the data that's being placed
 
00:14:36.829 --> 00:14:36.839 align:start position:0%
in that cloud uh as the way that they
 
00:14:38.629 --> 00:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
would get information from that meter so
 
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:40.240 align:start position:0%
they would have to adopt a new practice
 
00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:41.519 align:start position:0%
but they wouldn't have to change all of
 
00:14:43.389 --> 00:14:43.399 align:start position:0%
their back end at least that's my
 
00:14:45.069 --> 00:14:45.079 align:start position:0%
rudimentary understanding and there are
 
00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
people that can speak to the technology
 
00:14:50.749 --> 00:14:50.759 align:start position:0%
itself followup follow up now course
 
00:14:52.829 --> 00:14:52.839 align:start position:0%
we're talking about interval meters but
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
there I don't see any mention of time of
 
00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:56.600 align:start position:0%
day rates I mean if you have an interval
 
00:14:58.509 --> 00:14:58.519 align:start position:0%
meter and it tells you how much power
 
00:15:01.509 --> 00:15:01.519 align:start position:0%
I'm using at at 11:00 and 11:05 and 1110
 
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
and so forth if the rate is the same 247
 
00:15:08.350 --> 00:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
of what benefit is that to me yeah um my
 
00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:09.800 align:start position:0%
understanding is it's not I mean there
 
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
are uh people there are already
 
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
customers in the region on the grid who
 
00:15:18.389 --> 00:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
are doing interval metering and the
 
00:15:22.269 --> 00:15:22.279 align:start position:0%
whole point is to get us to actual uh
 
00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
rates and to understand uh what we have
 
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
for rates and also be able to leverage
 
00:15:30.749 --> 00:15:30.759 align:start position:0%
those rates in order to create savings
 
00:15:32.829 --> 00:15:32.839 align:start position:0%
so um we've talked about that before
 
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
that people plug in at a time when you
 
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
know the the the rates are lower at home
 
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
and and they um can also Place energy
 
00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
back onto the system at a time when you
 
00:15:48.509 --> 00:15:48.519 align:start position:0%
would have you know higher demand which
 
00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
generally drives up the rate in order to
 
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
sort of lower um you know the overall
 
00:15:57.309 --> 00:15:57.319 align:start position:0%
curve follow up but but it's to be clear
 
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
in this bill does doesn't do any of that
 
00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:02.440 align:start position:0%
there's no time of rate time of day
 
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
rates okay well having an Ami meter
 
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
means that you would be capable of doing
 
00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
that right you have the capability and
 
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
what we don't have right now is the
 
00:16:13.269 --> 00:16:13.279 align:start position:0%
technical capability and we're trying to
 
00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
see how we can uh more rapidly move
 
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
towards having the technical capability
 
00:16:22.629 --> 00:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
to to support the kinds of energy
 
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
transactions that allow us to understand
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
correct price signals um and ways to
 
00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
lower demand when we need
 
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:33.720 align:start position:0%
to I'm sorry about my voice very
 
00:16:35.629 --> 00:16:35.639 align:start position:0%
scratchy representative bney has a
 
00:16:37.509 --> 00:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
question thank you chairman and thank
 
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
you representative M for taking my
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
question um I thought it was interesting
 
00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:43.160 align:start position:0%
you said that uh they could upgrade the
 
00:16:46.309 --> 00:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
Ami meters without any backend upgrades
 
00:16:48.309 --> 00:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't say that explicitly
 
00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:51.160 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the bill but um I guess the
 
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
question I would have is uh on the
 
00:16:55.949 --> 00:16:55.959 align:start position:0%
second page on line two it says uh with
 
00:16:58.030 --> 00:16:58.040 align:start position:0%
such meters and utilizing subscription
 
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
based meter data management system um
 
00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
yes so somewhere and then all the way at
 
00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
the end uh lines 23 to 25 are saying
 
00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:09.160 align:start position:0%
that anything that isn't covered by the
 
00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:12.760 align:start position:0%
customer opting in is going to be um you
 
00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:14.079 align:start position:0%
know covered by the rest of the rate
 
00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:17.240 align:start position:0%
payers so um is that am my
 
00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:18.799 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding that the bill actually
 
00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:20.959 align:start position:0%
says that there is some backend
 
00:17:23.549 --> 00:17:23.559 align:start position:0%
upgrading that would need to be done or
 
00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:25.839 align:start position:0%
um I guess that's my question yeah I
 
00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:28.079 align:start position:0%
mean I think what this this refers to as
 
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
any Delta that's incurred by the utility
 
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
right so if the utility has to provide
 
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
access to a subscription service or if
 
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
they're um acquiring data on the back
 
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
end through a subscription service in
 
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
the interim before all of the machines
 
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
are replaced which will be you know a
 
00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:47.960 align:start position:0%
reasonable cost that they will recover
 
00:17:49.549 --> 00:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
so at the time that they replace them
 
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
all they'll have this large amount to
 
00:17:53.909 --> 00:17:53.919 align:start position:0%
recover but in the interim I think what
 
00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:56.720 align:start position:0%
this section 23 I mean letter line 23
 
00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
and 24 in section two on on page to is
 
00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:04.200 align:start position:0%
referring to is any prudent prudently
 
00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
incurred cost to implement those
 
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
Advanced meters in the interim so it
 
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
would be again a small cost because it's
 
00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:12.200 align:start position:0%
a small number of meters but they might
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
have to they might have to um use a
 
00:18:17.110 --> 00:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
subscription service themselves in order
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
to be the recipients of data that they
 
00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
might need from those meters in the
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
interim because it would be not
 
00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
collected through driveby meter
 
00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
collections does that make
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
sense followup
 
00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:31.000 align:start position:0%
um okay thank you that sort of explained
 
00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:35.240 align:start position:0%
a little bit but um my my thinking is
 
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
that by allowing any of the cost to be
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
um recovered and then saying that there
 
00:18:44.149 --> 00:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
has to be a subscription based uh data
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
management patform when you talk to the
 
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
utilities did any of them say that um if
 
00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:49.720 align:start position:0%
they offer this it would be them
 
00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
offering the the uh subscription based
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
meter data I I just can't imagine a
 
00:18:58.789 --> 00:18:58.799 align:start position:0%
utility selling the data or or having
 
00:19:02.149 --> 00:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
somebody else manage their own meters I
 
00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
guess that's the part I'm not really
 
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
understanding yeah I me that's a good
 
00:19:06.909 --> 00:19:06.919 align:start position:0%
question and I think they they can
 
00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:08.600 align:start position:0%
answer it better than I can in terms of
 
00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:11.039 align:start position:0%
the details on it my understanding is
 
00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:13.480 align:start position:0%
that folks who have Ami meters Now by
 
00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
choice or folks who are part of the
 
00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
system with other providers than
 
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:19.720 align:start position:0%
eversource which is they're the they're
 
00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
the long poll in the tent they're the
 
00:19:24.029 --> 00:19:24.039 align:start position:0%
last of the utilities that's in line to
 
00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:26.600 align:start position:0%
adopt this technology across all of
 
00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
their customers so um the other folks
 
00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:33.480 align:start position:0%
that are already uh involved have the
 
00:19:35.669 --> 00:19:35.679 align:start position:0%
option to use their meters with a
 
00:19:38.549 --> 00:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
web-based service subscription and the
 
00:19:40.909 --> 00:19:40.919 align:start position:0%
subscriptions are inexpensive so it's
 
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
not like it's a it's not a huge cost
 
00:19:44.669 --> 00:19:44.679 align:start position:0%
that would be you wouldn't feel it
 
00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
across 540,000 customers so especially
 
00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:49.880 align:start position:0%
if it's 5,000 meters a year right so
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
it's a very small cost but I think the
 
00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
bill just tries to be as thorough as
 
00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
possible in explaining how costs would
 
00:19:59.310 --> 00:19:59.320 align:start position:0%
be allocated
 
00:20:01.029 --> 00:20:01.039 align:start position:0%
so that it's fair and that it's in
 
00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:03.640 align:start position:0%
keeping with our existing
 
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
practices does that help representative
 
00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
bernardy uh has a question but before I
 
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
recognize him I'd alert anybody who
 
00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
wants to testify on this bill but you
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%
need to fill out a p card and pass it my
 
00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:21.320 align:start position:0%
way thank you representative Bernardi
 
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman so if I understood
 
00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:25.640 align:start position:0%
what you
 
00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:29.480 align:start position:0%
said uh eversource is the last uh
 
00:20:32.470 --> 00:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
utility to come in into the program of
 
00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:35.039 align:start position:0%
having uh or establishing a program for
 
00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
these Ami meters they have a plan to do
 
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
it in five years why do we need to put
 
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
this into a bill if they already have a
 
00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:44.840 align:start position:0%
plan to do it in five years yeah thank
 
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
you for the question and it's it's a
 
00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
good question it's why would we need to
 
00:20:54.789 --> 00:20:54.799 align:start position:0%
intercede well we know there's a plan um
 
00:20:57.789 --> 00:20:57.799 align:start position:0%
and the plan is basically holding up
 
00:20:59.149 --> 00:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
several other
 
00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
aspects of the competitive market at
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
this point so I think we would like to
 
00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
understand the plan we would like to
 
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
ensure that by November of 2026 there is
 
00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
a plan and that that plan includes what
 
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
will happen in the
 
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:17.440 align:start position:0%
interim um so that we are moving forward
 
00:21:21.909 --> 00:21:21.919 align:start position:0%
as quickly as we can right follow
 
00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:25.000 align:start position:0%
up so do we need legislation to do that
 
00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
or can we just ask ever source to
 
00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
provide this committee there their
 
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
plan um well their plan is to wait for
 
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
the five years and do it all at once
 
00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:38.200 align:start position:0%
which is how they normally do their
 
00:21:42.549 --> 00:21:42.559 align:start position:0%
migrations um and so the issue really is
 
00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:45.480 align:start position:0%
do we see technology and the components
 
00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:47.240 align:start position:0%
of technology and the meter is a big
 
00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
piece of that as something um that we
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
should have some say over in terms of
 
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
being able to enable this functionality
 
00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
sooner we have competitors in our Market
 
00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
who are trying to provide Supply
 
00:22:04.510 --> 00:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
services that are um dependent on
 
00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:07.640 align:start position:0%
technology and right now our technology
 
00:22:11.669 --> 00:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
is um is not sufficient so the question
 
00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
is what do we do uh do we do anything
 
00:22:16.789 --> 00:22:16.799 align:start position:0%
and and this Bill is saying we should
 
00:22:21.710 --> 00:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
try and do uh something to work to to
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
incentivize uh the utilities to give us
 
00:22:26.549 --> 00:22:26.559 align:start position:0%
a plan that says what's going to happen
 
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
between now and that 5 years they don't
 
00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:30.520 align:start position:0%
don't normally do anything within the 5
 
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
years they they want it to be a clean
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
sweep um and my understanding is
 
00:22:40.669 --> 00:22:40.679 align:start position:0%
that the technology allows them
 
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
to um to provide smarter meters in the
 
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
interim as their replacing meters and
 
00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:50.440 align:start position:0%
we're just suggesting that that might be
 
00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
a good idea and if it has to be
 
00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
supported by a non-standard process but
 
00:22:58.029 --> 00:22:58.039 align:start position:0%
it still can work in order to provide
 
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
that data now then we think that we
 
00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
should be moving towards that so I think
 
00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
it's a question of having having the
 
00:23:08.630 --> 00:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
utilities disprove this Theory right and
 
00:23:10.830 --> 00:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
say we can't do that it doesn't work and
 
00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
I've had the conversation um with Mr LCA
 
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
that that's not the way they operate and
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
their and their current backend systems
 
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
aren't going to read these more advanced
 
00:23:22.549 --> 00:23:22.559 align:start position:0%
meters at this point but my
 
00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:25.240 align:start position:0%
understanding is from uh from the
 
00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:27.880 align:start position:0%
competitive market that there is a
 
00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:28.950 align:start position:0%
competitive market that there is a
capability

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
capability
 
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
for them to use a cloud-based service in
 
00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
order to allow both the customer and the
 
00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:37.640 align:start position:0%
utilities access um and there's and
 
00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:40.360 align:start position:0%
privacy concerns are you know obviously
 
00:23:42.669 --> 00:23:42.679 align:start position:0%
protected by the service but this
 
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
subscription is available so that
 
00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
individual meters could be fed into um
 
00:23:49.549 --> 00:23:49.559 align:start position:0%
the utilities
 
00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:55.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:58.830 --> 00:23:58.840 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman
 
00:24:00.269 --> 00:24:00.279 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
 
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
question and I if I own an electric car
 
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
which is basically a big battery on
 
00:24:06.909 --> 00:24:06.919 align:start position:0%
Wheels and if I could charge my car
 
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
during periods of low demand and low
 
00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
price and then turn around and provide
 
00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
electricity to the Grid at high demand
 
00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
and high price would I not benefit uh
 
00:24:21.789 --> 00:24:21.799 align:start position:0%
and make money actually and also would
 
00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
that not benefit the grid and its
 
00:24:26.269 --> 00:24:26.279 align:start position:0%
customers by doing load leveling by
 
00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:29.240 align:start position:0%
shaving the peak load to the grid and
 
00:24:31.549 --> 00:24:31.559 align:start position:0%
the customers thank you you don't have
 
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
to answer that because it's not about
 
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
the bill it's not okay it it's not it's
 
00:24:38.029 --> 00:24:38.039 align:start position:0%
not directly about the bill it's
 
00:24:40.389 --> 00:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
transactive energy right it's another
 
00:24:42.710 --> 00:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
sophisticated energy thing we could be
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
doing if we had better technology so
 
00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's the only way it is related to the
 
00:24:48.549 --> 00:24:48.559 align:start position:0%
bill representative Kaplan has a
 
00:24:50.549 --> 00:24:50.559 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:52.480 align:start position:0%
you uh representative McGee for bringing
 
00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:55.240 align:start position:0%
this bill uh this is kind of related to
 
00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:56.360 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington's question
 
00:24:59.830 --> 00:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
about time of use um
 
00:25:02.149 --> 00:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
this bill allows the utilities it seems
 
00:25:06.029 --> 00:25:06.039 align:start position:0%
like to to recoup some of the cost of
 
00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
installing these meters which would be
 
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
an incentive to install more of these
 
00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
meters because that would be an
 
00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:13.240 align:start position:0%
infrastructure cost that they could then
 
00:25:15.149 --> 00:25:15.159 align:start position:0%
you know add onto their distribution or
 
00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
transmission costs um so would it not be
 
00:25:22.029 --> 00:25:22.039 align:start position:0%
then in their interest to also provide
 
00:25:24.510 --> 00:25:24.520 align:start position:0%
time of used tariffs fairly soon after
 
00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
they implemented this plan in order to
 
00:25:29.310 --> 00:25:29.320 align:start position:0%
incentivize more people more customers
 
00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
to to have these smart
 
00:25:33.389 --> 00:25:33.399 align:start position:0%
meters well I don't think I can speak
 
00:25:37.029 --> 00:25:37.039 align:start position:0%
for them um I I think that this is
 
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
um that the bill is trying to
 
00:25:43.789 --> 00:25:43.799 align:start position:0%
acknowledge all of the players in the
 
00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:47.039 align:start position:0%
system in terms of trying to advance the
 
00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
idea that the sooner we can adopt the
 
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
technology the sooner we will be able to
 
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
move towards lowering demand and and
 
00:25:58.630 --> 00:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
um and assisting people with figure out
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
ways to lower their costs right they'll
 
00:26:02.269 --> 00:26:02.279 align:start position:0%
have that capability they'll have
 
00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
granular information about that but the
 
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
section that says the commission shall
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
ensure timely cost recovery for utility
 
00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
cost prudently incurred to implement and
 
00:26:15.310 --> 00:26:15.320 align:start position:0%
integrate the advanced meter optin
 
00:26:17.789 --> 00:26:17.799 align:start position:0%
option it's a very very small part of
 
00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:19.960 align:start position:0%
their cost and they're already allowed
 
00:26:23.389 --> 00:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
th this is just really um rearticulating
 
00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
the language that already exists I mean
 
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:26.480 align:start position:0%
the utilities whenever they make a
 
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
prudent investment they're able to
 
00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
recover that from the rate payers so uh
 
00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:32.840 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do is really
 
00:26:35.669 --> 00:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
incentivize a conversion to the more
 
00:26:38.269 --> 00:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
sophisticated technology more rapidly
 
00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:45.029 --> 00:26:45.039 align:start position:0%
system okay seeing no more questions I
 
00:26:46.669 --> 00:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
want to thank you representative for
 
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
introducing this legislation we'll call
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
on next Matt Young from the New
 
00:26:59.430 --> 00:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:11.950 --> 00:27:11.960 align:start position:0%
morning so for the record my name is
 
00:27:13.269 --> 00:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
Matt Young I'm an attorney with the New
 
00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of energy um the
 
00:27:17.029 --> 00:27:17.039 align:start position:0%
department is neutral on this bill but
 
00:27:18.430 --> 00:27:18.440 align:start position:0%
did have a few concerns just wanted to
 
00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
raise here uh this morning um so first
 
00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
the department does understand that it
 
00:27:27.909 --> 00:27:27.919 align:start position:0%
would be very expensive um and maybe
 
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
come some a an AP word uh to implement
 
00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
Ami metering functionality from
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
a uh data Gathering and uh Billing
 
00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
System perspective of the
 
00:27:38.159 --> 00:27:40.310 align:start position:0%
System perspective of the
utility

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
utility
 
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:43.240 align:start position:0%
um so I think even if those Ami meters
 
00:27:45.549 --> 00:27:45.559 align:start position:0%
were put in the functionality uh may not
 
00:27:47.909 --> 00:27:47.919 align:start position:0%
necessarily be there for uh for some
 
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
time and then in a similar vein uh this
 
00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:54.440 align:start position:0%
bill is introduced uh seems to
 
00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:57.919 align:start position:0%
contemplate um I I guess a a permissive
 
00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
cost recovery from those customers that
 
00:28:01.909 --> 00:28:01.919 align:start position:0%
opt in um but there was just some
 
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
concern of cost shifting uh with the
 
00:28:07.389 --> 00:28:07.399 align:start position:0%
language of this bill um and something
 
00:28:09.549 --> 00:28:09.559 align:start position:0%
for the community to consider is whether
 
00:28:12.389 --> 00:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
uh um those customers that do opt in
 
00:28:14.789 --> 00:28:14.799 align:start position:0%
should should be the ones um paying for
 
00:28:14.799 --> 00:28:15.710 align:start position:0%
should should be the ones um paying for
the

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
upgrades and then finally the um last
 
00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:19.919 align:start position:0%
thing I just wanted to mention uh at the
 
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
outset was I guess more of a structural
 
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
um structural con concern with this
 
00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
language was um it was the Departments
 
00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
understanding that the intent of the
 
00:28:30.909 --> 00:28:30.919 align:start position:0%
legislature with the creation of the
 
00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:34.600 align:start position:0%
department uh was to have it implements
 
00:28:36.149 --> 00:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
um what I guess I'll call the policy
 
00:28:39.389 --> 00:28:39.399 align:start position:0%
implications um or policy um
 
00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
implementations excuse me and then the
 
00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:44.440 align:start position:0%
uh the Pu would then kind of turn those
 
00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
policies into a rate um so something
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
such as this
 
00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
um the the I guess policy is sort of
 
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
directs the commission to to direct the
 
00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:57.320 align:start position:0%
utilities to do certain things um and
 
00:28:58.509 --> 00:28:58.519 align:start position:0%
the department feels that that might be
 
00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:01.240 align:start position:0%
better suited with with the department
 
00:29:03.509 --> 00:29:03.519 align:start position:0%
and I think to sort of illustrate that
 
00:29:06.269 --> 00:29:06.279 align:start position:0%
example um or to illustrate that is an
 
00:29:09.909 --> 00:29:09.919 align:start position:0%
example of Dees uh the Department of
 
00:29:09.919 --> 00:29:11.149 align:start position:0%
example of Dees uh the Department of
Environmental

00:29:11.149 --> 00:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
Environmental
 
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
Services uh permits the alteration of
 
00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
land for utilities and those rates are
 
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
then recovered um in uh through the Pu
 
00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:20.440 align:start position:0%
in a rate case the the commission does
 
00:29:23.149 --> 00:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
not have any um does not have any
 
00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
involvement in the alteration of land
 
00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:25.880 align:start position:0%
permits or anything like that that that
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
falls squarely on Dees and then the
 
00:29:28.669 --> 00:29:28.679 align:start position:0%
commission turns that into a raid so
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
that's just sort of um illustrates kind
 
00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
of the example that um just wanted to
 
00:29:35.230 --> 00:29:35.240 align:start position:0%
kind of put out there for the committee
 
00:29:37.549 --> 00:29:37.559 align:start position:0%
um and with that happy to answer any
 
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
questions well thank you appreciate that
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
if I understand or understood what you
 
00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:47.240 align:start position:0%
just said on line 27 of the page one of
 
00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:47.909 align:start position:0%
just said on line 27 of the page one of
the

00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:47.919 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:50.269 --> 00:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
bill there is text that says the
 
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
commission shall direct such utilities
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
to develop a plan are you saying that
 
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
that should be the department that
 
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
directs the utility to De develop a plan
 
00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
sure and um and that could that could
 
00:30:05.149 --> 00:30:05.159 align:start position:0%
come in the form of you know by rule by
 
00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
order um similar language like
 
00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:11.919 align:start position:0%
that thank you further questions for Mr
 
00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
Young representative Wendy Thomas thank
 
00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:17.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um and thank you for being
 
00:30:18.909 --> 00:30:18.919 align:start position:0%
here um can you tell me what the
 
00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
department of Energy's position on
 
00:30:23.149 --> 00:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
timing of adoption for Amis or smart
 
00:30:26.269 --> 00:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
meters is so there is the uh integrated
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
resource plan which is um supposed to
 
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
come out I believe five years after the
 
00:30:32.630 --> 00:30:32.640 align:start position:0%
bill became effective um the department
 
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
is setting the schedule for that um I do
 
00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
believe that that'll come out
 
00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
shortly thank
 
00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
you representative Kaplan has a question
 
00:30:44.549 --> 00:30:44.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you uh for
 
00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
coming in today um you mentioned that
 
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
you had some or the department had some
 
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
concerns about cost shifting I I I just
 
00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:52.360 align:start position:0%
wonder if you could uh just go into a
 
00:30:54.389 --> 00:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
little more detail about what that would
 
00:30:57.029 --> 00:30:57.039 align:start position:0%
entail because it seems like the the
 
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
bill does includ some language for the
 
00:31:01.029 --> 00:31:01.039 align:start position:0%
utilities to recoup the the cost of
 
00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
imple of implementing the the change
 
00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:03.870 align:start position:0%
imple of implementing the the change
over

00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:03.880 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
so where does the cost Shift come in
 
00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:08.440 align:start position:0%
sure um so from the Department thank you
 
00:31:09.909 --> 00:31:09.919 align:start position:0%
for the question U from the Department's
 
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
perspective the language of the bill
 
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:14.720 align:start position:0%
does include um you know uh I believe
 
00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:18.760 align:start position:0%
it's page two um line 19 states that the
 
00:31:21.149 --> 00:31:21.159 align:start position:0%
rate design um and skipping ahead may
 
00:31:22.509 --> 00:31:22.519 align:start position:0%
include Provisions for charging the
 
00:31:25.870 --> 00:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
customers requesting such meters um I
 
00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:28.600 align:start position:0%
think that language could be read uh to
 
00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
be almost permissive in nature so it
 
00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:31.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily have to go just to
 
00:31:35.669 --> 00:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
those opting into the um I guess program
 
00:31:37.509 --> 00:31:37.519 align:start position:0%
I'll call it um and there could be some
 
00:31:40.549 --> 00:31:40.559 align:start position:0%
concern that individuals not receiving
 
00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:50.269 --> 00:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
costs thank you representative
 
00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
Harrington has a question yeah referring
 
00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
to page one uh the bottom on lines uh 25
 
00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.710 align:start position:0%
to page one uh the bottom on lines uh 25
through

00:31:59.710 --> 00:31:59.720 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:32:02.549 --> 00:32:02.559 align:start position:0%
29 I'm trying to determine exactly what
 
00:32:04.750 --> 00:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
this says but it seems to be talking
 
00:32:08.549 --> 00:32:08.559 align:start position:0%
about uh having by November 1st
 
00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
2026 uh interval and advanced metering
 
00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
functionality capable of reporting
 
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
hourly consumption or exports to the
 
00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
grid of all and most of their
 
00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
distribution customers for use and load
 
00:32:21.549 --> 00:32:21.559 align:start position:0%
settlements so is this going to be some
 
00:32:25.149 --> 00:32:25.159 align:start position:0%
type of time of you excuse me time of
 
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
you settlement what what how do you
 
00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:29.039 align:start position:0%
interpret that what that going to what's
 
00:32:32.789 --> 00:32:32.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
statement so I probably take that
 
00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:35.960 align:start position:0%
question back and and talk to some
 
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
people at the department on how we would
 
00:32:39.070 --> 00:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily interpret that I know that
 
00:32:41.149 --> 00:32:41.159 align:start position:0%
um a lot of the load settlement issues
 
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
and things time of use are um actually
 
00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:45.480 align:start position:0%
coming up in bills this morning uh but
 
00:32:48.269 --> 00:32:48.279 align:start position:0%
are also parts of ongoing dockets as
 
00:32:50.909 --> 00:32:50.919 align:start position:0%
well um and they're
 
00:32:53.509 --> 00:32:53.519 align:start position:0%
just complicated subjects I guess so I
 
00:32:54.909 --> 00:32:54.919 align:start position:0%
would have to take that back and see how
 
00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
we would interpret that and quick
 
00:32:59.430 --> 00:32:59.440 align:start position:0%
followup quick followup yeah I was just
 
00:33:01.669 --> 00:33:01.679 align:start position:0%
looking at the iso New England uh report
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
of lmps and would you agree that time of
 
00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
use isn't everything that it's not the
 
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
Panacea that some people say because I'm
 
00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
just looking and the price in the last
 
00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
12 hours has varied from around $100 a
 
00:33:15.710 --> 00:33:15.720 align:start position:0%
megawatt hour to over 300 back down back
 
00:33:17.909 --> 00:33:17.919 align:start position:0%
up back down back up so unless someone
 
00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:19.480 align:start position:0%
was sitting there watching it I don't
 
00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:22.120 align:start position:0%
not sure how much great how much value
 
00:33:24.149 --> 00:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
this would
 
00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
be I think I could say there's certainly
 
00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
fluctuations in the market um and how
 
00:33:30.669 --> 00:33:30.679 align:start position:0%
those are captured I guess is a question
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:35.909 --> 00:33:35.919 align:start position:0%
decided Representatives Swanson has a
 
00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair uh and thank
 
00:33:41.549 --> 00:33:41.559 align:start position:0%
you for being here
 
00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:43.919 align:start position:0%
um at the outset you
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned first question you did say
 
00:33:49.909 --> 00:33:49.919 align:start position:0%
that this would be very expensive right
 
00:33:51.549 --> 00:33:51.559 align:start position:0%
that's the Department's understanding
 
00:33:55.029 --> 00:33:55.039 align:start position:0%
yes followup
 
00:33:58.110 --> 00:33:58.120 align:start position:0%
followup the way that I'm gathered ing
 
00:34:00.269 --> 00:34:00.279 align:start position:0%
this is that it's just asking utilities
 
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
for a
 
00:34:04.509 --> 00:34:04.519 align:start position:0%
plan about doing something that they
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
would end up being doing anyway so
 
00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:09.919 align:start position:0%
somebody would have to foot the bill
 
00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
ultimately or this would these are
 
00:34:15.109 --> 00:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
things that would never be implemented
 
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
if we didn't have direction to do
 
00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:20.720 align:start position:0%
it so back to the the question is
 
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't they be doing this anyway and
 
00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:28.589 --> 00:34:28.599 align:start position:0%
it I I I think I would direct that
 
00:34:30.669 --> 00:34:30.679 align:start position:0%
question to the utilities on on how they
 
00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
would operate thank
 
00:34:35.109 --> 00:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
you all right seeing no further
 
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
questions no you can't ask a question
 
00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
don't you're not supposed to sorry all
 
00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
right thank you Mr Young we'll move
 
00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
along and I'll ask the honorable Chris
 
00:34:50.589 --> 00:34:50.599 align:start position:0%
Clifton Belo to come and talk to us to
 
00:34:55.950 --> 00:34:55.960 align:start position:0%
give the CP cnh perspective on this
 
00:34:58.910 --> 00:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
legislation good morning Mr Belo nice to
 
00:35:06.670 --> 00:35:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
again you turn on the mic please sorry
 
00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:13.320 align:start position:0%
uh back in 2005 uh the Congress passed
 
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
the energy Policy Act of 2005 um which
 
00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
set forth a number of policies that they
 
00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
asked uh state legislatures to consider
 
00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
adopting and one of those was Advanced
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
metering functionality and time-based
 
00:35:27.119 --> 00:35:28.349 align:start position:0%
metering functionality and time-based
rates

00:35:28.349 --> 00:35:28.359 align:start position:0%
rates
 
00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
and the Pu undertook an investigation
 
00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:33.400 align:start position:0%
and then in judic proceeding to to
 
00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
consider that at the time um eversource
 
00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
had old mechanical meters that you had
 
00:35:40.589 --> 00:35:40.599 align:start position:0%
to walk up to to read so they had a
 
00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:42.680 align:start position:0%
large Workforce of people would go to
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
every month and read the Meers
 
00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:49.400 align:start position:0%
essentially manually um and um the the
 
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
commission concluded at that time that
 
00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
we should uh move towards Ami uh and
 
00:35:58.670 --> 00:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
essentially directed the utilities and
 
00:36:03.069 --> 00:36:03.079 align:start position:0%
the staff to um uh consider in a future
 
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
proceeding um exactly how to do that and
 
00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:09.240 align:start position:0%
when to do that um around 2014
 
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
eversource decided just to install AMR
 
00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
meters which is just when you Dr you can
 
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
drive by and collect the data but it
 
00:36:17.829 --> 00:36:17.839 align:start position:0%
didn't have the advanced uh
 
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
functionality of Ami um and and so those
 
00:36:23.349 --> 00:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
meters have about a 20-year life and
 
00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:25.640 align:start position:0%
they're being uh depreciated over 18
 
00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
years um so uh
 
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
in their last um docket uh for a
 
00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
distribution rate case um this was an
 
00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:38.680 align:start position:0%
issue as to whether it had been prudent
 
00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:41.720 align:start position:0%
of them to invest in the AMR instead of
 
00:36:43.829 --> 00:36:43.839 align:start position:0%
the Ami that the commission had said
 
00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
they should should consider um and as
 
00:36:49.309 --> 00:36:49.319 align:start position:0%
part of that uh uh case um there was a
 
00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
settlement uh in which um eversource
 
00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:55.240 align:start position:0%
agreed uh to evaluate um this
 
00:36:58.309 --> 00:36:58.319 align:start position:0%
possibility of um Ami
 
00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
and specifically uh the settlement
 
00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
called for uh them to consider uh doing
 
00:37:06.589 --> 00:37:06.599 align:start position:0%
this both on a full replacement or a
 
00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:09.599 align:start position:0%
partial opend meter deplacement uh uh
 
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
replacement and uh considering using
 
00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
existing Telecom networks for um uh
 
00:37:20.109 --> 00:37:20.119 align:start position:0%
opt-in option um and so they did do a uh
 
00:37:22.510 --> 00:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
feasibility study but it did not look at
 
00:37:24.829 --> 00:37:24.839 align:start position:0%
the option of doing this incrementally
 
00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:26.440 align:start position:0%
it just sort of was an All or Nothing
 
00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
proposal and they they looked at a
 
00:37:29.829 --> 00:37:29.839 align:start position:0%
couple scenarios what's the fastest we
 
00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:31.880 align:start position:0%
could do it and what's a more optimal
 
00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:35.240 align:start position:0%
time frame for doing it the fastest uh
 
00:37:39.910 --> 00:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
would have um Ami uh starting uh this
 
00:37:42.309 --> 00:37:42.319 align:start position:0%
year uh you know basically in terms of
 
00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
planning uh and uh completing by 2028
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
this was sort of suboptimal uh because
 
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
they still have a whole bunch of meters
 
00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:51.160 align:start position:0%
that they haven't depreciated that are
 
00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:53.480 align:start position:0%
on their books so they said an optimized
 
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
scenario would be to wait until we're
 
00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
reaching the end of the life so
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
um around 2033 in about 8 years is when
 
00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
they'd actually be putting uh Ami in
 
00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
place um uh to uh with the intent to
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
replace all these 20 year old meters uh
 
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
by 2034 and a couple years thereafter so
 
00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:16.200 align:start position:0%
that that's a little bit more than five
 
00:38:17.829 --> 00:38:17.839 align:start position:0%
years out that's more like seven eight
 
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
nine years out um the cost of that um
 
00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
they estimated up around $400 million
 
00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
and it's and because the approach they
 
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
would use is What's called the itron Gen
 
00:38:31.829 --> 00:38:31.839 align:start position:0%
5 Network which is a complete buildout
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
of a mesh network with a communication
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
system in which and they're started this
 
00:38:37.589 --> 00:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts and they're moving
 
00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
across the state and building out this
 
00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
mesh network with replacing all meters
 
00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
and building in a whole new
 
00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:45.160 align:start position:0%
communication system and a whole lot of
 
00:38:46.589 --> 00:38:46.599 align:start position:0%
other Investments that's where it gets
 
00:38:50.069 --> 00:38:50.079 align:start position:0%
to4 m00 million in the last um
 
00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
distribution rate I'm sorry the last net
 
00:38:54.069 --> 00:38:54.079 align:start position:0%
metering case in
 
00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
2016 um I intervened on behalf of the
 
00:38:58.710 --> 00:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
city of Lebanon and and we proposed uh
 
00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:01.640 align:start position:0%
that there' be a time time a pilot of
 
00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:05.240 align:start position:0%
time of use uh uh time varying rates uh
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
for net metering um that customers could
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
both buy and sell at uh real-time prices
 
00:39:14.109 --> 00:39:14.119 align:start position:0%
for instance and um Liberty agreed to
 
00:39:16.349 --> 00:39:16.359 align:start position:0%
collaborate with us on that and the Pu
 
00:39:18.069 --> 00:39:18.079 align:start position:0%
um said yeah this would be cool to do
 
00:39:20.829 --> 00:39:20.839 align:start position:0%
this time-based net metering rate um
 
00:39:23.109 --> 00:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
which you both buy and sell at at these
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
uh real-time prices and um so we
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
collaborated with Liberty and we put out
 
00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:31.160 align:start position:0%
a joint request for information to see
 
00:39:33.150 --> 00:39:33.160 align:start position:0%
if there's a way because they don't have
 
00:39:36.829 --> 00:39:36.839 align:start position:0%
Ami to put in interval meters uh at a at
 
00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
a small volume like a 100 or 200
 
00:39:42.309 --> 00:39:42.319 align:start position:0%
interval meters itron responded and said
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
yes we can do that we have a solution
 
00:39:48.069 --> 00:39:48.079 align:start position:0%
for that which is a complete soft uh
 
00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
software as a service cloud-based uh
 
00:39:52.910 --> 00:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
data collection system it can work with
 
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
cellular meters and we can do it
 
00:39:56.870 --> 00:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
incrementally and it's a subscription
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
you only have to pay per meter so we
 
00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:00.680 align:start position:0%
asked oh well how much might this cost
 
00:40:02.109 --> 00:40:02.119 align:start position:0%
because we wanted to get an idea of what
 
00:40:03.790 --> 00:40:03.800 align:start position:0%
it would cost to integrate into their
 
00:40:06.589 --> 00:40:06.599 align:start position:0%
existing Billing System and subscribed
 
00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
to the software and they said well
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
interesting you should ask normally we
 
00:40:12.270 --> 00:40:12.280 align:start position:0%
would not give that information out
 
00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
because it's kind of competitively
 
00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
sensitive but they said the town of
 
00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
middle uh burrow Massachusetts has just
 
00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
recently posted has selected itron to
 
00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
convert all their electric and gas
 
00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
meters to Ami and they posted on their
 
00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:29.800 align:start position:0%
website it our complete proposal so it's
 
00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
publicly available so I went at the
 
00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
suggestion of the itron sales
 
00:40:36.109 --> 00:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
represented and downloaded what is
 
00:40:38.349 --> 00:40:38.359 align:start position:0%
marked as a confidential and proprietary
 
00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:42.040 align:start position:0%
document um we you know ever source is
 
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
saying we take hundreds of millions of
 
00:40:46.109 --> 00:40:46.119 align:start position:0%
dollars this is at the most in the
 
00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands actually tens of
 
00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
thousands and it shows exactly what the
 
00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
software is a service which they say is
 
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
a comprehensive so the utility doesn't
 
00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
even have to add personnel or make any
 
00:41:00.309 --> 00:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
investment uh to take advantage of this
 
00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:02.079 align:start position:0%
there is an integration with billing
 
00:41:04.349 --> 00:41:04.359 align:start position:0%
systems but they've said they you know
 
00:41:06.109 --> 00:41:06.119 align:start position:0%
they've done that a lot over a lot of
 
00:41:08.349 --> 00:41:08.359 align:start position:0%
systems and and they point out it could
 
00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
take 10 weeks not years to implement
 
00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:13.880 align:start position:0%
this solution the cost for the
 
00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
cloud-based service per meter $3 a year
 
00:41:20.349 --> 00:41:20.359 align:start position:0%
on a 5-year contract um for fair fairly
 
00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
small number of meters so that is what
 
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
this bill contemplates trying to enable
 
00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
and to seriously consider um uh you know
 
00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
I can probably probably stop there I I
 
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
would just point out that um they do um
 
00:41:37.710 --> 00:41:37.720 align:start position:0%
eversource does invest in buy a certain
 
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
number of new meters every year in 2023
 
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
the test year for their distribution
 
00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
rate case they bought uh almost 13,000
 
00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
meters uh 8,000 of which were actually
 
00:41:50.109 --> 00:41:50.119 align:start position:0%
deployed otherwise their study said they
 
00:41:52.109 --> 00:41:52.119 align:start position:0%
also said about 1% a year they almost
 
00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
have 600,000 meters so 5 6,000 meters a
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
year is what they're purchasing
 
00:41:59.829 --> 00:41:59.839 align:start position:0%
purchased today they have a 20-year life
 
00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
18-year depreciation if they convert in
 
00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
2033 or 2035 you've still got half the
 
00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:10.160 align:start position:0%
depreciation on that what was for 2023 a
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
$35 million investment so you we
 
00:42:14.190 --> 00:42:14.200 align:start position:0%
potentially end up with millions of
 
00:42:16.829 --> 00:42:16.839 align:start position:0%
dollars in stranded cost when they do
 
00:42:20.309 --> 00:42:20.319 align:start position:0%
finally convert to Ami say in in the mid
 
00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
2030s um so this is a way to avoid that
 
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
uh potential loss of value and I believe
 
00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
they actually pointed this out in
 
00:42:30.069 --> 00:42:30.079 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and said maybe we should
 
00:42:31.589 --> 00:42:31.599 align:start position:0%
start putting the kind of meters that
 
00:42:33.589 --> 00:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
will be compatible with what we're
 
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
planning in the future instead of buying
 
00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:38.480 align:start position:0%
more Legacy metors that are going to be
 
00:42:41.549 --> 00:42:41.559 align:start position:0%
uh uh not fully depreciated when when we
 
00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
convert over and we'll have some
 
00:42:44.589 --> 00:42:44.599 align:start position:0%
stranded cost so that that's sort of the
 
00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:47.240 align:start position:0%
motivation here uh the idea doing this
 
00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:49.880 align:start position:0%
incrementally came from the Pu staff out
 
00:42:52.589 --> 00:42:52.599 align:start position:0%
of the grid modernization investigation
 
00:42:56.069 --> 00:42:56.079 align:start position:0%
and said why not do it this way and my
 
00:42:58.750 --> 00:42:58.760 align:start position:0%
final point is this set a light bulb off
 
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
in Liberty's mind which they said oh we
 
00:43:02.910 --> 00:43:02.920 align:start position:0%
could actually do a three-part time of
 
00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
use rate which ISO New England actually
 
00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:07.880 align:start position:0%
recommended back in the early 2000s that
 
00:43:10.190 --> 00:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
that the state should move towards uh
 
00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:11.800 align:start position:0%
for their battery pilot and they now
 
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
offer it for uh EV charging um and uh
 
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
opening it up to some other uses and
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
they're doing it with these cellular
 
00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
meters that they at a fairly low cost
 
00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
integrated into their existing Billing
 
00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
System um and in terms so we're the
 
00:43:29.870 --> 00:43:29.880 align:start position:0%
community power Coalition is very
 
00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
interested in offering our customers
 
00:43:35.069 --> 00:43:35.079 align:start position:0%
these expanded rate options like large
 
00:43:36.990 --> 00:43:37.000 align:start position:0%
commercial users have because they have
 
00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
interval metering and when you have
 
00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
interval metering you can actually
 
00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
settle the load based on the load shape
 
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
and so if you help the customer improve
 
00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:46.760 align:start position:0%
their load shape or shave their Peak you
 
00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
can actually realize that value for the
 
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
customer and this is what we're trying
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
to bring uh and expand and not be in a
 
00:43:56.549 --> 00:43:56.559 align:start position:0%
situation when they get to convert and
 
00:43:58.109 --> 00:43:58.119 align:start position:0%
they say well now we have a bunch of
 
00:43:59.549 --> 00:43:59.559 align:start position:0%
replacement meters that we haven't
 
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
depreciated so somebody's got to pay for
 
00:44:06.109 --> 00:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
that thank you okay thank you for your
 
00:44:08.309 --> 00:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
testimony questions for Mr Belo
 
00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
representative Bary thank you chairman
 
00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:13.160 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
00:44:15.510 --> 00:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
so I don't know very much about these uh
 
00:44:17.069 --> 00:44:17.079 align:start position:0%
the the technologies that are in some of
 
00:44:19.549 --> 00:44:19.559 align:start position:0%
these Ami meters but you mentioned that
 
00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
um eversource is rolling out meters with
 
00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
a mesh Network yes and I'm assuming
 
00:44:26.549 --> 00:44:26.559 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that's not the same thing
 
00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
as a a regular cellular meter and so my
 
00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
question would be um those are different
 
00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
kinds of meters or at least if they have
 
00:44:37.950 --> 00:44:37.960 align:start position:0%
a planed to roll out mesh Network meters
 
00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
and we're saying go ahead and do
 
00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:41.720 align:start position:0%
cellular meters then those cellular
 
00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:43.160 align:start position:0%
meters wouldn't work on the mesh Network
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
so no no that the the itron uh
 
00:44:48.549 --> 00:44:48.559 align:start position:0%
specifically says they have meters uh
 
00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
that are designed specifically for this
 
00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
purpose so that you can start with them
 
00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
with more like with a cellular system
 
00:44:58.510 --> 00:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
and then convert to the mesh Network and
 
00:45:00.309 --> 00:45:00.319 align:start position:0%
they have that option built right into
 
00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
the meter you can just switch once you
 
00:45:04.270 --> 00:45:04.280 align:start position:0%
deploy your mesh Network you can take
 
00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
the cellular little card out of it if
 
00:45:10.589 --> 00:45:10.599 align:start position:0%
you want to and have the uh RF radio
 
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
frequency one that talks to other meters
 
00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:15.160 align:start position:0%
they have meters that are designed to be
 
00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:18.920 align:start position:0%
forward compatible uh to uh this kind of
 
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
system that ever source is going to in
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
massachusett so just follow up yes
 
00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
follow up so the these meters are these
 
00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
are the meters that they're rolling out
 
00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:31.400 align:start position:0%
in in Massachusetts that work like that
 
00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
or is this a different kind of meter
 
00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about no they're
 
00:45:36.670 --> 00:45:36.680 align:start position:0%
using R they're doing the mesh Network
 
00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
ones and and they're geographically
 
00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
saturating the conversion because the
 
00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
meters they rely on the meters talking
 
00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:45.800 align:start position:0%
to each other
 
00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:48.680 align:start position:0%
um the the
 
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
yes related to that though is is the
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
cost question the cost is not
 
00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily that high with cellular we
 
00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
we asked in a discovery if they had
 
00:45:59.230 --> 00:45:59.240 align:start position:0%
considered this approach and they
 
00:46:01.589 --> 00:46:01.599 align:start position:0%
basically said no because cellular costs
 
00:46:03.549 --> 00:46:03.559 align:start position:0%
more than a mesh Network well that would
 
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
be true for um half a million meters um
 
00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:09.160 align:start position:0%
but if you're dealing with a few
 
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
thousand and you're having the customer
 
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
or their supplier pay for the cellular
 
00:46:17.589 --> 00:46:17.599 align:start position:0%
service um then it can be done uh at a
 
00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
fairly low cost and and just to
 
00:46:22.829 --> 00:46:22.839 align:start position:0%
illustrate that the city has uh over 700
 
00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
street lights with a communicating meter
 
00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
uh this two-way directional reports
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
every hour the data and the data service
 
00:46:34.990 --> 00:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
for those per meter are 40 bucks for 10
 
00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
years so that's four bucks a year for
 
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
data service um and includes an extended
 
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
warranty on the control node itself uh
 
00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:46.640 align:start position:0%
for that 10-year
 
00:46:49.150 --> 00:46:49.160 align:start position:0%
period okay thank you I have a question
 
00:46:52.349 --> 00:46:52.359 align:start position:0%
about the bill itself on page two if you
 
00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
I'm curious to know why does the bill
 
00:47:02.309 --> 00:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
require that the priority for these
 
00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:05.599 align:start position:0%
meters be given to limited producers and
 
00:47:05.599 --> 00:47:07.030 align:start position:0%
meters be given to limited producers and
customer

00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
customer
 
00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
generators over everyone
 
00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
else that would seem to favor deers and
 
00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:15.640 align:start position:0%
aggregators over everybody else is that
 
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
the intent here or what exactly is the
 
00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:20.680 align:start position:0%
purpose of that those lines the the
 
00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
Commission in the current net metering
 
00:47:25.109 --> 00:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
proceeding has expressed a strong
 
00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:27.800 align:start position:0%
interest in uh
 
00:47:30.750 --> 00:47:30.760 align:start position:0%
trying to create time varying options in
 
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
conjunction with net metering uh so that
 
00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
right now net metering basically says
 
00:47:36.950 --> 00:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
all kilowatt hours are equal in value
 
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
and that's not really true there you
 
00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:42.200 align:start position:0%
know the price changes every hour day
 
00:47:45.309 --> 00:47:45.319 align:start position:0%
ahead every five minutes real time and
 
00:47:50.190 --> 00:47:50.200 align:start position:0%
um uh so you know part of the issue I
 
00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
mean that doesn't probably need to be
 
00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
there but the idea is that these are
 
00:47:57.870 --> 00:47:57.880 align:start position:0%
potentially uh uh systems that Import
 
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
and Export um with customer generators
 
00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:04.960 align:start position:0%
or limited producers and uh that seems
 
00:48:07.589 --> 00:48:07.599 align:start position:0%
to be a place at least from the
 
00:48:09.069 --> 00:48:09.079 align:start position:0%
commission and I I would say also the
 
00:48:12.109 --> 00:48:12.119 align:start position:0%
doe the Doe's major recommendation in
 
00:48:13.549 --> 00:48:13.559 align:start position:0%
the current net metering docket was that
 
00:48:16.109 --> 00:48:16.119 align:start position:0%
we need to move to time of use rates or
 
00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
three-part time of use rates for net
 
00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
metering instead of saying all kilowatt
 
00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
hours are equal in
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
value okay thank you additional
 
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
questions representative Harrington
 
00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taken my
 
00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:30.040 align:start position:0%
question so let me see if I've got this
 
00:48:32.430 --> 00:48:32.440 align:start position:0%
just the nutshell version of this it
 
00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:34.280 align:start position:0%
seems what you're saying is a couple of
 
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
things one we continually replace meters
 
00:48:38.470 --> 00:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
as they need to be replaced because they
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
get old two eventually in I guess five
 
00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:43.000 align:start position:0%
years we're going to be going to a
 
00:48:45.309 --> 00:48:45.319 align:start position:0%
system that uh will have advanced
 
00:48:47.549 --> 00:48:47.559 align:start position:0%
metering and time of use metering
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
installed so we're starting now or with
 
00:48:52.789 --> 00:48:52.799 align:start position:0%
the enaction of this bill we should
 
00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
start replacing meters with the advanced
 
00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
meters because in 5 years we're going to
 
00:48:58.990 --> 00:48:59.000 align:start position:0%
have to replace them again if we don't
 
00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
is that the nutshell of the bill uh yes
 
00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:04.280 align:start position:0%
except except I think in their optimal
 
00:49:06.349 --> 00:49:06.359 align:start position:0%
scenario it's more like eight years and
 
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
and and there's no commitment to that
 
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
quite yet okay all right thank you
 
00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:13.839 align:start position:0%
additional questions representative
 
00:49:16.109 --> 00:49:16.119 align:start position:0%
Kaplan thank you thank you Mr chair and
 
00:49:18.270 --> 00:49:18.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Bel for coming in um I'm
 
00:49:19.710 --> 00:49:19.720 align:start position:0%
interested in the difference between the
 
00:49:22.069 --> 00:49:22.079 align:start position:0%
cost estimation for the replacement that
 
00:49:24.109 --> 00:49:24.119 align:start position:0%
uh that the uh utilities came up with in
 
00:49:26.069 --> 00:49:26.079 align:start position:0%
that docket that you mentioned versus
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:49:29.109 --> 00:49:29.119 align:start position:0%
uh you know what you're talking about
 
00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:30.680 align:start position:0%
the cloud-based service and how much
 
00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's going to cost so there seems to
 
00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
be a difference there and uh so that
 
00:49:38.109 --> 00:49:38.119 align:start position:0%
brings me to my question about the cost
 
00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
shifting concern that the department of
 
00:49:43.230 --> 00:49:43.240 align:start position:0%
energy raised how would you respond to
 
00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:46.040 align:start position:0%
that cost shifting concern given the
 
00:49:48.789 --> 00:49:48.799 align:start position:0%
lower implementation cost that you're
 
00:49:50.910 --> 00:49:50.920 align:start position:0%
describing um
 
00:49:54.789 --> 00:49:54.799 align:start position:0%
what I mean to do the mesh Network
 
00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
approach um
 
00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:01.240 align:start position:0%
you know their own uh estimates uh the
 
00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
AMA the Ami Network and communication
 
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
that's like $200 million the other 200
 
00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:09.680 align:start position:0%
million is for other it upgrades and
 
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
other uh new systems to take advantage
 
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
of some of the
 
00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
functionality none of that really needs
 
00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:18.040 align:start position:0%
to be incurred uh to do this sort of
 
00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
itron cloud-based option
 
00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
um they there it would be a cost to
 
00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
integrate the data into um either their
 
00:50:30.190 --> 00:50:30.200 align:start position:0%
their customer Billing System and and uh
 
00:50:32.069 --> 00:50:32.079 align:start position:0%
load settlement system uh but they
 
00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:34.280 align:start position:0%
already have the means to do that with
 
00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
interval data for the large customers
 
00:50:39.870 --> 00:50:39.880 align:start position:0%
so yeah there would be a cost there but
 
00:50:41.950 --> 00:50:41.960 align:start position:0%
itron at least in their Middleboro Mass
 
00:50:43.950 --> 00:50:43.960 align:start position:0%
proposal says they've done this all over
 
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
the world um and with this and they do
 
00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:49.480 align:start position:0%
it particularly for small utilities like
 
00:50:51.549 --> 00:50:51.559 align:start position:0%
Municipal Utilities or Co-op that may
 
00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
only have uh 5 or 10,000 customers and
 
00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
can't afford to make a big investment so
 
00:50:59.950 --> 00:50:59.960 align:start position:0%
they they they say well let's we we can
 
00:51:01.549 --> 00:51:01.559 align:start position:0%
do most of that work for you we can help
 
00:51:04.109 --> 00:51:04.119 align:start position:0%
you integrate it and we're experienced
 
00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:07.720 align:start position:0%
with that so let's explore that
 
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
possibility followup so so you mentioned
 
00:51:13.069 --> 00:51:13.079 align:start position:0%
that there might still be a minimal cost
 
00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:15.400 align:start position:0%
shifting uh would you agree that that
 
00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
would be outweighed by uh the benefit of
 
00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
opening up the market to to more
 
00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
competition that this would allow um I I
 
00:51:24.829 --> 00:51:24.839 align:start position:0%
think that's highly likely and and
 
00:51:26.670 --> 00:51:26.680 align:start position:0%
there's going to be you know if they
 
00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
keep investing in Legacy meters up until
 
00:51:32.109 --> 00:51:32.119 align:start position:0%
the time that they convert there's also
 
00:51:34.789 --> 00:51:34.799 align:start position:0%
going to be a bunch of cost shifting
 
00:51:38.549 --> 00:51:38.559 align:start position:0%
probably from them to rate payers for
 
00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:45.589 --> 00:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
useful representative partiel has a
 
00:51:47.470 --> 00:51:47.480 align:start position:0%
question thank you chair and thank you
 
00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
for being here today Mr Bel uh by
 
00:51:53.829 --> 00:51:53.839 align:start position:0%
reducing um the peak load I'm going back
 
00:51:55.549 --> 00:51:55.559 align:start position:0%
to a question that was asked earlier on
 
00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
page two line four
 
00:52:00.390 --> 00:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
um by reducing Peak load it will benefit
 
00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:01.270 align:start position:0%
um by reducing Peak load it will benefit
all

00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:52:05.230 --> 00:52:05.240 align:start position:0%
consumers and so uh what putting the uh
 
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
availability of time of use meters into
 
00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
the hands of those who can most
 
00:52:12.549 --> 00:52:12.559 align:start position:0%
effectively impact that have a benefit
 
00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:13.480 align:start position:0%
to all
 
00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
consumers um well well yes I I I think
 
00:52:20.190 --> 00:52:20.200 align:start position:0%
that um the idea of having the supplier
 
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
of the customer pay the incremental cost
 
00:52:24.549 --> 00:52:24.559 align:start position:0%
for the more expensive meter and then
 
00:52:27.309 --> 00:52:27.319 align:start position:0%
pay for uh the subscriptions service to
 
00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
support that um the customers or their
 
00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
suppliers only going to want to do that
 
00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
if they think they can produce value
 
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
which might be just ways of helping
 
00:52:38.990 --> 00:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
control flexible demand that are
 
00:52:42.589 --> 00:52:42.599 align:start position:0%
automated like uh outside of the areas
 
00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
that have gas in New Hampshire there are
 
00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of storage hot water heaters and
 
00:52:49.789 --> 00:52:49.799 align:start position:0%
they sto they store so you can there's
 
00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:53.240 align:start position:0%
inexpensive devices uh that you can use
 
00:52:55.470 --> 00:52:55.480 align:start position:0%
to control them so that they store up
 
00:52:58.710 --> 00:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
heat for the peak after late afternoon
 
00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
early evening hours and and you can help
 
00:53:05.470 --> 00:53:05.480 align:start position:0%
shave the peak that way uh and so it and
 
00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
around the world many many use uh
 
00:53:10.870 --> 00:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
applications have been found and and
 
00:53:13.309 --> 00:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
they're very it's helped support a
 
00:53:17.309 --> 00:53:17.319 align:start position:0%
flexible load Market that's able to um
 
00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:19.480 align:start position:0%
help shave those high price periods and
 
00:53:21.630 --> 00:53:21.640 align:start position:0%
Peaks and and produce sort of value for
 
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
everyone thank
 
00:53:26.630 --> 00:53:26.640 align:start position:0%
you okay seeing no further questions I
 
00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
want to thank you Mr below for being
 
00:53:30.789 --> 00:53:30.799 align:start position:0%
here and give the last word on this
 
00:53:33.069 --> 00:53:33.079 align:start position:0%
legislation to Michael Lata of
 
00:53:36.109 --> 00:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
eversource and any of the documents I've
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
have I'd be happy to share I just didn't
 
00:53:39.150 --> 00:53:39.160 align:start position:0%
want to burden you with a lot of paper
 
00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
today thank you we appreciate that
 
00:53:47.390 --> 00:53:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:50.549 --> 00:53:50.559 align:start position:0%
Lata good morning uh Michael Lata
 
00:53:52.109 --> 00:53:52.119 align:start position:0%
representing eversource energy
 
00:53:54.190 --> 00:53:54.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to testify
 
00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
before you today also appreciate
 
00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
um the bill sponsors intent with this
 
00:54:04.109 --> 00:54:04.119 align:start position:0%
legislation and her focus on um
 
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
progressing technological advantage
 
00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
advances and grid modernization uh we've
 
00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
had a number of conversations uh uh and
 
00:54:15.990 --> 00:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh certainly we I understand uh where
 
00:54:18.430 --> 00:54:18.440 align:start position:0%
she's coming from and her goals uh
 
00:54:20.910 --> 00:54:20.920 align:start position:0%
however um we are opposed to the
 
00:54:24.990 --> 00:54:25.000 align:start position:0%
legislation um before you today um I I
 
00:54:28.549 --> 00:54:28.559 align:start position:0%
think there seems to be a little
 
00:54:33.829 --> 00:54:33.839 align:start position:0%
oversimplification of an Ami uh Network
 
00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
and the different components of that and
 
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
what is required to enable functionality
 
00:54:42.270 --> 00:54:42.280 align:start position:0%
uh the meter itself obviously is very
 
00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
important component but is just one
 
00:54:48.510 --> 00:54:48.520 align:start position:0%
component of an overall meter system uh
 
00:54:51.710 --> 00:54:51.720 align:start position:0%
Ami Network system uh first you have the
 
00:54:53.829 --> 00:54:53.839 align:start position:0%
meter you have the communications
 
00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:56.799 align:start position:0%
Network that uh Mr buo talked about you
 
00:54:59.789 --> 00:54:59.799 align:start position:0%
then have to have a collection Point uh
 
00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:01.960 align:start position:0%
known as a headend or a meter data
 
00:55:04.789 --> 00:55:04.799 align:start position:0%
management system to collect those large
 
00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
large volumes of data so compared to uh
 
00:55:11.549 --> 00:55:11.559 align:start position:0%
the uh system that we have in place
 
00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
today where you're doing sort of monthly
 
00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:15.880 align:start position:0%
Drive buys interrogating the meter
 
00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:18.520 align:start position:0%
downloading the data um here you're
 
00:55:21.470 --> 00:55:21.480 align:start position:0%
talking about a much much much larger
 
00:55:24.670 --> 00:55:24.680 align:start position:0%
volume of of information and then
 
00:55:26.829 --> 00:55:26.839 align:start position:0%
perhaps most important importantly and
 
00:55:29.230 --> 00:55:29.240 align:start position:0%
critically you then need a customer
 
00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:32.200 align:start position:0%
information system and a billing system
 
00:55:34.589 --> 00:55:34.599 align:start position:0%
that can accept that information those
 
00:55:36.789 --> 00:55:36.799 align:start position:0%
large volumes of information interpret
 
00:55:39.109 --> 00:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
it and actually be able to generate
 
00:55:43.710 --> 00:55:43.720 align:start position:0%
customer bills based upon that um as has
 
00:55:46.069 --> 00:55:46.079 align:start position:0%
been discussed uh as part of a
 
00:55:49.150 --> 00:55:49.160 align:start position:0%
settlement in our 2019 rate case
 
00:55:52.109 --> 00:55:52.119 align:start position:0%
eversource hired a third party uh West
 
00:55:56.589 --> 00:55:56.599 align:start position:0%
Monroe uh to do a what was termed an AMF
 
00:55:59.789 --> 00:55:59.799 align:start position:0%
Ami uh feasibility study uh what it
 
00:56:03.549 --> 00:56:03.559 align:start position:0%
really was is a cost benefit analysis of
 
00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:06.760 align:start position:0%
the cost of of various scenarios of
 
00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
installation of the entire uh structure
 
00:56:13.589 --> 00:56:13.599 align:start position:0%
that I I spoke about and the benefits of
 
00:56:17.789 --> 00:56:17.799 align:start position:0%
it and what that study found was uh the
 
00:56:20.990 --> 00:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
planning and timing of this uh roll out
 
00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
is is very very important uh costs to
 
00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
customers ranged from $400 $73 million
 
00:56:32.789 --> 00:56:32.799 align:start position:0%
to $394 million benefits ranged from
 
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
$364 million to $315 million so a lot of
 
00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
variability as you can see extremely
 
00:56:44.549 --> 00:56:44.559 align:start position:0%
large numbers uh this is is not
 
00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:48.640 align:start position:0%
inexpensive and again one of the reasons
 
00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
for that is eversource currently uh in
 
00:56:55.789 --> 00:56:55.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has a number of of older
 
00:56:55.799 --> 00:56:56.870 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has a number of of older
Legacy

00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
Legacy
 
00:57:00.390 --> 00:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
systems uh they function well they
 
00:57:03.150 --> 00:57:03.160 align:start position:0%
accurately take customer information we
 
00:57:05.589 --> 00:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
accurately build customer information
 
00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:08.720 align:start position:0%
but virtually all of those systems would
 
00:57:11.910 --> 00:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
require replacement uh and in the future
 
00:57:14.190 --> 00:57:14.200 align:start position:0%
will require replacement as they reach
 
00:57:18.029 --> 00:57:18.039 align:start position:0%
end of life in order to enable Advanced
 
00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
meter functionality and so that is why
 
00:57:24.309 --> 00:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
you see the large price tag associated
 
00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:28.640 align:start position:0%
with the am uh Ami conversion so simply
 
00:57:31.789 --> 00:57:31.799 align:start position:0%
having an Ami meter Simply Having a
 
00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
cellular network does not enable uh the
 
00:57:37.390 --> 00:57:37.400 align:start position:0%
current structure that we have the
 
00:57:41.109 --> 00:57:41.119 align:start position:0%
current billing systems to accurately uh
 
00:57:44.309 --> 00:57:44.319 align:start position:0%
generate customer bills uh that is is
 
00:57:46.829 --> 00:57:46.839 align:start position:0%
just an unfortunately an incorrect
 
00:57:48.829 --> 00:57:48.839 align:start position:0%
statement that our current systems could
 
00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
accommodate that uh and each utility has
 
00:57:54.349 --> 00:57:54.359 align:start position:0%
their own systems each utility is uh in
 
00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
a different place with with converion
 
00:57:59.829 --> 00:57:59.839 align:start position:0%
other utilities have been mentioned here
 
00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh some of them have recently gone
 
00:58:03.710 --> 00:58:03.720 align:start position:0%
through customer information and Billing
 
00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
System conversions to newer uh more more
 
00:58:10.950 --> 00:58:10.960 align:start position:0%
current uh applications uh eversource in
 
00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:13.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire simply is not not in that
 
00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:16.720 align:start position:0%
place today and one of the reasons uh
 
00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
and this was discussed in our Ray case
 
00:58:21.870 --> 00:58:21.880 align:start position:0%
we did not push ahead uh is because of
 
00:58:24.430 --> 00:58:24.440 align:start position:0%
of the necessity to optimize for the
 
00:58:27.670 --> 00:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
benefit of our customers to reduce costs
 
00:58:31.470 --> 00:58:31.480 align:start position:0%
as well as a recognition that customers
 
00:58:33.309 --> 00:58:33.319 align:start position:0%
with very large storms that we've
 
00:58:36.789 --> 00:58:36.799 align:start position:0%
incurred uh inflationary pressures are
 
00:58:38.829 --> 00:58:38.839 align:start position:0%
uh facing significant cost increases
 
00:58:40.510 --> 00:58:40.520 align:start position:0%
through our rate case so we try to be
 
00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
sensitive to not overloading uh our
 
00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
customers with with costs um I would
 
00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
note uh eversource in Connecticut does
 
00:58:52.430 --> 00:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
not have Ami metering uh we have
 
00:58:56.349 --> 00:58:56.359 align:start position:0%
submitted uh plans and information to uh
 
00:58:58.910 --> 00:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
uh the their version of the Public
 
00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:00.960 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission uh those have not
 
00:59:04.190 --> 00:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
been approved uh we only within the past
 
00:59:06.510 --> 00:59:06.520 align:start position:0%
uh year or two got approval in
 
00:59:09.390 --> 00:59:09.400 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and that was part again as
 
00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
a multi-year conversion changing out
 
00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
back office systems changing out billing
 
00:59:16.829 --> 00:59:16.839 align:start position:0%
systems building out that mesh Network
 
00:59:18.990 --> 00:59:19.000 align:start position:0%
so uh unfortunately what the bill would
 
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
propose on an optin basis is it would
 
00:59:25.470 --> 00:59:25.480 align:start position:0%
require the utility to essentially uh
 
00:59:28.029 --> 00:59:28.039 align:start position:0%
offer me ERS that would not have have
 
00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
really the basic functionality that we
 
00:59:33.150 --> 00:59:33.160 align:start position:0%
need in order to to Bill our customers
 
00:59:35.109 --> 00:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
accurately and it certainly would not
 
00:59:37.549 --> 00:59:37.559 align:start position:0%
enable the advanced functionality that
 
00:59:40.029 --> 00:59:40.039 align:start position:0%
Ami meters uh allow
 
00:59:43.589 --> 00:59:43.599 align:start position:0%
for with that uh I'd be happy to answer
 
00:59:46.109 --> 00:59:46.119 align:start position:0%
questions that I can well thank you we
 
00:59:48.789 --> 00:59:48.799 align:start position:0%
appreciate your perspective on the bill
 
00:59:51.549 --> 00:59:51.559 align:start position:0%
uh I have one quick question for
 
00:59:53.710 --> 00:59:53.720 align:start position:0%
you in order
 
00:59:57.750 --> 00:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
to recover costs in a prudent
 
01:00:02.349 --> 01:00:02.359 align:start position:0%
manner wouldn't it be a utility business
 
01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
decision on how to do this metering to
 
01:00:07.829 --> 01:00:07.839 align:start position:0%
ensure that prudency issues were
 
01:00:07.839 --> 01:00:09.829 align:start position:0%
ensure that prudency issues were
addressed

01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:09.839 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
adequately absolutely uh and that is
 
01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
part of the um Ami feasibility study
 
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
that was completed that I mentioned is
 
01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:21.720 align:start position:0%
to look at what is an optimized scenario
 
01:00:24.589 --> 01:00:24.599 align:start position:0%
to reduce cost again we have a number of
 
01:00:26.549 --> 01:00:26.559 align:start position:0%
systems we have meters that will be
 
01:00:29.029 --> 01:00:29.039 align:start position:0%
approaching end of life uh over the next
 
01:00:32.589 --> 01:00:32.599 align:start position:0%
several years and how do we properly how
 
01:00:36.029 --> 01:00:36.039 align:start position:0%
do we uh intelligently replace those
 
01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
systems deploy new newer technology for
 
01:00:41.549 --> 01:00:41.559 align:start position:0%
the benefits of customers but do it in a
 
01:00:45.190 --> 01:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
way that is is low cost otherwise the
 
01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
chair is absolutely correct we run the
 
01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
risk of uh essentially being found to to
 
01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:53.720 align:start position:0%
have operated imprudently and run the
 
01:00:56.549 --> 01:00:56.559 align:start position:0%
risk of disallowances there just one
 
01:00:58.510 --> 01:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
other thing I I did want to mention
 
01:00:59.910 --> 01:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
because it had been discussed and I
 
01:01:02.789 --> 01:01:02.799 align:start position:0%
apologize I didn't bring up earlier um
 
01:01:05.069 --> 01:01:05.079 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of conversation about
 
01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
time of use rates time of day rates uh
 
01:01:11.069 --> 01:01:11.079 align:start position:0%
reducing Peak usage I I I would just
 
01:01:13.829 --> 01:01:13.839 align:start position:0%
inform the committee eversource today
 
01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:16.760 align:start position:0%
does offer time of day rates we offer on
 
01:01:20.390 --> 01:01:20.400 align:start position:0%
Peak and off peak pricing uh other
 
01:01:23.069 --> 01:01:23.079 align:start position:0%
utilities some have Ami meters some have
 
01:01:26.349 --> 01:01:26.359 align:start position:0%
AMR meters offer similar uh similar
 
01:01:28.990 --> 01:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
programs some offer in New Hampshire
 
01:01:32.069 --> 01:01:32.079 align:start position:0%
some offer on Peak off peak some offer
 
01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:35.480 align:start position:0%
critical Peak mid peak and off peak so
 
01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:37.480 align:start position:0%
all the utilities and certainly cannot
 
01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
speak for any of the others do offer a
 
01:01:42.109 --> 01:01:42.119 align:start position:0%
form of of time of day piece Peak
 
01:01:44.589 --> 01:01:44.599 align:start position:0%
reduction pricing that is available to
 
01:01:44.599 --> 01:01:46.950 align:start position:0%
reduction pricing that is available to
customers

01:01:46.950 --> 01:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
customers
 
01:01:49.710 --> 01:01:49.720 align:start position:0%
today I have a follow-up question we
 
01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
heard it mentioned earlier that stranded
 
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
costs are a concern about the plan that
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
you have in place currently is that a
 
01:02:02.549 --> 01:02:02.559 align:start position:0%
legitimate concern are you worried about
 
01:02:02.559 --> 01:02:04.470 align:start position:0%
legitimate concern are you worried about
stranded

01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
stranded
 
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
costs absolutely I I I think we're
 
01:02:11.309 --> 01:02:11.319 align:start position:0%
always cognizant of uh incurring costs
 
01:02:14.789 --> 01:02:14.799 align:start position:0%
that that then are no longer in use um
 
01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
and as we develop plans for the
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
deployment of of Ami metering in the
 
01:02:22.870 --> 01:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
future it had been mentioned that in
 
01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts as we were further along
 
01:02:26.950 --> 01:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
in the back off office conversions we
 
01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
did look at the the earlier deployment
 
01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:31.480 align:start position:0%
of some meters as part of the normal
 
01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
replacement process but again as we sit
 
01:02:37.870 --> 01:02:37.880 align:start position:0%
here today we would be deploying meters
 
01:02:40.589 --> 01:02:40.599 align:start position:0%
given what we have on our our back uh
 
01:02:42.829 --> 01:02:42.839 align:start position:0%
back end that would simply not have
 
01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:44.960 align:start position:0%
functionality we we simply can't even if
 
01:02:47.950 --> 01:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
it has a a cellular communication our
 
01:02:49.990 --> 01:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
systems can't uh process that
 
01:02:52.789 --> 01:02:52.799 align:start position:0%
information in render
 
01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
bills representative Kaplan has a
 
01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:02:59.630 --> 01:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
you Mr Lata for coming in
 
01:03:02.309 --> 01:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
uh there you mentioned the feasibility
 
01:03:04.549 --> 01:03:04.559 align:start position:0%
study uh and that was to replace the
 
01:03:07.390 --> 01:03:07.400 align:start position:0%
entire network uh and I'm assuming that
 
01:03:10.510 --> 01:03:10.520 align:start position:0%
also included the Billing System yep um
 
01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:13.400 align:start position:0%
is it possible that a partial
 
01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
replacement of the metering and could be
 
01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
accompanied by a partial replacement of
 
01:03:22.109 --> 01:03:22.119 align:start position:0%
a billing system so that you could then
 
01:03:24.510 --> 01:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
use so that you know they the these new
 
01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:26.440 align:start position:0%
meters would have some function ality is
 
01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
is is that not possible to have a
 
01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
partial uh substitution of your Billing
 
01:03:34.589 --> 01:03:34.599 align:start position:0%
System with a cloud-based system
 
01:03:37.630 --> 01:03:37.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it it is not
 
01:03:40.349 --> 01:03:40.359 align:start position:0%
essentially we we have a Billing System
 
01:03:41.829 --> 01:03:41.839 align:start position:0%
uh we actually have two billing systems
 
01:03:43.870 --> 01:03:43.880 align:start position:0%
one for large customers one for uh
 
01:03:47.789 --> 01:03:47.799 align:start position:0%
smaller customers and you can't sort of
 
01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
go halfway uh you know you you need a A
 
01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
system that works it works for customers
 
01:03:56.789 --> 01:03:56.799 align:start position:0%
um and so that system would you know you
 
01:03:59.470 --> 01:03:59.480 align:start position:0%
can't sort of replace part of it to
 
01:04:01.390 --> 01:04:01.400 align:start position:0%
enable the functionality given the the
 
01:04:03.069 --> 01:04:03.079 align:start position:0%
age of
 
01:04:05.630 --> 01:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
it representative Harrington has a
 
01:04:07.589 --> 01:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
question yeah I'm just trying to get
 
01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
this straight on the meters now um are
 
01:04:13.269 --> 01:04:13.279 align:start position:0%
you saying that if if it's part of your
 
01:04:15.029 --> 01:04:15.039 align:start position:0%
routine replacement with meters if you
 
01:04:18.029 --> 01:04:18.039 align:start position:0%
put in Ami meters under your existing
 
01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
Billing System they wouldn't work I mean
 
01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
I know they won't give time of day
 
01:04:24.109 --> 01:04:24.119 align:start position:0%
because we don't have time of day rates
 
01:04:26.029 --> 01:04:26.039 align:start position:0%
uh but could it still function as the
 
01:04:28.589 --> 01:04:28.599 align:start position:0%
meter does now and get someone a a bill
 
01:04:30.670 --> 01:04:30.680 align:start position:0%
at the end of the month my understanding
 
01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
in talking to our back office teams is
 
01:04:36.349 --> 01:04:36.359 align:start position:0%
that the volume of data could not our
 
01:04:39.230 --> 01:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
current systems could not handle that
 
01:04:41.390 --> 01:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
followup follow up no I'm not talking
 
01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:43.640 align:start position:0%
about handling the potential output of
 
01:04:46.029 --> 01:04:46.039 align:start position:0%
an Ami meter but could the Ami meter
 
01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:48.760 align:start position:0%
simply function like the historical
 
01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
meter does now and you know someone go
 
01:04:53.829 --> 01:04:53.839 align:start position:0%
by drive by the car and do whatever they
 
01:04:55.789 --> 01:04:55.799 align:start position:0%
do and get a reading how many kilowatt
 
01:04:58.150 --> 01:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
was used that month and send you a bill
 
01:05:00.029 --> 01:05:00.039 align:start position:0%
does it because it contain that
 
01:05:01.950 --> 01:05:01.960 align:start position:0%
functionality such that it would work
 
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
your existing system I'll have to check
 
01:05:07.150 --> 01:05:07.160 align:start position:0%
on whether an Ami meter could be
 
01:05:08.829 --> 01:05:08.839 align:start position:0%
programmed to essentially function as an
 
01:05:11.470 --> 01:05:11.480 align:start position:0%
AMR meter all right thank
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
you representative Corman has a question
 
01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:16.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Mr
 
01:05:19.349 --> 01:05:19.359 align:start position:0%
Lata you mentioned Connecticut uh is
 
01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
ever Source uh supporting Ami meters in
 
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
any other place
 
01:05:28.510 --> 01:05:28.520 align:start position:0%
uh so we operate in three states New
 
01:05:30.269 --> 01:05:30.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Massachusetts and in
 
01:05:33.269 --> 01:05:33.279 align:start position:0%
Connecticut in Massachusetts as I uh
 
01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
said we are in the process of deploying
 
01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
Ami meters that was part of a multi-year
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
conversion in Connecticut we have filed
 
01:05:43.710 --> 01:05:43.720 align:start position:0%
a plan that has not been approved and so
 
01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
we are not advancing at this time follow
 
01:05:49.470 --> 01:05:49.480 align:start position:0%
up follow up so that means that then the
 
01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
backin systems are either in place or
 
01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
going to be in place in
 
01:05:56.789 --> 01:05:56.799 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts why can't that be ported
 
01:05:59.710 --> 01:05:59.720 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire so each each state uh
 
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
as it exists now has its own unique
 
01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
Billing System uh ultimately our our
 
01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:07.240 align:start position:0%
longer term goal is to have all three
 
01:06:09.950 --> 01:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
states operating on a a single system uh
 
01:06:13.109 --> 01:06:13.119 align:start position:0%
obviously that would have tremendous uh
 
01:06:17.230 --> 01:06:17.240 align:start position:0%
efficiencies uh for for our uh staff uh
 
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
but again it it has to be done in a uh
 
01:06:23.390 --> 01:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
stepped uh planned
 
01:06:25.870 --> 01:06:25.880 align:start position:0%
process representative bery has a
 
01:06:27.269 --> 01:06:27.279 align:start position:0%
question thank you chairman and thank
 
01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
you uh for taking my question so there
 
01:06:32.309 --> 01:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
were uh two different time frames given
 
01:06:34.029 --> 01:06:34.039 align:start position:0%
uh one was 5 years that you guys were
 
01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:35.480 align:start position:0%
going to roll something out another one
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
was seven years can you speak to that
 
01:06:40.029 --> 01:06:40.039 align:start position:0%
and also my I guess a follow-up question
 
01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
to that would be um on page one
 
01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:48.029 align:start position:0%
to that would be um on page one
um

01:06:48.029 --> 01:06:48.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:51.150 --> 01:06:51.160 align:start position:0%
see oh no I guess yeah just that that
 
01:06:53.230 --> 01:06:53.240 align:start position:0%
question sure I I I think the two
 
01:06:55.029 --> 01:06:55.039 align:start position:0%
different time frames are when we would
 
01:06:57.470 --> 01:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
begin some of the back office system
 
01:07:00.069 --> 01:07:00.079 align:start position:0%
conversion uh Replacements and then when
 
01:07:02.829 --> 01:07:02.839 align:start position:0%
we would actually uh deploy the meters
 
01:07:05.789 --> 01:07:05.799 align:start position:0%
and and be able to utilize that
 
01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
functionality followup follow up and I I
 
01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
just thought of my second question my
 
01:07:12.510 --> 01:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
second one was on on page one on line 25
 
01:07:17.230 --> 01:07:17.240 align:start position:0%
it says um uh utilities are not in the
 
01:07:19.710 --> 01:07:19.720 align:start position:0%
process of implementing uh these would
 
01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
you guys consider yourselves in the
 
01:07:23.269 --> 01:07:23.279 align:start position:0%
process or not in the process of
 
01:07:25.870 --> 01:07:25.880 align:start position:0%
implementing it thank you I I I think
 
01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
that's a fair question I I think we are
 
01:07:31.150 --> 01:07:31.160 align:start position:0%
not currently in the process of of
 
01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
implementing we are certainly planning
 
01:07:36.109 --> 01:07:36.119 align:start position:0%
exploring and and developing plans but
 
01:07:37.910 --> 01:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
we are I I think it's fair to say that
 
01:07:44.470 --> 01:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
implementing Vice chair Thomas has a
 
01:07:48.309 --> 01:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:07:50.190 --> 01:07:50.200 align:start position:0%
for taking my question Ju Just My Own
 
01:07:52.029 --> 01:07:52.039 align:start position:0%
clarification you mentioned about the
 
01:07:54.309 --> 01:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
other two states that you operate in but
 
01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire's case
 
01:07:58.109 --> 01:07:58.119 align:start position:0%
we had Public Service New Hampshire and
 
01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
they probably had their own system at
 
01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
the time that it was you know the time
 
01:08:05.029 --> 01:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
you took it over is that one of the main
 
01:08:07.470 --> 01:08:07.480 align:start position:0%
reasons why we're on a different system
 
01:08:10.069 --> 01:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
than than uh the other states that's
 
01:08:12.950 --> 01:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
correct each each state had its had its
 
01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:16.480 align:start position:0%
own legacy customer information billing
 
01:08:19.709 --> 01:08:19.719 align:start position:0%
systems uh and that's not uncommon uh
 
01:08:21.829 --> 01:08:21.839 align:start position:0%
that you know each utility would sort of
 
01:08:24.590 --> 01:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
have in the past sort of a homegrown
 
01:08:28.669 --> 01:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
system um now as technology has advanced
 
01:08:30.749 --> 01:08:30.759 align:start position:0%
there's sort of third parties that offer
 
01:08:32.269 --> 01:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
these systems they're kind of
 
01:08:33.870 --> 01:08:33.880 align:start position:0%
standardized and that's where you've
 
01:08:35.910 --> 01:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
seen a number of of Utilities in New
 
01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and and uh in other states
 
01:08:40.390 --> 01:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
have gone to these kind of third-party
 
01:08:43.390 --> 01:08:43.400 align:start position:0%
platforms uh which obviously offer uh
 
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
efficiencies but you're absolutely
 
01:08:47.470 --> 01:08:47.480 align:start position:0%
correct Vice
 
01:08:50.709 --> 01:08:50.719 align:start position:0%
chair representative Ros has a question
 
01:08:52.189 --> 01:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
01:08:55.110 --> 01:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
chairman um and thanks uh Mike for being
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
here again again and answering questions
 
01:09:01.349 --> 01:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
um earlier last fall and and now this
 
01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
spring I've built at my house a a new
 
01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:07.400 align:start position:0%
detached two-car garage with an
 
01:09:10.990 --> 01:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
apartment over an Adu and I just had a
 
01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
the new meter installed on that building
 
01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
two weeks ago so I got a new meter which
 
01:09:17.910 --> 01:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
I've learned through testimony tonight
 
01:09:19.950 --> 01:09:19.960 align:start position:0%
today is I guess going to have some
 
01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
stranded costs associated with it when
 
01:09:24.349 --> 01:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
it becomes
 
01:09:28.709 --> 01:09:28.719 align:start position:0%
um unusable later on I'm I just wonder
 
01:09:31.870 --> 01:09:31.880 align:start position:0%
isn't there the possibility that
 
01:09:34.309 --> 01:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
eversource there could be some value in
 
01:09:38.669 --> 01:09:38.679 align:start position:0%
learning by doing uh in replacing say
 
01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
the 5 to 6,000 meters per year that
 
01:09:44.550 --> 01:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
we've heard about that ever Source buys
 
01:09:46.470 --> 01:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
new meters and installs each year
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
couldn't the utility learn by doing by
 
01:09:51.149 --> 01:09:51.159 align:start position:0%
allowing inst know supporting
 
01:09:52.829 --> 01:09:52.839 align:start position:0%
installation of advanced metering and
 
01:09:52.839 --> 01:09:55.470 align:start position:0%
installation of advanced metering and
then

01:09:55.470 --> 01:09:55.480 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:09:57.390 --> 01:09:57.400 align:start position:0%
yeah learning to support them rather
 
01:09:59.189 --> 01:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
than having to do it on a massive scale
 
01:10:01.950 --> 01:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
in in five years uh
 
01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
so all of the limitations and challenges
 
01:10:09.070 --> 01:10:09.080 align:start position:0%
that I talked about are are real uh and
 
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
and confront us that said um we do I
 
01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
completely agree in the value of
 
01:10:18.669 --> 01:10:18.679 align:start position:0%
learning by doing and creating
 
01:10:21.229 --> 01:10:21.239 align:start position:0%
efficiencies uh and so one of the
 
01:10:24.189 --> 01:10:24.199 align:start position:0%
benefits of one of our sister States uh
 
01:10:26.110 --> 01:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
sister utilities down in Massachusetts
 
01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:28.840 align:start position:0%
going first is that we can learn from
 
01:10:30.990 --> 01:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
their experience and try to avoid
 
01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
pitfalls that they've encountered and
 
01:10:34.910 --> 01:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
you know if there are areas that they
 
01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
were able to move faster than they
 
01:10:38.709 --> 01:10:38.719 align:start position:0%
expected we have the value of that
 
01:10:41.669 --> 01:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
knowledge uh in terms of when we do
 
01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
Implement in New
 
01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire okay thank you we appreciate
 
01:10:49.510 --> 01:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
your testimony and seeing that's the
 
01:10:52.669 --> 01:10:52.679 align:start position:0%
last pink card we have on House Bill 692
 
01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
will close the public hearing and will
 
01:10:57.510 --> 01:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
immediately open a public hearing on
 
01:10:58.990 --> 01:10:59.000 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
755 and I'll call Representative cat
 
01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
McGee to the front to um introduce this
 
01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:35.070 align:start position:0%
McGee to the front to um introduce this
legislation

01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:37.390 --> 01:11:37.400 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair and members of the
 
01:11:39.470 --> 01:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
committee nice to see you all again for
 
01:11:43.870 --> 01:11:43.880 align:start position:0%
our next our next round um you'll notice
 
01:11:46.590 --> 01:11:46.600 align:start position:0%
that all of the bills today uh are
 
01:11:50.149 --> 01:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
similar in that they are being put forth
 
01:11:53.390 --> 01:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
to try and address the competition in
 
01:11:55.470 --> 01:11:55.480 align:start position:0%
the market that we've been trying to to
 
01:11:58.669 --> 01:11:58.679 align:start position:0%
enable for quite some time now so um
 
01:12:00.110 --> 01:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
I'll just get started again I'm Kat
 
01:12:02.149 --> 01:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
McGee Hillsboro 35
 
01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
Hollis um on st&amp; we have some things we
 
01:12:08.669 --> 01:12:08.679 align:start position:0%
agree on we seem to agree on free
 
01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
markets and
 
01:12:12.910 --> 01:12:12.920 align:start position:0%
competition and finding ways to lower
 
01:12:15.790 --> 01:12:15.800 align:start position:0%
costs in fact free market competition is
 
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
the best way to drive costs
 
01:12:21.270 --> 01:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
down so what is necessary to support a
 
01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:22.189 align:start position:0%
down so what is necessary to support a
free

01:12:22.189 --> 01:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
free
 
01:12:26.110 --> 01:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
market a Level Playing Field Innovative
 
01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurs and accurate price signals
 
01:12:30.709 --> 01:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
these are the ingredients that create
 
01:12:32.709 --> 01:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
fertile ground for free
 
01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
markets many of our new members may
 
01:12:36.669 --> 01:12:36.679 align:start position:0%
think New Hampshire is not really a
 
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
leader on energy policy saying we should
 
01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:41.400 align:start position:0%
seed Innovation to other states as
 
01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:42.960 align:start position:0%
though it's a good thing to ignore New
 
01:12:45.470 --> 01:12:45.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's innovators and opportunities
 
01:12:47.790 --> 01:12:47.800 align:start position:0%
that we have here in the state to unlock
 
01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
the competition that drives cost down in
 
01:12:52.950 --> 01:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
fact New Hampshire was the first in the
 
01:12:54.669 --> 01:12:54.679 align:start position:0%
region to deregulate the utility
 
01:12:57.990 --> 01:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
Monopoly in 1996 to enable competitive
 
01:12:59.910 --> 01:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
suppliers to begin building a truly
 
01:13:02.590 --> 01:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
competitive market it was
 
01:13:04.669 --> 01:13:04.679 align:start position:0%
purposeful but the coalitions and
 
01:13:07.270 --> 01:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
collaborations needed to get policies
 
01:13:09.709 --> 01:13:09.719 align:start position:0%
passed to get to that competitive market
 
01:13:13.709 --> 01:13:13.719 align:start position:0%
are hard one we often say that energy is
 
01:13:15.709 --> 01:13:15.719 align:start position:0%
complicated and it
 
01:13:18.709 --> 01:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
is we have harder a harder and harder
 
01:13:21.110 --> 01:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
time explaining what is a good what is
 
01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
good about a bill uh or good about this
 
01:13:25.790 --> 01:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
bill versus that bill
 
01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:27.679 align:start position:0%
but we have to try and understand when a
 
01:13:29.790 --> 01:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
bill that appears complex is actually
 
01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
part of a solution for enabling
 
01:13:35.590 --> 01:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
competition and helping to bring costs
 
01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
down each year those entrepreneurs who
 
01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
are often industry experts provide us
 
01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
with ideas for legislation to do what we
 
01:13:45.510 --> 01:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
say we want to do enable the competitive
 
01:13:48.790 --> 01:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
market to bring cost down and that is
 
01:13:52.350 --> 01:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
what HB 755 is designed to do in section
 
01:13:54.550 --> 01:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
one the legislative findings and purpose
 
01:13:56.790 --> 01:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
section it does an excellent job of
 
01:13:59.629 --> 01:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
explaining some of the problems uh
 
01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
passing this bill would work to
 
01:14:04.270 --> 01:14:04.280 align:start position:0%
resolve suppliers who compete with
 
01:14:06.430 --> 01:14:06.440 align:start position:0%
utilities cannot offer their customers
 
01:14:08.990 --> 01:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
accurate value for net metered net
 
01:14:11.470 --> 01:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
metered energy because Energy prices
 
01:14:14.070 --> 01:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
change throughout the day if the actual
 
01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
price of the energy you use is never
 
01:14:18.669 --> 01:14:18.679 align:start position:0%
properly reconciled somebody is winning
 
01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
and somebody is losing a Level Playing
 
01:14:24.229 --> 01:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
Field would be if we could use actual
 
01:14:27.070 --> 01:14:27.080 align:start position:0%
time of use rat for actual energy used
 
01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
so the value earned and the value to the
 
01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
grid is appropriately
 
01:14:36.030 --> 01:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
placed section two starting on page uh
 
01:14:39.629 --> 01:14:39.639 align:start position:0%
two line 25 modifies a definition for
 
01:14:42.350 --> 01:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
grid modernization and in section three
 
01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
there's a definition for load reducer uh
 
01:14:47.669 --> 01:14:47.679 align:start position:0%
which is also added for
 
01:14:50.550 --> 01:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
clarification section four begins on
 
01:14:53.669 --> 01:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
line 15 and talks about retail Market
 
01:14:56.070 --> 01:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
reforms and that takes up the remainder
 
01:14:57.950 --> 01:14:57.960 align:start position:0%
of the six pages of this bill which I
 
01:15:00.990 --> 01:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
will let the experts behind me speak to
 
01:15:03.830 --> 01:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
in detail but finally there's a fiscal
 
01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
note on the bill I wanted to draw your
 
01:15:08.350 --> 01:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
attention to um that says that this bill
 
01:15:10.229 --> 01:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
would require upgrades or Replacements
 
01:15:12.870 --> 01:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
of some Utility Systems including load
 
01:15:14.430 --> 01:15:14.440 align:start position:0%
settlement systems and customer
 
01:15:16.510 --> 01:15:16.520 align:start position:0%
information systems in order to fulfill
 
01:15:18.830 --> 01:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
the pro the provisions of the
 
01:15:21.470 --> 01:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
bill the estimated expenditures for
 
01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:23.320 align:start position:0%
these upgrades are deemed to be in the
 
01:15:25.229 --> 01:15:25.239 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars it doesn't say how
 
01:15:27.510 --> 01:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
many millions just apparently a
 
01:15:30.510 --> 01:15:30.520 align:start position:0%
lot these systems upgrades are already
 
01:15:33.990 --> 01:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
being required um by Federal Energy
 
01:15:36.030 --> 01:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
Regulatory Commission order
 
01:15:38.910 --> 01:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
2222 uh in an order that was passed in
 
01:15:41.590 --> 01:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
2020 to remove barriers preventing
 
01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
distributed energy resources from
 
01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
competing on a Level Playing Field as
 
01:15:47.550 --> 01:15:47.560 align:start position:0%
participants in the electric grid of the
 
01:15:50.870 --> 01:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
future so as you can see from the amount
 
01:15:52.270 --> 01:15:52.280 align:start position:0%
of ground that I've covered talking
 
01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
about this bill there are number of
 
01:15:59.629 --> 01:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
impediments that are facing us right now
 
01:16:03.229 --> 01:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
in terms of modernizing our grid and
 
01:16:05.550 --> 01:16:05.560 align:start position:0%
enabling competition in a way that
 
01:16:08.350 --> 01:16:08.360 align:start position:0%
actually benefits the rate payers of New
 
01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and there are many different
 
01:16:14.950 --> 01:16:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh entities at the federal level at the
 
01:16:17.709 --> 01:16:17.719 align:start position:0%
regional grid level trying to enable
 
01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
these pieces and the legislature has a
 
01:16:23.709 --> 01:16:23.719 align:start position:0%
role to to play if our grid requires
 
01:16:25.629 --> 01:16:25.639 align:start position:0%
functionality that our utilities do not
 
01:16:28.189 --> 01:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
yet support then they need
 
01:16:30.709 --> 01:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
legislation uh like this to incentivize
 
01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
them to answer the question of when we
 
01:16:35.270 --> 01:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
can expect this hold up to retail price
 
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
signaling to be
 
01:16:39.750 --> 01:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
resolved if grid systems operators are
 
01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
requiring minimum standards for
 
01:16:43.510 --> 01:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
transactions on their systems that
 
01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
support time of use rates and load
 
01:16:47.390 --> 01:16:47.400 align:start position:0%
settlement then the utilities will be
 
01:16:49.709 --> 01:16:49.719 align:start position:0%
charging rate payers for those upgrades
 
01:16:51.310 --> 01:16:51.320 align:start position:0%
whether we pass the bill or not because
 
01:16:53.149 --> 01:16:53.159 align:start position:0%
they're going to be forced to provide
 
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
that functionality
 
01:16:57.510 --> 01:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
this bill helps our statutes reflect
 
01:16:59.430 --> 01:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
where we are at in terms of the energy
 
01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
markets in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:17:04.510 --> 01:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
the Investments uh to make modern energy
 
01:17:06.590 --> 01:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
markets work are something that we
 
01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
should view as essential to providing a
 
01:17:10.470 --> 01:17:10.480 align:start position:0%
means to Spur innovation in the state of
 
01:17:12.430 --> 01:17:12.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and to provide the
 
01:17:16.149 --> 01:17:16.159 align:start position:0%
competition that lowers rates and costs
 
01:17:18.669 --> 01:17:18.679 align:start position:0%
and that's that's my testimony
 
01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you very much
 
01:17:22.390 --> 01:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
representative for introducing this
 
01:17:24.149 --> 01:17:24.159 align:start position:0%
legislation do we have questions
 
01:17:26.470 --> 01:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
representative bernardy has
 
01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
one thank you chair uh
 
01:17:32.189 --> 01:17:32.199 align:start position:0%
so you said this this going to be
 
01:17:35.149 --> 01:17:35.159 align:start position:0%
extremely costly I think if you're going
 
01:17:38.390 --> 01:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
if if you're going to uh
 
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
understand the the benefits you have to
 
01:17:44.149 --> 01:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
be able to quantify them I ask you to
 
01:17:46.470 --> 01:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
quantify them rather than just
 
01:17:49.110 --> 01:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
generically say we're going to have you
 
01:17:52.870 --> 01:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
know benefits from this against the cost
 
01:17:55.669 --> 01:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
that's what we have to really assess so
 
01:17:59.430 --> 01:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
can you provide an adequate cost benefit
 
01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
assessment of this activity
 
01:18:04.390 --> 01:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
now thank you for the question
 
01:18:06.790 --> 01:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi um the bill
 
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
itself uh doesn't entertain to provide a
 
01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
cost benefit analysis and what it does
 
01:18:16.189 --> 01:18:16.199 align:start position:0%
though is it tries to um provide a way
 
01:18:18.390 --> 01:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
forward to enable competitive markets
 
01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
which is where we believe savings will
 
01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
be right if competitors are jockeying
 
01:18:24.430 --> 01:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
for position in a market to provide
 
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
service that allow people to save money
 
01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
they're going to be competing with each
 
01:18:29.910 --> 01:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
other and that competition is going to
 
01:18:32.550 --> 01:18:32.560 align:start position:0%
help drive cost down we don't currently
 
01:18:36.189 --> 01:18:36.199 align:start position:0%
have a fully competitive market and that
 
01:18:38.830 --> 01:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
has a lot to do with the fact that we
 
01:18:42.030 --> 01:18:42.040 align:start position:0%
are not uh enabling that Level Playing
 
01:18:45.030 --> 01:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
Field that allows everybody to see the
 
01:18:48.149 --> 01:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
value of the data um use the data in a
 
01:18:50.350 --> 01:18:50.360 align:start position:0%
way that would be helpful to lowering
 
01:18:52.709 --> 01:18:52.719 align:start position:0%
our demand and so what we're trying to
 
01:18:55.149 --> 01:18:55.159 align:start position:0%
do is say these things need to be AED
 
01:18:57.669 --> 01:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
and the fact is getting to the point
 
01:19:00.030 --> 01:19:00.040 align:start position:0%
where that functionality is enabled
 
01:19:01.189 --> 01:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
through the
 
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
utilities is something that we're not
 
01:19:06.390 --> 01:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
we're not the only body that's vectoring
 
01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
towards that right the federal
 
01:19:09.790 --> 01:19:09.800 align:start position:0%
government is saying you need to make
 
01:19:11.310 --> 01:19:11.320 align:start position:0%
this competition available you need to
 
01:19:12.910 --> 01:19:12.920 align:start position:0%
level the playing field you need to
 
01:19:15.149 --> 01:19:15.159 align:start position:0%
allow people who are trying to create
 
01:19:17.390 --> 01:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
energy close to where it's being used to
 
01:19:21.149 --> 01:19:21.159 align:start position:0%
get on the grid and help support um
 
01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
creating greater grid stability which is
 
01:19:25.189 --> 01:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
another desire that we talk talk about a
 
01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
lot and also being able to compete in
 
01:19:31.470 --> 01:19:31.480 align:start position:0%
that energy Supply Market in a real way
 
01:19:33.550 --> 01:19:33.560 align:start position:0%
so that's that's really the point of the
 
01:19:37.390 --> 01:19:37.400 align:start position:0%
bill and as I said the costs of that we
 
01:19:39.070 --> 01:19:39.080 align:start position:0%
can't get away from those costs because
 
01:19:41.669 --> 01:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
at some point we have to do it what
 
01:19:44.510 --> 01:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
we're saying is is it better for us to
 
01:19:46.950 --> 01:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
try and enable that sooner so that we
 
01:19:49.669 --> 01:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
can realize cost savings sooner and know
 
01:19:51.510 --> 01:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
what we're doing rather than just leave
 
01:19:53.030 --> 01:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
it to
 
01:19:56.189 --> 01:19:56.199 align:start position:0%
chance follow up
 
01:19:58.430 --> 01:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
so if I understand you correctly there
 
01:20:01.870 --> 01:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
is no cost benefit an analysis now and
 
01:20:05.229 --> 01:20:05.239 align:start position:0%
you say you you just indicated that what
 
01:20:10.870 --> 01:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
we need is a Time based cost benefit
 
01:20:15.629 --> 01:20:15.639 align:start position:0%
assessment no I think that all of the um
 
01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
experts and Regulators that manage and
 
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
maintain our very complex Energy Systems
 
01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
and grid have already decided for
 
01:20:27.110 --> 01:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
example this order under the Trump
 
01:20:31.790 --> 01:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
administration of uh furk 2222 it says
 
01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
you need to do this right and because it
 
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
has the benefit of supporting an
 
01:20:40.990 --> 01:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
advanced grid grid res resiliency and
 
01:20:44.669 --> 01:20:44.679 align:start position:0%
reliability and uh also a a distributed
 
01:20:44.679 --> 01:20:45.790 align:start position:0%
reliability and uh also a a distributed
system

01:20:45.790 --> 01:20:45.800 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:20:48.350 --> 01:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
so I think the growing pains that are
 
01:20:50.270 --> 01:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
coming from this are that we have a top-
 
01:20:52.590 --> 01:20:52.600 align:start position:0%
down system that we're trying
 
01:20:57.189 --> 01:20:57.199 align:start position:0%
to force to allow a bottomup system and
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
the bottomup piece is the distributed
 
01:21:01.510 --> 01:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
generators and they need to be
 
01:21:04.830 --> 01:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
accommodated by the former Monopoly
 
01:21:07.470 --> 01:21:07.480 align:start position:0%
system uh in order to allow for the
 
01:21:10.709 --> 01:21:10.719 align:start position:0%
system to grow in a way that makes sense
 
01:21:12.709 --> 01:21:12.719 align:start position:0%
we have Regulators saying this has to
 
01:21:16.030 --> 01:21:16.040 align:start position:0%
happen right and then we have our piece
 
01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
which is how do we make that happen and
 
01:21:22.270 --> 01:21:22.280 align:start position:0%
uh there are people who can speak far
 
01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
more eloquently than I can I just sort
 
01:21:26.750 --> 01:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
of have big picture perspective on this
 
01:21:28.629 --> 01:21:28.639 align:start position:0%
but what this bill is seeking to do is
 
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
just remove some of the um impediments
 
01:21:34.870 --> 01:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
that currently exist in our system that
 
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
will allow the competition to come I
 
01:21:39.470 --> 01:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
can't give you a cost benefit analysis
 
01:21:41.590 --> 01:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
for what competition would do in the
 
01:21:44.350 --> 01:21:44.360 align:start position:0%
system I only know that competition
 
01:21:46.350 --> 01:21:46.360 align:start position:0%
always does the same thing if it's
 
01:21:48.830 --> 01:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
enabled on a Level Playing Field then it
 
01:21:50.629 --> 01:21:50.639 align:start position:0%
will it will drive the cost down because
 
01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
it will provide better and better
 
01:21:53.390 --> 01:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
products and people will choose those
 
01:21:55.550 --> 01:21:55.560 align:start position:0%
products and and it will drive the cost
 
01:21:59.709 --> 01:21:59.719 align:start position:0%
down of services so that's my story and
 
01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sticking to
 
01:22:05.070 --> 01:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
it okay representative Harrington has a
 
01:22:06.629 --> 01:22:06.639 align:start position:0%
question thank you thank you for taking
 
01:22:10.229 --> 01:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
my question I'm I'm looking on uh page
 
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
three where talks is is a definition of
 
01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
a load reducer and the first one is it's
 
01:22:19.070 --> 01:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
has a maximum rated export capacity
 
01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
point of inter connection uh less than 5
 
01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
megawatts is not registered as a
 
01:22:25.870 --> 01:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
generator and a doesn't participate in
 
01:22:27.830 --> 01:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
any other F jurisdictional markets by
 
01:22:29.629 --> 01:22:29.639 align:start position:0%
that I assume you mean the energy and
 
01:22:31.790 --> 01:22:31.800 align:start position:0%
capacity markets but what I'm trying to
 
01:22:35.149 --> 01:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
get a handle on this is if there was a
 
01:22:38.310 --> 01:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
let's just say a 4 megawatt a 3 megawatt
 
01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
a 2 megawatt another 4 megawatt whatever
 
01:22:44.550 --> 01:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
they don't have any obligation to serve
 
01:22:46.870 --> 01:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
right they can provide this load
 
01:22:50.830 --> 01:22:50.840 align:start position:0%
reducing service when it benefits them
 
01:22:52.790 --> 01:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
and when it doesn't benefit them for
 
01:22:54.669 --> 01:22:54.679 align:start position:0%
whatever reason or because they can't do
 
01:22:57.470 --> 01:22:57.480 align:start position:0%
it they have no obligation like a normal
 
01:23:00.390 --> 01:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
registered generator would to provide uh
 
01:23:03.470 --> 01:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
Power or or someone who's a demand
 
01:23:05.950 --> 01:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
response uh registered under the uh
 
01:23:08.830 --> 01:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
capacity Market uh has an obligation to
 
01:23:10.910 --> 01:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
provide that demand response these load
 
01:23:13.310 --> 01:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
reducers would be great if they work
 
01:23:14.910 --> 01:23:14.920 align:start position:0%
when we need them but if they're not
 
01:23:16.830 --> 01:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
available there's no penalty to them is
 
01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:18.270 align:start position:0%
available there's no penalty to them is
that

01:23:18.270 --> 01:23:18.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
correct thank you for the question uh
 
01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
that is probably above my pay grade to
 
01:23:25.070 --> 01:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
answer you specifically I mean I
 
01:23:26.629 --> 01:23:26.639 align:start position:0%
followed everything you said but I don't
 
01:23:29.149 --> 01:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
know that I know the answer so I won't
 
01:23:31.790 --> 01:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
pretend to um I did want to alert folks
 
01:23:35.070 --> 01:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
that on line 8 uh there is a typo that
 
01:23:37.470 --> 01:23:37.480 align:start position:0%
needs to be corrected uh and that is
 
01:23:40.590 --> 01:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
that the term atrr stands for
 
01:23:42.990 --> 01:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
alternative technology regulation
 
01:23:47.149 --> 01:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
resource um and I my assumption is that
 
01:23:49.830 --> 01:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
if you're operating as a load reducer on
 
01:23:52.310 --> 01:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
the system that you will be you know
 
01:23:55.189 --> 01:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
identified and available and
 
01:23:57.550 --> 01:23:57.560 align:start position:0%
um and recompensed for the value that
 
01:24:00.149 --> 01:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
you bring to the system but I don't know
 
01:24:01.790 --> 01:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
the specific answer to your question so
 
01:24:03.390 --> 01:24:03.400 align:start position:0%
I think somebody behind me can probably
 
01:24:05.149 --> 01:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
answer it
 
01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
better representative Kaplan has a
 
01:24:09.990 --> 01:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:24:11.629 --> 01:24:11.639 align:start position:0%
you represent McGee once again for
 
01:24:16.950 --> 01:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:19.229 --> 01:24:19.239 align:start position:0%
um I I'm just wondering whether you
 
01:24:20.430 --> 01:24:20.440 align:start position:0%
would agree with me that this sounds
 
01:24:22.110 --> 01:24:22.120 align:start position:0%
kind of like deju this this argument
 
01:24:24.390 --> 01:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
about cost benefit analysis didn't we
 
01:24:27.470 --> 01:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
undergo this same debate when we talked
 
01:24:29.030 --> 01:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
about the Grid modernization bill that
 
01:24:32.510 --> 01:24:32.520 align:start position:0%
we passed and uh secondly um well no
 
01:24:33.790 --> 01:24:33.800 align:start position:0%
I'll just leave it that would you agree
 
01:24:35.950 --> 01:24:35.960 align:start position:0%
that that the cost benefit analysis has
 
01:24:38.629 --> 01:24:38.639 align:start position:0%
been St in statute when we set when we
 
01:24:40.189 --> 01:24:40.199 align:start position:0%
passed that Grid modernization bill and
 
01:24:43.109 --> 01:24:43.119 align:start position:0%
this is just trying to cement the the
 
01:24:45.149 --> 01:24:45.159 align:start position:0%
the market transformation that that
 
01:24:47.550 --> 01:24:47.560 align:start position:0%
previous Bill uh
 
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
envisioned yeah it's a good point um I I
 
01:24:54.550 --> 01:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
think we are continually trying to
 
01:24:57.189 --> 01:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
answer questions that are held up by the
 
01:24:58.830 --> 01:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
fact that we don't have adequate
 
01:25:03.109 --> 01:25:03.119 align:start position:0%
insights and Technology available um to
 
01:25:06.669 --> 01:25:06.679 align:start position:0%
necessarily drive us to exact answers uh
 
01:25:09.310 --> 01:25:09.320 align:start position:0%
so it's a chicken and egg in terms of do
 
01:25:11.470 --> 01:25:11.480 align:start position:0%
we do something to try and incentivize
 
01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
us to get to that place um or do we
 
01:25:19.070 --> 01:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
continually hold up in a energy Market
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
that's moving forward without us with
 
01:25:23.310 --> 01:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
advancements that we could be helping to
 
01:25:26.669 --> 01:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
push along and um so the grid
 
01:25:29.629 --> 01:25:29.639 align:start position:0%
modernization uh piece is just a small
 
01:25:32.950 --> 01:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
piece um uh the value of distributed
 
01:25:35.070 --> 01:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
energy piece and the net metering piece
 
01:25:37.990 --> 01:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
also all feature into this how do we
 
01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
integrate new systems in and value them
 
01:25:44.189 --> 01:25:44.199 align:start position:0%
properly and make sure that everybody
 
01:25:46.750 --> 01:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
that's contributing is able to benefit
 
01:25:48.669 --> 01:25:48.679 align:start position:0%
from the value of what they're bringing
 
01:25:52.590 --> 01:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
to this new grid um and at this point we
 
01:25:54.790 --> 01:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
haven't solved for those things
 
01:25:56.390 --> 01:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
and we have to be able to see some of
 
01:25:59.270 --> 01:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
these bills for the part that they play
 
01:26:00.750 --> 01:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
uh in getting us to a Level Playing
 
01:26:04.709 --> 01:26:04.719 align:start position:0%
Field in in in including the ingredients
 
01:26:05.910 --> 01:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
again that I referred to at the
 
01:26:07.950 --> 01:26:07.960 align:start position:0%
beginning in my testimony that will
 
01:26:10.270 --> 01:26:10.280 align:start position:0%
actually allow us to have a fertile
 
01:26:11.990 --> 01:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
competitive market which we don't have
 
01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.510 align:start position:0%
competitive market which we don't have
right

01:26:13.510 --> 01:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
now okay thank you seeing no more
 
01:26:20.590 --> 01:26:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:23.350 --> 01:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
McGee before we move on then let's uh
 
01:26:26.070 --> 01:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
let's have a little chat about the rest
 
01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
of the morning it's
 
01:26:33.470 --> 01:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
now 10:25 we need to break at
 
01:26:38.149 --> 01:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
11:45 in order to uh have a caucus for
 
01:26:40.830 --> 01:26:40.840 align:start position:0%
the Republican members before
 
01:26:43.229 --> 01:26:43.239 align:start position:0%
lunch I've got six people who want to
 
01:26:45.070 --> 01:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
testify on this
 
01:26:47.229 --> 01:26:47.239 align:start position:0%
bill and then we have three people who
 
01:26:49.910 --> 01:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
want to testify on the next bill so
 
01:26:52.830 --> 01:26:52.840 align:start position:0%
unless you want to carry this these P
 
01:26:54.910 --> 01:26:54.920 align:start position:0%
morning public hearings over until the
 
01:26:58.590 --> 01:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
afternoon then I suggest we accelerate
 
01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
our uh question and answer period for
 
01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
the people who are testifying on the
 
01:27:08.070 --> 01:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
this this bill and the next bill I'll
 
01:27:10.229 --> 01:27:10.239 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate that all right
 
01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
next up is Matt Young from the
 
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:29.950 --> 01:27:29.960 align:start position:0%
good morning again Mr chairman members
 
01:27:32.390 --> 01:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh for the record Matt
 
01:27:33.310 --> 01:27:33.320 align:start position:0%
Young I'm an attorney at the New
 
01:27:34.870 --> 01:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of energy the
 
01:27:36.350 --> 01:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
department is neutral on this bill and I
 
01:27:38.030 --> 01:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
just wanted to um raise a couple
 
01:27:39.830 --> 01:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
concerns and I I think emphasize a few
 
01:27:45.709 --> 01:27:45.719 align:start position:0%
things um the first is that um there is
 
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
I guess there's sort of a lot to absorb
 
01:27:49.950 --> 01:27:49.960 align:start position:0%
in this legislation um kind of a lot to
 
01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
take in and I just wanted to highlight
 
01:27:56.350 --> 01:27:56.360 align:start position:0%
that many of the the um Provisions in
 
01:27:58.669 --> 01:27:58.679 align:start position:0%
this bill and issues are part of several
 
01:28:00.510 --> 01:28:00.520 align:start position:0%
dockets before the Pu right now that the
 
01:28:03.070 --> 01:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
department is a part of um and I just
 
01:28:04.990 --> 01:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to highlight that there has been
 
01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of time and I guess with
 
01:28:08.709 --> 01:28:08.719 align:start position:0%
that a cost associated with
 
01:28:11.350 --> 01:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
participating in those dockets
 
01:28:15.109 --> 01:28:15.119 align:start position:0%
um so if uh the legislature does I guess
 
01:28:17.870 --> 01:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
decide to proceed um on this I would I
 
01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
would point you to those dockets and um
 
01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
there's Reams and reams of of
 
01:28:24.109 --> 01:28:24.119 align:start position:0%
information um that has been proved
 
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
provided by the parties and those
 
01:28:29.350 --> 01:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
dockets um so I I would urge you to
 
01:28:31.750 --> 01:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
review that um before moving forward and
 
01:28:33.750 --> 01:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
I think the second sort of similar
 
01:28:36.669 --> 01:28:36.679 align:start position:0%
similar point is that um and I I I
 
01:28:37.709 --> 01:28:37.719 align:start position:0%
believe a previous speaker this morning
 
01:28:40.550 --> 01:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
sort of mentioned Discovery um so with
 
01:28:43.550 --> 01:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
that I think what what comes with um
 
01:28:45.109 --> 01:28:45.119 align:start position:0%
sort of the the vetting process of these
 
01:28:47.709 --> 01:28:47.719 align:start position:0%
pu proceedings is just a a thoroughness
 
01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
to those answers um those answers are
 
01:28:51.430 --> 01:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
answered under Pains of penalty and
 
01:28:54.270 --> 01:28:54.280 align:start position:0%
perjury um so they they're just sort of
 
01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:55.390 align:start position:0%
perjury um so they they're just sort of
a

01:28:55.390 --> 01:28:55.400 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:29:00.350 --> 01:29:00.360 align:start position:0%
um thoroughness and um kind of a fact
 
01:29:02.350 --> 01:29:02.360 align:start position:0%
check that goes into that uh sort of
 
01:29:06.350 --> 01:29:06.360 align:start position:0%
naturally um next um I just wanted to
 
01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:08.629 align:start position:0%
naturally um next um I just wanted to
raise

01:29:08.629 --> 01:29:08.639 align:start position:0%
raise
 
01:29:13.229 --> 01:29:13.239 align:start position:0%
that while this legislation does seem to
 
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh attempt to address issues that are in
 
01:29:17.669 --> 01:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
those dockets um I guess first it's not
 
01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
clear that uh all the parties in those
 
01:29:21.870 --> 01:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
dockets are here today um I'm aware that
 
01:29:24.109 --> 01:29:24.119 align:start position:0%
several of them are but I think I would
 
01:29:26.030 --> 01:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
just note that some some parties may not
 
01:29:27.870 --> 01:29:27.880 align:start position:0%
be as legislatively focused so there
 
01:29:30.149 --> 01:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
maybe something to consider as well and
 
01:29:32.910 --> 01:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know that the legislation
 
01:29:35.910 --> 01:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily addresses um some of the
 
01:29:37.109 --> 01:29:37.119 align:start position:0%
cost shifting concerns that the
 
01:29:39.470 --> 01:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
department would have uh with with it
 
01:29:42.669 --> 01:29:42.679 align:start position:0%
with uh this legislation
 
01:29:45.030 --> 01:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
um it it was briefly discussed by the
 
01:29:47.229 --> 01:29:47.239 align:start position:0%
representative earlier um but I think
 
01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:48.760 align:start position:0%
there's still sort of a question of uh
 
01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:55.270 --> 01:29:55.280 align:start position:0%
costs um finally I think I just wanted
 
01:29:57.669 --> 01:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
to note having um been present for other
 
01:30:00.830 --> 01:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
legislation uh this session um that
 
01:30:03.310 --> 01:30:03.320 align:start position:0%
there is sort of a conversation I think
 
01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
happening um around restructuring and
 
01:30:09.310 --> 01:30:09.320 align:start position:0%
moving a moving away moving towards kind
 
01:30:10.910 --> 01:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
of what's what's happening there and
 
01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:12.189 align:start position:0%
of what's what's happening there and
there's

01:30:12.189 --> 01:30:12.199 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:30:14.790 --> 01:30:14.800 align:start position:0%
um I I think several bills kind of Go in
 
01:30:15.990 --> 01:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
different directions so I would just
 
01:30:17.310 --> 01:30:17.320 align:start position:0%
kind of urge the committee to take that
 
01:30:19.870 --> 01:30:19.880 align:start position:0%
into consideration as well um moving
 
01:30:22.109 --> 01:30:22.119 align:start position:0%
forward and with that happy to answer
 
01:30:25.270 --> 01:30:25.280 align:start position:0%
any questions w for the doe
 
01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:26.470 align:start position:0%
any questions w for the doe
representative

01:30:26.470 --> 01:30:26.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:30:28.390 --> 01:30:28.400 align:start position:0%
Harrington thank you Mr chairman then me
 
01:30:30.830 --> 01:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
take my question with reference to page
 
01:30:34.990 --> 01:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
three um this uh starting on line
 
01:30:37.709 --> 01:30:37.719 align:start position:0%
18 it talks about pursuant to relevant
 
01:30:40.629 --> 01:30:40.639 align:start position:0%
ISO tariffs and goes on so forth and so
 
01:30:43.669 --> 01:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
on uh will take effect in November 1st
 
01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
2026 is there anything in those tariffs
 
01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
that the iso is um putting into effect
 
01:30:52.590 --> 01:30:52.600 align:start position:0%
on November 26 that would require this
 
01:30:54.590 --> 01:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
bill to be passed in order to be in
 
01:30:56.990 --> 01:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
compliance with it the department is not
 
01:30:59.430 --> 01:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
aware of um any changes of current law
 
01:31:01.390 --> 01:31:01.400 align:start position:0%
that would be required to comply with FK
 
01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:02.810 align:start position:0%
order 222
 
01:31:02.810 --> 01:31:04.310 align:start position:0%
order 222
[Music]

01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:31:07.790 --> 01:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
um as as implemented by ISO rules
 
01:31:16.550 --> 01:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:18.790 --> 01:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:31:20.950 --> 01:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
schneller brief question thank you
 
01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
chairman Vose um and thank you Mr Young
 
01:31:25.790 --> 01:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh you mentioned
 
01:31:27.750 --> 01:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
concerns about cost shifting if you
 
01:31:30.229 --> 01:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
could just flush that out a little bit
 
01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:33.040 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful thank you so I
 
01:31:35.550 --> 01:31:35.560 align:start position:0%
think this um legislation deals mostly
 
01:31:39.950 --> 01:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
with the ability of suppliers um to
 
01:31:42.870 --> 01:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
offer various um net metering programs
 
01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:44.310 align:start position:0%
offer various um net metering programs
and

01:31:44.310 --> 01:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:47.310 --> 01:31:47.320 align:start position:0%
if default service provider or default
 
01:31:49.189 --> 01:31:49.199 align:start position:0%
service customers or customers who
 
01:31:52.510 --> 01:31:52.520 align:start position:0%
aren't part of those um supplier
 
01:31:54.910 --> 01:31:54.920 align:start position:0%
programs or customers of those buyers if
 
01:31:56.950 --> 01:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
they'd be
 
01:31:59.149 --> 01:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
um if it would be their respon if it
 
01:32:00.629 --> 01:32:00.639 align:start position:0%
should be their responsibility to pay
 
01:32:02.510 --> 01:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
for those costs to allow the the
 
01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
suppliers to offer the the um prices
 
01:32:07.669 --> 01:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
that they would
 
01:32:10.189 --> 01:32:10.199 align:start position:0%
like does that answer your
 
01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
question yes thank
 
01:32:15.590 --> 01:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
you further questions representative
 
01:32:17.669 --> 01:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
Kaplan thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:32:21.990 --> 01:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
Mr Young um I have a problem trying to
 
01:32:24.870 --> 01:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
understand the cost shifting of of
 
01:32:26.590 --> 01:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
implementing this
 
01:32:30.270 --> 01:32:30.280 align:start position:0%
legislation as opposed to the the
 
01:32:35.030 --> 01:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
lowering of cost to the entire uh user
 
01:32:39.149 --> 01:32:39.159 align:start position:0%
base that would come with incentivizing
 
01:32:41.669 --> 01:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
distributed generation resources for
 
01:32:45.470 --> 01:32:45.480 align:start position:0%
example can you describe I mean there's
 
01:32:47.149 --> 01:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
been discussion here about cost benefit
 
01:32:49.669 --> 01:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
I mean has the department constantly
 
01:32:51.590 --> 01:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
raises this issue of cost shifting has
 
01:32:53.430 --> 01:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
the department done a cost benefit
 
01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:54.790 align:start position:0%
the department done a cost benefit
analysis

01:32:54.790 --> 01:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
01:32:58.270 --> 01:32:58.280 align:start position:0%
so as I mentioned these are um ongoing
 
01:33:00.390 --> 01:33:00.400 align:start position:0%
issues in dockets and I can't speak to
 
01:33:02.149 --> 01:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
the exactly what's what's gone back and
 
01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
forth in those dockets but that would be
 
01:33:06.430 --> 01:33:06.440 align:start position:0%
precisely an issue that's discussed in
 
01:33:07.709 --> 01:33:07.719 align:start position:0%
those dockets I don't have that
 
01:33:10.270 --> 01:33:10.280 align:start position:0%
information in front of me but those
 
01:33:12.470 --> 01:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
cost Ben benefit analysis conversations
 
01:33:15.950 --> 01:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
are are are being discussed
 
01:33:19.270 --> 01:33:19.280 align:start position:0%
there follow up I'm just yeah thank you
 
01:33:21.149 --> 01:33:21.159 align:start position:0%
for your answer I'm just curious I mean
 
01:33:23.510 --> 01:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
you have access to those dockets can you
 
01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:24.430 align:start position:0%
you have access to those dockets can you
not

01:33:24.430 --> 01:33:24.440 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:33:26.709 --> 01:33:26.719 align:start position:0%
summarize the findings for us here at
 
01:33:29.229 --> 01:33:29.239 align:start position:0%
this public hearing it seems that that
 
01:33:30.990 --> 01:33:31.000 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:33:33.470 --> 01:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
helpful so the the department does have
 
01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
that information I can't speak to that
 
01:33:38.070 --> 01:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:42.070 --> 01:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
today but you will attempt to satisfy
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative kaplan's question sure
 
01:33:48.109 --> 01:33:48.119 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to to follow up after this
 
01:33:50.430 --> 01:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
hearing okay seeing no further questions
 
01:33:54.030 --> 01:33:54.040 align:start position:0%
we'll move along and I'll ask Alex om
 
01:33:58.070 --> 01:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
from Unitil to give us a utility
 
01:34:03.070 --> 01:34:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:07.070 --> 01:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:09.310 --> 01:34:09.320 align:start position:0%
back good morning thank you for having
 
01:34:13.350 --> 01:34:13.360 align:start position:0%
me uh for the record my name is Alec Oma
 
01:34:16.950 --> 01:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
I am here representing Unitil and we are
 
01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
uh in opposition to this bill we oppose
 
01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
it uh first one this session I believe
 
01:34:24.709 --> 01:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
we have opposed um when I go through my
 
01:34:27.790 --> 01:34:27.800 align:start position:0%
process uh internally on finding out how
 
01:34:29.629 --> 01:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
we feel about a specific issue I usually
 
01:34:31.669 --> 01:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
reach out to a variety of different
 
01:34:33.669 --> 01:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
departments within the company uh any
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
that might be particularly touched by
 
01:34:37.470 --> 01:34:37.480 align:start position:0%
that particular issue and I get answers
 
01:34:39.709 --> 01:34:39.719 align:start position:0%
and that's generally how I sort of start
 
01:34:42.149 --> 01:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
working on How I build out uh how we're
 
01:34:43.790 --> 01:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
going to talk about a particular issue
 
01:34:47.350 --> 01:34:47.360 align:start position:0%
with this particular bill um we I ran
 
01:34:49.590 --> 01:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
into a bit of a problem because each of
 
01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
the Departments I spoke with emphasized
 
01:34:54.149 --> 01:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
a different piece of this uh particular
 
01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
legislation that they took issue with um
 
01:34:58.189 --> 01:34:58.199 align:start position:0%
many of those issues have already been
 
01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
discussed today um when I talked to our
 
01:35:03.310 --> 01:35:03.320 align:start position:0%
billing folks they talked a little bit
 
01:35:05.830 --> 01:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
to me about the uh costs that would be
 
01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
associated with the integration I think
 
01:35:09.229 --> 01:35:09.239 align:start position:0%
eversource talked a little bit about
 
01:35:12.550 --> 01:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
that during the Ami Bill uh how simply
 
01:35:14.950 --> 01:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
installing Ami and installing the
 
01:35:16.830 --> 01:35:16.840 align:start position:0%
Technologies and implementations that
 
01:35:19.070 --> 01:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
would be required to create these load
 
01:35:22.590 --> 01:35:22.600 align:start position:0%
settlement uh solutions would have great
 
01:35:24.709 --> 01:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
cost um I think that the fiscal note
 
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
used the term Millions uh that's an
 
01:35:28.870 --> 01:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
off-the-cuff term I think that our
 
01:35:30.669 --> 01:35:30.679 align:start position:0%
billing folks generally agreed with I
 
01:35:32.550 --> 01:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
don't have a precise number but
 
01:35:34.350 --> 01:35:34.360 align:start position:0%
generally when talking about integration
 
01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
with customer information Services it is
 
01:35:39.390 --> 01:35:39.400 align:start position:0%
a costly Endeavor for sure uh when I
 
01:35:42.870 --> 01:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
talk to our supply folks uh they talked
 
01:35:47.350 --> 01:35:47.360 align:start position:0%
they they questioned the premise of how
 
01:35:49.629 --> 01:35:49.639 align:start position:0%
much ultimate savings something like
 
01:35:52.189 --> 01:35:52.199 align:start position:0%
this may ultimately generate for
 
01:35:54.750 --> 01:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
participants regarding load settlement
 
01:35:56.470 --> 01:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
um and you know it was more of a
 
01:35:58.550 --> 01:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
conceptual conversation but they
 
01:36:00.149 --> 01:36:00.159 align:start position:0%
acknowledged that folks that are
 
01:36:01.830 --> 01:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
receiving uh that have net metering
 
01:36:03.870 --> 01:36:03.880 align:start position:0%
right now are seeing benefits from that
 
01:36:08.109 --> 01:36:08.119 align:start position:0%
program uh the costs associated with the
 
01:36:10.830 --> 01:36:10.840 align:start position:0%
uh integration that would be required um
 
01:36:12.870 --> 01:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
for the granual level of information
 
01:36:14.709 --> 01:36:14.719 align:start position:0%
that would be required would you
 
01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:17.280 align:start position:0%
ultimately see substantial savings uh
 
01:36:19.790 --> 01:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
it's a real question that they had um I
 
01:36:21.149 --> 01:36:21.159 align:start position:0%
know that's going to continue to get
 
01:36:22.430 --> 01:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
discussed at the Public Utilities
 
01:36:24.189 --> 01:36:24.199 align:start position:0%
Commission which not for nothing was one
 
01:36:25.709 --> 01:36:25.719 align:start position:0%
of the points that our legal team had
 
01:36:27.550 --> 01:36:27.560 align:start position:0%
that there was so many pieces of this
 
01:36:29.550 --> 01:36:29.560 align:start position:0%
that are already getting reviewed within
 
01:36:31.149 --> 01:36:31.159 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission like the
 
01:36:33.950 --> 01:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
department of energy said that really
 
01:36:36.709 --> 01:36:36.719 align:start position:0%
require that detail and it's it's the
 
01:36:38.350 --> 01:36:38.360 align:start position:0%
proper forum for a lot of these
 
01:36:40.870 --> 01:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
conversations because this is a very
 
01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
complicated and very complex concept and
 
01:36:46.270 --> 01:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
the time and the detail and the care and
 
01:36:47.669 --> 01:36:47.679 align:start position:0%
the vetting that will happen at the
 
01:36:49.550 --> 01:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission is really
 
01:36:51.629 --> 01:36:51.639 align:start position:0%
the appropriate place for a lot of this
 
01:36:53.070 --> 01:36:53.080 align:start position:0%
and then finally our regulatory team
 
01:36:54.750 --> 01:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
also knowledge the cost shifting issue
 
01:36:56.430 --> 01:36:56.440 align:start position:0%
that's already been brought up uh we
 
01:36:58.590 --> 01:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
have net metering customers that already
 
01:37:00.870 --> 01:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
benefit from a degree of cost shifting
 
01:37:03.350 --> 01:37:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh opening up another potential front on
 
01:37:05.229 --> 01:37:05.239 align:start position:0%
cost shifting with this particular
 
01:37:07.470 --> 01:37:07.480 align:start position:0%
concept would lead to a host of
 
01:37:09.109 --> 01:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
additional challenges we recognize
 
01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
that's already a controversial issue
 
01:37:12.870 --> 01:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
within the state uh in regards to
 
01:37:14.830 --> 01:37:14.840 align:start position:0%
existing net metering this simply would
 
01:37:17.149 --> 01:37:17.159 align:start position:0%
potentially create another Avenue for
 
01:37:20.590 --> 01:37:20.600 align:start position:0%
those types of uh conversations to occur
 
01:37:24.430 --> 01:37:24.440 align:start position:0%
um in short Unitil believes in using the
 
01:37:26.189 --> 01:37:26.199 align:start position:0%
distribution system as an enabling
 
01:37:28.470 --> 01:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
platform for Innovative Technologies I
 
01:37:30.270 --> 01:37:30.280 align:start position:0%
think we've demonstrated that in a
 
01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
variety of different areas but on this
 
01:37:35.310 --> 01:37:35.320 align:start position:0%
particular concept we're not there yet
 
01:37:37.030 --> 01:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
and that's the message I wanted to
 
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
convey to you folks
 
01:37:43.070 --> 01:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
today excellent thank you we appreciate
 
01:37:45.589 --> 01:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
the utility perspective and that gives
 
01:37:48.950 --> 01:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
me an opportunity to ask you a question
 
01:37:50.589 --> 01:37:50.599 align:start position:0%
about one of the issues that has
 
01:37:54.430 --> 01:37:54.440 align:start position:0%
concerned me about this bill and that is
 
01:37:56.830 --> 01:37:56.840 align:start position:0%
following utilities traditionally
 
01:38:00.750 --> 01:38:00.760 align:start position:0%
recover their costs through energy sales
 
01:38:02.109 --> 01:38:02.119 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour
 
01:38:06.030 --> 01:38:06.040 align:start position:0%
sales so will widespread load reduction
 
01:38:07.510 --> 01:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
as this
 
01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
bill seeks to uh make happen will that
 
01:38:15.030 --> 01:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
impact utility revenue models and if so
 
01:38:18.750 --> 01:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
how much well I don't have a number in
 
01:38:20.189 --> 01:38:20.199 align:start position:0%
terms of what that would be I think
 
01:38:22.310 --> 01:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
that's part of what would potentially be
 
01:38:23.830 --> 01:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
discussed within the public U ilities
 
01:38:25.709 --> 01:38:25.719 align:start position:0%
commission but I think ultimately what
 
01:38:27.870 --> 01:38:27.880 align:start position:0%
you're getting at is the the concept of
 
01:38:29.310 --> 01:38:29.320 align:start position:0%
cost shifting that ultimately gets
 
01:38:31.870 --> 01:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
talked about with these types of issues
 
01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
if you see a net reduction in one area
 
01:38:37.669 --> 01:38:37.679 align:start position:0%
for one subset of customers the
 
01:38:39.990 --> 01:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
potential then would exist for those
 
01:38:41.350 --> 01:38:41.360 align:start position:0%
costs that would then need to be
 
01:38:43.589 --> 01:38:43.599 align:start position:0%
recovered to be recovered across other
 
01:38:45.550 --> 01:38:45.560 align:start position:0%
customers that aren't necessarily seeing
 
01:38:47.589 --> 01:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
that specific savings when people talk
 
01:38:49.149 --> 01:38:49.159 align:start position:0%
about cost shifting that's often the
 
01:38:51.310 --> 01:38:51.320 align:start position:0%
concept that they are trying to get at
 
01:38:52.950 --> 01:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
and that leads to the concern that we
 
01:38:55.229 --> 01:38:55.239 align:start position:0%
see here where there might be costs
 
01:38:56.830 --> 01:38:56.840 align:start position:0%
associated with this program that would
 
01:38:59.310 --> 01:38:59.320 align:start position:0%
be incurred by all customers whereas the
 
01:39:02.030 --> 01:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
benefit would be seen by a
 
01:39:04.390 --> 01:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
subsection okay thank you representative
 
01:39:06.910 --> 01:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
Corman has a question thank you thank
 
01:39:09.229 --> 01:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you Mr Amir see
 
01:39:13.189 --> 01:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
you um as I understand it Unitil already
 
01:39:16.669 --> 01:39:16.679 align:start position:0%
offers time abuse rates uh and if
 
01:39:19.030 --> 01:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
so why do you need to make changes to
 
01:39:22.270 --> 01:39:22.280 align:start position:0%
the Billing System well we do have time
 
01:39:25.990 --> 01:39:26.000 align:start position:0%
of use rates um the concept here as I
 
01:39:28.750 --> 01:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
understand it is uh above and beyond the
 
01:39:30.629 --> 01:39:30.639 align:start position:0%
current existing time of use rates and
 
01:39:32.790 --> 01:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
also includes a number of other
 
01:39:35.950 --> 01:39:35.960 align:start position:0%
integration aspects uh specifically with
 
01:39:37.830 --> 01:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
the the real-time Concepts that have
 
01:39:40.270 --> 01:39:40.280 align:start position:0%
also been discussed here uh we do have
 
01:39:43.790 --> 01:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
Ami uh that Ami is was installed in the
 
01:39:46.310 --> 01:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
mid 2000s so is reaching end of life
 
01:39:49.550 --> 01:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
right now um anytime we're integrating
 
01:39:51.310 --> 01:39:51.320 align:start position:0%
into our existing customer information
 
01:39:54.750 --> 01:39:54.760 align:start position:0%
systems there's a ton of
 
01:39:58.149 --> 01:39:58.159 align:start position:0%
uh it's I've seen a couple different
 
01:40:00.350 --> 01:40:00.360 align:start position:0%
upgrades to our CIS system over the
 
01:40:03.750 --> 01:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
years and it's a Time intensive uh
 
01:40:05.510 --> 01:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
difficult process that involves making
 
01:40:07.830 --> 01:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
sure that these systems can talk to a
 
01:40:10.790 --> 01:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
variety of other softwares in a really
 
01:40:14.669 --> 01:40:14.679 align:start position:0%
uh complex way that requires reliability
 
01:40:14.679 --> 01:40:18.149 align:start position:0%
uh complex way that requires reliability
of

01:40:18.149 --> 01:40:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:20.390 --> 01:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
information okay additional questions
 
01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:21.550 align:start position:0%
information okay additional questions
representative

01:40:21.550 --> 01:40:21.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:40:23.310 --> 01:40:23.320 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah thank you thank you
 
01:40:25.629 --> 01:40:25.639 align:start position:0%
check my question I'm I'm looking at
 
01:40:27.430 --> 01:40:27.440 align:start position:0%
page three of the bill and again it it
 
01:40:30.030 --> 01:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
talks about a load reducer and it says
 
01:40:33.790 --> 01:40:33.800 align:start position:0%
uh less than five megawatts well what we
 
01:40:36.109 --> 01:40:36.119 align:start position:0%
would Now call Net metering we only
 
01:40:38.350 --> 01:40:38.360 align:start position:0%
allow a maximum of one megawatt except
 
01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:39.189 align:start position:0%
allow a maximum of one megawatt except
for

01:40:39.189 --> 01:40:39.199 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:40:41.830 --> 01:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
municipals does this then get around
 
01:40:44.750 --> 01:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
that by simply calling what could now be
 
01:40:47.030 --> 01:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
classified as net metering load reduces
 
01:40:50.030 --> 01:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
and allow them to go up to almost 5
 
01:40:53.310 --> 01:40:53.320 align:start position:0%
megaw um I'm not entirely sure to be
 
01:40:55.149 --> 01:40:55.159 align:start position:0%
perfectly honest I'm not as technically
 
01:40:56.910 --> 01:40:56.920 align:start position:0%
Savvy on that particular topic I can
 
01:40:58.750 --> 01:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
find an answer for you on that one I can
 
01:41:00.990 --> 01:41:01.000 align:start position:0%
talk with our folks and get back to you
 
01:41:04.030 --> 01:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
follow up followup and my my previous
 
01:41:05.510 --> 01:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
question I don't know if you're able to
 
01:41:08.629 --> 01:41:08.639 align:start position:0%
answer this one but it appears that
 
01:41:12.430 --> 01:41:12.440 align:start position:0%
these load reducers with a value of what
 
01:41:14.629 --> 01:41:14.639 align:start position:0%
does it say export capacity of up to 5
 
01:41:17.350 --> 01:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
megawatts would have no obligation to
 
01:41:19.870 --> 01:41:19.880 align:start position:0%
provide anything unlike if they were to
 
01:41:22.709 --> 01:41:22.719 align:start position:0%
be uh demand response and bid into the
 
01:41:24.629 --> 01:41:24.639 align:start position:0%
uh wholesale capacity Market where they
 
01:41:26.790 --> 01:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
have an obligation to deliver demand
 
01:41:29.629 --> 01:41:29.639 align:start position:0%
response these resources at least it
 
01:41:32.950 --> 01:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
appears would be able to deliver the up
 
01:41:34.830 --> 01:41:34.840 align:start position:0%
to five or slightly less than 5
 
01:41:36.830 --> 01:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
megawatts when it was the weather was
 
01:41:38.189 --> 01:41:38.199 align:start position:0%
good when it worked for them when their
 
01:41:39.589 --> 01:41:39.599 align:start position:0%
equipment was running right but if
 
01:41:40.790 --> 01:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
something happened they'd have no
 
01:41:43.189 --> 01:41:43.199 align:start position:0%
penalty or obligation to not pro to
 
01:41:45.229 --> 01:41:45.239 align:start position:0%
provide that service is that
 
01:41:47.910 --> 01:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
correct I believe what you're getting at
 
01:41:50.149 --> 01:41:50.159 align:start position:0%
is the concept difference between a net
 
01:41:52.109 --> 01:41:52.119 align:start position:0%
metering customer and a full-on
 
01:41:54.350 --> 01:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
generating facility is is kind of where
 
01:41:56.310 --> 01:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
you're driving at I believe how you're
 
01:41:59.270 --> 01:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
articulating that is correct um I I
 
01:42:00.950 --> 01:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
think that the point I'm trying to make
 
01:42:04.350 --> 01:42:04.360 align:start position:0%
here overall though is that the concept
 
01:42:06.830 --> 01:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
as a whole we're just not entirely sure
 
01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
that the that it's going to create the
 
01:42:12.390 --> 01:42:12.400 align:start position:0%
benefits that are
 
01:42:14.910 --> 01:42:14.920 align:start position:0%
articulated additional
 
01:42:17.950 --> 01:42:17.960 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none we'll move along
 
01:42:20.910 --> 01:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
and call next on Dean Dennis and Clifton
 
01:42:52.709 --> 01:42:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:54.270 --> 01:42:54.280 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:43:03.589 --> 01:43:03.599 align:start position:0%

New Hampshire and by distributed energy
 
01:44:05.629 --> 01:44:05.639 align:start position:0%
I'm referring to small scale power
 
01:44:08.070 --> 01:44:08.080 align:start position:0%

01:44:46.589 --> 01:44:46.599 align:start position:0%
forward the reason that cbcn is
 
01:44:49.070 --> 01:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
proposing the reforms in this bill to
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
have more explicit requirements for how
 
01:44:53.910 --> 01:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
innovation in the retail Market Market
 
01:44:56.149 --> 01:44:56.159 align:start position:0%
um such as Innovative rates and value
 
01:44:59.270 --> 01:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
added services to customers as permitted
 
01:45:01.109 --> 01:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
is because right now and as uh
 
01:45:03.870 --> 01:45:03.880 align:start position:0%
representative McGee alluded to entities
 
01:45:05.750 --> 01:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
like the community power Coalition and
 
01:45:08.070 --> 01:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
other competitive suppliers are not able
 
01:45:09.350 --> 01:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
to provide these
 
01:45:11.870 --> 01:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
Innovations um it's been the policy of
 
01:45:15.070 --> 01:45:15.080 align:start position:0%
the general court since 1996 to develop
 
01:45:17.189 --> 01:45:17.199 align:start position:0%
competitive markets that achieve lower
 
01:45:19.990 --> 01:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
costs for electricity customers despite
 
01:45:21.750 --> 01:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
this most residential and small
 
01:45:23.950 --> 01:45:23.960 align:start position:0%
commercial customers to today can only
 
01:45:26.070 --> 01:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
choose flat rate commodity service
 
01:45:28.589 --> 01:45:28.599 align:start position:0%
options from Community power programs
 
01:45:31.510 --> 01:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
and competitive suppliers value added
 
01:45:33.830 --> 01:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
services such as time varying rates and
 
01:45:36.430 --> 01:45:36.440 align:start position:0%
programs to enable distributed energy
 
01:45:38.510 --> 01:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
remain unavailable in practice while
 
01:45:40.870 --> 01:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
utilities alone can offer these
 
01:45:42.830 --> 01:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
Innovations the lack of a market
 
01:45:44.350 --> 01:45:44.360 align:start position:0%
emerging to offer these kind of
 
01:45:47.270 --> 01:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
Innovations is largely due to uh
 
01:45:49.830 --> 01:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
utilities not keeping up toate their
 
01:45:52.390 --> 01:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
software systems data access and
 
01:45:56.229 --> 01:45:56.239 align:start position:0%
business processes that are essential to
 
01:45:59.390 --> 01:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
enabling um Market competition this
 
01:46:01.390 --> 01:46:01.400 align:start position:0%
limits customer choice and prevents
 
01:46:03.310 --> 01:46:03.320 align:start position:0%
competitive entities from introducing
 
01:46:05.709 --> 01:46:05.719 align:start position:0%
new products and investing private
 
01:46:07.709 --> 01:46:07.719 align:start position:0%
Capital to build out distributed energy
 
01:46:10.510 --> 01:46:10.520 align:start position:0%
where it makes Financial stents to do so
 
01:46:12.709 --> 01:46:12.719 align:start position:0%
the energy forward act requires the
 
01:46:14.709 --> 01:46:14.719 align:start position:0%
necessary changes to utility managed
 
01:46:17.430 --> 01:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
retail Market facilities including data
 
01:46:19.990 --> 01:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
access metering billing transmission
 
01:46:22.390 --> 01:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
pricing and load settlement systems to
 
01:46:25.109 --> 01:46:25.119 align:start position:0%
enable True Market
 
01:46:27.189 --> 01:46:27.199 align:start position:0%
competition with these improvements
 
01:46:28.629 --> 01:46:28.639 align:start position:0%
Community power and competitive
 
01:46:30.470 --> 01:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
suppliers across the state would be able
 
01:46:32.350 --> 01:46:32.360 align:start position:0%
to offer innovative solutions to
 
01:46:35.310 --> 01:46:35.320 align:start position:0%
customers on a voluntary basis without
 
01:46:37.030 --> 01:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
these improvements the state will
 
01:46:39.030 --> 01:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
continue to rely on state regulated
 
01:46:41.109 --> 01:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
utility programs for net metering
 
01:46:43.390 --> 01:46:43.400 align:start position:0%
customer de or distributed energy
 
01:46:45.669 --> 01:46:45.679 align:start position:0%
programs and utility-owned distributed
 
01:46:48.350 --> 01:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
generation projects and rate payers will
 
01:46:50.109 --> 01:46:50.119 align:start position:0%
continue to ultimately shoulder the
 
01:46:52.109 --> 01:46:52.119 align:start position:0%
costs when utilities recover those
 
01:46:53.390 --> 01:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
Capital expenses
 
01:46:55.229 --> 01:46:55.239 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether the Investments
 
01:46:56.950 --> 01:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
actually deliver on the benefits
 
01:46:59.430 --> 01:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
projected in contrast the New Hampshire
 
01:47:01.310 --> 01:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
energy forward act enables
 
01:47:03.510 --> 01:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
permissionless Innovation so that
 
01:47:05.910 --> 01:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
suppliers and developers can contract
 
01:47:08.189 --> 01:47:08.199 align:start position:0%
for the construction of new local energy
 
01:47:11.070 --> 01:47:11.080 align:start position:0%
projects offer new Innovative services
 
01:47:13.270 --> 01:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
without waiting for utilities or going
 
01:47:15.350 --> 01:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
through lengthy pu proceedings to
 
01:47:17.189 --> 01:47:17.199 align:start position:0%
dictate the pace and extent of
 
01:47:19.390 --> 01:47:19.400 align:start position:0%
innovation these new market-driven
 
01:47:21.750 --> 01:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
distributed energy and customer programs
 
01:47:24.750 --> 01:47:24.760 align:start position:0%
would be paced paid based on actual
 
01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
performance that is by how much
 
01:47:28.830 --> 01:47:28.840 align:start position:0%
wholesale energy capacity and
 
01:47:31.550 --> 01:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
transmission costs they reduce and not
 
01:47:33.790 --> 01:47:33.800 align:start position:0%
through administratively set rates and
 
01:47:36.109 --> 01:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
rebates determined by state Regulators
 
01:47:38.030 --> 01:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
with automatic recovery of costs and
 
01:47:40.589 --> 01:47:40.599 align:start position:0%
guaranteed profits for utilities as
 
01:47:42.350 --> 01:47:42.360 align:start position:0%
representative McGee pointed out the New
 
01:47:43.990 --> 01:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire energy forward Act is well
 
01:47:45.709 --> 01:47:45.719 align:start position:0%
timed because the Federal Energy
 
01:47:47.470 --> 01:47:47.480 align:start position:0%
Regulatory Commission has been trying to
 
01:47:49.350 --> 01:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
expand market access for distributed
 
01:47:51.350 --> 01:47:51.360 align:start position:0%
energy to participate in wholesale
 
01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
markets um including uh the iso New
 
01:47:56.950 --> 01:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
England markets um the new requirements
 
01:47:59.149 --> 01:47:59.159 align:start position:0%
automatically apply to eversource um
 
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
because of eversource's size um
 
01:48:04.430 --> 01:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
including that the utility that
 
01:48:06.750 --> 01:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
utilities like eversource permit
 
01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
competitive entities to self-pride um
 
01:48:12.910 --> 01:48:12.920 align:start position:0%
interval metering for distributed energy
 
01:48:15.030 --> 01:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
and that's needed because you need
 
01:48:17.589 --> 01:48:17.599 align:start position:0%
accurate um and more frequent
 
01:48:19.910 --> 01:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
measurements of what the de what the
 
01:48:21.790 --> 01:48:21.800 align:start position:0%
distributed energy is is doing what
 
01:48:23.149 --> 01:48:23.159 align:start position:0%
they're using and what they're producing
 
01:48:26.790 --> 01:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
onto the grid um and that eversource and
 
01:48:29.149 --> 01:48:29.159 align:start position:0%
other Utilities in New England um their
 
01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
load settlements need to start to
 
01:48:33.870 --> 01:48:33.880 align:start position:0%
accurately track those outputs and
 
01:48:36.870 --> 01:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
allocate load impacts to individual
 
01:48:40.589 --> 01:48:40.599 align:start position:0%
suppliers um and the energy forward act
 
01:48:42.310 --> 01:48:42.320 align:start position:0%
elects that the same Market enabling
 
01:48:44.629 --> 01:48:44.639 align:start position:0%
reforms should also be implemented for
 
01:48:46.750 --> 01:48:46.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's other utilities Unitil
 
01:48:48.750 --> 01:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
Liberty and New Hampshire Electric Co-op
 
01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
I think all of them are sitting behind
 
01:48:52.990 --> 01:48:53.000 align:start position:0%
me right now um and this Bill calls for
 
01:48:55.589 --> 01:48:55.599 align:start position:0%
joint implementation of many of these
 
01:48:57.750 --> 01:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
reforms across all four New Hampshire
 
01:49:00.030 --> 01:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
utilities by Contracting with a single
 
01:49:02.589 --> 01:49:02.599 align:start position:0%
expert vendor to perform load settlement
 
01:49:04.430 --> 01:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
calculations and leverages the
 
01:49:06.510 --> 01:49:06.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to modernize load settlement
 
01:49:09.510 --> 01:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
on a Statewide basis if it's more cost
 
01:49:11.589 --> 01:49:11.599 align:start position:0%
competitive and to enable competitive
 
01:49:13.629 --> 01:49:13.639 align:start position:0%
Innovations and Achieve cost
 
01:49:15.589 --> 01:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
efficiencies while it's been raised
 
01:49:17.350 --> 01:49:17.360 align:start position:0%
whether the Public Utilities Commission
 
01:49:19.709 --> 01:49:19.719 align:start position:0%
is addressing these matters the answer
 
01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
is sort of um well Community power
 
01:49:25.189 --> 01:49:25.199 align:start position:0%
Coalition has been advancing key
 
01:49:27.990 --> 01:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
proposals at the commission not all of
 
01:49:29.709 --> 01:49:29.719 align:start position:0%
these reforms are being considered in
 
01:49:31.669 --> 01:49:31.679 align:start position:0%
the scope of active proceedings at
 
01:49:33.790 --> 01:49:33.800 align:start position:0%
present um and we believe legislative
 
01:49:35.510 --> 01:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
action is necessary to enable a
 
01:49:38.390 --> 01:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
competitive retail Market um so while
 
01:49:40.510 --> 01:49:40.520 align:start position:0%
these changes to Utility Systems do cost
 
01:49:43.589 --> 01:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
money the investments in mostly software
 
01:49:45.669 --> 01:49:45.679 align:start position:0%
and business process changes are
 
01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
necessary to enable an order of
 
01:49:50.109 --> 01:49:50.119 align:start position:0%
magnitude greater investment of private
 
01:49:52.790 --> 01:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
capital capital into distributed energy
 
01:49:54.430 --> 01:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
and cost-saving Innovations for
 
01:49:56.910 --> 01:49:56.920 align:start position:0%
customers and as previously mentioned
 
01:49:58.669 --> 01:49:58.679 align:start position:0%
the largest utility in New Hampshire
 
01:50:00.589 --> 01:50:00.599 align:start position:0%
will already need to invest in these new
 
01:50:02.510 --> 01:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
settlement and Data Systems to comply
 
01:50:05.629 --> 01:50:05.639 align:start position:0%
with the federal Rules by November 1st
 
01:50:08.350 --> 01:50:08.360 align:start position:0%
2026 um so in summary if we want to move
 
01:50:10.709 --> 01:50:10.719 align:start position:0%
to a more competitive market and Empower
 
01:50:13.629 --> 01:50:13.639 align:start position:0%
customers to have maximum freedom and
 
01:50:15.990 --> 01:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
choice over their energy options we need
 
01:50:19.070 --> 01:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
the reforms contained in House Bill 755
 
01:50:20.870 --> 01:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
otherwise utilities will continue to
 
01:50:22.870 --> 01:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
dominate in this space and there will
 
01:50:25.750 --> 01:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
fewer options for customers and fewer
 
01:50:28.149 --> 01:50:28.159 align:start position:0%
ways to reduce costs thank you for your
 
01:50:29.189 --> 01:50:29.199 align:start position:0%
time and
 
01:50:32.950 --> 01:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:35.350 --> 01:50:35.360 align:start position:0%
questions questions for the folks from
 
01:50:37.270 --> 01:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
the community power Coalition
 
01:50:40.310 --> 01:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas thank you Mr
 
01:50:43.109 --> 01:50:43.119 align:start position:0%
chair um there's been a lot of talk
 
01:50:45.790 --> 01:50:45.800 align:start position:0%
about cost shifting um can you tell me
 
01:50:48.669 --> 01:50:48.679 align:start position:0%
what the VD report says uh regarding
 
01:50:50.910 --> 01:50:50.920 align:start position:0%
cough shift shifting specifically with
 
01:50:54.830 --> 01:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:56.510 --> 01:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
do you want to tackle that
 
01:51:01.189 --> 01:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
um I I've read that report
 
01:51:04.629 --> 01:51:04.639 align:start position:0%
um but I don't recall that it actually
 
01:51:09.910 --> 01:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
addresses cost shifting per se um it did
 
01:51:11.790 --> 01:51:11.800 align:start position:0%
conclude in
 
01:51:11.800 --> 01:51:13.550 align:start position:0%
conclude in
general

01:51:13.550 --> 01:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
general
 
01:51:18.069 --> 01:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
um that the value of distributed energy
 
01:51:22.109 --> 01:51:22.119 align:start position:0%
resources is uh close to their current
 
01:51:24.189 --> 01:51:24.199 align:start position:0%
level of compensation I I'll just leave
 
01:51:28.270 --> 01:51:28.280 align:start position:0%
it at that it's fairly uh complex but
 
01:51:32.149 --> 01:51:32.159 align:start position:0%
the general conclusion was um our our
 
01:51:34.589 --> 01:51:34.599 align:start position:0%
general our level of
 
01:51:37.750 --> 01:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
compensation generally uh aligns with
 
01:51:40.510 --> 01:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
the benefits that that are realized
 
01:51:40.520 --> 01:51:41.550 align:start position:0%
the benefits that that are realized
thank

01:51:41.550 --> 01:51:41.560 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:51:45.270 --> 01:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
you additional questions representative
 
01:51:47.310 --> 01:51:47.320 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah I'll follow up with the
 
01:51:49.030 --> 01:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
question I asked to the gentleman from
 
01:51:52.270 --> 01:51:52.280 align:start position:0%
the uh Department of energy uh and what
 
01:51:53.950 --> 01:51:53.960 align:start position:0%
he told me was that he would the
 
01:51:55.350 --> 01:51:55.360 align:start position:0%
department was not aware of any Law
 
01:51:57.830 --> 01:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
changes needed to comply with the FK
 
01:52:00.229 --> 01:52:00.239 align:start position:0%
order is implemented by ISO New England
 
01:52:02.149 --> 01:52:02.159 align:start position:0%
and it sounds like you don't agree with
 
01:52:04.189 --> 01:52:04.199 align:start position:0%
that could you uh follow up on that
 
01:52:07.589 --> 01:52:07.599 align:start position:0%
please um yes
 
01:52:10.790 --> 01:52:10.800 align:start position:0%
um I I think that's more or less true
 
01:52:13.990 --> 01:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
for eversource uh because eversource is
 
01:52:16.709 --> 01:52:16.719 align:start position:0%
of a size that they are uh subject to
 
01:52:19.470 --> 01:52:19.480 align:start position:0%
these requirements which are uh
 
01:52:21.189 --> 01:52:21.199 align:start position:0%
scheduled to be in place by November of
 
01:52:23.109 --> 01:52:23.119 align:start position:0%
2026 as
 
01:52:25.430 --> 01:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
November a year from now at which point
 
01:52:28.430 --> 01:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
they will either need to provide uh uh
 
01:52:32.030 --> 01:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
this this uh you know essentially ISO
 
01:52:33.750 --> 01:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
New England specified metering
 
01:52:36.390 --> 01:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
requirements for aggregated distributed
 
01:52:40.149 --> 01:52:40.159 align:start position:0%
energy resources these These are um for
 
01:52:43.189 --> 01:52:43.199 align:start position:0%
order 2022 is about aggregating small
 
01:52:46.470 --> 01:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
deers um uh so that they're of a size
 
01:52:47.830 --> 01:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
that they can participate in the iso New
 
01:52:49.669 --> 01:52:49.679 align:start position:0%
England Market in which case they would
 
01:52:51.510 --> 01:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
be if they bid into capacity they would
 
01:52:52.870 --> 01:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
be subject to the Capac capity
 
01:52:55.669 --> 01:52:55.679 align:start position:0%
requirements of a market participant
 
01:53:00.350 --> 01:53:00.360 align:start position:0%
that that whole framework um does not
 
01:53:02.870 --> 01:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
extend to the other three Utilities in
 
01:53:06.470 --> 01:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and essentially
 
01:53:10.229 --> 01:53:10.239 align:start position:0%
um the the what fur approved was that
 
01:53:13.270 --> 01:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
generators um I mean distribution uh
 
01:53:15.830 --> 01:53:15.840 align:start position:0%
utilities that distribute 4 million
 
01:53:18.950 --> 01:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
megawatt hours or less uh in the
 
01:53:21.390 --> 01:53:21.400 align:start position:0%
previous fiscal year don't have to do
 
01:53:23.790 --> 01:53:23.800 align:start position:0%
this until unless the the term is
 
01:53:25.910 --> 01:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
relevant regulator electric retail
 
01:53:27.669 --> 01:53:27.679 align:start position:0%
regulatory authority meaning I guess the
 
01:53:30.910 --> 01:53:30.920 align:start position:0%
Pu although that Authority uh is vested
 
01:53:32.470 --> 01:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
in the state constitution in the
 
01:53:34.069 --> 01:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
legislature and then it delegates it to
 
01:53:38.910 --> 01:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
the puc and doe uh but it it it it the
 
01:53:42.709 --> 01:53:42.719 align:start position:0%
state has to permit customers of the
 
01:53:44.950 --> 01:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
other three utilities to be able to
 
01:53:47.790 --> 01:53:47.800 align:start position:0%
participate um as aggregated uh
 
01:53:49.910 --> 01:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
resources in the iso New England market
 
01:53:52.830 --> 01:53:52.840 align:start position:0%
so that would need
 
01:53:55.669 --> 01:53:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh I think some legislative direction if
 
01:53:57.790 --> 01:53:57.800 align:start position:0%
if if you're serious about wanting to
 
01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
create Market options uh based options
 
01:54:04.030 --> 01:54:04.040 align:start position:0%
um to to drive prudent you know
 
01:54:07.270 --> 01:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
decisions about use of resources uh then
 
01:54:09.510 --> 01:54:09.520 align:start position:0%
um some action would probably be needed
 
01:54:12.109 --> 01:54:12.119 align:start position:0%
to indicate at least that the Comm pu
 
01:54:14.550 --> 01:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
has the authority uh to require this if
 
01:54:16.470 --> 01:54:16.480 align:start position:0%
they find it's in the public interest I
 
01:54:17.790 --> 01:54:17.800 align:start position:0%
mean this bill would just go ahead and
 
01:54:20.510 --> 01:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
say this should apply to all the
 
01:54:22.910 --> 01:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
utilities thank you
 
01:54:25.910 --> 01:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
so following up on that question from
 
01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:28.470 align:start position:0%
so following up on that question from
representative

01:54:28.470 --> 01:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:54:31.229 --> 01:54:31.239 align:start position:0%
Harrington is it possible since we've
 
01:54:33.550 --> 01:54:33.560 align:start position:0%
been trying to develop competitive
 
01:54:35.629 --> 01:54:35.639 align:start position:0%
markets since
 
01:54:39.149 --> 01:54:39.159 align:start position:0%
1996 which is like 29 years is it
 
01:54:41.350 --> 01:54:41.360 align:start position:0%
possible that competitive
 
01:54:43.550 --> 01:54:43.560 align:start position:0%
markets are
 
01:54:47.870 --> 01:54:47.880 align:start position:0%
incompatible with a utility regime that
 
01:54:50.310 --> 01:54:50.320 align:start position:0%
requires that there be regulation of
 
01:54:53.390 --> 01:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
utilities there there is no free market
 
01:54:56.830 --> 01:54:56.840 align:start position:0%
for the utilities so you know how can we
 
01:54:58.589 --> 01:54:58.599 align:start position:0%
expect there to be free market for other
 
01:55:01.950 --> 01:55:01.960 align:start position:0%
things um well I think that's actually
 
01:55:03.550 --> 01:55:03.560 align:start position:0%
been pretty well thought through around
 
01:55:05.510 --> 01:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
much of the world
 
01:55:09.030 --> 01:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
um the the the Monopoly function of the
 
01:55:11.069 --> 01:55:11.079 align:start position:0%
distribution utilties is to distribute
 
01:55:13.430 --> 01:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
the power it's the poles and wires and
 
01:55:15.870 --> 01:55:15.880 align:start position:0%
all the infrastructure that supports
 
01:55:17.390 --> 01:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
that and that supports a competitive
 
01:55:19.830 --> 01:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
market um and I think that was
 
01:55:21.270 --> 01:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
understood at the outset of
 
01:55:25.910 --> 01:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
restructuring um and and what we've seen
 
01:55:30.990 --> 01:55:31.000 align:start position:0%
is uh in in many places um very robust
 
01:55:34.109 --> 01:55:34.119 align:start position:0%
competitive generation markets where
 
01:55:36.750 --> 01:55:36.760 align:start position:0%
investment decisions and power supply
 
01:55:39.149 --> 01:55:39.159 align:start position:0%
are are in the private sector and so if
 
01:55:44.069 --> 01:55:44.079 align:start position:0%
they if they don't forecast correctly
 
01:55:46.669 --> 01:55:46.679 align:start position:0%
rate payers aren't risk of that bad
 
01:55:49.830 --> 01:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
potentially bad investment so
 
01:55:53.030 --> 01:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
I I don't believe that competitive
 
01:55:56.109 --> 01:55:56.119 align:start position:0%
markets for power supply and for demand
 
01:55:58.030 --> 01:55:58.040 align:start position:0%
response services are at all
 
01:56:00.390 --> 01:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
incompatible with a monopoly function
 
01:56:03.229 --> 01:56:03.239 align:start position:0%
for distribution services and it a
 
01:56:05.629 --> 01:56:05.639 align:start position:0%
little bit goes to the question of well
 
01:56:07.350 --> 01:56:07.360 align:start position:0%
isn't this going to mean lost revenue
 
01:56:08.709 --> 01:56:08.719 align:start position:0%
for the utilities not necessarily
 
01:56:10.990 --> 01:56:11.000 align:start position:0%
because if a storage resource or a
 
01:56:12.790 --> 01:56:12.800 align:start position:0%
generation resource is putting power
 
01:56:15.109 --> 01:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
onto the distribution grid they still P
 
01:56:17.990 --> 01:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
pay charge for Distributing that power
 
01:56:21.910 --> 01:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
um so there's no uh sort of harm there
 
01:56:26.350 --> 01:56:26.360 align:start position:0%
what could happen is if DRS are
 
01:56:29.589 --> 01:56:29.599 align:start position:0%
responding to to price signals that are
 
01:56:32.510 --> 01:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
temporal in nature that they're going to
 
01:56:36.750 --> 01:56:36.760 align:start position:0%
help shave these Peaks which potentially
 
01:56:38.790 --> 01:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
means when you shave the Peaks and can
 
01:56:41.189 --> 01:56:41.199 align:start position:0%
shift load off of the peak into less
 
01:56:44.790 --> 01:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
Peak periods um it means for for the
 
01:56:47.709 --> 01:56:47.719 align:start position:0%
capacity the whole system um because the
 
01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
whole system generation distribution
 
01:56:51.830 --> 01:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
transmission has to be designed to meet
 
01:56:55.709 --> 01:56:55.719 align:start position:0%
Peak capacity Plus a safety margin um so
 
01:56:58.189 --> 01:56:58.199 align:start position:0%
to the extent we have Financial signals
 
01:57:03.310 --> 01:57:03.320 align:start position:0%
or Market signals that Peak is expensive
 
01:57:05.950 --> 01:57:05.960 align:start position:0%
which we do with the capacity uh you
 
01:57:07.310 --> 01:57:07.320 align:start position:0%
know it's based on the single hour of
 
01:57:09.990 --> 01:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
highest peak demand in New England then
 
01:57:13.350 --> 01:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
what we're going to see is a shifting of
 
01:57:15.550 --> 01:57:15.560 align:start position:0%
load that fills more in The Valleys
 
01:57:16.830 --> 01:57:16.840 align:start position:0%
which means we're spreading all these
 
01:57:19.189 --> 01:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
fixed costs over more kilowatt hours
 
01:57:21.550 --> 01:57:21.560 align:start position:0%
rather than fewer because when customers
 
01:57:24.470 --> 01:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
don't have any access or deers for that
 
01:57:26.270 --> 01:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
matter people are investing in net
 
01:57:28.910 --> 01:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
metered resources don't care when they
 
01:57:31.069 --> 01:57:31.079 align:start position:0%
produce cuz all kilow hours are treated
 
01:57:33.750 --> 01:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
the same in contrast when Unitil looked
 
01:57:35.510 --> 01:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
at this and said if we treat this as a
 
01:57:37.709 --> 01:57:37.719 align:start position:0%
load reducer and pay attention to the
 
01:57:40.910 --> 01:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
actual price signals LMP capacity
 
01:57:43.229 --> 01:57:43.239 align:start position:0%
transmission which is essentially a
 
01:57:47.109 --> 01:57:47.119 align:start position:0%
capacity charge um then what we get is a
 
01:57:49.510 --> 01:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
different investment um which is a
 
01:57:52.350 --> 01:57:52.360 align:start position:0%
single AIS tracker and the reason they
 
01:57:53.870 --> 01:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
said even though that costs more and
 
01:57:55.430 --> 01:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
it's going to cost more to operate it
 
01:57:58.030 --> 01:57:58.040 align:start position:0%
produces much more value because it
 
01:58:01.470 --> 01:58:01.480 align:start position:0%
produces more when prices are high and
 
01:58:03.629 --> 01:58:03.639 align:start position:0%
demand is High um at least throughout
 
01:58:05.830 --> 01:58:05.840 align:start position:0%
the summer um and it can produce more in
 
01:58:07.750 --> 01:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
the winter because it can shed snow and
 
01:58:09.830 --> 01:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
and follow the sun to some extent so so
 
01:58:11.629 --> 01:58:11.639 align:start position:0%
the point is you get more optimal
 
01:58:13.870 --> 01:58:13.880 align:start position:0%
investment when these resources are
 
01:58:16.830 --> 01:58:16.840 align:start position:0%
exposed to market price signals than
 
01:58:18.750 --> 01:58:18.760 align:start position:0%
than when they're just being traded on a
 
01:58:22.870 --> 01:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
regulatory basis and in the case of un's
 
01:58:24.870 --> 01:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
single access tracker they projected net
 
01:58:27.870 --> 01:58:27.880 align:start position:0%
benefits uh for customers in the system
 
01:58:29.589 --> 01:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
but if those net benefits are not
 
01:58:31.510 --> 01:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
realized customers will still be on the
 
01:58:33.430 --> 01:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
hook to pay for that investment
 
01:58:35.470 --> 01:58:35.480 align:start position:0%
eversource in their case distribution
 
01:58:37.229 --> 01:58:37.239 align:start position:0%
rate cases said we think we'll be
 
01:58:39.589 --> 01:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
proposing about five of these projects
 
01:58:41.950 --> 01:58:41.960 align:start position:0%
over the next a few years in the same
 
01:58:44.790 --> 01:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
manner that Unitil has as a load reducer
 
01:58:47.510 --> 01:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
where it produces the most value and
 
01:58:50.709 --> 01:58:50.719 align:start position:0%
this is simply saying let's piggy back
 
01:58:53.109 --> 01:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
onto fur
 
01:58:56.430 --> 01:58:56.440 align:start position:0%
um uh which came out under commissioner
 
01:58:59.510 --> 01:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
Neil Chatter's leadership at FK a trump
 
01:59:03.270 --> 01:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
appointee a former uh Chief of Staff to
 
01:59:05.950 --> 01:59:05.960 align:start position:0%
uh leader McConnell um he was one of the
 
01:59:09.229 --> 01:59:09.239 align:start position:0%
people Help drive this uh effort to open
 
01:59:13.189 --> 01:59:13.199 align:start position:0%
up uh competitive markets for smaller
 
01:59:15.990 --> 01:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
distributed energy resources recognizing
 
01:59:18.030 --> 01:59:18.040 align:start position:0%
that there's potentially a immense
 
01:59:19.589 --> 01:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
amount of value that and they can get
 
01:59:22.310 --> 01:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
built quickly we're going to have grown
 
01:59:26.589 --> 01:59:26.599 align:start position:0%
Demand with AI and all that deers can be
 
01:59:29.189 --> 01:59:29.199 align:start position:0%
deployed much more quickly than large
 
01:59:30.750 --> 01:59:30.760 align:start position:0%
new central power
 
01:59:33.109 --> 01:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
plants representative Corman has a
 
01:59:35.149 --> 01:59:35.159 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:59:37.990 --> 01:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question we're still in
 
01:59:40.069 --> 01:59:40.079 align:start position:0%
this world where uh at least for
 
01:59:41.790 --> 01:59:41.800 align:start position:0%
Community power customers and maybe
 
01:59:46.069 --> 01:59:46.079 align:start position:0%
third party um canet meter does this
 
01:59:49.270 --> 01:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
bill move the ball toward net metering
 
01:59:51.510 --> 01:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
for Community power and and third party
 
01:59:53.270 --> 01:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
yes would very much it would it would
 
01:59:56.790 --> 01:59:56.800 align:start position:0%
open up that net metering
 
01:59:59.430 --> 01:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be at the utility where
 
02:00:02.109 --> 02:00:02.119 align:start position:0%
you can get the most value it could be
 
02:00:03.990 --> 02:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
and and and this can help reduce cost
 
02:00:05.669 --> 02:00:05.679 align:start position:0%
shifting because if competitive
 
02:00:07.069 --> 02:00:07.079 align:start position:0%
suppliers and Community power
 
02:00:09.270 --> 02:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
aggregations can contract with these
 
02:00:11.350 --> 02:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
resources then there won't be anything
 
02:00:13.550 --> 02:00:13.560 align:start position:0%
that has to be paid out by the utility
 
02:00:15.629 --> 02:00:15.639 align:start position:0%
uh to compensate them so this is trying
 
02:00:19.350 --> 02:00:19.360 align:start position:0%
to create to to move net metering or the
 
02:00:22.589 --> 02:00:22.599 align:start position:0%
development of deers out of a high
 
02:00:25.669 --> 02:00:25.679 align:start position:0%
regulated um essentially Monopoly type
 
02:00:30.189 --> 02:00:30.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:33.030 --> 02:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
Market additional questions
 
02:00:35.950 --> 02:00:35.960 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan thank you Mr chair
 
02:00:39.229 --> 02:00:39.239 align:start position:0%
and thank you for coming in again for
 
02:00:40.589 --> 02:00:40.599 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:00:43.870 --> 02:00:43.880 align:start position:0%
um would you agree or would you say that
 
02:00:45.390 --> 02:00:45.400 align:start position:0%
what this bill is intended to do is to
 
02:00:48.390 --> 02:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
use Market forces uh in other words the
 
02:00:50.790 --> 02:00:50.800 align:start position:0%
benefits that distributed resources
 
02:00:53.030 --> 02:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
provide and are currently being
 
02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
privatized and held on to internalized
 
02:00:56.669 --> 02:00:56.679 align:start position:0%
by the accounting systems of the
 
02:00:58.390 --> 02:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
utilities what you're trying to do is
 
02:01:00.750 --> 02:01:00.760 align:start position:0%
just liberate those forces put them onto
 
02:01:02.310 --> 02:01:02.320 align:start position:0%
the market to
 
02:01:05.109 --> 02:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
incentivize growth in the use of
 
02:01:07.149 --> 02:01:07.159 align:start position:0%
distributed generation resources which
 
02:01:10.589 --> 02:01:10.599 align:start position:0%
as you mentioned are sorely needed in in
 
02:01:11.790 --> 02:01:11.800 align:start position:0%
the future because we're going to need
 
02:01:13.350 --> 02:01:13.360 align:start position:0%
more and more Generations so we should
 
02:01:15.990 --> 02:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
use an all above strategy and all you're
 
02:01:18.350 --> 02:01:18.360 align:start position:0%
saying is let's use those Market forces
 
02:01:20.669 --> 02:01:20.679 align:start position:0%
that right now are just it's inside the
 
02:01:22.589 --> 02:01:22.599 align:start position:0%
black box of the utility and they're
 
02:01:25.109 --> 02:01:25.119 align:start position:0%
holding on to them uh let's see what
 
02:01:27.430 --> 02:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
they are and let's use them to drive
 
02:01:31.030 --> 02:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
more growth in in in in resources right
 
02:01:33.950 --> 02:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
and and just using those Market signals
 
02:01:38.270 --> 02:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
uh to drive more prudent more optimal
 
02:01:41.189 --> 02:01:41.199 align:start position:0%
use of resources and and Investments and
 
02:01:44.229 --> 02:01:44.239 align:start position:0%
Investments that Ray payers are not at
 
02:01:47.350 --> 02:01:47.360 align:start position:0%
risk of if they don't prove
 
02:01:50.310 --> 02:01:50.320 align:start position:0%
out okay seeing no more questions we
 
02:01:52.470 --> 02:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for that testimony and next on
 
02:01:59.589 --> 02:01:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:07.470 --> 02:02:07.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:07.480 --> 02:02:09.270 align:start position:0%
 
again

02:02:09.270 --> 02:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:02:12.910 --> 02:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
on thank you uh chairman Vose members of
 
02:02:15.470 --> 02:02:15.480 align:start position:0%
the committee um it's nice to be back
 
02:02:18.030 --> 02:02:18.040 align:start position:0%
again in a bigger room we used to meet
 
02:02:19.750 --> 02:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
in half this space with the same number
 
02:02:22.030 --> 02:02:22.040 align:start position:0%
of people in it
 
02:02:23.990 --> 02:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas is not said I'm
 
02:02:27.149 --> 02:02:27.159 align:start position:0%
gonna not speak to my uh prepared
 
02:02:29.030 --> 02:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
remarks because I want to try and keep
 
02:02:31.870 --> 02:02:31.880 align:start position:0%
this short uh to your benefit but um I
 
02:02:33.390 --> 02:02:33.400 align:start position:0%
want to speak to an area where I have
 
02:02:36.870 --> 02:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
some expertise um and that's in it
 
02:02:41.270 --> 02:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
systems so um I'm a simple guy and I
 
02:02:43.790 --> 02:02:43.800 align:start position:0%
like to think of trying to get to
 
02:02:45.750 --> 02:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
complicate things as simple as possible
 
02:02:48.910 --> 02:02:48.920 align:start position:0%
and I think about you power delivery I
 
02:02:52.149 --> 02:02:52.159 align:start position:0%
think about what this committee did um
 
02:02:52.159 --> 02:02:53.149 align:start position:0%
think about what this committee did um
real

02:02:53.149 --> 02:02:53.159 align:start position:0%
real
 
02:02:56.790 --> 02:02:56.800 align:start position:0%
leadership um and shman V is right it's
 
02:03:01.189 --> 02:03:01.199 align:start position:0%
been almost 40 years now since in 96 the
 
02:03:05.790 --> 02:03:05.800 align:start position:0%
um this committee freed up um and made
 
02:03:07.830 --> 02:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
you know a competitive market of of
 
02:03:10.390 --> 02:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
power generation seeing no sense in
 
02:03:13.229 --> 02:03:13.239 align:start position:0%
regulating it so when you sort of think
 
02:03:15.550 --> 02:03:15.560 align:start position:0%
about the bolds that that make up the
 
02:03:18.270 --> 02:03:18.280 align:start position:0%
power delivery system we had one end of
 
02:03:19.990 --> 02:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
the spectrum we have the generation the
 
02:03:21.149 --> 02:03:21.159 align:start position:0%
other end of the spectrum we have the
 
02:03:22.790 --> 02:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
people consuming assuming that
 
02:03:25.430 --> 02:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
generation and major player in the
 
02:03:28.310 --> 02:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
middle that's regulated are the
 
02:03:31.910 --> 02:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
utilities um there is as you have heard
 
02:03:34.550 --> 02:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
and will have heard many years in a row
 
02:03:37.510 --> 02:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
I'm sure lots of ideas about how things
 
02:03:40.470 --> 02:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
could be more Innovative more
 
02:03:43.549 --> 02:03:43.559 align:start position:0%
competitive more cost effective if there
 
02:03:46.470 --> 02:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
was more competition between those two
 
02:03:49.750 --> 02:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
elements of the spectrum and invariably
 
02:03:52.030 --> 02:03:52.040 align:start position:0%
the reasons that come back frequently
 
02:03:54.270 --> 02:03:54.280 align:start position:0%
with poorly
 
02:03:58.030 --> 02:03:58.040 align:start position:0%
documented um cases is it's just going
 
02:04:00.709 --> 02:04:00.719 align:start position:0%
to be too expensive to do that and it's
 
02:04:02.430 --> 02:04:02.440 align:start position:0%
usually the utilities they're saying
 
02:04:05.030 --> 02:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
that today it's also the department of
 
02:04:05.040 --> 02:04:05.830 align:start position:0%
that today it's also the department of
of

02:04:05.830 --> 02:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:04:10.830 --> 02:04:10.840 align:start position:0%
energy um so one of the things I did uh
 
02:04:13.950 --> 02:04:13.960 align:start position:0%
in my career was Implement large it
 
02:04:17.750 --> 02:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
systems um Enterprise level systems I
 
02:04:22.149 --> 02:04:22.159 align:start position:0%
worked um LED for a while the conversion
 
02:04:24.350 --> 02:04:24.360 align:start position:0%
of the entire University system of New
 
02:04:27.910 --> 02:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to a modern system and I can
 
02:04:30.510 --> 02:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
tell you that what I'm hearing today are
 
02:04:32.189 --> 02:04:32.199 align:start position:0%
people representing
 
02:04:35.629 --> 02:04:35.639 align:start position:0%
technologies that existed back way
 
02:04:38.430 --> 02:04:38.440 align:start position:0%
before that shortly after we were
 
02:04:41.750 --> 02:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
storing memory on cores anyone knows
 
02:04:44.030 --> 02:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
what a core memory is your memory is
 
02:04:50.390 --> 02:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
pretty good um it's pre silicone so it's
 
02:04:53.109 --> 02:04:53.119 align:start position:0%
just if you think about if you were a
 
02:04:55.629 --> 02:04:55.639 align:start position:0%
Fortune 500 company or you know maybe
 
02:04:59.229 --> 02:04:59.239 align:start position:0%
even a mom and pop on the street today
 
02:05:02.310 --> 02:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
this is the 21st century we expect
 
02:05:04.709 --> 02:05:04.719 align:start position:0%
information when we want it and we
 
02:05:06.310 --> 02:05:06.320 align:start position:0%
expect to be able to get it in the palm
 
02:05:09.229 --> 02:05:09.239 align:start position:0%
of our hands most of the time there is
 
02:05:12.310 --> 02:05:12.320 align:start position:0%
no reason why a competitive industry
 
02:05:14.229 --> 02:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
should not be able to deliver
 
02:05:16.629 --> 02:05:16.639 align:start position:0%
information and whatever quantity is
 
02:05:19.629 --> 02:05:19.639 align:start position:0%
needed by whatever the demand is out
 
02:05:21.990 --> 02:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
there that bears it and the cost should
 
02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:22.870 align:start position:0%
there that bears it and the cost should
be

02:05:22.870 --> 02:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:05:25.990 --> 02:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
minimal the advances in information
 
02:05:28.430 --> 02:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
development systems is such that most
 
02:05:31.270 --> 02:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
companies 200 utility companies in the
 
02:05:34.709 --> 02:05:34.719 align:start position:0%
United States alone currently use third
 
02:05:37.270 --> 02:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
parties to provide their Enterprise
 
02:05:40.149 --> 02:05:40.159 align:start position:0%
systems at all levels whatever the the
 
02:05:42.830 --> 02:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
need is and the reason for that is
 
02:05:44.750 --> 02:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
because they can far more rapidly
 
02:05:47.750 --> 02:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
respond to demands they have far more
 
02:05:52.109 --> 02:05:52.119 align:start position:0%
resources they have scale and they have
 
02:05:55.189 --> 02:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
the technologies that you know a company
 
02:05:59.910 --> 02:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
whose business is not technology have so
 
02:06:03.270 --> 02:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
um that's it just makes sense so what
 
02:06:06.709 --> 02:06:06.719 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing is an industry that is not
 
02:06:10.950 --> 02:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
really using modern systems for modern
 
02:06:10.960 --> 02:06:12.910 align:start position:0%
really using modern systems for modern
needs

02:06:12.910 --> 02:06:12.920 align:start position:0%
needs
 
02:06:16.750 --> 02:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
so I to me this tells me two things
 
02:06:20.470 --> 02:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
there's a resistance to change a because
 
02:06:22.709 --> 02:06:22.719 align:start position:0%
it suits them just fine to stay where
 
02:06:27.510 --> 02:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
they are um they are controlling some of
 
02:06:31.350 --> 02:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
the resources by resistance to change
 
02:06:33.870 --> 02:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
and it works to their business Advantage
 
02:06:36.149 --> 02:06:36.159 align:start position:0%
perceived I don't think it's working to
 
02:06:38.910 --> 02:06:38.920 align:start position:0%
the customer's advantage and the other
 
02:06:42.510 --> 02:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
reason um that I think that this happens
 
02:06:45.870 --> 02:06:45.880 align:start position:0%
is who Bears the cost of doing these
 
02:06:48.870 --> 02:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
changes these are public corporations
 
02:06:52.950 --> 02:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
owned by investors
 
02:06:55.910 --> 02:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
if fundamental business processes are
 
02:06:57.229 --> 02:06:57.239 align:start position:0%
not being
 
02:07:00.430 --> 02:07:00.440 align:start position:0%
maintained who should pay for that
 
02:07:03.149 --> 02:07:03.159 align:start position:0%
should it be rate payers or should it be
 
02:07:03.159 --> 02:07:04.149 align:start position:0%
should it be rate payers or should it be
the

02:07:04.149 --> 02:07:04.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:07:06.589 --> 02:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
shareholders and I you know the it's a
 
02:07:09.069 --> 02:07:09.079 align:start position:0%
complicated question it's a question
 
02:07:11.229 --> 02:07:11.239 align:start position:0%
that a Public Utilities Commission would
 
02:07:14.229 --> 02:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
have to weigh in on and I think you know
 
02:07:16.870 --> 02:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
what I would encourage you to do is be
 
02:07:21.870 --> 02:07:21.880 align:start position:0%
bold as you were you know in 96
 
02:07:25.549 --> 02:07:25.559 align:start position:0%
open up which this bill does this
 
02:07:29.830 --> 02:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
bill handles all those little incomplete
 
02:07:31.790 --> 02:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
pieces of the
 
02:07:35.830 --> 02:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
law that rectify the situation and allow
 
02:07:38.430 --> 02:07:38.440 align:start position:0%
the Freedom of Information to flow back
 
02:07:40.750 --> 02:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
and forth between customers and
 
02:07:42.990 --> 02:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
producers and that's essentially what
 
02:07:44.669 --> 02:07:44.679 align:start position:0%
you're getting out of this Bill thank
 
02:07:46.430 --> 02:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
you very
 
02:07:49.310 --> 02:07:49.320 align:start position:0%
much well thank you appreciate you being
 
02:07:51.669 --> 02:07:51.679 align:start position:0%
here and giving us your perspective good
 
02:07:55.709 --> 02:07:55.719 align:start position:0%
to see you again uh you did mention as
 
02:07:58.510 --> 02:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
you spoke that you had experience in it
 
02:08:01.830 --> 02:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
systems during your working career yep
 
02:08:07.950 --> 02:08:07.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:10.950 --> 02:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
wondering electric companies offer
 
02:08:12.589 --> 02:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
Billing Services
 
02:08:12.599 --> 02:08:14.270 align:start position:0%
Billing Services
right

02:08:14.270 --> 02:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:08:17.149 --> 02:08:17.159 align:start position:0%
and the changes in this
 
02:08:21.510 --> 02:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
bill might not support uh no long there
 
02:08:22.990 --> 02:08:23.000 align:start position:0%
systems May no longer support the
 
02:08:25.470 --> 02:08:25.480 align:start position:0%
changes that that are envisioned by this
 
02:08:29.229 --> 02:08:29.239 align:start position:0%
bill so who would pay for those upgrades
 
02:08:31.470 --> 02:08:31.480 align:start position:0%
and how much would it
 
02:08:33.870 --> 02:08:33.880 align:start position:0%
cost uh thank you for that question
 
02:08:36.589 --> 02:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
representative Vose chairman Vose um so
 
02:08:39.229 --> 02:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
that I think there's some contention
 
02:08:41.189 --> 02:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
about that I mean one of the things that
 
02:08:44.549 --> 02:08:44.559 align:start position:0%
you can look at um we're talking about
 
02:08:46.830 --> 02:08:46.840 align:start position:0%
companies that en large not all the
 
02:08:48.950 --> 02:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
utilities in the state are you know
 
02:08:50.910 --> 02:08:50.920 align:start position:0%
owning proprietary systems that they
 
02:08:53.629 --> 02:08:53.639 align:start position:0%
built in house else some have moved to
 
02:08:56.189 --> 02:08:56.199 align:start position:0%
third party systems um some are in the
 
02:09:00.270 --> 02:09:00.280 align:start position:0%
process of doing that and I you know
 
02:09:02.510 --> 02:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
everything that we talked about today
 
02:09:05.069 --> 02:09:05.079 align:start position:0%
could be handled by a service it doesn't
 
02:09:08.709 --> 02:09:08.719 align:start position:0%
have to be you know uh a system inhouse
 
02:09:10.669 --> 02:09:10.679 align:start position:0%
there are services that will provide
 
02:09:13.109 --> 02:09:13.119 align:start position:0%
this billing is one of those services
 
02:09:15.030 --> 02:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
and some of these Integrated Systems can
 
02:09:17.750 --> 02:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
provide that and the question is
 
02:09:20.510 --> 02:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
you're here's the fundamental question
 
02:09:23.189 --> 02:09:23.199 align:start position:0%
technology that dates back you know to
 
02:09:25.709 --> 02:09:25.719 align:start position:0%
the last century and some parts of what
 
02:09:27.510 --> 02:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
I heard today sound like they dated back
 
02:09:30.669 --> 02:09:30.679 align:start position:0%
to the early parts of the you know per
 
02:09:33.709 --> 02:09:33.719 align:start position:0%
the creation of Technology it technology
 
02:09:37.510 --> 02:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
and its very infancy punch card
 
02:09:41.510 --> 02:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
technology um who owns the
 
02:09:43.910 --> 02:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility of porting that
 
02:09:47.149 --> 02:09:47.159 align:start position:0%
technology to where it is appropriate
 
02:09:50.390 --> 02:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
for today's use I think you know
 
02:09:52.470 --> 02:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
shareholders have some responsibility in
 
02:09:55.149 --> 02:09:55.159 align:start position:0%
that to maintain their companies so that
 
02:09:58.669 --> 02:09:58.679 align:start position:0%
they're truly competitive the problem is
 
02:09:59.950 --> 02:09:59.960 align:start position:0%
because they're
 
02:10:02.669 --> 02:10:02.679 align:start position:0%
regulated they have been able to avoid
 
02:10:02.679 --> 02:10:04.189 align:start position:0%
regulated they have been able to avoid
that

02:10:04.189 --> 02:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:10:09.270 --> 02:10:09.280 align:start position:0%
but it is it is a competitive space it
 
02:10:12.990 --> 02:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
um you know should be should be more
 
02:10:15.950 --> 02:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
competitive thank you representative
 
02:10:18.030 --> 02:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
Corman has a question for you thank you
 
02:10:20.109 --> 02:10:20.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and uh I want to follow on
 
02:10:22.790 --> 02:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
to Chairman Vose question uh I've
 
02:10:24.430 --> 02:10:24.440 align:start position:0%
actually been in computer science for
 
02:10:27.069 --> 02:10:27.079 align:start position:0%
over 50 years and I taught software
 
02:10:28.750 --> 02:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
design although I'm probably a little
 
02:10:30.790 --> 02:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
rusty these
 
02:10:34.549 --> 02:10:34.559 align:start position:0%
days can you talk about the elements of
 
02:10:39.470 --> 02:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
a billing system that would possibly
 
02:10:43.470 --> 02:10:43.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:43.480 --> 02:10:45.310 align:start position:0%
 
costs

02:10:45.310 --> 02:10:45.320 align:start position:0%
costs
 
02:10:48.189 --> 02:10:48.199 align:start position:0%
well I there's it's a that's a big
 
02:10:49.990 --> 02:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you uh for the question
 
02:10:52.390 --> 02:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
representative Corman uh
 
02:10:57.750 --> 02:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
um if you break down any
 
02:11:01.270 --> 02:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
system if there is change what you need
 
02:11:06.589 --> 02:11:06.599 align:start position:0%
is a system that is agile and robust for
 
02:11:08.229 --> 02:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
change and I think that's what you're
 
02:11:11.030 --> 02:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
talking about in all this the change is
 
02:11:12.750 --> 02:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
02:11:15.589 --> 02:11:15.599 align:start position:0%
required it sounds like and I don't have
 
02:11:18.189 --> 02:11:18.199 align:start position:0%
intimate knowledge of specific system of
 
02:11:20.310 --> 02:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
these utilities but it sounds like their
 
02:11:22.750 --> 02:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
systems are not Pro
 
02:11:27.549 --> 02:11:27.559 align:start position:0%
agile if you went to a major vendor and
 
02:11:29.510 --> 02:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
take sap for example it's one of the
 
02:11:31.950 --> 02:11:31.960 align:start position:0%
world's largest software vendors for
 
02:11:34.229 --> 02:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
making Enterprise
 
02:11:37.109 --> 02:11:37.119 align:start position:0%
systems they have specific systems for
 
02:11:40.109 --> 02:11:40.119 align:start position:0%
utilities which include billing
 
02:11:42.709 --> 02:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
systems they are able to produce these
 
02:11:45.750 --> 02:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
systems not only you know to fit
 
02:11:48.669 --> 02:11:48.679 align:start position:0%
particular State needs they they adapt
 
02:11:49.870 --> 02:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
their systems
 
02:11:52.510 --> 02:11:52.520 align:start position:0%
internationally so the the ability to
 
02:11:55.910 --> 02:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
change you know requirements in one
 
02:11:58.629 --> 02:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
environment to another is going to be a
 
02:12:02.350 --> 02:12:02.360 align:start position:0%
lot less burdensome than if some you
 
02:12:04.709 --> 02:12:04.719 align:start position:0%
know inhouse Computing group is going to
 
02:12:08.470 --> 02:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
have to do that work and bring forward U
 
02:12:12.069 --> 02:12:12.079 align:start position:0%
what may be a really Antiquated system
 
02:12:15.350 --> 02:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
so um that's where I'm getting at the
 
02:12:18.310 --> 02:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
cost who should have borne that cost and
 
02:12:21.830 --> 02:12:21.840 align:start position:0%
making the systems agile and robust and
 
02:12:25.030 --> 02:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
flexible to meet the 21st century needs
 
02:12:29.430 --> 02:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:31.430 --> 02:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
expense all right seeing no more
 
02:12:33.270 --> 02:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
questions I want to thank you Bill for
 
02:12:36.350 --> 02:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
being here nice to see you
 
02:12:38.950 --> 02:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
again next up is Jeremy Clark
 
02:12:43.830 --> 02:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:48.870 --> 02:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
Co-op oh he just stepped out all right
 
02:12:52.790 --> 02:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
um here he comes okay
 
02:12:54.549 --> 02:12:54.559 align:start position:0%
welcome Mr
 
02:12:56.549 --> 02:12:56.559 align:start position:0%
Clark thank you chairman Vose I'm going
 
02:12:57.950 --> 02:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
to try to be brief because I know time
 
02:12:59.270 --> 02:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
is of the essence and I have a parking
 
02:13:01.109 --> 02:13:01.119 align:start position:0%
meter I'm worried
 
02:13:03.709 --> 02:13:03.719 align:start position:0%
about so my name is Jeremy Clark I'm the
 
02:13:05.350 --> 02:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
financial planning analysis and race
 
02:13:06.750 --> 02:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
manager for New Hampshire Electric
 
02:13:08.229 --> 02:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
Cooperative and I'm here today to
 
02:13:11.030 --> 02:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
testify an opposition to HP 755 on
 
02:13:12.870 --> 02:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
behalf of the Cooperative we do
 
02:13:14.390 --> 02:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate some of the objectives of the
 
02:13:16.069 --> 02:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
legislation and share some of those
 
02:13:17.950 --> 02:13:17.960 align:start position:0%
however we do we do have some concerns
 
02:13:20.390 --> 02:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
about the impacts um as already
 
02:13:21.950 --> 02:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
discussed there are a lot of concerns
 
02:13:24.870 --> 02:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
about cost and we know that uh the bill
 
02:13:26.549 --> 02:13:26.559 align:start position:0%
concedes that it would cost you or the
 
02:13:29.990 --> 02:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh language uh Supply the testimony here
 
02:13:31.270 --> 02:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
says it would cost millions of dollars
 
02:13:33.310 --> 02:13:33.320 align:start position:0%
to implement for the co-op alone it
 
02:13:34.430 --> 02:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
would cost millions of dollars to
 
02:13:36.030 --> 02:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
implement these upgrades to our metering
 
02:13:37.950 --> 02:13:37.960 align:start position:0%
load sett settlement billing and
 
02:13:40.430 --> 02:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
customer service systems all of which
 
02:13:41.910 --> 02:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
we've borne by our
 
02:13:44.510 --> 02:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
members um also I think probably of
 
02:13:47.750 --> 02:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
interest is uh number two based upon our
 
02:13:49.430 --> 02:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
recent experience in trying to create a
 
02:13:52.030 --> 02:13:52.040 align:start position:0%
similar hourly pricing program it's not
 
02:13:53.589 --> 02:13:53.599 align:start position:0%
clear that this kind of system can
 
02:13:55.629 --> 02:13:55.639 align:start position:0%
actually work uh over the last few years
 
02:13:57.310 --> 02:13:57.320 align:start position:0%
we attempted to create a transactive
 
02:13:59.510 --> 02:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
energy rate um only to see it fail
 
02:14:01.149 --> 02:14:01.159 align:start position:0%
because we could not accurately build
 
02:14:03.750 --> 02:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
members um the goals of the te were kind
 
02:14:06.629 --> 02:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
of similar Dynamic pricing so we had a
 
02:14:08.430 --> 02:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
hourly rate fluctuating throughout the
 
02:14:10.589 --> 02:14:10.599 align:start position:0%
day uh based upon grid conditions and
 
02:14:11.870 --> 02:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
allowing members to optimize their
 
02:14:13.669 --> 02:14:13.679 align:start position:0%
energy usage by consuming more during
 
02:14:15.629 --> 02:14:15.639 align:start position:0%
lowcost periods and reducing their
 
02:14:17.830 --> 02:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
consumption when prices were high we
 
02:14:19.910 --> 02:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
also had the de integration as part of
 
02:14:22.270 --> 02:14:22.280 align:start position:0%
this uh allowing uh participants with
 
02:14:24.109 --> 02:14:24.119 align:start position:0%
home batteries or electric vehicles to
 
02:14:26.350 --> 02:14:26.360 align:start position:0%
grid um to be able to you know
 
02:14:29.470 --> 02:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
participate when uh to charge when uh
 
02:14:31.629 --> 02:14:31.639 align:start position:0%
prices were low and then discharge when
 
02:14:33.910 --> 02:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
prices were high to get that benefit and
 
02:14:36.149 --> 02:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
also provide members control to have the
 
02:14:38.510 --> 02:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
ability to manage their own use uh and
 
02:14:39.950 --> 02:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
to be able to make informed decisions
 
02:14:42.069 --> 02:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
about their consumption now despite
 
02:14:43.669 --> 02:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
numerous attempts we could not get our
 
02:14:45.990 --> 02:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
Billing System to work as intended uh
 
02:14:48.270 --> 02:14:48.280 align:start position:0%
nor could we adequately align hourly
 
02:14:50.149 --> 02:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
price signal forecasts with the actual
 
02:14:52.470 --> 02:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
results um we also realized that there
 
02:14:53.709 --> 02:14:53.719 align:start position:0%
were far fewer members who were
 
02:14:55.830 --> 02:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
interested in this uh than we originally
 
02:14:57.549 --> 02:14:57.559 align:start position:0%
thought or had the capability to
 
02:14:58.870 --> 02:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
actually take advantage of this
 
02:15:01.030 --> 02:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
technology in short it was simply too
 
02:15:02.189 --> 02:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
complicated and could not be
 
02:15:04.350 --> 02:15:04.360 align:start position:0%
operationalized and after a year more
 
02:15:05.830 --> 02:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
than a year of effort we had to abandon
 
02:15:08.750 --> 02:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
the project we also have some concerns
 
02:15:11.270 --> 02:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
about cost shifting as discussed um in
 
02:15:14.830 --> 02:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
the case of the te um you know the cost
 
02:15:16.629 --> 02:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
was born by all including low to
 
02:15:18.189 --> 02:15:18.199 align:start position:0%
moderate income members however the
 
02:15:19.990 --> 02:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
benefit in cost based rates is only
 
02:15:21.950 --> 02:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
going to the de our participants in the
 
02:15:23.990 --> 02:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
program and we were concerned that this
 
02:15:26.069 --> 02:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
was unfair and at our uh at odds with
 
02:15:27.990 --> 02:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
our pricing philosophy which aims to
 
02:15:29.629 --> 02:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
have individual members pay for the
 
02:15:31.310 --> 02:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
costs associated with those enhancements
 
02:15:33.950 --> 02:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
or changes to their service uh and then
 
02:15:34.990 --> 02:15:35.000 align:start position:0%
finally you know there's just the
 
02:15:37.669 --> 02:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
complexity of it um you know energy
 
02:15:40.030 --> 02:15:40.040 align:start position:0%
markets metering load management it's
 
02:15:41.750 --> 02:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
kind of exciting for someone who like me
 
02:15:43.950 --> 02:15:43.960 align:start position:0%
who deals with this every day but uh
 
02:15:45.589 --> 02:15:45.599 align:start position:0%
when I step outside of the cooperative
 
02:15:47.830 --> 02:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
and talk to you know friends and family
 
02:15:50.069 --> 02:15:50.079 align:start position:0%
their eyes glaze over and we in fact we
 
02:15:52.310 --> 02:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
find that most members really have a
 
02:15:53.990 --> 02:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
hard time understanding even basic solar
 
02:15:55.750 --> 02:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
interconnection requirements or
 
02:15:57.990 --> 02:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
unbundled rates let alone complex
 
02:16:00.270 --> 02:16:00.280 align:start position:0%
pricing like uh you know the TR in that
 
02:16:02.470 --> 02:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
case and in fact most members they
 
02:16:03.990 --> 02:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
simply want to know that their power is
 
02:16:06.870 --> 02:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
reliable and affordable so uh I thank
 
02:16:09.750 --> 02:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
you for that and I'm happy to answer any
 
02:16:13.470 --> 02:16:13.480 align:start position:0%
questions thank you I am a co-op member
 
02:16:15.950 --> 02:16:15.960 align:start position:0%
just to make that clear to everyone does
 
02:16:18.950 --> 02:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
the co-op currently use Ami meters yes
 
02:16:21.470 --> 02:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
we do okay thank you
 
02:16:23.629 --> 02:16:23.639 align:start position:0%
representative courtman thank you Mr
 
02:16:24.950 --> 02:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:16:27.390 --> 02:16:27.400 align:start position:0%
question um it it's interesting you you
 
02:16:29.350 --> 02:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
said that you actually tried to
 
02:16:31.270 --> 02:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
Institute time of use rates and people
 
02:16:34.669 --> 02:16:34.679 align:start position:0%
weren't taking them up um I know that
 
02:16:36.429 --> 02:16:36.439 align:start position:0%
I've looked at the Unitil rates and
 
02:16:38.190 --> 02:16:38.200 align:start position:0%
there's a really Stark difference
 
02:16:42.190 --> 02:16:42.200 align:start position:0%
between uh off peak and on Peak is it
 
02:16:44.429 --> 02:16:44.439 align:start position:0%
possible that people weren't taking up
 
02:16:46.709 --> 02:16:46.719 align:start position:0%
the rates because the difference was so
 
02:16:51.309 --> 02:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
severe and perhaps maybe uh making less
 
02:16:53.709 --> 02:16:53.719 align:start position:0%
severe might have had allowed people to
 
02:16:56.389 --> 02:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
take it up thank you for the question um
 
02:16:57.950 --> 02:16:57.960 align:start position:0%
first of all the Cooperative still does
 
02:16:59.990 --> 02:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
have time of use rates uh they're more
 
02:17:01.669 --> 02:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
of a traditional time of use rate we
 
02:17:03.669 --> 02:17:03.679 align:start position:0%
have that available for uh basic
 
02:17:05.589 --> 02:17:05.599 align:start position:0%
residential members and we also have a
 
02:17:07.389 --> 02:17:07.399 align:start position:0%
net metering time of day rate with on
 
02:17:10.150 --> 02:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
andof Peak pricing in both directions um
 
02:17:12.349 --> 02:17:12.359 align:start position:0%
but with regard to the te this was an
 
02:17:14.389 --> 02:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
hourly pricing and we found this uh the
 
02:17:16.030 --> 02:17:16.040 align:start position:0%
members found this to be extremely
 
02:17:17.950 --> 02:17:17.960 align:start position:0%
difficult to understand and also
 
02:17:20.150 --> 02:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
especially the device integration with
 
02:17:22.150 --> 02:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
these uh various manufacturers with
 
02:17:24.270 --> 02:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
battery storage electric vehic vehicle
 
02:17:26.750 --> 02:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
to grid and then also the Billing System
 
02:17:30.030 --> 02:17:30.040 align:start position:0%
impl uh imple implications uh made it
 
02:17:32.190 --> 02:17:32.200 align:start position:0%
very difficult so we still do offer the
 
02:17:34.509 --> 02:17:34.519 align:start position:0%
traditional time of day options we have
 
02:17:36.950 --> 02:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
very little um uptake of those but they
 
02:17:40.190 --> 02:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:42.230 --> 02:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
members okay further questions
 
02:17:44.469 --> 02:17:44.479 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington could you
 
02:17:45.469 --> 02:17:45.479 align:start position:0%
expound a little bit when you say
 
02:17:47.830 --> 02:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
traditional time of day or time of right
 
02:17:50.110 --> 02:17:50.120 align:start position:0%
could you tell me what that implies sure
 
02:17:52.190 --> 02:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
so uh for inance since for we have two
 
02:17:53.509 --> 02:17:53.519 align:start position:0%
different programs with different hours
 
02:17:55.030 --> 02:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
this work gets complex when you add more
 
02:17:57.030 --> 02:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
and more programs on for our basic
 
02:17:58.910 --> 02:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
residential members if they so choose
 
02:18:00.509 --> 02:18:00.519 align:start position:0%
they can participate any time of day
 
02:18:03.230 --> 02:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
rate um and the on peak hours are 7
 
02:18:05.469 --> 02:18:05.479 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the morning until 11 o'clock
 
02:18:07.270 --> 02:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
at night Monday through Friday non-
 
02:18:09.030 --> 02:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
holiday there's also an electric vehicle
 
02:18:10.309 --> 02:18:10.319 align:start position:0%
component if you want to subm your
 
02:18:12.150 --> 02:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
electric vehicle and then off peaker all
 
02:18:13.870 --> 02:18:13.880 align:start position:0%
the other hours nights and weekends and
 
02:18:16.030 --> 02:18:16.040 align:start position:0%
holidays and then we have a net metering
 
02:18:17.629 --> 02:18:17.639 align:start position:0%
time of day where we designed that more
 
02:18:19.230 --> 02:18:19.240 align:start position:0%
recently we actually designed that right
 
02:18:21.270 --> 02:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
around the same time as the te
 
02:18:23.309 --> 02:18:23.319 align:start position:0%
uh we kept it though because it really
 
02:18:24.990 --> 02:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't have much overhead to implement
 
02:18:27.110 --> 02:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
with our current systems and that has
 
02:18:30.469 --> 02:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
only a 4-Hour Peak uh from 4:00 to 8:00
 
02:18:32.389 --> 02:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
Monday through Friday non holiday
 
02:18:33.950 --> 02:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
because that's when most of our Peaks
 
02:18:35.910 --> 02:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
typically happen transmission and also
 
02:18:38.190 --> 02:18:38.200 align:start position:0%
capacity um but again you know we we
 
02:18:39.589 --> 02:18:39.599 align:start position:0%
have not have much uptake in either of
 
02:18:39.599 --> 02:18:40.750 align:start position:0%
have not have much uptake in either of
those

02:18:40.750 --> 02:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:18:43.669 --> 02:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
programs representative Bernardi has a
 
02:18:48.910 --> 02:18:48.920 align:start position:0%
question thank you chair so
 
02:18:52.910 --> 02:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh when you tried this system uh one of
 
02:18:55.709 --> 02:18:55.719 align:start position:0%
the things that's been uh articulated
 
02:18:59.709 --> 02:18:59.719 align:start position:0%
here is that that the claim of high cost
 
02:18:59.719 --> 02:19:00.669 align:start position:0%
here is that that the claim of high cost
is

02:19:00.669 --> 02:19:00.679 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:19:03.669 --> 02:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
because utilities are trying to do this
 
02:19:05.830 --> 02:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
with their own workforces and make their
 
02:19:09.230 --> 02:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
own uh it departments develop all these
 
02:19:11.990 --> 02:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
systems and not using external
 
02:19:15.830 --> 02:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
contractors who are fcil in these uh
 
02:19:19.150 --> 02:19:19.160 align:start position:0%
activities what did uh the co-op do use
 
02:19:20.750 --> 02:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
internal systems or did you kind
 
02:19:23.309 --> 02:19:23.319 align:start position:0%
contract both uh so there were some
 
02:19:25.509 --> 02:19:25.519 align:start position:0%
internal projects especially related to
 
02:19:28.509 --> 02:19:28.519 align:start position:0%
cost unique to New Hampshire however our
 
02:19:30.349 --> 02:19:30.359 align:start position:0%
um our software vender for billing and
 
02:19:32.790 --> 02:19:32.800 align:start position:0%
all other systems pretty much is an the
 
02:19:35.349 --> 02:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
nisc platform which is also Cooperative
 
02:19:37.629 --> 02:19:37.639 align:start position:0%
that serves over 900 cooperatives so
 
02:19:39.070 --> 02:19:39.080 align:start position:0%
they provided some of the functionality
 
02:19:40.349 --> 02:19:40.359 align:start position:0%
and there was a lot of custom
 
02:19:41.830 --> 02:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
programming involved that they had to
 
02:19:45.429 --> 02:19:45.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:47.990 --> 02:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
you okay seeing no further questions
 
02:19:49.510 --> 02:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
we'll give the last word on this
 
02:19:54.230 --> 02:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:02.910 --> 02:20:02.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:05.830 --> 02:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
back thank you uh again Michael AATA
 
02:20:08.469 --> 02:20:08.479 align:start position:0%
representing ever Source energy again
 
02:20:10.030 --> 02:20:10.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to testify
 
02:20:14.670 --> 02:20:14.680 align:start position:0%
before you today uh and again uh great
 
02:20:16.910 --> 02:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
respect for the bill sponsor and her
 
02:20:19.510 --> 02:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
goals uh and her desire to to move
 
02:20:22.030 --> 02:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
forward on a number of very complicated
 
02:20:25.710 --> 02:20:25.720 align:start position:0%
uh issues uh however eversource is again
 
02:20:29.950 --> 02:20:29.960 align:start position:0%
uh opposed to uh this legislation um and
 
02:20:31.870 --> 02:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll try to keep this high level
 
02:20:34.429 --> 02:20:34.439 align:start position:0%
and brief I understand you uh have other
 
02:20:37.710 --> 02:20:37.720 align:start position:0%
business to attend to but at its core uh
 
02:20:40.030 --> 02:20:40.040 align:start position:0%
this legislation is really an attempt to
 
02:20:42.590 --> 02:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
radically change how New Hampshire's
 
02:20:45.309 --> 02:20:45.319 align:start position:0%
Electric utilities settle load with ISO
 
02:20:47.790 --> 02:20:47.800 align:start position:0%
New England in a way that we believe
 
02:20:50.309 --> 02:20:50.319 align:start position:0%
will drastically increase costs for all
 
02:20:53.230 --> 02:20:53.240 align:start position:0%
customer customers with a goal to
 
02:20:55.469 --> 02:20:55.479 align:start position:0%
advance the business interests of one
 
02:20:58.070 --> 02:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
unregulated entity in the state who has
 
02:21:00.550 --> 02:21:00.560 align:start position:0%
expressed a desire for this additional
 
02:21:03.990 --> 02:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
functionality and changes to our systems
 
02:21:06.790 --> 02:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
today all of New Hampshire's utilities
 
02:21:08.990 --> 02:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
accurately settle load with ISO New
 
02:21:11.830 --> 02:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
England we use the same process that
 
02:21:14.150 --> 02:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
nearly every other utility across New
 
02:21:17.510 --> 02:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
England uses this process accurately
 
02:21:20.950 --> 02:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
accounts for reductions in load due to
 
02:21:24.990 --> 02:21:25.000 align:start position:0%
conservation Energy Efficiency or
 
02:21:27.750 --> 02:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
exports from distributed energy or the
 
02:21:31.270 --> 02:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
usage or load reduction at the site of
 
02:21:34.429 --> 02:21:34.439 align:start position:0%
the DG where it is offsetting the the
 
02:21:36.389 --> 02:21:36.399 align:start position:0%
load and actually being used to serve
 
02:21:39.990 --> 02:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
the customer where the DG is located any
 
02:21:43.030 --> 02:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
reductions in load today under our load
 
02:21:47.030 --> 02:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
settlement process are accounted for and
 
02:21:50.190 --> 02:21:50.200 align:start position:0%
those savings if they exist are shared
 
02:21:52.590 --> 02:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
with all customers including those who
 
02:21:55.270 --> 02:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
are on competitive Supply and that is
 
02:21:58.030 --> 02:21:58.040 align:start position:0%
allocated proportionately based upon
 
02:22:00.910 --> 02:22:00.920 align:start position:0%
each suppliers share of load that they
 
02:22:03.910 --> 02:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
serve there isn't some pot of money that
 
02:22:07.429 --> 02:22:07.439 align:start position:0%
isn't being accounted for all savings
 
02:22:09.710 --> 02:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
associated with either exports or
 
02:22:12.230 --> 02:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
reductions in load are accounted for if
 
02:22:14.670 --> 02:22:14.680 align:start position:0%
they reduce transmission Peaks if they
 
02:22:17.230 --> 02:22:17.240 align:start position:0%
reduce capacity Peaks if they reduce the
 
02:22:19.190 --> 02:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
amount of electricity that needs to be
 
02:22:21.790 --> 02:22:21.800 align:start position:0%
purchased it is a accounted for and it
 
02:22:24.870 --> 02:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
is shared back to customers that is a
 
02:22:30.190 --> 02:22:30.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:34.469 --> 02:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
point the bill before you today would
 
02:22:37.110 --> 02:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
require different metering different
 
02:22:39.790 --> 02:22:39.800 align:start position:0%
accounting for exports and create an
 
02:22:42.469 --> 02:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
entirely new class of customer called
 
02:22:44.870 --> 02:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
load reducers that would be entitled to
 
02:22:47.590 --> 02:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
specific benefits and privileges that
 
02:22:49.550 --> 02:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
presumably other customers would not be
 
02:22:52.590 --> 02:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:55.870 --> 02:22:55.880 align:start position:0%
at its Essence the bill would require
 
02:22:58.110 --> 02:22:58.120 align:start position:0%
all of New Hampshire's utilities to
 
02:23:02.230 --> 02:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
offer individualized variable customers
 
02:23:06.630 --> 02:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
customer specific rates in order to do
 
02:23:09.750 --> 02:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
this utilities as you have heard would
 
02:23:12.750 --> 02:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
have to make hundreds of millions of
 
02:23:13.990 --> 02:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
dollars in
 
02:23:16.429 --> 02:23:16.439 align:start position:0%
Investments and change how their load
 
02:23:19.429 --> 02:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
settlement processes exist today and
 
02:23:21.230 --> 02:23:21.240 align:start position:0%
become outliers
 
02:23:23.349 --> 02:23:23.359 align:start position:0%
in the iso New England
 
02:23:26.150 --> 02:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
region that is concerning for us it
 
02:23:30.230 --> 02:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
creates variability additional cost and
 
02:23:32.750 --> 02:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
the potential under the bill for
 
02:23:35.309 --> 02:23:35.319 align:start position:0%
inaccurate readings and inaccurate load
 
02:23:38.030 --> 02:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
settlement with ISO New England and as
 
02:23:40.950 --> 02:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
the entity that settles load the utility
 
02:23:46.550 --> 02:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:49.389 --> 02:23:49.399 align:start position:0%
information because we accurately settle
 
02:23:52.070 --> 02:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
load today and account for reductions in
 
02:23:54.349 --> 02:23:54.359 align:start position:0%
load essentially what the bill is
 
02:23:57.349 --> 02:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
proposing is Shifting costs among
 
02:23:59.309 --> 02:23:59.319 align:start position:0%
different customer groups there would
 
02:24:02.230 --> 02:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
not be overall customer savings there
 
02:24:05.550 --> 02:24:05.560 align:start position:0%
would simply be winners and losers there
 
02:24:07.030 --> 02:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
would be customers who would see a
 
02:24:09.110 --> 02:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
reduction in their bills or suppliers
 
02:24:11.349 --> 02:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
who would see a reduction in their bills
 
02:24:13.389 --> 02:24:13.399 align:start position:0%
if we were able to get the functionality
 
02:24:15.990 --> 02:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
to work as intended under the bill and
 
02:24:17.950 --> 02:24:17.960 align:start position:0%
there would be customers who would see
 
02:24:21.990 --> 02:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:24.110 --> 02:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
for all of
 
02:24:28.030 --> 02:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
that the minimal savings because again
 
02:24:29.950 --> 02:24:29.960 align:start position:0%
this is accounted for under the process
 
02:24:32.070 --> 02:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
today so you're really talking about the
 
02:24:36.950 --> 02:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
Delta uh between today and the future uh
 
02:24:39.790 --> 02:24:39.800 align:start position:0%
again we would be spending hundreds of
 
02:24:42.550 --> 02:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars on a regime that we
 
02:24:44.550 --> 02:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
don't know whether it could would be
 
02:24:46.429 --> 02:24:46.439 align:start position:0%
workable or
 
02:24:49.830 --> 02:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
not uh I'll leave it there um I'm happy
 
02:24:51.750 --> 02:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
to answer questions uh that the
 
02:24:54.590 --> 02:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
committee may have uh I guess my final
 
02:24:57.910 --> 02:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
word is these are extremely technically
 
02:25:00.630 --> 02:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
complex Concepts and I would encourage
 
02:25:03.030 --> 02:25:03.040 align:start position:0%
the the committee and the legislature if
 
02:25:05.190 --> 02:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
they don't have a full understanding of
 
02:25:07.110 --> 02:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
the implications of a piece of
 
02:25:10.190 --> 02:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
legislation to defer action and not move
 
02:25:12.550 --> 02:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
forward with a bill that they don't
 
02:25:15.750 --> 02:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
fully know the Implement implementations
 
02:25:18.230 --> 02:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
of Passage thank
 
02:25:21.110 --> 02:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
you thank you appreciate that
 
02:25:24.590 --> 02:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
testimony frequently when I'm trying to
 
02:25:27.950 --> 02:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
evaluate complex legislation like this I
 
02:25:32.110 --> 02:25:32.120 align:start position:0%
ask questions of my old pal chat
 
02:25:36.269 --> 02:25:36.279 align:start position:0%
GPT and I asked chat GPT the other day
 
02:25:39.950 --> 02:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
uh uh about the term load reducer and
 
02:25:43.710 --> 02:25:43.720 align:start position:0%
chat GPT told me that it is not a widely
 
02:25:46.309 --> 02:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
accepted or standardized Concept in
 
02:25:46.319 --> 02:25:48.030 align:start position:0%
accepted or standardized Concept in
utility

02:25:48.030 --> 02:25:48.040 align:start position:0%
utility
 
02:25:50.710 --> 02:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
regulation does that jive with your
 
02:25:52.790 --> 02:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
understanding so the traditional way
 
02:25:55.870 --> 02:25:55.880 align:start position:0%
that utilities or or really the standard
 
02:25:57.790 --> 02:25:57.800 align:start position:0%
definition of a load
 
02:26:01.990 --> 02:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
reducer is in this context is uh a
 
02:26:05.110 --> 02:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
distributed generation resource that is
 
02:26:08.750 --> 02:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
reducing load on site so imagine a
 
02:26:12.630 --> 02:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
customer has solar instead of purchasing
 
02:26:15.030 --> 02:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
electricity from uh the electric
 
02:26:17.790 --> 02:26:17.800 align:start position:0%
distribution system their solar is
 
02:26:20.550 --> 02:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
serving them thus the utility sees a
 
02:26:26.190 --> 02:26:26.200 align:start position:0%
reduction in load and 30 around 34 of
 
02:26:29.070 --> 02:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
behindth meter solar output is used in
 
02:26:32.349 --> 02:26:32.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire today to reduce on-site
 
02:26:35.030 --> 02:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
load what this bill would do is is
 
02:26:37.950 --> 02:26:37.960 align:start position:0%
really radically expand that definition
 
02:26:41.070 --> 02:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
to say not only are you reducing load at
 
02:26:43.429 --> 02:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
the customer generator site but you're
 
02:26:46.110 --> 02:26:46.120 align:start position:0%
also reducing load for the overall
 
02:26:48.070 --> 02:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
system and all your your friends and
 
02:26:50.750 --> 02:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
neighbors uh which doesn't take into
 
02:26:54.469 --> 02:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
account the fact that that generation
 
02:26:57.349 --> 02:26:57.359 align:start position:0%
Source relies upon the distribution
 
02:26:59.910 --> 02:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
system in order to essentially get their
 
02:27:01.790 --> 02:27:01.800 align:start position:0%
product to Market and that there is
 
02:27:06.510 --> 02:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:11.510 --> 02:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:14.670 --> 02:27:14.680 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none okay we thank you
 
02:27:17.190 --> 02:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
and we'll close the public hearing now
 
02:27:20.510 --> 02:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 755
 
02:27:23.830 --> 02:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
so that we can immediately move into a
 
02:27:27.150 --> 02:27:27.160 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill
 
02:27:31.110 --> 02:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
761 relative to customer energy storage
 
02:27:33.750 --> 02:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
and I'll call on the prime sponsor
 
02:27:37.510 --> 02:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas Corman to explain
 
02:27:39.630 --> 02:27:39.640 align:start position:0%
this legislation to us Mr chair there's
 
02:27:39.640 --> 02:27:40.590 align:start position:0%
this legislation to us Mr chair there's
a

02:27:40.590 --> 02:27:40.600 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:27:43.389 --> 02:27:43.399 align:start position:0%
question yes representative parshall
 
02:27:45.190 --> 02:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
than your chair V at some point could
 
02:27:47.309 --> 02:27:47.319 align:start position:0%
you get the online numbers uh for people
 
02:27:49.429 --> 02:27:49.439 align:start position:0%
have spend the testimony not not right
 
02:27:51.750 --> 02:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
now but when it's
 
02:27:53.630 --> 02:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:27:56.150 --> 02:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
representative PL I'll ask you to work
 
02:28:08.910 --> 02:28:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:11.469 --> 02:28:11.479 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you Mr chairman for the
 
02:28:16.550 --> 02:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
record Tom Corman I represent Grafton 15
 
02:28:20.550 --> 02:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
which is Ward three of the
 
02:28:23.110 --> 02:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
micropolitan city of
 
02:28:26.910 --> 02:28:26.920 align:start position:0%
Lebanon and I'm here to introduce HB 761
 
02:28:29.349 --> 02:28:29.359 align:start position:0%
which is about storage I actually think
 
02:28:31.030 --> 02:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
we don't talk enough about storage in
 
02:28:33.230 --> 02:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
this committee and I think we're going
 
02:28:35.469 --> 02:28:35.479 align:start position:0%
to be talking about it more and more as
 
02:28:36.950 --> 02:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
time goes
 
02:28:40.309 --> 02:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
on the beauty of storage is that it
 
02:28:43.670 --> 02:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
allows us to time shift generation you
 
02:28:48.309 --> 02:28:48.319 align:start position:0%
can generate at one time and then make
 
02:28:51.150 --> 02:28:51.160 align:start position:0%
that power that energy available at
 
02:28:54.110 --> 02:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
another time so for example I have solar
 
02:28:56.630 --> 02:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
panels on my house and I also have 30
 
02:28:58.910 --> 02:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
kwatt hours of batteries in my
 
02:29:01.269 --> 02:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
basement my solar panels are very
 
02:29:04.070 --> 02:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
productive at solar noon which is not
 
02:29:06.670 --> 02:29:06.680 align:start position:0%
exactly the peak time for when the power
 
02:29:09.670 --> 02:29:09.680 align:start position:0%
is needed so what I'm doing is I'm using
 
02:29:11.950 --> 02:29:11.960 align:start position:0%
some of that power but I'm storing most
 
02:29:13.110 --> 02:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
of it in my
 
02:29:16.429 --> 02:29:16.439 align:start position:0%
batteries now I can't currently take
 
02:29:18.750 --> 02:29:18.760 align:start position:0%
that power that's in my batteries and
 
02:29:22.870 --> 02:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
put it out onto the Grid at peak times
 
02:29:25.190 --> 02:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
it would be lovely to be able to do that
 
02:29:27.469 --> 02:29:27.479 align:start position:0%
but I I can't because I can't net meter
 
02:29:29.830 --> 02:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
that and that's what this bill is trying
 
02:29:33.070 --> 02:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
to resolve that we should be able to net
 
02:29:35.429 --> 02:29:35.439 align:start position:0%
meter from
 
02:29:39.830 --> 02:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
batteries Battery Technology is rapidly
 
02:29:41.790 --> 02:29:41.800 align:start position:0%
changing I know that we think of the
 
02:29:43.830 --> 02:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
lithium ion batteries that we have now
 
02:29:45.510 --> 02:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
and we think of some of the disasters
 
02:29:47.389 --> 02:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
like what just happened at Moss Landing
 
02:29:50.070 --> 02:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
a few weeks ago but Battery Tech
 
02:29:51.429 --> 02:29:51.439 align:start position:0%
technology is
 
02:29:54.269 --> 02:29:54.279 align:start position:0%
changing and we're seeing things like
 
02:29:57.389 --> 02:29:57.399 align:start position:0%
iron air batteries and if you recall a
 
02:29:59.110 --> 02:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
week from today I'm going to be at the
 
02:30:02.070 --> 02:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
factory in wton West Virginia that is
 
02:30:05.790 --> 02:30:05.800 align:start position:0%
making iron air batteries for the 8.5
 
02:30:08.630 --> 02:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
gigatt hour installation in Lincoln
 
02:30:11.429 --> 02:30:11.439 align:start position:0%
Maine so we're going to be seeing that
 
02:30:13.590 --> 02:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
we're seeing what's happening at
 
02:30:15.910 --> 02:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
Schiller and maramax station where
 
02:30:18.950 --> 02:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
battery installations are going
 
02:30:22.630 --> 02:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
in there are also solid state batteries
 
02:30:25.510 --> 02:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
that are coming down the pike and
 
02:30:27.590 --> 02:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
they're they're becoming
 
02:30:31.230 --> 02:30:31.240 align:start position:0%
real Hyundai and Honda are opening
 
02:30:33.070 --> 02:30:33.080 align:start position:0%
factories to create solid state
 
02:30:35.429 --> 02:30:35.439 align:start position:0%
batteries and solid state batteries just
 
02:30:39.429 --> 02:30:39.439 align:start position:0%
to fill you in on that a traditional
 
02:30:42.389 --> 02:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
lithium ion battery has a liquid
 
02:30:45.389 --> 02:30:45.399 align:start position:0%
electrolyte solid state battery has a
 
02:30:47.389 --> 02:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
solid electrolyte it has nothing to do
 
02:30:49.110 --> 02:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
with solid state chips it's just a
 
02:30:51.030 --> 02:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
matter of what the Electro is like and
 
02:30:52.830 --> 02:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
there's actually something in between
 
02:30:55.910 --> 02:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
that's also being developed with a gel
 
02:30:58.150 --> 02:30:58.160 align:start position:0%
electrolyte the beauty of solid state
 
02:30:59.990 --> 02:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
batteries is they're much more energy
 
02:31:03.349 --> 02:31:03.359 align:start position:0%
dense than lithium ion they charge up
 
02:31:05.950 --> 02:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
much quicker so you know you you think
 
02:31:07.750 --> 02:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
about uh if you're driving an EV and
 
02:31:10.349 --> 02:31:10.359 align:start position:0%
you've got to stop to charge and it's
 
02:31:12.990 --> 02:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
going to take a while it'll take a lot
 
02:31:16.950 --> 02:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
less and they're a lot less prone to the
 
02:31:20.750 --> 02:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
fires that we see so when we think about
 
02:31:22.670 --> 02:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
batteries don't think about batteries
 
02:31:25.030 --> 02:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
today think about what batteries are
 
02:31:28.349 --> 02:31:28.359 align:start position:0%
going to be so the purpose of this bill
 
02:31:33.070 --> 02:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
is simply to allow for net metering for
 
02:31:36.389 --> 02:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
storage so that people who have storage
 
02:31:39.309 --> 02:31:39.319 align:start position:0%
can actually take that power when the
 
02:31:42.830 --> 02:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
power is not needed for the grid store
 
02:31:46.030 --> 02:31:46.040 align:start position:0%
it and then put it out onto the grid and
 
02:31:49.870 --> 02:31:49.880 align:start position:0%
this bill just says that the uh the DOE
 
02:31:51.550 --> 02:31:51.560 align:start position:0%
Department of energy should adopt rules
 
02:31:54.469 --> 02:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
and the Public Utilities Commission will
 
02:31:56.349 --> 02:31:56.359 align:start position:0%
approve the tariffs and issue the orders
 
02:32:00.349 --> 02:32:00.359 align:start position:0%
in proceedings to allow for net metering
 
02:32:00.359 --> 02:32:01.870 align:start position:0%
in proceedings to allow for net metering
from

02:32:01.870 --> 02:32:01.880 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:32:04.630 --> 02:32:04.640 align:start position:0%
batteries um and that's really what the
 
02:32:09.230 --> 02:32:09.240 align:start position:0%
spill's about okay pretty simple thank
 
02:32:11.950 --> 02:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
you representative Harrington has a
 
02:32:14.190 --> 02:32:14.200 align:start position:0%
question for you yeah thank you then you
 
02:32:16.469 --> 02:32:16.479 align:start position:0%
for take my question well from the uh
 
02:32:18.830 --> 02:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
the grid perspective I I don't think it
 
02:32:20.429 --> 02:32:20.439 align:start position:0%
makes any difference whether the
 
02:32:22.750 --> 02:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
electricity is coming directly from a
 
02:32:25.230 --> 02:32:25.240 align:start position:0%
solar panel back out to the distribution
 
02:32:27.950 --> 02:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
system when you're producing less more
 
02:32:30.269 --> 02:32:30.279 align:start position:0%
than you consume or if it's going from a
 
02:32:32.269 --> 02:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
solar panel into a battery and waits a
 
02:32:34.190 --> 02:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
few hours then goes back out on the
 
02:32:35.910 --> 02:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
distribution system it's there's no
 
02:32:38.309 --> 02:32:38.319 align:start position:0%
difference that I can see is there I
 
02:32:40.389 --> 02:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
actually think there is a difference so
 
02:32:42.990 --> 02:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
if I'm producing a lot at solar noon and
 
02:32:45.830 --> 02:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
it's not really needed at solar noon by
 
02:32:48.469 --> 02:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
the grid as a whole it's not doing much
 
02:32:50.190 --> 02:32:50.200 align:start position:0%
good for me to do that and and I've
 
02:32:53.070 --> 02:32:53.080 align:start position:0%
heard that criticism of solar uh from
 
02:32:57.070 --> 02:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
this very committee so by storing it at
 
02:32:59.990 --> 02:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
my house in my batteries which by the
 
02:33:02.389 --> 02:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
way might be in a car and then putting
 
02:33:04.550 --> 02:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
it back out onto the Grid at a time when
 
02:33:06.630 --> 02:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
it's actually needed I'm actually
 
02:33:09.389 --> 02:33:09.399 align:start position:0%
providing a benefit to the
 
02:33:12.389 --> 02:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
grid followup followup no I wasn't
 
02:33:13.790 --> 02:33:13.800 align:start position:0%
referring so much to the time of day but
 
02:33:15.349 --> 02:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
just to the physics of it as far as the
 
02:33:17.750 --> 02:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
Grid's concerned if you're putting out
 
02:33:19.349 --> 02:33:19.359 align:start position:0%
the same amount of electricity whether
 
02:33:22.670 --> 02:33:22.680 align:start position:0%
it's it 2:00 in the afternoon or or 4:00
 
02:33:25.269 --> 02:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
in the morning it's there may be a
 
02:33:27.190 --> 02:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
different need but the electric physics
 
02:33:28.750 --> 02:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
of it doesn't
 
02:33:30.990 --> 02:33:31.000 align:start position:0%
change well I agree that the electric
 
02:33:32.950 --> 02:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
physics doesn't change but the point is
 
02:33:35.030 --> 02:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
that I'd be putting it out when it's
 
02:33:37.510 --> 02:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
actually needed
 
02:33:40.269 --> 02:33:40.279 align:start position:0%
okay additional questions representative
 
02:33:43.429 --> 02:33:43.439 align:start position:0%
rolds has one thank you Mr chairman
 
02:33:45.630 --> 02:33:45.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Tom for being here introduc in
 
02:33:48.590 --> 02:33:48.600 align:start position:0%
the bill Al even although you spent some
 
02:33:52.030 --> 02:33:52.040 align:start position:0%
time educating us on the
 
02:33:54.469 --> 02:33:54.479 align:start position:0%
various battery
 
02:33:54.479 --> 02:33:57.070 align:start position:0%
various battery
technologies

02:33:57.070 --> 02:33:57.080 align:start position:0%
technologies
 
02:34:00.150 --> 02:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
um there's nothing about tech Battery
 
02:34:04.630 --> 02:34:04.640 align:start position:0%
Technology in this bill and so
 
02:34:09.710 --> 02:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:14.030 --> 02:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
that battery owners would be bearing all
 
02:34:16.550 --> 02:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
their technological risk you know
 
02:34:18.349 --> 02:34:18.359 align:start position:0%
whatever kind of battery they might have
 
02:34:21.269 --> 02:34:21.279 align:start position:0%
now or procure in the future this
 
02:34:21.279 --> 02:34:22.790 align:start position:0%
now or procure in the future this
legislation

02:34:22.790 --> 02:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
02:34:22.800 --> 02:34:24.429 align:start position:0%
legislation
is

02:34:24.429 --> 02:34:24.439 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:34:28.990 --> 02:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
technology um neutral right technology
 
02:34:32.150 --> 02:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh doesn't say doesn't say anything
 
02:34:33.950 --> 02:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
about the technology the the owners of
 
02:34:37.790 --> 02:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
the batteries would be at risk for their
 
02:34:39.830 --> 02:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
choice that's right and and the reason I
 
02:34:41.830 --> 02:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
I talked about the the technology
 
02:34:43.230 --> 02:34:43.240 align:start position:0%
changes that we're seeing is because I
 
02:34:44.429 --> 02:34:44.439 align:start position:0%
think we're going to be seeing more and
 
02:34:47.269 --> 02:34:47.279 align:start position:0%
more batteries certainly with EVS but
 
02:34:49.830 --> 02:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
just in general as as the technology is
 
02:34:52.469 --> 02:34:52.479 align:start position:0%
improving I don't think um that I'm
 
02:34:54.950 --> 02:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
going to have an iron air battery at my
 
02:34:57.110 --> 02:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
house I you know these are utility scale
 
02:34:59.150 --> 02:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
batteries they take a lot of area and
 
02:35:00.950 --> 02:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
they're very very heavy because they're
 
02:35:04.110 --> 02:35:04.120 align:start position:0%
made of iron but you know as solid state
 
02:35:06.469 --> 02:35:06.479 align:start position:0%
batteries become more available and
 
02:35:08.190 --> 02:35:08.200 align:start position:0%
become cheaper we I think we're going to
 
02:35:11.309 --> 02:35:11.319 align:start position:0%
see more and more people adopting solid
 
02:35:12.750 --> 02:35:12.760 align:start position:0%
state batteries whether it's in their
 
02:35:16.389 --> 02:35:16.399 align:start position:0%
vehicles or in their homes and um I
 
02:35:19.070 --> 02:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
think we'll seen more and more of a use
 
02:35:22.950 --> 02:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:26.269 --> 02:35:26.279 align:start position:0%
metering okay thank you representative
 
02:35:28.309 --> 02:35:28.319 align:start position:0%
Harrington has another question just to
 
02:35:30.070 --> 02:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
follow up on that uh and then you take
 
02:35:32.590 --> 02:35:32.600 align:start position:0%
my question uh you think energy storage
 
02:35:35.990 --> 02:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
systems is is definitive enough or is
 
02:35:37.630 --> 02:35:37.640 align:start position:0%
that kind of Leave It Wide Open or are
 
02:35:40.269 --> 02:35:40.279 align:start position:0%
you just relying on the uh Department of
 
02:35:42.510 --> 02:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
energy to come up with a somewhat there
 
02:35:43.429 --> 02:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
going to have to be some kind of a
 
02:35:45.269 --> 02:35:45.279 align:start position:0%
definition because that can mean a lot
 
02:35:47.269 --> 02:35:47.279 align:start position:0%
of different things to different people
 
02:35:48.670 --> 02:35:48.680 align:start position:0%
do you think that would be done in the
 
02:35:50.990 --> 02:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
rules rather than specified in the
 
02:35:53.190 --> 02:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you uh yeah I I would
 
02:35:54.830 --> 02:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
imagine that being done in the rules and
 
02:35:56.070 --> 02:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
you know I can imagine you know you
 
02:35:58.150 --> 02:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
could talk about let's say closed loop
 
02:36:00.990 --> 02:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
pumped Hydro right that that's probably
 
02:36:03.349 --> 02:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
what you were thinking and um yeah mean
 
02:36:05.830 --> 02:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
I I wasn't really thinking that as as a
 
02:36:07.750 --> 02:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
storage system and and I would leave
 
02:36:09.750 --> 02:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
that up to the department and the Pu to
 
02:36:12.710 --> 02:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
decide how to proceed with that
 
02:36:12.720 --> 02:36:14.429 align:start position:0%
decide how to proceed with that
representative

02:36:14.429 --> 02:36:14.439 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:36:16.670 --> 02:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
migy thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
02:36:18.550 --> 02:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so in just
 
02:36:21.870 --> 02:36:21.880 align:start position:0%
looking at the bill it appears to be
 
02:36:21.880 --> 02:36:22.990 align:start position:0%
looking at the bill it appears to be
attempting

02:36:22.990 --> 02:36:23.000 align:start position:0%
attempting
 
02:36:27.790 --> 02:36:27.800 align:start position:0%
to uh illustrate in statute uh a segment
 
02:36:30.309 --> 02:36:30.319 align:start position:0%
on storage that doesn't currently exist
 
02:36:32.910 --> 02:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
right so the whole point of the exercise
 
02:36:35.309 --> 02:36:35.319 align:start position:0%
is to let the department of energy and
 
02:36:36.990 --> 02:36:37.000 align:start position:0%
the commission know what is expected of
 
02:36:39.349 --> 02:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
them and also to add this portion so
 
02:36:42.150 --> 02:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
that it's revealed in statute is that
 
02:36:44.349 --> 02:36:44.359 align:start position:0%
correct yeah well I I wouldn't say that
 
02:36:46.349 --> 02:36:46.359 align:start position:0%
it that the storage doesn't exist it's
 
02:36:48.110 --> 02:36:48.120 align:start position:0%
it's that the net metering for the
 
02:36:50.110 --> 02:36:50.120 align:start position:0%
storage doesn't exist so it's not
 
02:36:52.070 --> 02:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
defined adequately it's it's it's just
 
02:36:53.510 --> 02:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
not allowed at this point and we're
 
02:36:57.710 --> 02:36:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:00.230 --> 02:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
you okay seeing no further questions
 
02:37:02.429 --> 02:37:02.439 align:start position:0%
I'll ask Matt Young from the doe to come
 
02:37:10.870 --> 02:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:12.910 --> 02:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chairman members of
 
02:37:14.830 --> 02:37:14.840 align:start position:0%
the committee um for the record again
 
02:37:16.309 --> 02:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
Matt Young I'm an attorney at the
 
02:37:18.790 --> 02:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
department of energy um department is
 
02:37:20.070 --> 02:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
neutral on this bill and just wanted to
 
02:37:23.429 --> 02:37:23.439 align:start position:0%
raise a few concerns um really um I
 
02:37:24.950 --> 02:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
guess just maybe structural concerns is
 
02:37:26.510 --> 02:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
maybe the best way to put it and I think
 
02:37:29.349 --> 02:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
I thank uh rep Corman for his testimony
 
02:37:30.950 --> 02:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
um that that did help clarify some
 
02:37:33.830 --> 02:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
questions that we had U with the I guess
 
02:37:36.309 --> 02:37:36.319 align:start position:0%
the the uh jurisdictional concerns with
 
02:37:39.830 --> 02:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
the language inserted in section two um
 
02:37:40.990 --> 02:37:41.000 align:start position:0%
as the department does not have the
 
02:37:42.870 --> 02:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
authority uh to regulate net metering
 
02:37:45.469 --> 02:37:45.479 align:start position:0%
and we are in the process of developing
 
02:37:49.950 --> 02:37:49.960 align:start position:0%
uh 900 rules as we speak um
 
02:37:51.510 --> 02:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
we would be
 
02:37:53.630 --> 02:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
um you know if the if the legislation
 
02:37:54.670 --> 02:37:54.680 align:start position:0%
does decide to move forward we be happy
 
02:37:56.389 --> 02:37:56.399 align:start position:0%
to work with uh rep Corman to sort of
 
02:37:59.070 --> 02:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
address the um the jurisdictional
 
02:38:04.030 --> 02:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
concerns there in section two um and in
 
02:38:04.040 --> 02:38:05.469 align:start position:0%
concerns there in section two um and in
terms

02:38:05.469 --> 02:38:05.479 align:start position:0%
terms
 
02:38:07.870 --> 02:38:07.880 align:start position:0%
of I I I guess
 
02:38:09.670 --> 02:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
another struggling for another word
 
02:38:10.950 --> 02:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
besides structural another structural
 
02:38:13.550 --> 02:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
concern that we had was um we do believe
 
02:38:15.870 --> 02:38:15.880 align:start position:0%
that there may be some changes required
 
02:38:19.990 --> 02:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
for um the net metering law 362a
 
02:38:22.389 --> 02:38:22.399 align:start position:0%
uh colon 9 that would need to be um I
 
02:38:24.510 --> 02:38:24.520 align:start position:0%
guess flushed out discussed um just sort
 
02:38:25.830 --> 02:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
of implement the intent of this
 
02:38:28.590 --> 02:38:28.600 align:start position:0%
legislation um which we' be happy to
 
02:38:29.950 --> 02:38:29.960 align:start position:0%
happy to work with the legislature on
 
02:38:31.710 --> 02:38:31.720 align:start position:0%
that and I guess on that note I would
 
02:38:34.190 --> 02:38:34.200 align:start position:0%
just note that there is a um energy
 
02:38:35.910 --> 02:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
storage task force Bill moving through
 
02:38:39.469 --> 02:38:39.479 align:start position:0%
the Senate um now U so some some of
 
02:38:41.710 --> 02:38:41.720 align:start position:0%
those conversations maybe U could happen
 
02:38:43.750 --> 02:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
in that form as well and with that happy
 
02:38:47.990 --> 02:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions questions for Mr
 
02:38:50.389 --> 02:38:50.399 align:start position:0%
Young represent of
 
02:38:53.070 --> 02:38:53.080 align:start position:0%
Harrington quick uh I I realize you talk
 
02:38:54.550 --> 02:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
about some structural things that may be
 
02:38:56.670 --> 02:38:56.680 align:start position:0%
addressed but from the principle of this
 
02:38:58.389 --> 02:38:58.399 align:start position:0%
it sounds like the department has no
 
02:39:00.349 --> 02:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
problem with allowing energy storage to
 
02:39:02.830 --> 02:39:02.840 align:start position:0%
participate in net majoring so my
 
02:39:04.389 --> 02:39:04.399 align:start position:0%
understanding from uh just talking to
 
02:39:05.870 --> 02:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
some folks inside the department is that
 
02:39:08.630 --> 02:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
there uh are con some concerns with uh
 
02:39:10.510 --> 02:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
making sure kind of where the energy
 
02:39:13.110 --> 02:39:13.120 align:start position:0%
comes from how it's compensated um
 
02:39:15.230 --> 02:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
whether it's store or how it's stored
 
02:39:17.110 --> 02:39:17.120 align:start position:0%
and then kind of sent back to the grid
 
02:39:19.750 --> 02:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh are concerns that we do have so but I
 
02:39:21.510 --> 02:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
I again I think that that would probably
 
02:39:23.990 --> 02:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
just be better in a um okay in a energy
 
02:39:25.590 --> 02:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
task force Forum or investigation of
 
02:39:27.230 --> 02:39:27.240 align:start position:0%
sorts quick followup it sounds like
 
02:39:28.630 --> 02:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
those could be addressed in the rules
 
02:39:30.750 --> 02:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
process then that that that's another
 
02:39:33.670 --> 02:39:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:35.990 --> 02:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
well okay see you know further questions
 
02:39:39.429 --> 02:39:39.439 align:start position:0%
we'll move along and I'll call on David
 
02:39:50.429 --> 02:39:50.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:55.230 --> 02:39:55.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:58.469 --> 02:39:58.479 align:start position:0%
st&amp; thank you first time speaking here
 
02:40:01.030 --> 02:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
my name is David hemway and it is a
 
02:40:03.990 --> 02:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
pleasure to be here and able to uh
 
02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:05.550 align:start position:0%
pleasure to be here and able to uh
testify

02:40:05.550 --> 02:40:05.560 align:start position:0%
testify
 
02:40:09.230 --> 02:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
today um I did give a paper that is
 
02:40:11.349 --> 02:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
coming out it is double-sided and there
 
02:40:13.150 --> 02:40:13.160 align:start position:0%
are a couple charts on that that you may
 
02:40:15.309 --> 02:40:15.319 align:start position:0%
want to see that I'll reference I'm not
 
02:40:17.269 --> 02:40:17.279 align:start position:0%
going to read through that testimony and
 
02:40:19.790 --> 02:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
it was provided to you earlier in email
 
02:40:22.469 --> 02:40:22.479 align:start position:0%
as well my name is David hemway from
 
02:40:24.070 --> 02:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
Webster New Hampshire where I'm the
 
02:40:25.830 --> 02:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
chair of the select board and on the
 
02:40:28.030 --> 02:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
energy committee I sit on the board of
 
02:40:29.429 --> 02:40:29.439 align:start position:0%
directors for the community power
 
02:40:31.349 --> 02:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
Coalition of New Hampshire as the member
 
02:40:33.469 --> 02:40:33.479 align:start position:0%
representative from Webster I am an
 
02:40:35.550 --> 02:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
engineer by trade and have designed and
 
02:40:37.510 --> 02:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
installed the solar and battery storage
 
02:40:40.110 --> 02:40:40.120 align:start position:0%
on my own home I would be happy to
 
02:40:42.309 --> 02:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you have about data
 
02:40:44.710 --> 02:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
existing programs challenges this bill
 
02:40:46.950 --> 02:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
solves or anything else at the end of my
 
02:40:50.910 --> 02:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
testimony I am in favor of HB 761 before
 
02:40:53.429 --> 02:40:53.439 align:start position:0%
us today enabling retail customer energy
 
02:40:56.550 --> 02:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
storage programs storage is an extremely
 
02:40:59.150 --> 02:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
important part of both grid resiliency
 
02:41:01.950 --> 02:41:01.960 align:start position:0%
and optimization as well as efficiency
 
02:41:04.429 --> 02:41:04.439 align:start position:0%
load reduction rate stability and rate
 
02:41:06.950 --> 02:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
reduction to set some background there
 
02:41:09.269 --> 02:41:09.279 align:start position:0%
are two major places in Electric Supply
 
02:41:12.230 --> 02:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
where storage is extremely impactful the
 
02:41:14.550 --> 02:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
first is the many Peak demand response
 
02:41:18.030 --> 02:41:18.040 align:start position:0%
programs that load reduce at peak times
 
02:41:20.110 --> 02:41:20.120 align:start position:0%
I'm currently enrolled in a small
 
02:41:22.630 --> 02:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
program from ever source for this in New
 
02:41:25.070 --> 02:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where they pay up front based
 
02:41:26.870 --> 02:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
on the capabilities of the batteries I
 
02:41:29.110 --> 02:41:29.120 align:start position:0%
have installed to be in the program
 
02:41:31.790 --> 02:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
these are set it and forget it programs
 
02:41:34.710 --> 02:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
as all semi- recent systems handle this
 
02:41:37.070 --> 02:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
here's an example from the application
 
02:41:41.110 --> 02:41:41.120 align:start position:0%
for the storage that is on that most
 
02:41:43.269 --> 02:41:43.279 align:start position:0%
other states however have rate setting
 
02:41:45.349 --> 02:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
such as this bill would provide that can
 
02:41:47.830 --> 02:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
enable this at more scale with smaller
 
02:41:50.429 --> 02:41:50.439 align:start position:0%
payments per event allowing for longer
 
02:41:52.950 --> 02:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
term value both to other rate payers and
 
02:41:55.230 --> 02:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
to the battery owner by ensuring that
 
02:41:57.389 --> 02:41:57.399 align:start position:0%
only when rate payers would save money
 
02:41:59.710 --> 02:41:59.720 align:start position:0%
does the system pay the battery owners
 
02:42:01.790 --> 02:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
the one bit I'll make sure to point out
 
02:42:04.469 --> 02:42:04.479 align:start position:0%
from my written testimony is how much
 
02:42:07.510 --> 02:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
this can really save according to the
 
02:42:11.030 --> 02:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
iso New England in 2023 the average
 
02:42:14.030 --> 02:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
real-time energy price was
 
02:42:18.670 --> 02:42:18.680 align:start position:0%
$35.70 per megawatt hour but 88% of grid
 
02:42:20.590 --> 02:42:20.600 align:start position:0%
level demand and response events
 
02:42:24.750 --> 02:42:24.760 align:start position:0%
happened at ,000 per megawatt hour
 
02:42:26.790 --> 02:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
removing however much was put out by the
 
02:42:29.190 --> 02:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
storage programs at that high cost mark
 
02:42:30.830 --> 02:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
from the need to be purchased at those
 
02:42:33.110 --> 02:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
prices and then recharging at the lower
 
02:42:36.190 --> 02:42:36.200 align:start position:0%
more average rates this becomes
 
02:42:37.790 --> 02:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
especially important in New Hampshire
 
02:42:40.070 --> 02:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
now as utilities become mandated to
 
02:42:42.630 --> 02:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
further expose default Supply customers
 
02:42:45.469 --> 02:42:45.479 align:start position:0%
to this High volatility of the real-time
 
02:42:48.590 --> 02:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
Market the second thing is the duck
 
02:42:50.750 --> 02:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
curve that you've probably all seen
 
02:42:54.269 --> 02:42:54.279 align:start position:0%
before this is on the back of that paper
 
02:42:57.469 --> 02:42:57.479 align:start position:0%
and in large part due to not having time
 
02:43:01.510 --> 02:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
sensitive pricing and demand-based net
 
02:43:04.910 --> 02:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
metering this is causing fixed southface
 
02:43:07.550 --> 02:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
Soler as the maximum value to be
 
02:43:10.389 --> 02:43:10.399 align:start position:0%
installed and you can see in the graph
 
02:43:12.910 --> 02:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
from ISO New England there how this is
 
02:43:15.070 --> 02:43:15.080 align:start position:0%
expected to impact the ability of Basel
 
02:43:17.590 --> 02:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
load generation to function such as
 
02:43:20.269 --> 02:43:20.279 align:start position:0%
nuclear this bill can help New Hampshire
 
02:43:22.910 --> 02:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
fix that by tying storage into net
 
02:43:25.550 --> 02:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
metering load shapes and timing can be
 
02:43:27.750 --> 02:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
included incentivizing the filling of
 
02:43:29.990 --> 02:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
storage during the middle of the day and
 
02:43:32.309 --> 02:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
using it from Storage in the evening so
 
02:43:34.429 --> 02:43:34.439 align:start position:0%
the peak curve doesn't go as high in
 
02:43:37.190 --> 02:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
expensive this flattening of the curve
 
02:43:39.590 --> 02:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
due to net metered load reduction has
 
02:43:41.710 --> 02:43:41.720 align:start position:0%
the double benefit of keeping the top
 
02:43:43.790 --> 02:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
costs lower while keeping base
 
02:43:46.950 --> 02:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
generation from being as affected in
 
02:43:49.150 --> 02:43:49.160 align:start position:0%
summary this bill would allow for the
 
02:43:50.990 --> 02:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
competitive storage Marketplace to take
 
02:43:53.670 --> 02:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
off that will enable people like me
 
02:43:55.910 --> 02:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
those considering storage in the future
 
02:43:58.070 --> 02:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
and those who already have storage to
 
02:44:00.349 --> 02:44:00.359 align:start position:0%
make everybody's rates lower and
 
02:44:02.710 --> 02:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
maintain the value of New Hampshire's
 
02:44:06.110 --> 02:44:06.120 align:start position:0%
existing base generation for longer so
 
02:44:07.990 --> 02:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
please vote Yes and support this bill as
 
02:44:10.269 --> 02:44:10.279 align:start position:0%
ought to pass you will be supporting
 
02:44:12.630 --> 02:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
grid stabilization more economical
 
02:44:15.389 --> 02:44:15.399 align:start position:0%
buildout of the grid Market competition
 
02:44:17.990 --> 02:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
and lower rates for all without rate
 
02:44:20.670 --> 02:44:20.680 align:start position:0%
payers picking up construction costs
 
02:44:22.070 --> 02:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and considering
 
02:44:23.830 --> 02:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
this important issue and I look forward
 
02:44:26.790 --> 02:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
to your questions thank you very much
 
02:44:30.349 --> 02:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:33.349 --> 02:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
way representative Wendy Thomas thank
 
02:44:35.790 --> 02:44:35.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um not really a question as
 
02:44:37.750 --> 02:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
much as a comment um it's your first
 
02:44:41.030 --> 02:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
time testifying and you did a great job
 
02:44:43.469 --> 02:44:43.479 align:start position:0%
uh explaining this thank you very much
 
02:44:45.870 --> 02:44:45.880 align:start position:0%
thank you forward to any other questions
 
02:44:47.469 --> 02:44:47.479 align:start position:0%
or explanations you'd
 
02:44:49.790 --> 02:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
like we have two more more pink cards
 
02:44:51.429 --> 02:44:51.439 align:start position:0%
here and we'd like to get them in before
 
02:44:53.990 --> 02:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
we have to break
 
02:44:56.990 --> 02:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
so yes we're we're all done with you
 
02:44:59.150 --> 02:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate you being
 
02:45:09.030 --> 02:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:11.230 --> 02:45:11.240 align:start position:0%
cpcn and I know you asked for three
 
02:45:12.590 --> 02:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
minutes but if you could do it in two
 
02:45:14.190 --> 02:45:14.200 align:start position:0%
we'd appreciate
 
02:45:16.910 --> 02:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
it good morning again and I will
 
02:45:19.750 --> 02:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
endeavor to do it in one
 
02:45:22.830 --> 02:45:22.840 align:start position:0%
um so again uh good morning everybody uh

um supports House Bill 761 for four
 
02:45:39.030 --> 02:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
reasons first um we think it provided it
 
02:45:40.630 --> 02:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
provides necessary
 
02:45:42.950 --> 02:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
clarification um regarding the roles and
 
02:45:45.510 --> 02:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the doe and the
 
02:45:47.750 --> 02:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission um just
 
02:45:49.429 --> 02:45:49.439 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out that last last year
 
02:45:52.750 --> 02:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
the legislature passed Senate Bill 391
 
02:45:54.550 --> 02:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
which directed the department to develop
 
02:45:56.269 --> 02:45:56.279 align:start position:0%
proposed rules for the interconnection
 
02:45:59.830 --> 02:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
of distributed energy resources um of
 
02:46:01.830 --> 02:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
which that they be aligned with National
 
02:46:04.230 --> 02:46:04.240 align:start position:0%

02:46:10.670 --> 02:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
model connection procedures include
 
02:46:13.349 --> 02:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
storage so we think it is appropriate to
 
02:46:16.309 --> 02:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
move that role from the Public Utilities
 
02:46:18.910 --> 02:46:18.920 align:start position:0%
Commission over to the department um so
 
02:46:20.389 --> 02:46:20.399 align:start position:0%
so that the department can include
 
02:46:23.990 --> 02:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
storage as it's um in its uh proceeding
 
02:46:26.190 --> 02:46:26.200 align:start position:0%
to develop Draft rules for distributed
 
02:46:29.550 --> 02:46:29.560 align:start position:0%
energy resources um second uh making the
 
02:46:31.190 --> 02:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
clarifications will streamline the
 
02:46:33.429 --> 02:46:33.439 align:start position:0%
regulatory process create greater
 
02:46:36.750 --> 02:46:36.760 align:start position:0%
transparency um for the industry and for
 
02:46:39.269 --> 02:46:39.279 align:start position:0%
customers that are looking to uh adopt
 
02:46:41.550 --> 02:46:41.560 align:start position:0%
energy storage um this bill will
 
02:46:43.550 --> 02:46:43.560 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that uh New Hampshire is
 
02:46:45.230 --> 02:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
open for business when it comes to
 
02:46:47.950 --> 02:46:47.960 align:start position:0%
enabling a market for storage um third
 
02:46:49.990 --> 02:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
it will enable innov by capturing
 
02:46:51.910 --> 02:46:51.920 align:start position:0%
benefits of storage which include
 
02:46:53.590 --> 02:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
avoiding wholesale power costs
 
02:46:55.710 --> 02:46:55.720 align:start position:0%
transmission and distribution costs
 
02:46:58.230 --> 02:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
helping to provide resilience greater
 
02:47:01.110 --> 02:47:01.120 align:start position:0%
control to customers o and communities
 
02:47:03.550 --> 02:47:03.560 align:start position:0%
over their energy
 
02:47:05.790 --> 02:47:05.800 align:start position:0%
availability um and then when storage is
 
02:47:07.750 --> 02:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
combined with local power generation the
 
02:47:10.349 --> 02:47:10.359 align:start position:0%
benefits can be multiplied um I know as
 
02:47:11.830 --> 02:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier the department of
 
02:47:15.150 --> 02:47:15.160 align:start position:0%
Energy's value of deer study found that
 
02:47:16.790 --> 02:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
the addition of storage substantially
 
02:47:19.830 --> 02:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
increased the value of distributed gener
 
02:47:21.870 --> 02:47:21.880 align:start position:0%
um and that's why Section 3 is important
 
02:47:24.030 --> 02:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
because it clarifies the puc has the
 
02:47:25.910 --> 02:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
authority to incorporate storage as part
 
02:47:29.309 --> 02:47:29.319 align:start position:0%
of net metering fourth and lastly um it
 
02:47:31.030 --> 02:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
aligns with State energy policy
 
02:47:32.510 --> 02:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
preference for customer choice and
 
02:47:34.830 --> 02:47:34.840 align:start position:0%
Market competition and is consistent
 
02:47:36.110 --> 02:47:36.120 align:start position:0%
with the principles for storage
 
02:47:41.190 --> 02:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:43.790 --> 02:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
2 and I I just wanted to help answer a
 
02:47:46.510 --> 02:47:46.520 align:start position:0%
couple of questions that came up um
 
02:47:50.190 --> 02:47:50.200 align:start position:0%
section one of rsa3 74h includes a
 
02:47:52.630 --> 02:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
definition of energy storage so that
 
02:47:56.110 --> 02:47:56.120 align:start position:0%
that's what uh the term it is defined in
 
02:47:59.469 --> 02:47:59.479 align:start position:0%
statute um I think that was the main
 
02:48:01.389 --> 02:48:01.399 align:start position:0%
point that's
 
02:48:05.910 --> 02:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:08.790 --> 02:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
questions looks like we don't have any
 
02:48:11.269 --> 02:48:11.279 align:start position:0%
people are probably getting ready for
 
02:48:13.230 --> 02:48:13.240 align:start position:0%
lunch which puts a little bit of
 
02:48:15.990 --> 02:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
pressure on Sam Evans
 
02:48:26.710 --> 02:48:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:28.710 --> 02:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
ation take it as a challenge see if I
 
02:48:31.870 --> 02:48:31.880 align:start position:0%
can do in 45 seconds uh so clean energy
 
02:48:33.469 --> 02:48:33.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire does support this bill we
 
02:48:35.429 --> 02:48:35.439 align:start position:0%
see it as a fairly straightforward
 
02:48:38.750 --> 02:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
attempt to to try to once again uh move
 
02:48:41.309 --> 02:48:41.319 align:start position:0%
the peanut forward on getting uh access
 
02:48:43.510 --> 02:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
to some sort of Market structure in
 
02:48:45.309 --> 02:48:45.319 align:start position:0%
place for energy storage I just note and
 
02:48:47.269 --> 02:48:47.279 align:start position:0%
this is in my testimony the legislature
 
02:48:49.830 --> 02:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
has at multiple times over the past 5
 
02:48:52.469 --> 02:48:52.479 align:start position:0%
years directed uh the regulatory bodies
 
02:48:55.710 --> 02:48:55.720 align:start position:0%
in in question here to develop uh or
 
02:48:58.510 --> 02:48:58.520 align:start position:0%
study creating some sort of price signal
 
02:49:00.269 --> 02:49:00.279 align:start position:0%
that would encourage customer cited
 
02:49:02.790 --> 02:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
storage um and over the past several
 
02:49:04.830 --> 02:49:04.840 align:start position:0%
years progress in that direction has
 
02:49:07.190 --> 02:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
stalled there is an open investigation
 
02:49:08.870 --> 02:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
that the department of energy opened in
 
02:49:12.150 --> 02:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
2023 but we've seen no action in that
 
02:49:15.349 --> 02:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
investigation since August of 2023 um
 
02:49:17.710 --> 02:49:17.720 align:start position:0%
and uh and I will note that that
 
02:49:20.510 --> 02:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
essentially we are are already allowing
 
02:49:22.309 --> 02:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
batteries to receive net metan
 
02:49:24.550 --> 02:49:24.560 align:start position:0%
compensation as part of the Liberty
 
02:49:26.990 --> 02:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
Utilities battery storage pilot um which
 
02:49:28.030 --> 02:49:28.040 align:start position:0%
has been approved by the Public
 
02:49:29.469 --> 02:49:29.479 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission and has been found
 
02:49:32.309 --> 02:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
to be costeffective um and the puc in
 
02:49:34.750 --> 02:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
fact ordered Liberty to include you know
 
02:49:36.710 --> 02:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
further phases of that battery storage
 
02:49:39.349 --> 02:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
pilot in uh in their rate case their
 
02:49:42.349 --> 02:49:42.359 align:start position:0%
rate case is currently um sort of up in
 
02:49:45.510 --> 02:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
the air as as many know so uh once again
 
02:49:47.469 --> 02:49:47.479 align:start position:0%
further progress in that in that area
 
02:49:50.790 --> 02:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
has has stalled so uh I think there's a
 
02:49:52.830 --> 02:49:52.840 align:start position:0%
tremendous opportunity to use battery
 
02:49:55.469 --> 02:49:55.479 align:start position:0%
storage to reduce the costs of of uh
 
02:49:56.830 --> 02:49:56.840 align:start position:0%
grid infrastructure and provide rate
 
02:49:58.670 --> 02:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
relief to to rate payers and this is
 
02:50:00.590 --> 02:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
just another mechanism through which
 
02:50:03.070 --> 02:50:03.080 align:start position:0%
such a program could be
 
02:50:05.710 --> 02:50:05.720 align:start position:0%
established thank you Mr R Brown can you
 
02:50:07.910 --> 02:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
say anything more about the Liberty
 
02:50:11.790 --> 02:50:11.800 align:start position:0%
pilot uh y did it did it turn out to be
 
02:50:14.190 --> 02:50:14.200 align:start position:0%
cost effective did it turn out to be a
 
02:50:16.710 --> 02:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
useful program it did and and there is
 
02:50:19.030 --> 02:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
actually uh a footnote in my written
 
02:50:20.750 --> 02:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
testimony that would direct you to the
 
02:50:23.510 --> 02:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
filing in which the Pu uh found it to be
 
02:50:25.790 --> 02:50:25.800 align:start position:0%
cost- effective and I will note uh those
 
02:50:27.150 --> 02:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
batteries were installed during the
 
02:50:30.229 --> 02:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
pandemic sort of 2019 2020 20 21 time
 
02:50:32.870 --> 02:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
frame and costs of battery packs have
 
02:50:35.790 --> 02:50:35.800 align:start position:0%
only Fallen since then uh so I think
 
02:50:37.910 --> 02:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
that that uh you know really the time is
 
02:50:40.110 --> 02:50:40.120 align:start position:0%
now to figure this out and to the point
 
02:50:42.389 --> 02:50:42.399 align:start position:0%
that Clifton Belo made uh you know we're
 
02:50:44.349 --> 02:50:44.359 align:start position:0%
headed into a period of Rapid load
 
02:50:47.469 --> 02:50:47.479 align:start position:0%
growth and having storage as as a
 
02:50:50.309 --> 02:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
potential asset to try to make sure that
 
02:50:52.070 --> 02:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
the grid is is able to absorb that
 
02:50:53.510 --> 02:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
growth in a cost- effective manner I
 
02:50:55.190 --> 02:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
think is really important that and
 
02:50:56.389 --> 02:50:56.399 align:start position:0%
something that policy makers should be
 
02:50:57.670 --> 02:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
really thinking
 
02:51:02.269 --> 02:51:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:04.309 --> 02:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
questions I'm guessing people want to go
 
02:51:06.110 --> 02:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
to lunch
 
02:51:09.349 --> 02:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
so uh we'll bring to a close then the
 
02:51:12.389 --> 02:51:12.399 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill
 
02:51:16.190 --> 02:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
761 we will take a lunch break effective
 
02:51:19.229 --> 02:51:19.239 align:start position:0%
until 1:15 this afternoon
 
02:51:20.910 --> 02:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
and I'd ask everybody in the room to
 
02:51:22.510 --> 02:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
please clear the room so that
 
02:51:24.870 --> 02:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
Republicans can caucus thank you very
 
02:51:47.510 --> 02:51:47.520 align:start position:0%

okay let's get started with the
 
04:11:15.710 --> 04:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
afternoon session here of stn for
 
04:11:15.720 --> 04:11:17.550 align:start position:0%
afternoon session here of stn for
February

04:11:17.550 --> 04:11:17.560 align:start position:0%
February
 
04:11:21.269 --> 04:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
18th we're going to pass judgment on
 
04:11:24.590 --> 04:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
five bills in an executive session and
 
04:11:26.550 --> 04:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
then after that we're going to return to
 
04:11:30.590 --> 04:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
public hearings for two more bills HB
 
04:11:33.550 --> 04:11:33.560 align:start position:0%
759 and HB
 
04:11:36.670 --> 04:11:36.680 align:start position:0%
760 so we'll begin the activity of the
 
04:11:40.269 --> 04:11:40.279 align:start position:0%
afternoon by open opening a public a
 
04:11:45.590 --> 04:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
executive session on HB 72 23 FN and I
 
04:11:48.910 --> 04:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
04:11:52.349 --> 04:11:52.359 align:start position:0%
bney I move that we judge HB
 
04:11:56.429 --> 04:11:56.439 align:start position:0%
723 as ought to pass chair recognizes
 
04:11:59.510 --> 04:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative fog I'll second there a
 
04:12:02.349 --> 04:12:02.359 align:start position:0%
to pass okay it's been moved and
 
04:12:05.389 --> 04:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
seconded that we adopt the motion of a
 
04:12:10.269 --> 04:12:10.279 align:start position:0%
to pass for ill 723 FN chair recognizes
 
04:12:13.349 --> 04:12:13.359 align:start position:0%
representative bney thank you chairman
 
04:12:17.309 --> 04:12:17.319 align:start position:0%
um so I'll I'll be pretty brief um as
 
04:12:20.070 --> 04:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
far as the U benefits to individual
 
04:12:22.469 --> 04:12:22.479 align:start position:0%
customers and their data utilities that
 
04:12:25.349 --> 04:12:25.359 align:start position:0%
have Ami are already providing portals
 
04:12:28.910 --> 04:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
where users can see their or their usage
 
04:12:30.790 --> 04:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
um one of the benefits that would have
 
04:12:32.750 --> 04:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
come from the data platform is is
 
04:12:35.950 --> 04:12:35.960 align:start position:0%
aggregated view of usage either by uh an
 
04:12:38.070 --> 04:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
apartment building or municipality or
 
04:12:41.309 --> 04:12:41.319 align:start position:0%
the entire State um which is a much
 
04:12:45.429 --> 04:12:45.439 align:start position:0%
larger uh much smaller um um number of
 
04:12:47.309 --> 04:12:47.319 align:start position:0%
of users that would benefit from that as
 
04:12:50.189 --> 04:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
opposed to the rate payers um arguably
 
04:12:51.910 --> 04:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
Department of energy would have been the
 
04:12:54.309 --> 04:12:54.319 align:start position:0%
biggest benefactor uh and they were
 
04:12:57.469 --> 04:12:57.479 align:start position:0%
neutral on the bill so uh the federal
 
04:12:58.790 --> 04:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
government could have also benefited
 
04:13:00.990 --> 04:13:01.000 align:start position:0%
from that and they had two opportunities
 
04:13:03.149 --> 04:13:03.159 align:start position:0%
to fund this project and they chose not
 
04:13:07.550 --> 04:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
to um and other than that the benefits
 
04:13:10.030 --> 04:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
uh there wasn't very many benefits
 
04:13:13.830 --> 04:13:13.840 align:start position:0%
listed so it's not really clear um
 
04:13:16.469 --> 04:13:16.479 align:start position:0%
under what circumstances some like who
 
04:13:18.109 --> 04:13:18.119 align:start position:0%
who would benefit from it and how they
 
04:13:20.389 --> 04:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
would benefit was not brought up in the
 
04:13:24.030 --> 04:13:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:24.040 --> 04:13:26.189 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:13:26.189 --> 04:13:26.199 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:13:29.550 --> 04:13:29.560 align:start position:0%
okay additional comments on the motion
 
04:13:34.710 --> 04:13:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:38.269 --> 04:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
723 representative McGee thank you Mr
 
04:13:40.630 --> 04:13:40.640 align:start position:0%
chairman yes um to the points that were
 
04:13:43.429 --> 04:13:43.439 align:start position:0%
made I I think in the hearing where we
 
04:13:45.229 --> 04:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
have limited amount of time to present
 
04:13:47.550 --> 04:13:47.560 align:start position:0%
something which is basically a 5 and a
 
04:13:49.830 --> 04:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
half year effort that was set in motion
 
04:13:52.349 --> 04:13:52.359 align:start position:0%
by the state of New Hampshire uh uh with
 
04:13:55.229 --> 04:13:55.239 align:start position:0%
cooperation from doe and the
 
04:13:58.389 --> 04:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
utilities um there were handouts that
 
04:14:00.189 --> 04:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
were provided to every member of this
 
04:14:03.590 --> 04:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
committee one was a set of user stories
 
04:14:07.189 --> 04:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
that indicated the multiple current
 
04:14:09.950 --> 04:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission cases that
 
04:14:13.630 --> 04:14:13.640 align:start position:0%
would be supported by having access
 
04:14:17.670 --> 04:14:17.680 align:start position:0%
to aggregated G data that can be shared
 
04:14:20.469 --> 04:14:20.479 align:start position:0%
um the purpose of the model is not to
 
04:14:22.990 --> 04:14:23.000 align:start position:0%
replicate any individual utilities
 
04:14:25.309 --> 04:14:25.319 align:start position:0%
ability to provide downloaded
 
04:14:28.510 --> 04:14:28.520 align:start position:0%
information with green button but to
 
04:14:31.309 --> 04:14:31.319 align:start position:0%
create a uniform data model that can be
 
04:14:34.670 --> 04:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
used across all data inputs so that we
 
04:14:36.910 --> 04:14:36.920 align:start position:0%
can have a snapshot of what energy is
 
04:14:40.990 --> 04:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
doing what its value is how to plan for
 
04:14:43.750 --> 04:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
the future and also how to realize
 
04:14:48.309 --> 04:14:48.319 align:start position:0%
savings on that system it is um maybe a
 
04:14:50.990 --> 04:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
complex project to explain to people in
 
04:14:53.790 --> 04:14:53.800 align:start position:0%
a short period of time but the idea that
 
04:14:56.670 --> 04:14:56.680 align:start position:0%
we could do all of this
 
04:14:59.710 --> 04:14:59.720 align:start position:0%
currently uh is really not borne out by
 
04:15:02.189 --> 04:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
the the folks who worked on the project
 
04:15:05.229 --> 04:15:05.239 align:start position:0%
I mean we also uh on the day of the
 
04:15:08.189 --> 04:15:08.199 align:start position:0%
hearing I presented people with
 
04:15:11.469 --> 04:15:11.479 align:start position:0%
basically a compilation from a dunsky
 
04:15:13.469 --> 04:15:13.479 align:start position:0%
report that is not complete needed yet
 
04:15:15.590 --> 04:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire that
 
04:15:18.309 --> 04:15:18.319 align:start position:0%
would cover the cost benefit analysis of
 
04:15:20.870 --> 04:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not to build this project we
 
04:15:24.349 --> 04:15:24.359 align:start position:0%
have been um waiting for this point for
 
04:15:27.109 --> 04:15:27.119 align:start position:0%
quite some time so that a decision can
 
04:15:30.550 --> 04:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
be made and what passing this bill would
 
04:15:33.670 --> 04:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
do is it would eliminate the ability for
 
04:15:36.070 --> 04:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
us to secure the information in order to
 
04:15:38.349 --> 04:15:38.359 align:start position:0%
make a reasonable decision about whether
 
04:15:41.710 --> 04:15:41.720 align:start position:0%
this would be of benefit to rate payers
 
04:15:45.149 --> 04:15:45.159 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and so on that basis I
 
04:15:48.990 --> 04:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
would ask that people not vote to kill
 
04:15:53.109 --> 04:15:53.119 align:start position:0%
this um in statute before we've actually
 
04:15:55.630 --> 04:15:55.640 align:start position:0%
had the chance to get the utilities
 
04:15:57.670 --> 04:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
which did not want to come to the table
 
04:16:01.229 --> 04:16:01.239 align:start position:0%
and do this process uh before we've had
 
04:16:03.870 --> 04:16:03.880 align:start position:0%
a chance to see if we can actually do
 
04:16:06.590 --> 04:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
this for a you know a reasonable amount
 
04:16:09.830 --> 04:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
in and get incredible benefits out
 
04:16:12.710 --> 04:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
basically the data is is information and
 
04:16:15.510 --> 04:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
we it is information we do not have
 
04:16:17.950 --> 04:16:17.960 align:start position:0%
access to today and we will not have
 
04:16:20.469 --> 04:16:20.479 align:start position:0%
access to it for a long time to come
 
04:16:23.030 --> 04:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
having the individual utilities provide
 
04:16:25.510 --> 04:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
that information to their customers will
 
04:16:28.109 --> 04:16:28.119 align:start position:0%
never give us the capacity of having an
 
04:16:32.510 --> 04:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
API of API that can serve uh all of our
 
04:16:35.149 --> 04:16:35.159 align:start position:0%
energy needs because it includes all of
 
04:16:37.149 --> 04:16:37.159 align:start position:0%
our energy data in one
 
04:16:40.950 --> 04:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
place thanks further comments
 
04:16:43.429 --> 04:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
representative Corman
 
04:16:46.309 --> 04:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh I'll be voting
 
04:16:48.469 --> 04:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
against the motion because I'd like to
 
04:16:50.389 --> 04:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
see a cost benefit analysis and we don't
 
04:16:54.269 --> 04:16:54.279 align:start position:0%
know the cost yet because the RFP is
 
04:16:56.950 --> 04:16:56.960 align:start position:0%
just going out we should know it by the
 
04:16:58.950 --> 04:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
end of the summer we should have some
 
04:17:00.710 --> 04:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
some idea of what it would cost to do
 
04:17:03.590 --> 04:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
this I would much rather see this bill
 
04:17:07.710 --> 04:17:07.720 align:start position:0%
and 681 because they're really uh uh
 
04:17:09.830 --> 04:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
opposite points of view I'd like to see
 
04:17:12.429 --> 04:17:12.439 align:start position:0%
both of them retained so that by the
 
04:17:14.349 --> 04:17:14.359 align:start position:0%
Fall have an idea of what the cost is
 
04:17:16.910 --> 04:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
going to be and then we can make a more
 
04:17:19.790 --> 04:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
informed judgment one other thing i' I'd
 
04:17:21.630 --> 04:17:21.640 align:start position:0%
add is
 
04:17:24.429 --> 04:17:24.439 align:start position:0%
that we don't have the platform yet we
 
04:17:26.389 --> 04:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
don't really know exactly what it's
 
04:17:29.149 --> 04:17:29.159 align:start position:0%
going to be we have a description but
 
04:17:30.670 --> 04:17:30.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes you need to put it in people's
 
04:17:34.229 --> 04:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
hands in order for people to get it and
 
04:17:36.590 --> 04:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
use it and figure out the best way to
 
04:17:40.189 --> 04:17:40.199 align:start position:0%
use it and I think back to when I was in
 
04:17:43.950 --> 04:17:43.960 align:start position:0%
grad school in 19
 
04:17:48.910 --> 04:17:48.920 align:start position:0%
84 I read an article about this system
 
04:17:51.990 --> 04:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
uh called small talk and it it mentioned
 
04:17:55.590 --> 04:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
this user interface for small talk and I
 
04:17:57.790 --> 04:17:57.800 align:start position:0%
had no idea what they were talking about
 
04:17:59.750 --> 04:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
it was written but I had no idea what it
 
04:18:01.590 --> 04:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
was talking about then a few months
 
04:18:04.550 --> 04:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
later I got my hand on a Mac and I got
 
04:18:07.349 --> 04:18:07.359 align:start position:0%
it so sometimes you just need to put the
 
04:18:10.030 --> 04:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
system in people's hands let them figure
 
04:18:11.750 --> 04:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
it out let them get comfortable with it
 
04:18:13.510 --> 04:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
and let them get creative
 
04:18:15.349 --> 04:18:15.359 align:start position:0%
so I would like to see
 
04:18:19.109 --> 04:18:19.119 align:start position:0%
this not killed yet maybe when we know
 
04:18:20.990 --> 04:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
the cost maybe we decide yeah this isn't
 
04:18:22.870 --> 04:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
worth pursuing but let's get the costs
 
04:18:25.109 --> 04:18:25.119 align:start position:0%
let's retain these bills and then make a
 
04:18:26.910 --> 04:18:26.920 align:start position:0%
more informed
 
04:18:29.109 --> 04:18:29.119 align:start position:0%
decision further
 
04:18:32.229 --> 04:18:32.239 align:start position:0%
comment representative
 
04:18:35.870 --> 04:18:35.880 align:start position:0%
reels thank you Mr chairman um I'll will
 
04:18:40.349 --> 04:18:40.359 align:start position:0%
also be voting against uh the
 
04:18:44.149 --> 04:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
motion to pass the bill to to kill the
 
04:18:46.550 --> 04:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh pull the plug on the on the
 
04:18:50.109 --> 04:18:50.119 align:start position:0%
development of the of the of the data
 
04:18:54.149 --> 04:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
platform um I just feel as though it's
 
04:18:54.159 --> 04:18:55.750 align:start position:0%
platform um I just feel as though it's
it's

04:18:55.750 --> 04:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:18:55.760 --> 04:18:57.590 align:start position:0%
it's
premature

04:18:57.590 --> 04:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
premature
 
04:19:01.630 --> 04:19:01.640 align:start position:0%
um it would it basically is saying that
 
04:19:01.640 --> 04:19:02.469 align:start position:0%
um it would it basically is saying that
this

04:19:02.469 --> 04:19:02.479 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:19:05.910 --> 04:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
committee and the sponsor of this bill
 
04:19:08.189 --> 04:19:08.199 align:start position:0%
are substituting our
 
04:19:12.030 --> 04:19:12.040 align:start position:0%
judgment about this five and a half year
 
04:19:12.040 --> 04:19:14.149 align:start position:0%
judgment about this five and a half year
effort

04:19:14.149 --> 04:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
effort
 
04:19:18.389 --> 04:19:18.399 align:start position:0%
that got started by Act of this
 
04:19:20.870 --> 04:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
legislature five and a half years
 
04:19:24.950 --> 04:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
ago and then was furthered through a
 
04:19:27.030 --> 04:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
proceeding at the Public Utilities
 
04:19:30.590 --> 04:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
Commission and which then proceeded over
 
04:19:34.510 --> 04:19:34.520 align:start position:0%
the past five and a half years through
 
04:19:39.189 --> 04:19:39.199 align:start position:0%
the contributed volunteer efforts of
 
04:19:41.590 --> 04:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
many people including staff from all
 
04:19:44.149 --> 04:19:44.159 align:start position:0%
three utilities and subject matter
 
04:19:48.750 --> 04:19:48.760 align:start position:0%
experts and legislators and doe staff
 
04:19:51.990 --> 04:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
all this effort's been put into this and
 
04:19:53.590 --> 04:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
just as we're on the
 
04:19:57.229 --> 04:19:57.239 align:start position:0%
cusp of the RFP going
 
04:20:00.990 --> 04:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
out which would give us a firm cost and
 
04:20:03.030 --> 04:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
enable the cost benefit that others have
 
04:20:04.710 --> 04:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
talked about we're going to pull the
 
04:20:07.269 --> 04:20:07.279 align:start position:0%
plug it just doesn't make
 
04:20:11.109 --> 04:20:11.119 align:start position:0%
sense in addition Mr chairman I
 
04:20:13.189 --> 04:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
um praised you
 
04:20:18.030 --> 04:20:18.040 align:start position:0%
and said I I appreciated your
 
04:20:22.189 --> 04:20:22.199 align:start position:0%
uh when you um submitted an amendment
 
04:20:23.990 --> 04:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
for your energy policy bill you
 
04:20:27.429 --> 04:20:27.439 align:start position:0%
specifically included uh as an element
 
04:20:29.750 --> 04:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire's what would be our new
 
04:20:33.030 --> 04:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
energy policy the phrase Market
 
04:20:34.670 --> 04:20:34.680 align:start position:0%
transformation you know Market
 
04:20:36.389 --> 04:20:36.399 align:start position:0%
transformation it's kind of an abstract
 
04:20:37.710 --> 04:20:37.720 align:start position:0%
term what does that mean well for
 
04:20:40.349 --> 04:20:40.359 align:start position:0%
markets to change we heard testimony on
 
04:20:44.670 --> 04:20:44.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:48.670 --> 04:20:48.680 align:start position:0%
energy data platform which would enable
 
04:20:52.109 --> 04:20:52.119 align:start position:0%
Market actors to to have access to
 
04:20:55.710 --> 04:20:55.720 align:start position:0%
aggregated data and analyze things would
 
04:20:59.910 --> 04:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
be um an enabler of Market
 
04:21:01.469 --> 04:21:01.479 align:start position:0%
transformation would contribute to
 
04:21:01.479 --> 04:21:02.550 align:start position:0%
transformation would contribute to
Market

04:21:02.550 --> 04:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
Market
 
04:21:06.950 --> 04:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
transformation and um better enable the
 
04:21:09.790 --> 04:21:09.800 align:start position:0%
state to achieve some of the goals that
 
04:21:13.510 --> 04:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
we have been reaching for
 
04:21:15.990 --> 04:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
since utility
 
04:21:19.229 --> 04:21:19.239 align:start position:0%
deregulation so this is a it's an
 
04:21:22.830 --> 04:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
important tool and uh of that potential
 
04:21:24.590 --> 04:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
Market transformation and and I think
 
04:21:26.590 --> 04:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
it's premature to pull the plug I agree
 
04:21:27.990 --> 04:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
with representative Corman that we
 
04:21:31.389 --> 04:21:31.399 align:start position:0%
should at least retain this bill until
 
04:21:34.469 --> 04:21:34.479 align:start position:0%
we have additional information later in
 
04:21:37.550 --> 04:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
the year thank you further comment
 
04:21:37.560 --> 04:21:39.109 align:start position:0%
the year thank you further comment
representative

04:21:39.109 --> 04:21:39.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:21:42.590 --> 04:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
Bernardi thank you Mr chair uh so
 
04:21:45.630 --> 04:21:45.640 align:start position:0%
initially I was inclined to agree with
 
04:21:48.429 --> 04:21:48.439 align:start position:0%
uh representative corman's thoughts on
 
04:21:52.389 --> 04:21:52.399 align:start position:0%
potentially retaining this bill but then
 
04:21:54.670 --> 04:21:54.680 align:start position:0%
it came to understand that there are
 
04:21:57.870 --> 04:21:57.880 align:start position:0%
multiple entities working on these kinds
 
04:22:01.469 --> 04:22:01.479 align:start position:0%
of programs other states are doing them
 
04:22:03.790 --> 04:22:03.800 align:start position:0%
uh which we could
 
04:22:07.670 --> 04:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh uh get use of uh as well as
 
04:22:11.750 --> 04:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
commercial entities are doing this so it
 
04:22:14.429 --> 04:22:14.439 align:start position:0%
in my mind became clear we do not need
 
04:22:17.269 --> 04:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
to spend the money on this when there's
 
04:22:19.950 --> 04:22:19.960 align:start position:0%
another Avenue to get these potential
 
04:22:23.830 --> 04:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
resources in a much more simple cost
 
04:22:23.840 --> 04:22:25.269 align:start position:0%
resources in a much more simple cost
effective

04:22:25.269 --> 04:22:25.279 align:start position:0%
effective
 
04:22:29.710 --> 04:22:29.720 align:start position:0%
manner additional comment representative
 
04:22:32.790 --> 04:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
Swanson thank you Mr chair I am not
 
04:22:35.510 --> 04:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
convinced of the Avail availability of
 
04:22:37.870 --> 04:22:37.880 align:start position:0%
the other Alternatives that have been
 
04:22:40.910 --> 04:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned I do concur with many of the
 
04:22:43.429 --> 04:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
comments my colleagues had and in fact I
 
04:22:44.870 --> 04:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
save you all the trouble I check them
 
04:22:46.229 --> 04:22:46.239 align:start position:0%
off my list so I'm not going to go
 
04:22:48.469 --> 04:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
through those I'll simply say there's no
 
04:22:51.149 --> 04:22:51.159 align:start position:0%
reason to no compelling reason to tosses
 
04:22:53.229 --> 04:22:53.239 align:start position:0%
capability right now while we're still
 
04:22:57.710 --> 04:22:57.720 align:start position:0%
looking for data so I vote against the
 
04:23:00.870 --> 04:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
OTP additional comments representative
 
04:23:04.109 --> 04:23:04.119 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr chair um since I'm
 
04:23:06.229 --> 04:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
the only person that actually had any
 
04:23:08.710 --> 04:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
involvement with this and at the
 
04:23:11.710 --> 04:23:11.720 align:start position:0%
Inception I just want to say that there
 
04:23:12.950 --> 04:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
are other
 
04:23:15.750 --> 04:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
who are desperately trying to get a hold
 
04:23:18.710 --> 04:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
of their energy data to be able to do
 
04:23:20.309 --> 04:23:20.319 align:start position:0%
the kind of things that are proposed by
 
04:23:22.870 --> 04:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
the Statewide energy data platform
 
04:23:26.469 --> 04:23:26.479 align:start position:0%
project um and we had Texas as an early
 
04:23:28.269 --> 04:23:28.279 align:start position:0%
adopter which was on one of the slides I
 
04:23:29.670 --> 04:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
was going to present you the day that I
 
04:23:31.269 --> 04:23:31.279 align:start position:0%
presented but we couldn't get the
 
04:23:32.870 --> 04:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
technology together so I could show you
 
04:23:35.109 --> 04:23:35.119 align:start position:0%
those slides so Texas was an early
 
04:23:37.070 --> 04:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
adopter we learned from their mistakes
 
04:23:39.750 --> 04:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
when we were designing this project um
 
04:23:42.189 --> 04:23:42.199 align:start position:0%
New York also has capability there are
 
04:23:44.269 --> 04:23:44.279 align:start position:0%
other states that are looking to do this
 
04:23:47.590 --> 04:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
as well as we have been involved in
 
04:23:50.229 --> 04:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
attempting to do this the difference is
 
04:23:53.510 --> 04:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
they don't have our data our system is
 
04:23:56.269 --> 04:23:56.279 align:start position:0%
designed to give us access to all of the
 
04:23:58.590 --> 04:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
energy data in the state of New
 
04:24:00.710 --> 04:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so that we can cut it up and
 
04:24:02.149 --> 04:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
look at it the way that we need to look
 
04:24:05.790 --> 04:24:05.800 align:start position:0%
at it in order to do whatever we need to
 
04:24:08.830 --> 04:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
do and energy is complex but it's even
 
04:24:11.269 --> 04:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
more complex if you can't see it you
 
04:24:13.189 --> 04:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
can't see it and you can't report on it
 
04:24:16.469 --> 04:24:16.479 align:start position:0%
and you can't use it for both analysis
 
04:24:19.630 --> 04:24:19.640 align:start position:0%
and planning and so the capabilities
 
04:24:23.550 --> 04:24:23.560 align:start position:0%
that this system could bring us are
 
04:24:28.469 --> 04:24:28.479 align:start position:0%
also roughly uh derived in the benefits
 
04:24:30.790 --> 04:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
list that I gave everybody from
 
04:24:33.590 --> 04:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
dunky's initial look at what the state
 
04:24:36.510 --> 04:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire could save low midle
 
04:24:40.109 --> 04:24:40.119 align:start position:0%
and high uh at 5 years out and 10 years
 
04:24:42.590 --> 04:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
out and that's based on adoption so it
 
04:24:45.269 --> 04:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
would be based on how well we run the
 
04:24:47.070 --> 04:24:47.080 align:start position:0%
project but it has been extremely
 
04:24:51.469 --> 04:24:51.479 align:start position:0%
well-run to date so I think
 
04:24:54.189 --> 04:24:54.199 align:start position:0%
again it it doesn't appear that everyone
 
04:24:56.109 --> 04:24:56.119 align:start position:0%
on the committee has a good sense of
 
04:24:59.030 --> 04:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
what this project offers the state of
 
04:25:01.630 --> 04:25:01.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and so we're projecting
 
04:25:04.269 --> 04:25:04.279 align:start position:0%
what we want to say about it but I I
 
04:25:06.030 --> 04:25:06.040 align:start position:0%
don't think it does Justice to the
 
04:25:08.030 --> 04:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
people who are actually working on the
 
04:25:10.429 --> 04:25:10.439 align:start position:0%
project and so I would ask that we
 
04:25:13.070 --> 04:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
consider voting down the OT TP so that
 
04:25:14.710 --> 04:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
we can make another motion to retain
 
04:25:14.720 --> 04:25:15.429 align:start position:0%
we can make another motion to retain
this

04:25:15.429 --> 04:25:15.439 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:25:18.590 --> 04:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
bill further
 
04:25:20.670 --> 04:25:20.680 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none I'll ask the
 
04:25:22.349 --> 04:25:22.359 align:start position:0%

ISO New England and other strategy
 
04:26:49.229 --> 04:26:49.239 align:start position:0%
decisions that impact rate payers in
 
04:26:51.950 --> 04:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
relation to New England's environmental
 
04:26:55.149 --> 04:26:55.159 align:start position:0%
policy and I recognize representative
 
04:26:57.590 --> 04:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
Summers thank you Mr chairman I make the
 
04:27:01.309 --> 04:27:01.319 align:start position:0%
motion of ought to pass on HB 690 FN
 
04:27:04.590 --> 04:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative Matson I
 
04:27:06.830 --> 04:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
second the motion moved and seconded
 
04:27:08.830 --> 04:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
that we adopt the motion of ought to
 
04:27:12.590 --> 04:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
pass on House Bill 690 chair recognized
 
04:27:15.109 --> 04:27:15.119 align:start position:0%
representative Summers thank you Mr
 
04:27:18.109 --> 04:27:18.119 align:start position:0%
chairman so I brought this bill forward
 
04:27:19.590 --> 04:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
originally and I wanted to actually you
 
04:27:21.269 --> 04:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
learn more about it since this keeps
 
04:27:23.830 --> 04:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
coming up and we've this way this allows
 
04:27:25.349 --> 04:27:25.359 align:start position:0%
for the Department of energy to be able
 
04:27:29.109 --> 04:27:29.119 align:start position:0%
to conduct investigation on the pros and
 
04:27:33.030 --> 04:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
cons of not only of um possibly leaving
 
04:27:35.149 --> 04:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
ISO New England but tend to learn more
 
04:27:37.750 --> 04:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
about it uh the consumer Advocate
 
04:27:40.070 --> 04:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
testified that he actually stated that
 
04:27:42.229 --> 04:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
he was for this bill as well as he gave
 
04:27:44.710 --> 04:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
us a demonstrated map of how convoluted
 
04:27:47.429 --> 04:27:47.439 align:start position:0%
and complicated the iso New England
 
04:27:51.109 --> 04:27:51.119 align:start position:0%
platform was we also had a the dod
 
04:27:53.030 --> 04:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
stated they were neutral on it but they
 
04:27:55.349 --> 04:27:55.359 align:start position:0%
were willing to investigate conduct an
 
04:27:58.349 --> 04:27:58.359 align:start position:0%
investigation as far as the um public
 
04:28:00.510 --> 04:28:00.520 align:start position:0%
generators who said they were against it
 
04:28:02.030 --> 04:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
and they stated there were two two
 
04:28:04.229 --> 04:28:04.239 align:start position:0%
different items one was that this has
 
04:28:05.630 --> 04:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
already been conducted within
 
04:28:09.389 --> 04:28:09.399 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and with Maine however um
 
04:28:11.550 --> 04:28:11.560 align:start position:0%
with extra additional information from
 
04:28:14.429 --> 04:28:14.439 align:start position:0%
our committee research we found that
 
04:28:17.469 --> 04:28:17.479 align:start position:0%
while we were told that both um
 
04:28:19.429 --> 04:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
processes in Maine and Connecticut were
 
04:28:22.830 --> 04:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
completed and they decided not to do it
 
04:28:25.870 --> 04:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
Maine actually found inadequacies in the
 
04:28:28.070 --> 04:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
status quo participating in the is New
 
04:28:30.910 --> 04:28:30.920 align:start position:0%
England Market with main pu found
 
04:28:32.950 --> 04:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
included rising and volatile Energy
 
04:28:35.149 --> 04:28:35.159 align:start position:0%

04:28:37.630 --> 04:28:37.640 align:start position:0%
fired generation less control over
 
04:28:39.469 --> 04:28:39.479 align:start position:0%
decisions less influence in Regional
 
04:28:41.149 --> 04:28:41.159 align:start position:0%
decision making related to Consumer
 
04:28:43.070 --> 04:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
interests and concerned that main
 
04:28:45.189 --> 04:28:45.199 align:start position:0%
consumers were paying more than their
 
04:28:47.990 --> 04:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
fair share of a regional cost now while
 
04:28:51.149 --> 04:28:51.159 align:start position:0%
they end up finding 2 years later that
 
04:28:53.710 --> 04:28:53.720 align:start position:0%
the uh the cost would be they'd be
 
04:28:56.229 --> 04:28:56.239 align:start position:0%
paying a bit more compared to 78
 
04:28:59.510 --> 04:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
megawatts rather than 158 Connecticut
 
04:29:01.750 --> 04:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
however when they conducted it the con
 
04:29:03.070 --> 04:29:03.080 align:start position:0%
Connecticut Department of energy
 
04:29:05.309 --> 04:29:05.319 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection found that the
 
04:29:07.309 --> 04:29:07.319 align:start position:0%
regional wholesale electricity Market
 
04:29:09.389 --> 04:29:09.399 align:start position:0%
administered by I New England created
 
04:29:11.550 --> 04:29:11.560 align:start position:0%

04:29:11.560 --> 04:29:12.590 align:start position:0%

04:29:12.590 --> 04:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
development
 
04:29:14.630 --> 04:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
strategies and threaten reliability by
 
04:29:17.349 --> 04:29:17.359 align:start position:0%
increasing Regional Reliance on natural
 
04:29:19.149 --> 04:29:19.159 align:start position:0%
gas they recognized that withdrawing
 
04:29:21.590 --> 04:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
participation ice and New England was an
 
04:29:23.710 --> 04:29:23.720 align:start position:0%
option but that the first State's
 
04:29:26.149 --> 04:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
priority would reform through new
 
04:29:28.870 --> 04:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
regional market designs now Connecticut
 
04:29:31.630 --> 04:29:31.640 align:start position:0%
did not stop and not did not close this
 
04:29:33.910 --> 04:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
in fact they actually still have it open
 
04:29:35.309 --> 04:29:35.319 align:start position:0%
the Connecticut public utilities
 
04:29:37.309 --> 04:29:37.319 align:start position:0%
regulatory Authority has been directed
 
04:29:39.229 --> 04:29:39.239 align:start position:0%
to evaluate whether Connecticut rate
 
04:29:41.269 --> 04:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
payers benefit from Connecticut's
 
04:29:43.630 --> 04:29:43.640 align:start position:0%
Reliance on the wholesale energy markets
 
04:29:46.109 --> 04:29:46.119 align:start position:0%
administered by ISO New England this
 
04:29:48.790 --> 04:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
investigation is taking place through
 
04:29:52.189 --> 04:29:52.199 align:start position:0%
Connecticut P which is still an active
 
04:29:54.109 --> 04:29:54.119 align:start position:0%
docket docket number
 
04:29:58.309 --> 04:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
21515 re 03 therefore Conneticut is
 
04:30:00.830 --> 04:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
still conducting investigation on this
 
04:30:03.189 --> 04:30:03.199 align:start position:0%
Maine found the benefits of it but found
 
04:30:05.070 --> 04:30:05.080 align:start position:0%
that it was going to be more costly
 
04:30:07.229 --> 04:30:07.239 align:start position:0%
therefore I believe it is in extreme
 
04:30:08.990 --> 04:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
interest of New Hampshire to do this
 
04:30:11.990 --> 04:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
investigation to find out as was stated
 
04:30:13.790 --> 04:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
earlier testimony we are a different
 
04:30:16.590 --> 04:30:16.600 align:start position:0%
state our data is different therefore we
 
04:30:18.910 --> 04:30:18.920 align:start position:0%
should investigate how New Hampshire is
 
04:30:21.710 --> 04:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
affected by Isa New England Pros cons
 
04:30:23.550 --> 04:30:23.560 align:start position:0%
and what the effect
 
04:30:26.189 --> 04:30:26.199 align:start position:0%
is okay thank you further discussion on
 
04:30:29.870 --> 04:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
this question representative
 
04:30:32.429 --> 04:30:32.439 align:start position:0%
Harrington you know one of the more uh
 
04:30:34.910 --> 04:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
successful campaign slogans of our time
 
04:30:36.590 --> 04:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
was uh done by the governor when she
 
04:30:39.349 --> 04:30:39.359 align:start position:0%
said don't Mass up New Hampshire and
 
04:30:40.910 --> 04:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
that's what's happening in the electric
 
04:30:42.990 --> 04:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
field Mass Massachusetts and Connecticut
 
04:30:44.630 --> 04:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
you notice when uh representative
 
04:30:45.950 --> 04:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
Summers was talking about the
 
04:30:48.229 --> 04:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
impediments to renewable energy that
 
04:30:50.229 --> 04:30:50.239 align:start position:0%
Connecticut saw back some years ago well
 
04:30:52.389 --> 04:30:52.399 align:start position:0%
that's drastically changed now looking
 
04:30:54.670 --> 04:30:54.680 align:start position:0%
at the iso document economic planning
 
04:30:56.950 --> 04:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
for the clean energy transition issued
 
04:30:58.670 --> 04:30:58.680 align:start position:0%
the end of October this year it's kind
 
04:31:02.149 --> 04:31:02.159 align:start position:0%
of uh eye-opening basically the policies
 
04:31:04.109 --> 04:31:04.119 align:start position:0%
of Massachusetts Connecticut and Rhode
 
04:31:07.309 --> 04:31:07.319 align:start position:0%
Island will be driving what the iso does
 
04:31:10.630 --> 04:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
and this is this moving to this uh zero
 
04:31:13.469 --> 04:31:13.479 align:start position:0%
uh emissions which will result in a lot
 
04:31:15.389 --> 04:31:15.399 align:start position:0%
of different things we're talking
 
04:31:17.070 --> 04:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands of offshore
 
04:31:19.269 --> 04:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
windmills if indeed they get get can get
 
04:31:23.550 --> 04:31:23.560 align:start position:0%
built thousands of um onshore wind uh
 
04:31:26.109 --> 04:31:26.119 align:start position:0%
over 200 square miles of solar panels
 
04:31:28.030 --> 04:31:28.040 align:start position:0%
This would be needed to supplement the
 
04:31:30.510 --> 04:31:30.520 align:start position:0%
getting rid of all the base load uh
 
04:31:32.389 --> 04:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels we have now specifically
 
04:31:35.710 --> 04:31:35.720 align:start position:0%
natural gas but even with all that the
 
04:31:39.030 --> 04:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
key factor remains is that in 2050 the
 
04:31:41.550 --> 04:31:41.560 align:start position:0%
iso predicts for the moderate typical
 
04:31:43.990 --> 04:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
weather conditions we will have to have
 
04:31:47.510 --> 04:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
12 GW that's 12 GW five times the size
 
04:31:50.349 --> 04:31:50.359 align:start position:0%
of seab Brook station of dispatchable
 
04:31:53.349 --> 04:31:53.359 align:start position:0%
resources that run less than 1% of the
 
04:31:56.750 --> 04:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
time otherwise we'll have outages less
 
04:31:59.389 --> 04:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
than more than 1% of the time now to put
 
04:32:01.189 --> 04:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
that in perspective these plants are not
 
04:32:02.670 --> 04:32:02.680 align:start position:0%
going to make much money in the energy
 
04:32:03.910 --> 04:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
Market because they're not going to run
 
04:32:06.149 --> 04:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
very often I asked the iso how they
 
04:32:08.429 --> 04:32:08.439 align:start position:0%
would make money to stay open one
 
04:32:09.710 --> 04:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
suggestion was to put them in the
 
04:32:11.510 --> 04:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
capacity Market they would then be
 
04:32:13.910 --> 04:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
setting the price for capacity extremely
 
04:32:15.710 --> 04:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
high which would be paid to every
 
04:32:17.590 --> 04:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
resource in New England that cleared the
 
04:32:19.630 --> 04:32:19.640 align:start position:0%
forward capacity Market this would drive
 
04:32:21.550 --> 04:32:21.560 align:start position:0%
up the cost of electricity by billions
 
04:32:24.630 --> 04:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
of dollars and it's being set by these
 
04:32:26.429 --> 04:32:26.439 align:start position:0%
other states they're ter determining the
 
04:32:28.910 --> 04:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
policy ISO was basically rolled over and
 
04:32:31.149 --> 04:32:31.159 align:start position:0%
said you know Connecticut Massachusetts
 
04:32:33.750 --> 04:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
account for something like 75% of the
 
04:32:35.070 --> 04:32:35.080 align:start position:0%
load in New England so they were in the
 
04:32:37.229 --> 04:32:37.239 align:start position:0%
driver's seat so I think it behooves us
 
04:32:39.510 --> 04:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
to at least look in and investigate what
 
04:32:42.429 --> 04:32:42.439 align:start position:0%
the possibilities are one possibility is
 
04:32:44.790 --> 04:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
maybe we find that going with like um
 
04:32:46.429 --> 04:32:46.439 align:start position:0%
getting out of the iso in the wing but
 
04:32:49.070 --> 04:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
merging with Maine to form a new ISO or
 
04:32:51.510 --> 04:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
mering merging with Vermont Maine would
 
04:32:53.349 --> 04:32:53.359 align:start position:0%
do it but I think it's definitely worth
 
04:32:54.950 --> 04:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
looking at and finding out where we're
 
04:32:57.070 --> 04:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
going because right now our electric
 
04:32:58.750 --> 04:32:58.760 align:start position:0%
rates are going to be driven by the
 
04:33:00.429 --> 04:33:00.439 align:start position:0%
southern states and they're going to go
 
04:33:02.510 --> 04:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
off the boards and we're going to be
 
04:33:04.029 --> 04:33:04.039 align:start position:0%
sitting here looking pretty silly if we
 
04:33:07.709 --> 04:33:07.719 align:start position:0%
didn't at least look into other
 
04:33:10.269 --> 04:33:10.279 align:start position:0%
possibilities additional comment
 
04:33:12.390 --> 04:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy
 
04:33:14.789 --> 04:33:14.799 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um there's a few
 
04:33:16.869 --> 04:33:16.879 align:start position:0%
things I'd like to to um mention
 
04:33:20.109 --> 04:33:20.119 align:start position:0%
regarding this bill uh first of all it
 
04:33:22.590 --> 04:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
um it's poorly written in that it is
 
04:33:24.990 --> 04:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
requesting a report but there is no end
 
04:33:27.750 --> 04:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
date um and it doesn't say who gets the
 
04:33:29.990 --> 04:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
report so this is just an
 
04:33:34.670 --> 04:33:34.680 align:start position:0%
ongoing investigation by the doe um that
 
04:33:38.670 --> 04:33:38.680 align:start position:0%
seems to have no no end to it um if you
 
04:33:42.109 --> 04:33:42.119 align:start position:0%
look at the information um we could say
 
04:33:44.949 --> 04:33:44.959 align:start position:0%
first of all doe also um Rec uh
 
04:33:47.629 --> 04:33:47.639 align:start position:0%
suggested that this investigation would
 
04:33:50.070 --> 04:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
cost $200,000 which I don't believe for
 
04:33:53.590 --> 04:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
a second um the um if you look at the
 
04:33:55.789 --> 04:33:55.799 align:start position:0%
report that that Maine did they did a
 
04:33:59.949 --> 04:33:59.959 align:start position:0%
pretty comprehensive uh report um that
 
04:34:02.429 --> 04:34:02.439 align:start position:0%
I'm I wish I could have gotten the price
 
04:34:05.750 --> 04:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
on but but there is no price on that um
 
04:34:08.590 --> 04:34:08.600 align:start position:0%
merging with another state to create a
 
04:34:12.189 --> 04:34:12.199 align:start position:0%
new ISO my goodness I mean all I keep
 
04:34:14.189 --> 04:34:14.199 align:start position:0%
hearing from you guys is about lowering
 
04:34:16.949 --> 04:34:16.959 align:start position:0%
customer rates lowering customer rates
 
04:34:18.590 --> 04:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
um the rates would go through the roof
 
04:34:21.150 --> 04:34:21.160 align:start position:0%
if we did something like that um and
 
04:34:23.910 --> 04:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
lastly to use the defense that the doe
 
04:34:25.949 --> 04:34:25.959 align:start position:0%
is neutral on this bill as a
 
04:34:29.830 --> 04:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
justification for passing it Forward um
 
04:34:32.390 --> 04:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
is to use false logic they're neutral on
 
04:34:36.470 --> 04:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
everything and in fact on our side we
 
04:34:39.109 --> 04:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
take a shot every time the DOA announces
 
04:34:42.629 --> 04:34:42.639 align:start position:0%
that it's neutral on a Bill thank thank
 
04:34:46.949 --> 04:34:46.959 align:start position:0%
you further discussion representative
 
04:34:49.429 --> 04:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
Kaplan thank you uh Mr
 
04:34:52.910 --> 04:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
chair I I think that this bill uh is
 
04:34:54.910 --> 04:34:54.920 align:start position:0%
basically a waste of time because it's a
 
04:34:57.029 --> 04:34:57.039 align:start position:0%
act asking for an investigation that's
 
04:34:59.029 --> 04:34:59.039 align:start position:0%
already been conducted by two member
 
04:35:00.750 --> 04:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
states of the iso New England that yes
 
04:35:02.709 --> 04:35:02.719 align:start position:0%
do have different data but actually
 
04:35:05.349 --> 04:35:05.359 align:start position:0%
share uh one thing in common that is
 
04:35:06.869 --> 04:35:06.879 align:start position:0%
that they have better interconnection
 
04:35:08.990 --> 04:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
possibilities than we do and they both
 
04:35:11.949 --> 04:35:11.959 align:start position:0%
those states have already concluded that
 
04:35:13.789 --> 04:35:13.799 align:start position:0%
the you know withdrawing from the iso
 
04:35:16.869 --> 04:35:16.879 align:start position:0%
New England does not make any sense uh
 
04:35:21.670 --> 04:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
even though as my friend pointed out uh
 
04:35:23.869 --> 04:35:23.879 align:start position:0%
there are things that can be answered in
 
04:35:25.310 --> 04:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
such a study but they've already been
 
04:35:26.830 --> 04:35:26.840 align:start position:0%
answered in those studies so why do we
 
04:35:28.709 --> 04:35:28.719 align:start position:0%
need to you know we we just heard a
 
04:35:31.750 --> 04:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
whole list of of uh of the downside of
 
04:35:34.150 --> 04:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
being members of of uh being a part of
 
04:35:36.230 --> 04:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
iso New England so why why do we need to
 
04:35:38.429 --> 04:35:38.439 align:start position:0%
do this we've already we we already have
 
04:35:41.150 --> 04:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
those results we know what they are what
 
04:35:42.429 --> 04:35:42.439 align:start position:0%
I found in interesting was that
 
04:35:45.269 --> 04:35:45.279 align:start position:0%
Connecticut uh found that one of the
 
04:35:47.510 --> 04:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
downsides of being part of iso England
 
04:35:49.629 --> 04:35:49.639 align:start position:0%
was an over Reliance on natural gas so
 
04:35:52.390 --> 04:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that these studies will
 
04:35:54.510 --> 04:35:54.520 align:start position:0%
find whatever you know whatever you put
 
04:35:56.470 --> 04:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
into it is what you're going to get out
 
04:35:58.349 --> 04:35:58.359 align:start position:0%
and you can lead to you can it can lead
 
04:36:01.109 --> 04:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
to very very different um outcomes but
 
04:36:03.869 --> 04:36:03.879 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day the bottom line is
 
04:36:06.029 --> 04:36:06.039 align:start position:0%
that the cost of withdrawing from ISO
 
04:36:08.269 --> 04:36:08.279 align:start position:0%
New England would always outweigh any of
 
04:36:10.830 --> 04:36:10.840 align:start position:0%
the benefits and the department of
 
04:36:12.429 --> 04:36:12.439 align:start position:0%
energy actually concluded that in the
 
04:36:14.709 --> 04:36:14.719 align:start position:0%
public hearing they they they said in so
 
04:36:16.670 --> 04:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
many words that there is no way that
 
04:36:19.709 --> 04:36:19.719 align:start position:0%
they can see this study leading to a
 
04:36:21.869 --> 04:36:21.879 align:start position:0%
recommendation to lead ISO England that
 
04:36:25.109 --> 04:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
is not going to happen uh so wh why
 
04:36:28.590 --> 04:36:28.600 align:start position:0%
waste any money at all on such a
 
04:36:31.789 --> 04:36:31.799 align:start position:0%
study Vice chair Thomas thank you Mr
 
04:36:34.269 --> 04:36:34.279 align:start position:0%
chairman I will be supporting this bill
 
04:36:36.269 --> 04:36:36.279 align:start position:0%
because this subject has been coming up
 
04:36:38.750 --> 04:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
now for several years and you know
 
04:36:40.750 --> 04:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
here's an opportunity to finally put
 
04:36:42.029 --> 04:36:42.039 align:start position:0%
something to paper
 
04:36:44.551 --> 04:36:44.561 align:start position:0%
let doe investigate maybe by the end of
 
04:36:47.590 --> 04:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
that investigation uh we'll have less
 
04:36:49.470 --> 04:36:49.480 align:start position:0%
times that bills like this come forward
 
04:36:51.949 --> 04:36:51.959 align:start position:0%
because maybe we'll finally settle on
 
04:36:54.510 --> 04:36:54.520 align:start position:0%
just what exactly is a good or not so
 
04:36:56.869 --> 04:36:56.879 align:start position:0%
good effort so let's go ahead and do the
 
04:36:59.670 --> 04:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
investigation get out of the way and
 
04:37:01.910 --> 04:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
let's be done with it
 
04:37:04.551 --> 04:37:04.561 align:start position:0%
afterwards representative McGee thank
 
04:37:07.510 --> 04:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman well um Mr Vice chairman
 
04:37:09.310 --> 04:37:09.320 align:start position:0%
I think that's probably the best reason
 
04:37:11.789 --> 04:37:11.799 align:start position:0%
that I've heard uh for going for forward
 
04:37:15.349 --> 04:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
with the bill but where I fall on it is
 
04:37:18.789 --> 04:37:18.799 align:start position:0%
um I just want to know how it would work
 
04:37:21.510 --> 04:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
um we are members of a regional grid and
 
04:37:23.029 --> 04:37:23.039 align:start position:0%
certainly we have the option to go our
 
04:37:26.390 --> 04:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
own way but as was already mentioned by
 
04:37:31.830 --> 04:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
other speakers the cost of that uh would
 
04:37:35.510 --> 04:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
would be I I would imagine huge uh
 
04:37:37.629 --> 04:37:37.639 align:start position:0%
because we we do derive benefits from
 
04:37:40.510 --> 04:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
being party to the regional Grid in our
 
04:37:44.750 --> 04:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
region so um for its imperfections I I
 
04:37:47.150 --> 04:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
get the feeling that this bill is more
 
04:37:49.109 --> 04:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
of uh perfect being the enemy of the
 
04:37:51.949 --> 04:37:51.959 align:start position:0%
good we don't like all the things that
 
04:37:54.310 --> 04:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh that the iso imposes or that the
 
04:37:56.510 --> 04:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
regional wholesale markets
 
04:37:56.520 --> 04:37:59.349 align:start position:0%
regional wholesale markets
include

04:37:59.349 --> 04:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
include
 
04:38:01.990 --> 04:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
but we don't have any idea what the
 
04:38:05.670 --> 04:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
alternative would cost and I think we're
 
04:38:08.310 --> 04:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
or even how it would work and so I guess
 
04:38:10.590 --> 04:38:10.600 align:start position:0%
that my question is why would we want to
 
04:38:13.590 --> 04:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
go on a on a sort of a wild goose chase
 
04:38:15.789 --> 04:38:15.799 align:start position:0%
trying to figure that out rather than
 
04:38:17.551 --> 04:38:17.561 align:start position:0%
maybe trying to solve for some of the
 
04:38:19.510 --> 04:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
problems that we have with the grid
 
04:38:22.949 --> 04:38:22.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:26.310 --> 04:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
over representative Corman thank you Mr
 
04:38:29.590 --> 04:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
chairman yeah I I missed the field trip
 
04:38:34.551 --> 04:38:34.561 align:start position:0%
to iso's control room last time but I
 
04:38:35.830 --> 04:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
have a pretty good idea of what it looks
 
04:38:38.109 --> 04:38:38.119 align:start position:0%
like I saw the eversource one and I I
 
04:38:40.310 --> 04:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
guess the iso one's pretty similar and I
 
04:38:43.029 --> 04:38:43.039 align:start position:0%
realize you know or I think about we'd
 
04:38:45.830 --> 04:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
have to build one of those and we'd have
 
04:38:47.949 --> 04:38:47.959 align:start position:0%
to have all the control systems
 
04:38:51.629 --> 04:38:51.639 align:start position:0%
throughout the entire State hooked into
 
04:38:54.709 --> 04:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
that and I I can't imagine what the cost
 
04:38:57.910 --> 04:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
of that would be and who's going to pay
 
04:38:59.990 --> 04:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
for it we know who's going to pay for it
 
04:39:02.830 --> 04:39:02.840 align:start position:0%
so you know I feel like yeah we could do
 
04:39:05.830 --> 04:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
the study but this is asking a question
 
04:39:09.109 --> 04:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:11.390 --> 04:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
answer well I think this bill is more
 
04:39:14.349 --> 04:39:14.359 align:start position:0%
more than just a study of leaving I ISO
 
04:39:16.349 --> 04:39:16.359 align:start position:0%
New England this it's also a bill that
 
04:39:20.109 --> 04:39:20.119 align:start position:0%
wants to investigate how the rest of the
 
04:39:21.269 --> 04:39:21.279 align:start position:0%
New England
 
04:39:25.470 --> 04:39:25.480 align:start position:0%
states who are sort of driving ISO
 
04:39:27.990 --> 04:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
policy are going to affect New Hampshire
 
04:39:29.470 --> 04:39:29.480 align:start position:0%
and whether there's anything that can be
 
04:39:30.551 --> 04:39:30.561 align:start position:0%
done about
 
04:39:33.830 --> 04:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
it representative Harrington articulated
 
04:39:36.109 --> 04:39:36.119 align:start position:0%
those concerns very very well and I
 
04:39:38.910 --> 04:39:38.920 align:start position:0%
think they're important questions that
 
04:39:43.708 --> 04:39:43.718 align:start position:0%
have to be answered and the doe is in a
 
04:39:46.190 --> 04:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
perfect place to ask those questions
 
04:39:48.310 --> 04:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
they probably even have better questions
 
04:39:50.990 --> 04:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
than we could come up with on our own so
 
04:39:55.190 --> 04:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
I think supporting this uh
 
04:40:00.030 --> 04:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
study is worthwhile to do
 
04:40:04.310 --> 04:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
and the the the results of the study
 
04:40:06.550 --> 04:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
will probably be very revealing to all
 
04:40:06.560 --> 04:40:07.390 align:start position:0%
will probably be very revealing to all
of

04:40:07.390 --> 04:40:07.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:40:10.470 --> 04:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
us any further discussion representative
 
04:40:10.480 --> 04:40:12.070 align:start position:0%
us any further discussion representative
Harrington

04:40:12.070 --> 04:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
Harrington
 
04:40:13.510 --> 04:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I just wanted to make one point
 
04:40:15.110 --> 04:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
that this the previous studies that were
 
04:40:16.788 --> 04:40:16.798 align:start position:0%
mentioned in Connecticut and Maine were
 
04:40:18.948 --> 04:40:18.958 align:start position:0%
done some time ago especially the one in
 
04:40:21.990 --> 04:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
Maine and they both talked about a uh
 
04:40:24.230 --> 04:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
High Reliance on natural gas and under
 
04:40:26.590 --> 04:40:26.600 align:start position:0%
the newest Plans by ISO New England
 
04:40:28.070 --> 04:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
they're talking about phasing out
 
04:40:30.390 --> 04:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
natural gas other than for this I'm
 
04:40:32.868 --> 04:40:32.878 align:start position:0%
assumably this 1% of the plants the 12
 
04:40:34.910 --> 04:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
gaws that don't run hly at all but we
 
04:40:37.110 --> 04:40:37.120 align:start position:0%
still have to pay for so what was what
 
04:40:38.788 --> 04:40:38.798 align:start position:0%
was invogue what was going on with
 
04:40:40.990 --> 04:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
policy-wise back then is not now and I
 
04:40:42.590 --> 04:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
agree completely with the chairman one
 
04:40:43.990 --> 04:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
of the things we need to be looking at
 
04:40:46.110 --> 04:40:46.120 align:start position:0%
here is what's the option what happens
 
04:40:48.590 --> 04:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
if we do stay in and all these policies
 
04:40:50.390 --> 04:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
go in with these thousands and thousands
 
04:40:52.590 --> 04:40:52.600 align:start position:0%
of offshore windmills that might not
 
04:40:54.150 --> 04:40:54.160 align:start position:0%
even get built so I don't know what we
 
04:40:56.750 --> 04:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
do then but I think looking at what
 
04:41:00.070 --> 04:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
happens uh given this uh the iso's own
 
04:41:02.310 --> 04:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
predictions going forward is something
 
04:41:06.510 --> 04:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:09.190 --> 04:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
well okay I'd like to ask the clerk to
 
04:41:11.590 --> 04:41:11.600 align:start position:0%

session on House Bill
 
04:42:38.990 --> 04:42:39.000 align:start position:0%

the chair recognizes representative bney
 
04:42:47.550 --> 04:42:47.560 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman I move that we judge
 
04:42:52.510 --> 04:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
HB 681 as inexpedient to legislate chair
 
04:42:55.150 --> 04:42:55.160 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative schneller
 
04:42:58.070 --> 04:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
second the motion moved and seconded
 
04:43:00.270 --> 04:43:00.280 align:start position:0%
that we adopt the motion of itl for
 
04:43:03.190 --> 04:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
House Bill 681 chair recognizes
 
04:43:06.310 --> 04:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
representative bney thank you chairman
 
04:43:08.470 --> 04:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
um one of the issues that the department
 
04:43:11.190 --> 04:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
of energy brought up is on page two
 
04:43:14.230 --> 04:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
lines 20 through 27 uh which they
 
04:43:17.868 --> 04:43:17.878 align:start position:0%
understood as um the cost controls for
 
04:43:21.550 --> 04:43:21.560 align:start position:0%
the project would be moved from uh the
 
04:43:25.470 --> 04:43:25.480 align:start position:0%
Pu to this uh platform governing Council
 
04:43:29.270 --> 04:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
um that seemed uh concerning and then uh
 
04:43:31.270 --> 04:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
the other reason to itl this bill is
 
04:43:34.150 --> 04:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
because we passed 723 thank
 
04:43:39.470 --> 04:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:42.150 --> 04:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
discussion representative M guess just
 
04:43:45.670 --> 04:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
by way of explanation yes this bill was
 
04:43:47.948 --> 04:43:47.958 align:start position:0%
was about transitioning to the
 
04:43:49.948 --> 04:43:49.958 align:start position:0%
governance Council as the means of
 
04:43:51.670 --> 04:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
making decisions going forward rather
 
04:43:54.310 --> 04:43:54.320 align:start position:0%
than leaving an open public utilities
 
04:43:57.390 --> 04:43:57.400 align:start position:0%
case forever um but it was predicated on
 
04:43:58.868 --> 04:43:58.878 align:start position:0%
the fact that the project was going to
 
04:44:02.430 --> 04:44:02.440 align:start position:0%
be moving towards RFB and eventually um
 
04:44:05.628 --> 04:44:05.638 align:start position:0%
being built so since that is not there
 
04:44:08.750 --> 04:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
anymore uh the need for the bill is
 
04:44:13.150 --> 04:44:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:16.110 --> 04:44:16.120 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further comment I'll ask
 
04:44:18.670 --> 04:44:18.680 align:start position:0%
the clerk to call the role on the
 
04:44:21.190 --> 04:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
question of adopting the motion of itl
 
04:44:23.270 --> 04:44:23.280 align:start position:0%

representative Bernardi second the
 
04:46:27.150 --> 04:46:27.160 align:start position:0%
motion moved and seconded that we adopt

the motion of itl for HB 674 chair
 
04:46:33.628 --> 04:46:33.638 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Harrington
 
04:46:35.430 --> 04:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I think we just heard for hours on
 
04:46:37.510 --> 04:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
the uh the whole bit with the time of
 
04:46:41.150 --> 04:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
use and um smart meas and whether it's
 
04:46:43.230 --> 04:46:43.240 align:start position:0%
best to do it by legislature or allow
 
04:46:45.708 --> 04:46:45.718 align:start position:0%
the ongoing process at the Pu I think
 
04:46:47.030 --> 04:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
it's better to go through the process
 
04:46:48.470 --> 04:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
over there where the details can be
 
04:46:50.110 --> 04:46:50.120 align:start position:0%
worked out because this is a very
 
04:46:52.430 --> 04:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
detailed complicated issue so therefore
 
04:46:55.470 --> 04:46:55.480 align:start position:0%
I think this uh bill is
 
04:46:57.548 --> 04:46:57.558 align:start position:0%
unnecessary further
 
04:47:00.548 --> 04:47:00.558 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
04:47:03.310 --> 04:47:03.320 align:start position:0%
Kaplan yeah I uh for the very same
 
04:47:05.628 --> 04:47:05.638 align:start position:0%
reasons I I would like to retain this
 
04:47:07.150 --> 04:47:07.160 align:start position:0%
bill because I think that it's the
 
04:47:09.750 --> 04:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
legislature's duty to uh to set things
 
04:47:11.948 --> 04:47:11.958 align:start position:0%
in statute and not wait for the you know
 
04:47:15.190 --> 04:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
the Pu to to lead the charge on the way
 
04:47:17.548 --> 04:47:17.558 align:start position:0%
we want utilities to do the work of the
 
04:47:19.948 --> 04:47:19.958 align:start position:0%
State uh and yeah I agree that you know
 
04:47:21.990 --> 04:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
these are complicated issues that that
 
04:47:23.628 --> 04:47:23.638 align:start position:0%
that need lots of thought and lots of
 
04:47:27.628 --> 04:47:27.638 align:start position:0%
work um and this bill is intended to you
 
04:47:29.470 --> 04:47:29.480 align:start position:0%
know incentivize things that we all
 
04:47:31.708 --> 04:47:31.718 align:start position:0%
agree that we want the utilities to do
 
04:47:34.470 --> 04:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
so um I would hope that we could retain
 
04:47:36.788 --> 04:47:36.798 align:start position:0%
the bill and bring it back in September
 
04:47:39.310 --> 04:47:39.320 align:start position:0%
and uh maybe make some amendments uh and
 
04:47:40.990 --> 04:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
and decide how to move forward with it
 
04:47:41.990 --> 04:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
at that
 
04:47:46.868 --> 04:47:46.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:49.310 --> 04:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
comment seeing none I'll ask the clerk
 
04:47:51.510 --> 04:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
to call the role on the question of the
 
04:47:56.310 --> 04:47:56.320 align:start position:0%

674 representative Harrington will write
 
04:48:53.110 --> 04:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
the Mr chairman there may be a problem
 
04:48:54.470 --> 04:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
with that once you need it because right
 
04:48:56.868 --> 04:48:56.878 align:start position:0%
now my email is not working at all I
 
04:48:59.310 --> 04:48:59.320 align:start position:0%
can't send out any email so I don't know
 
04:49:01.150 --> 04:49:01.160 align:start position:0%
if it'll be fixed by tonight or whatever
 
04:49:02.788 --> 04:49:02.798 align:start position:0%
I don't know what's causing the problem
 
04:49:05.830 --> 04:49:05.840 align:start position:0%
so okay we'll take that offline will
 
04:49:08.150 --> 04:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
there be a Minority
 
04:49:11.150 --> 04:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
Report and it will be written by
 
04:49:14.948 --> 04:49:14.958 align:start position:0%
representative Kaplan Kaplan okay thank
 
04:49:18.430 --> 04:49:18.440 align:start position:0%
you when do you need that by again Mr 7
 
04:49:22.230 --> 04:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
am tomorrow tomorrow
 
04:49:25.750 --> 04:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
yep all right with that we'll close that
 
04:49:28.110 --> 04:49:28.120 align:start position:0%
executive session and now we're down to
 
04:49:31.190 --> 04:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
our last executive session of the
 
04:49:36.190 --> 04:49:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:38.628 --> 04:49:38.638 align:start position:0%
hcr2 declaring the development of
 
04:49:41.150 --> 04:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
advanced nuclear technology nuclear
 
04:49:43.150 --> 04:49:43.160 align:start position:0%
energy technology to be in the best
 
04:49:45.590 --> 04:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
interest of the State of New Hampshire
 
04:49:47.788 --> 04:49:47.798 align:start position:0%

hcr2 CH recognizes representative N I
 
04:50:00.670 --> 04:50:00.680 align:start position:0%
second the motion moved and seconded
 
04:50:04.708 --> 04:50:04.718 align:start position:0%
that we adopt the motion of OTP for hcr2
 
04:50:07.868 --> 04:50:07.878 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes Vice chair Thomas thank
 
04:50:08.750 --> 04:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
04:50:11.110 --> 04:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
chairman uh Mr chairman I think this
 
04:50:14.190 --> 04:50:14.200 align:start position:0%
committee has heard numerous uh public
 
04:50:17.070 --> 04:50:17.080 align:start position:0%
testimony uh for this bill and other
 
04:50:19.430 --> 04:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
bills involving nuclear energy of how
 
04:50:21.430 --> 04:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
important it is to send out a strong
 
04:50:25.390 --> 04:50:25.400 align:start position:0%
message to anyone looking at this state
 
04:50:29.110 --> 04:50:29.120 align:start position:0%
for possible investing into particularly
 
04:50:32.310 --> 04:50:32.320 align:start position:0%
the new type of uh nuclear energy we
 
04:50:35.070 --> 04:50:35.080 align:start position:0%
know that nuclear energy is a wave of
 
04:50:37.868 --> 04:50:37.878 align:start position:0%
the future we need to have base loads we
 
04:50:39.990 --> 04:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
know it would be good for our economy
 
04:50:41.628 --> 04:50:41.638 align:start position:0%
and we know know that it would be good
 
04:50:44.750 --> 04:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
to shore up uh you know Baseline type of
 
04:50:47.310 --> 04:50:47.320 align:start position:0%
energy here with our generators and with
 
04:50:49.030 --> 04:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
the new technology there's a lots of
 
04:50:51.628 --> 04:50:51.638 align:start position:0%
opportunity so by making this resolution
 
04:50:54.110 --> 04:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
and telling the world that we think it's
 
04:50:55.990 --> 04:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of of New Hampshire
 
04:50:58.430 --> 04:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
to at least explore any type of new
 
04:51:01.310 --> 04:51:01.320 align:start position:0%
scale nuclear energy it is telling
 
04:51:03.230 --> 04:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
everybody that we are open to that
 
04:51:05.628 --> 04:51:05.638 align:start position:0%
suggestion that investors could come in
 
04:51:07.510 --> 04:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
and take a look around if it meets
 
04:51:11.390 --> 04:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
Market um um situation then maybe
 
04:51:13.628 --> 04:51:13.638 align:start position:0%
they'll invest but it sends out a strong
 
04:51:15.670 --> 04:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
message and I think for that reason we
 
04:51:17.390 --> 04:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
should pass this resolution to tell
 
04:51:19.830 --> 04:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
people that we are open to this new type
 
04:51:22.190 --> 04:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
of nuclear energy for the benefit of all
 
04:51:23.190 --> 04:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:51:25.910 --> 04:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
state further
 
04:51:29.190 --> 04:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
comment representative Wendy Thomas
 
04:51:32.110 --> 04:51:32.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um recently in
 
04:51:35.670 --> 04:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
Washington there was a a massive layoff
 
04:51:37.708 --> 04:51:37.718 align:start position:0%
and they laid off um many of the people
 
04:51:39.830 --> 04:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
that are responsible for um monitoring
 
04:51:41.628 --> 04:51:41.638 align:start position:0%
our nuclear
 
04:51:44.708 --> 04:51:44.718 align:start position:0%
um industry and well not industry but
 
04:51:48.150 --> 04:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
but nuclear Arsenal in in um for the
 
04:51:51.510 --> 04:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
United States um I think that this bill
 
04:51:53.628 --> 04:51:53.638 align:start position:0%
right now with this Administration puts
 
04:51:57.230 --> 04:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
the cart before the horse and um until
 
04:52:01.350 --> 04:52:01.360 align:start position:0%
we understand the importance of managing
 
04:52:05.150 --> 04:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
nuclear devices on a federal level we
 
04:52:06.590 --> 04:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
shouldn't even be fooling around with
 
04:52:09.350 --> 04:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
them on the state level thank you
 
04:52:12.470 --> 04:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
further comment
 
04:52:14.510 --> 04:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
Vice chair Thomas uh thank you Mr
 
04:52:18.190 --> 04:52:18.200 align:start position:0%
chairman um uh yes uh that happened
 
04:52:20.190 --> 04:52:20.200 align:start position:0%
originally in reference to my good
 
04:52:23.548 --> 04:52:23.558 align:start position:0%
friend to my right comment but I also
 
04:52:25.470 --> 04:52:25.480 align:start position:0%
learned that they are in the process of
 
04:52:28.628 --> 04:52:28.638 align:start position:0%
hiring back the nuclear workers uh in
 
04:52:31.190 --> 04:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
into the field and also one thing to
 
04:52:33.430 --> 04:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
remember if we pass this resolution it
 
04:52:35.150 --> 04:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
will encourage more Education and
 
04:52:37.750 --> 04:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
Training in into this field from which
 
04:52:41.110 --> 04:52:41.120 align:start position:0%
we would need more more workers
 
04:52:44.590 --> 04:52:44.600 align:start position:0%
additional comment representative
 
04:52:47.590 --> 04:52:47.600 align:start position:0%
schneller thank you Mr chairman just
 
04:52:49.868 --> 04:52:49.878 align:start position:0%
want to read a comment recently from uh
 
04:52:53.310 --> 04:52:53.320 align:start position:0%
Jim sturos from the Pioneer Institute he
 
04:52:55.150 --> 04:52:55.160 align:start position:0%
said for years Massachusetts was
 
04:52:58.070 --> 04:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
recognized Nation wise Nationwide is a
 
04:53:00.750 --> 04:53:00.760 align:start position:0%
magnet for Capital and talent now we are
 
04:53:03.590 --> 04:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
not so we need our leaders focused on
 
04:53:05.350 --> 04:53:05.360 align:start position:0%
addressing the reasons why wealth and
 
04:53:07.910 --> 04:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
talent are heading for the
 
04:53:11.030 --> 04:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
exits uh
 
04:53:13.110 --> 04:53:13.120 align:start position:0%
they further that the study further
 
04:53:15.548 --> 04:53:15.558 align:start position:0%
found that the exits and and the
 
04:53:17.590 --> 04:53:17.600 align:start position:0%
destinations of those people are Florida
 
04:53:19.830 --> 04:53:19.840 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire so we are attracting
 
04:53:22.510 --> 04:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
the talent and the capital that would be
 
04:53:25.830 --> 04:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
necessary to fund both from a human
 
04:53:28.788 --> 04:53:28.798 align:start position:0%
capital perspective and a financial
 
04:53:31.270 --> 04:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
Capital perspective for a nuclear effort
 
04:53:33.670 --> 04:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
so I think this is a great
 
04:53:36.270 --> 04:53:36.280 align:start position:0%
resolution additional
 
04:53:38.788 --> 04:53:38.798 align:start position:0%
comments representative
 
04:53:41.470 --> 04:53:41.480 align:start position:0%
Corman thank you Mr
 
04:53:44.110 --> 04:53:44.120 align:start position:0%
chairman I found myself really torn on
 
04:53:47.628 --> 04:53:47.638 align:start position:0%
this um if if my late wife heard me
 
04:53:49.548 --> 04:53:49.558 align:start position:0%
saying that I would be voting for this
 
04:53:52.430 --> 04:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
she would just be shocked um 30 years
 
04:53:54.548 --> 04:53:54.558 align:start position:0%
ago we were no nukes no nukes no nukes
 
04:53:58.510 --> 04:53:58.520 align:start position:0%
also no tobacco and um you the fact is
 
04:54:00.948 --> 04:54:00.958 align:start position:0%
technology has changed and we need to
 
04:54:02.990 --> 04:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
recognize that really for all
 
04:54:05.230 --> 04:54:05.240 align:start position:0%
Technologies as I spoke earlier about
 
04:54:07.548 --> 04:54:07.558 align:start position:0%
batteries um I also think it's true
 
04:54:09.910 --> 04:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
about offshore wind we shouldn't be
 
04:54:11.948 --> 04:54:11.958 align:start position:0%
assuming that the technology that that
 
04:54:13.628 --> 04:54:13.638 align:start position:0%
is out there now is the technology of
 
04:54:15.868 --> 04:54:15.878 align:start position:0%
the Future No More seab Brooks are going
 
04:54:17.350 --> 04:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
to be built that's not the kind of
 
04:54:18.830 --> 04:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
nuclear we're talking
 
04:54:22.350 --> 04:54:22.360 align:start position:0%
about um I'm going to vote for this I I
 
04:54:24.628 --> 04:54:24.638 align:start position:0%
I understand representative Wendy
 
04:54:26.910 --> 04:54:26.920 align:start position:0%
Thomas's concern and you know I always
 
04:54:28.868 --> 04:54:28.878 align:start position:0%
have tremendous respect for anything
 
04:54:30.470 --> 04:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
that she says and I understand her
 
04:54:33.430 --> 04:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
concern about what's going on um at the
 
04:54:37.708 --> 04:54:37.718 align:start position:0%
federal level um but I I
 
04:54:40.510 --> 04:54:40.520 align:start position:0%
just can't believe that we'll have
 
04:54:43.230 --> 04:54:43.240 align:start position:0%
completely unfettered
 
04:54:46.230 --> 04:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
unregulated nukes everywhere that you
 
04:54:48.910 --> 04:54:48.920 align:start position:0%
know it's in in in my back yard or
 
04:54:51.350 --> 04:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
anything like that and you know look we
 
04:54:53.470 --> 04:54:53.480 align:start position:0%
do need reliable base load that's zero
 
04:54:55.548 --> 04:54:55.558 align:start position:0%
carbon that's that's great and you know
 
04:54:57.230 --> 04:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned about the nuclear waste
 
04:55:00.990 --> 04:55:01.000 align:start position:0%
issue but that's a relatively small
 
04:55:06.548 --> 04:55:06.558 align:start position:0%
amount volume wise so um um I'm amazed
 
04:55:09.390 --> 04:55:09.400 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to vote for this further
 
04:55:11.830 --> 04:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
comments representative
 
04:55:15.590 --> 04:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
lelle thank you Mr chair I think as I
 
04:55:17.470 --> 04:55:17.480 align:start position:0%
look around worldwide I see countries
 
04:55:20.628 --> 04:55:20.638 align:start position:0%
going back to nuclear uh France has
 
04:55:22.310 --> 04:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
always had probably the majority of
 
04:55:25.070 --> 04:55:25.080 align:start position:0%
their energy from nuclear and as I went
 
04:55:27.230 --> 04:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
to BBC news this morning I was surprised
 
04:55:30.990 --> 04:55:31.000 align:start position:0%
to find that of all countries Japan is
 
04:55:33.430 --> 04:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
turning back to nuclear and they're
 
04:55:35.750 --> 04:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
about to recommission a 50-year old
 
04:55:38.350 --> 04:55:38.360 align:start position:0%
nuclear plant so if they can do that in
 
04:55:40.030 --> 04:55:40.040 align:start position:0%
Japan with all the seismic activity
 
04:55:43.628 --> 04:55:43.638 align:start position:0%
there we can certainly do it here thank
 
04:55:46.708 --> 04:55:46.718 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:55:49.470 --> 04:55:49.480 align:start position:0%
parshall thank you chair I will not be
 
04:55:50.990 --> 04:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
voting for this
 
04:55:57.628 --> 04:55:57.638 align:start position:0%
HCR um in part because the only
 
04:56:00.910 --> 04:56:00.920 align:start position:0%
domestic uh effort to uh create a small
 
04:56:03.628 --> 04:56:03.638 align:start position:0%
mod reactor was out was by nuclear out
 
04:56:07.150 --> 04:56:07.160 align:start position:0%
in Utah that went Belly Up in 2023 after
 
04:56:10.948 --> 04:56:10.958 align:start position:0%
a cost of 400 million in direct funding
 
04:56:16.628 --> 04:56:16.638 align:start position:0%
and 1.3 36 billion in um cost uh share
 
04:56:16.638 --> 04:56:17.670 align:start position:0%
and 1.3 36 billion in um cost uh share
uh

04:56:17.670 --> 04:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:56:21.830 --> 04:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
revenues also the the problem
 
04:56:26.070 --> 04:56:26.080 align:start position:0%
of low waste is not clearly understood
 
04:56:27.750 --> 04:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh using the same figures that were
 
04:56:29.830 --> 04:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
provided by new scale there was a study
 
04:56:33.548 --> 04:56:33.558 align:start position:0%
at Stanford University that um uh
 
04:56:35.948 --> 04:56:35.958 align:start position:0%
concluded that because of economies of
 
04:56:37.750 --> 04:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
scale because these two don't function
 
04:56:39.390 --> 04:56:39.400 align:start position:0%
function in a much smaller level they
 
04:56:42.030 --> 04:56:42.040 align:start position:0%
produce up to 30 times as much waste as
 
04:56:42.040 --> 04:56:43.070 align:start position:0%
produce up to 30 times as much waste as
regular

04:56:43.070 --> 04:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
regular
 
04:56:45.628 --> 04:56:45.638 align:start position:0%
reactors um I'm not saying that I'm to
 
04:56:47.948 --> 04:56:47.958 align:start position:0%
pull my stock in one study but I'm
 
04:56:50.470 --> 04:56:50.480 align:start position:0%
saying there is Con there is controversy
 
04:56:53.470 --> 04:56:53.480 align:start position:0%
over this and plus I finally I'm going
 
04:56:55.628 --> 04:56:55.638 align:start position:0%
to be in oppos opposition to this
 
04:56:57.948 --> 04:56:57.958 align:start position:0%
because I think when we're focusing so
 
04:57:00.070 --> 04:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
much on a technology that nobody is
 
04:57:02.110 --> 04:57:02.120 align:start position:0%
investing in we're losing real
 
04:57:05.430 --> 04:57:05.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to invest in other
 
04:57:09.070 --> 04:57:09.080 align:start position:0%
proven uh areas such as solar wind and
 
04:57:11.788 --> 04:57:11.798 align:start position:0%
hydro and I think our first responsible
 
04:57:14.310 --> 04:57:14.320 align:start position:0%
needs to be investing in technology or
 
04:57:16.390 --> 04:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
encouraging in the investment of
 
04:57:19.110 --> 04:57:19.120 align:start position:0%
Technology of that's already been proven
 
04:57:21.548 --> 04:57:21.558 align:start position:0%
lower rates so I will be voting against
 
04:57:21.558 --> 04:57:22.830 align:start position:0%
lower rates so I will be voting against
this

04:57:22.830 --> 04:57:22.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:57:26.510 --> 04:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
bill representative McGee thank you Mr
 
04:57:29.510 --> 04:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
chairman um I I think that as we've
 
04:57:31.070 --> 04:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
heard going around the
 
04:57:33.708 --> 04:57:33.718 align:start position:0%
table uh we all have different
 
04:57:36.470 --> 04:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
information that we like to focus on
 
04:57:37.868 --> 04:57:37.878 align:start position:0%
when we talk about
 
04:57:40.510 --> 04:57:40.520 align:start position:0%
nuclear um we probably aren't going to
 
04:57:42.868 --> 04:57:42.878 align:start position:0%
be building large scale nuclear reactors
 
04:57:45.628 --> 04:57:45.638 align:start position:0%
unless they're needed um are people
 
04:57:47.750 --> 04:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
around the world building small modular
 
04:57:50.750 --> 04:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
reactors they are um everyone is trying
 
04:57:54.150 --> 04:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
to drive the cost down and even the
 
04:57:58.788 --> 04:57:58.798 align:start position:0%
ipcc has has admitted that we can't get
 
04:58:01.788 --> 04:58:01.798 align:start position:0%
to Net Zero or we can't make significant
 
04:58:05.030 --> 04:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
strides without having clean Baseel load
 
04:58:07.150 --> 04:58:07.160 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the mix right so it's still
 
04:58:08.830 --> 04:58:08.840 align:start position:0%
a math problem that you have to solve
 
04:58:10.868 --> 04:58:10.878 align:start position:0%
for how much how how many megawatts you
 
04:58:14.150 --> 04:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
need uh to service your your human
 
04:58:18.590 --> 04:58:18.600 align:start position:0%
population and I think that this bill um
 
04:58:18.600 --> 04:58:19.750 align:start position:0%
population and I think that this bill um
this

04:58:19.750 --> 04:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:58:22.548 --> 04:58:22.558 align:start position:0%
resolution uh does not harm the state of
 
04:58:26.750 --> 04:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire what it does is set out uh
 
04:58:29.270 --> 04:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
uh sort of a declarative statement that
 
04:58:31.310 --> 04:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
the state understands that there is
 
04:58:35.548 --> 04:58:35.558 align:start position:0%
value in advanced nuclear and so I I
 
04:58:37.310 --> 04:58:37.320 align:start position:0%
don't see a problem with it I I will be
 
04:58:41.310 --> 04:58:41.320 align:start position:0%
voting for it um don't think it does
 
04:58:43.070 --> 04:58:43.080 align:start position:0%
anything one way or another to really
 
04:58:45.510 --> 04:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
open up the state of New Hampshire I
 
04:58:47.070 --> 04:58:47.080 align:start position:0%
think there are other ways for us to
 
04:58:48.590 --> 04:58:48.600 align:start position:0%
work with the federal government if
 
04:58:50.470 --> 04:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
there were interest in doing a pilot or
 
04:58:52.750 --> 04:58:52.760 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing but I don't think
 
04:58:54.910 --> 04:58:54.920 align:start position:0%
nuclear is going to go away as part of
 
04:58:57.430 --> 04:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
the solution and so I don't see any harm
 
04:58:59.350 --> 04:58:59.360 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:59:02.708 --> 04:59:02.718 align:start position:0%
bill additional comments representative
 
04:59:05.190 --> 04:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah just to update there are
 
04:59:06.990 --> 04:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
ongoing efforts right now people are
 
04:59:10.788 --> 04:59:10.798 align:start position:0%
investing money there's been a large um
 
04:59:13.070 --> 04:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
data center that's talking about make uh
 
04:59:14.868 --> 04:59:14.878 align:start position:0%
merging with the Three Mile Island that
 
04:59:16.788 --> 04:59:16.798 align:start position:0%
was closed and reopening that that's
 
04:59:18.110 --> 04:59:18.120 align:start position:0%
that's something that's ongoing they've
 
04:59:21.070 --> 04:59:21.080 align:start position:0%
got a uh a um memorandum of
 
04:59:23.070 --> 04:59:23.080 align:start position:0%
understanding there's another uh two
 
04:59:24.750 --> 04:59:24.760 align:start position:0%
plants in the midwest that were shut
 
04:59:27.190 --> 04:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
down that now people are looking at uh
 
04:59:29.190 --> 04:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
the Palisades and Dwayne Arnold in fact
 
04:59:30.470 --> 04:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
I think it was I'm not sure which is
 
04:59:33.788 --> 04:59:33.798 align:start position:0%
which but one of them got u a billion
 
04:59:36.390 --> 04:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
dollars uh from some loan guarantee and
 
04:59:37.868 --> 04:59:37.878 align:start position:0%
another billion dollars from something
 
04:59:39.750 --> 04:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
else so that looks to be going forward
 
04:59:42.948 --> 04:59:42.958 align:start position:0%
too and in fact on large reactors even
 
04:59:47.628 --> 04:59:47.638 align:start position:0%
giving the non suuccess of the uh um two
 
04:59:49.150 --> 04:59:49.160 align:start position:0%
uh last projects that were built in
 
04:59:51.310 --> 04:59:51.320 align:start position:0%
Georgia two duplicate projects in North
 
04:59:53.310 --> 04:59:53.320 align:start position:0%
Carolina in South Carolina were canceled
 
04:59:54.788 --> 04:59:54.798 align:start position:0%
and the governor of South Carolina has
 
04:59:56.510 --> 04:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
just come out and said they probably
 
04:59:58.788 --> 04:59:58.798 align:start position:0%
should restart those plants so this is
 
05:00:00.788 --> 05:00:00.798 align:start position:0%
not just a dorcy where nothing's going
 
05:00:02.110 --> 05:00:02.120 align:start position:0%
on there's a lot of people spending a
 
05:00:04.430 --> 05:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
lot of money right
 
05:00:06.990 --> 05:00:07.000 align:start position:0%
now yes according to Robert Bryce there
 
05:00:10.070 --> 05:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
are 44 startups in the United States
 
05:00:12.548 --> 05:00:12.558 align:start position:0%
right now that are trying to develop
 
05:00:15.628 --> 05:00:15.638 align:start position:0%
small modular nuclear reactors they
 
05:00:19.390 --> 05:00:19.400 align:start position:0%
won't all survive but like any industry
 
05:00:21.270 --> 05:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a lot of activity
 
05:00:22.868 --> 05:00:22.878 align:start position:0%
and a lot of money
 
05:00:26.150 --> 05:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
spent any further comments seeing none
 
05:00:27.628 --> 05:00:27.638 align:start position:0%
I'll ask the clerk to call the role in
 
05:00:32.070 --> 05:00:32.080 align:start position:0%

HCR
 
05:01:31.230 --> 05:01:31.240 align:start position:0%
2 Vice chair Thomas will write the
 
05:01:33.708 --> 05:01:33.718 align:start position:0%
majority report will there be a Minority
 
05:01:36.990 --> 05:01:37.000 align:start position:0%
Report there will um from uh
 
05:01:39.548 --> 05:01:39.558 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas um however I
 
05:01:41.830 --> 05:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
wasn't prepared for this so it is not in
 
05:01:45.030 --> 05:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
your inbox and it will be by 7 o'
 
05:01:47.910 --> 05:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
tomorrow morning great thank you very
 
05:01:50.548 --> 05:01:50.558 align:start position:0%
much okay with that we're going to close
 
05:01:54.190 --> 05:01:54.200 align:start position:0%
the exec session on
 
05:01:57.390 --> 05:01:57.400 align:start position:0%
hcr2 and our timing is pretty good it's
 
05:02:01.270 --> 05:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
now 2:01 so we can move directly into
 
05:02:04.868 --> 05:02:04.878 align:start position:0%
more public hearings which we will do as
 
05:02:07.708 --> 05:02:07.718 align:start position:0%
I will open a public hearing on House
 
05:02:11.548 --> 05:02:11.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:15.788 --> 05:02:15.798 align:start position:0%
FN relative to community energy
 
05:02:19.948 --> 05:02:19.958 align:start position:0%
generators and I'll call to the table
 
05:02:22.270 --> 05:02:22.280 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas Corman who is the
 
05:02:25.590 --> 05:02:25.600 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill to tell us all about
 
05:02:25.600 --> 05:02:42.910 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill to tell us all about
it

05:02:42.910 --> 05:02:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:45.590 --> 05:02:45.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman Tom Corman
 
05:02:49.590 --> 05:02:49.600 align:start position:0%
representing Grafton 15 w three of the
 
05:02:51.430 --> 05:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
lovely little city of
 
05:02:54.110 --> 05:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
Lebanon this bill was actually uh
 
05:02:56.628 --> 05:02:56.638 align:start position:0%
written by the community power Coalition
 
05:02:59.070 --> 05:02:59.080 align:start position:0%
so I'm submitting uh I have submitted it
 
05:03:02.030 --> 05:03:02.040 align:start position:0%
on their behalf uh but there are a few
 
05:03:03.470 --> 05:03:03.480 align:start position:0%
things that I want to say about it and
 
05:03:06.150 --> 05:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that um uh Mr Belo will
 
05:03:08.350 --> 05:03:08.360 align:start position:0%
probably have much more to say than I
 
05:03:10.548 --> 05:03:10.558 align:start position:0%
have to say
 
05:03:13.628 --> 05:03:13.638 align:start position:0%
this is an update from
 
05:03:18.190 --> 05:03:18.200 align:start position:0%
hb600 from last year which actually uh
 
05:03:21.270 --> 05:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
we passed unanimously in committee got
 
05:03:24.230 --> 05:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
through on consent and then hit a bit of
 
05:03:26.190 --> 05:03:26.200 align:start position:0%
a roadblock in the Senate when the
 
05:03:28.670 --> 05:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
department of energy had some concerns
 
05:03:35.670 --> 05:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:37.990 --> 05:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
removed one of the things that this bill
 
05:03:41.070 --> 05:03:41.080 align:start position:0%
does is it defines a community generator
 
05:03:45.030 --> 05:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
and it puts it into uh the correct place
 
05:03:49.670 --> 05:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
in statute so that's nice but it
 
05:03:54.350 --> 05:03:54.360 align:start position:0%
also talks about um what a community
 
05:03:56.788 --> 05:03:56.798 align:start position:0%
generator is and it's just a customer
 
05:04:00.270 --> 05:04:00.280 align:start position:0%
generator who is producing less than 5
 
05:04:02.708 --> 05:04:02.718 align:start position:0%
megawatts and is using its excess
 
05:04:04.948 --> 05:04:04.958 align:start position:0%
generation to offset the load obligation
 
05:04:07.990 --> 05:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
of a municipal or County aggregation so
 
05:04:12.270 --> 05:04:12.280 align:start position:0%
for example um I am not yet a customer
 
05:04:14.350 --> 05:04:14.360 align:start position:0%
of Lebanon Community power I was and
 
05:04:16.150 --> 05:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
then I got solar panels and I wanted to
 
05:04:18.110 --> 05:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
net meter so I had to go back to default
 
05:04:20.788 --> 05:04:20.798 align:start position:0%
service but I would be very happy to be
 
05:04:23.670 --> 05:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
a community generator and have the
 
05:04:27.390 --> 05:04:27.400 align:start position:0%
excess generation from my panels offset
 
05:04:30.788 --> 05:04:30.798 align:start position:0%
the load obligation of Lebanon Community
 
05:04:32.948 --> 05:04:32.958 align:start position:0%
power that would be terrific then I
 
05:04:35.390 --> 05:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
could net meter which would be really
 
05:04:39.190 --> 05:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
nice so what this bill does is it allows
 
05:04:39.200 --> 05:04:40.868 align:start position:0%
nice so what this bill does is it allows
for

05:04:40.868 --> 05:04:40.878 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:04:40.878 --> 05:04:42.150 align:start position:0%
for
Community

05:04:42.150 --> 05:04:42.160 align:start position:0%
Community
 
05:04:42.160 --> 05:04:43.670 align:start position:0%
Community
generators

05:04:43.670 --> 05:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
generators
 
05:04:49.670 --> 05:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
to um actually do that type of net
 
05:04:52.670 --> 05:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
metering the other thing that this bill
 
05:04:57.350 --> 05:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
does is that it actually sets up uh a
 
05:05:00.150 --> 05:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
beginning point for understanding how to
 
05:05:02.868 --> 05:05:02.878 align:start position:0%
adjust for the line loss and I am not an
 
05:05:05.788 --> 05:05:05.798 align:start position:0%
expert on line loss I will leave that to
 
05:05:08.390 --> 05:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
others to talk
 
05:05:13.070 --> 05:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
about I do think this is a good bill um
 
05:05:15.910 --> 05:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
I think it just helps set certain things
 
05:05:20.030 --> 05:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
right so with that I will attempt to
 
05:05:21.868 --> 05:05:21.878 align:start position:0%
answer any questions but I have to say
 
05:05:25.510 --> 05:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:28.510 --> 05:05:28.520 align:start position:0%
people okay thank you for that bill
 
05:05:30.548 --> 05:05:30.558 align:start position:0%
introduction questions for
 
05:05:30.558 --> 05:05:37.030 align:start position:0%
introduction questions for
representative

05:05:37.030 --> 05:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:41.150 --> 05:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
Corman I guess we don't have any
 
05:05:44.750 --> 05:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
oh representative McGee so this bill
 
05:05:46.948 --> 05:05:46.958 align:start position:0%
will solve your
 
05:05:49.230 --> 05:05:49.240 align:start position:0%
problem of not being able to be a member
 
05:05:50.750 --> 05:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
of the community power Coalition
 
05:05:52.750 --> 05:05:52.760 align:start position:0%
currently as well as net metering at the
 
05:05:56.030 --> 05:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
same time it would
 
05:05:59.310 --> 05:05:59.320 align:start position:0%
help right because I mean there there's
 
05:06:02.628 --> 05:06:02.638 align:start position:0%
still the issues of um just the billing
 
05:06:05.390 --> 05:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
and all that right so this bill you know
 
05:06:07.788 --> 05:06:07.798 align:start position:0%
just by Fiat doesn't solve the problem
 
05:06:12.830 --> 05:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:15.708 --> 05:06:15.718 align:start position:0%
actually I do have a question for you I
 
05:06:18.470 --> 05:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
was messing with my paperwork and forgot
 
05:06:23.708 --> 05:06:23.718 align:start position:0%
that I had one so the definition on line
 
05:06:29.510 --> 05:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
three page one line three of community
 
05:06:32.868 --> 05:06:32.878 align:start position:0%
generator is this definition essentially
 
05:06:34.948 --> 05:06:34.958 align:start position:0%
saying that a community generator is the
 
05:06:38.070 --> 05:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
same thing as a municipal
 
05:06:40.990 --> 05:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
host no I don't think so
 
05:06:43.390 --> 05:06:43.400 align:start position:0%
um I mean
 
05:06:49.910 --> 05:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
I as as a a person with panels on my
 
05:06:51.990 --> 05:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
house in my
 
05:06:55.230 --> 05:06:55.240 align:start position:0%
garage if I'm selling or if I'm I'm
 
05:06:57.510 --> 05:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
using my power to offset the load
 
05:07:00.788 --> 05:07:00.798 align:start position:0%
obligation of Lebanon Community power I
 
05:07:02.788 --> 05:07:02.798 align:start position:0%
don't think that makes me a municipal
 
05:07:08.190 --> 05:07:08.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:10.310 --> 05:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
generator this might be a better
 
05:07:16.470 --> 05:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
question asked of Mr Belo okay further
 
05:07:18.990 --> 05:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
 
05:07:28.548 --> 05:07:28.558 align:start position:0%

handwriting miss out there Mr
 
05:07:56.590 --> 05:07:56.600 align:start position:0%
chairman um good afternoon for the
 
05:07:57.990 --> 05:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
record uh I'm Matt Young from the New
 
05:07:59.070 --> 05:07:59.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of energy and with
 
05:08:01.670 --> 05:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
me today is Mark Tuscano who's a
 
05:08:03.990 --> 05:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
regulatory Analyst at the department of
 
05:08:06.470 --> 05:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
energy the department is neutral on the
 
05:08:09.868 --> 05:08:09.878 align:start position:0%
house bill 759 um did have a uh few
 
05:08:11.628 --> 05:08:11.638 align:start position:0%
concerns that wanted to uh bring to the
 
05:08:15.110 --> 05:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
committee's attention here today um and
 
05:08:16.230 --> 05:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
in sort of looking at this bill and
 
05:08:19.990 --> 05:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
studying the implications
 
05:08:23.030 --> 05:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
um had a few concerns and mainly I think
 
05:08:24.430 --> 05:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
was sort of just addressed in the
 
05:08:27.070 --> 05:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
Chairman's question there um we had some
 
05:08:29.390 --> 05:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
concerns that there was no lower limit
 
05:08:32.990 --> 05:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
on the um in the definition there um
 
05:08:34.030 --> 05:08:34.040 align:start position:0%
that was one of the things we've been
 
05:08:35.190 --> 05:08:35.200 align:start position:0%
looking at kind of trying to figure out
 
05:08:35.990 --> 05:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
what the
 
05:08:38.670 --> 05:08:38.680 align:start position:0%
implications of not having that would be
 
05:08:38.680 --> 05:08:39.910 align:start position:0%
implications of not having that would be
um

05:08:39.910 --> 05:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:43.390 --> 05:08:43.400 align:start position:0%
and then something else that we were um
 
05:08:45.350 --> 05:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
kind of focused on in this legislation
 
05:08:49.590 --> 05:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
was the language on line 14 on page one
 
05:08:52.110 --> 05:08:52.120 align:start position:0%
um in section two which inserts a
 
05:08:55.150 --> 05:08:55.160 align:start position:0%
maximum rated export capacity language
 
05:08:58.628 --> 05:08:58.638 align:start position:0%
um the department has a concern and
 
05:09:01.270 --> 05:09:01.280 align:start position:0%
maybe feels that uh name plate capacity
 
05:09:04.110 --> 05:09:04.120 align:start position:0%
may be more appropriate for that space
 
05:09:06.150 --> 05:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
um but those are some of the things
 
05:09:07.948 --> 05:09:07.958 align:start position:0%
we're hoping to work on the work with
 
05:09:10.110 --> 05:09:10.120 align:start position:0%
the legislature on if this bill does
 
05:09:10.120 --> 05:09:11.948 align:start position:0%
the legislature on if this bill does
move

05:09:11.948 --> 05:09:11.958 align:start position:0%
move
 
05:09:14.990 --> 05:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
forward and I think with that we be
 
05:09:17.110 --> 05:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions and Mark
 
05:09:19.030 --> 05:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
Tuscano is here to answer anything that
 
05:09:19.040 --> 05:09:20.470 align:start position:0%
Tuscano is here to answer anything that
I

05:09:20.470 --> 05:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:09:22.990 --> 05:09:23.000 align:start position:0%
can't okay questions for the doe
 
05:09:23.000 --> 05:09:25.070 align:start position:0%
can't okay questions for the doe
representative

05:09:25.070 --> 05:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:09:26.948 --> 05:09:26.958 align:start position:0%
Harrington thank you Mr chairman I think
 
05:09:28.548 --> 05:09:28.558 align:start position:0%
I'm taking my question you know
 
05:09:30.230 --> 05:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes we get so bogged down in all
 
05:09:31.788 --> 05:09:31.798 align:start position:0%
this terminology here with Community
 
05:09:33.868 --> 05:09:33.878 align:start position:0%
generator and net metering and blah blah
 
05:09:36.070 --> 05:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah blah blah can you maybe
 
05:09:38.868 --> 05:09:38.878 align:start position:0%
put it in simpler terms okay what is
 
05:09:41.310 --> 05:09:41.320 align:start position:0%
going to change if this bill passes what
 
05:09:47.548 --> 05:09:47.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:51.430 --> 05:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
now and again um Cliff Mr Bel will be
 
05:09:53.628 --> 05:09:53.638 align:start position:0%
able to better explain it but as I
 
05:09:55.350 --> 05:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
understand is this will help offset the
 
05:09:57.030 --> 05:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
load obligation right that's the intent
 
05:09:58.990 --> 05:09:59.000 align:start position:0%
of this offset the load obligation of
 
05:10:02.270 --> 05:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
the of some of some of the aggravation
 
05:10:05.670 --> 05:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
aggregated suppliers um our initial
 
05:10:07.470 --> 05:10:07.480 align:start position:0%
concerns looking at this and some of it
 
05:10:09.910 --> 05:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
cleared up was on the minimum size but I
 
05:10:11.310 --> 05:10:11.320 align:start position:0%
think after hearing some of the comments
 
05:10:13.230 --> 05:10:13.240 align:start position:0%
today again the intent is to allow
 
05:10:15.750 --> 05:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
pretty much anybody to participate as a
 
05:10:18.190 --> 05:10:18.200 align:start position:0%
community generator um to help offset
 
05:10:21.310 --> 05:10:21.320 align:start position:0%
that load uh but what we do have some
 
05:10:22.628 --> 05:10:22.638 align:start position:0%
additional concerns on is just the
 
05:10:24.590 --> 05:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
tracking and accounting of all of this
 
05:10:27.230 --> 05:10:27.240 align:start position:0%
and again I think the earlier comment
 
05:10:28.948 --> 05:10:28.958 align:start position:0%
was that some of those details have yet
 
05:10:31.150 --> 05:10:31.160 align:start position:0%
you know will be worked out but those
 
05:10:32.708 --> 05:10:32.718 align:start position:0%
were the two big things and then on with
 
05:10:34.590 --> 05:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
regard to the export and I think that's
 
05:10:36.110 --> 05:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
where you were going there
 
05:10:40.670 --> 05:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
representative Harington um was the um
 
05:10:42.868 --> 05:10:42.878 align:start position:0%
and in my case we're working on a number
 
05:10:43.788 --> 05:10:43.798 align:start position:0%
of different things including
 
05:10:46.310 --> 05:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
interconnection requirements so there is
 
05:10:48.670 --> 05:10:48.680 align:start position:0%
there is the thing of net export
 
05:10:51.190 --> 05:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
capability uh where you would in some
 
05:10:53.350 --> 05:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
cases it's because that's M you maximum
 
05:10:55.548 --> 05:10:55.558 align:start position:0%
amount you can export based on what your
 
05:10:57.670 --> 05:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
based native load is or you have a
 
05:11:00.150 --> 05:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
limiting device or system that you can
 
05:11:01.990 --> 05:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
limit your export capacity and sometimes
 
05:11:04.830 --> 05:11:04.840 align:start position:0%
developers on the larger systems like we
 
05:11:07.070 --> 05:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
proposing that so they can minimize the
 
05:11:09.470 --> 05:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
amount of cost the upgrades on a utility
 
05:11:10.868 --> 05:11:10.878 align:start position:0%
that they would have to do so for
 
05:11:12.390 --> 05:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
instance if you had a 1 megawatt
 
05:11:14.430 --> 05:11:14.440 align:start position:0%
generator but the local distribution
 
05:11:16.350 --> 05:11:16.360 align:start position:0%
system could only handle 500 kilow you
 
05:11:18.230 --> 05:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
would limit it to 500 kilowatts at that
 
05:11:20.310 --> 05:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
time so those are the kinds of things
 
05:11:21.910 --> 05:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
that we we'd like to get a little more
 
05:11:23.750 --> 05:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
clarity on as we go through this is you
 
05:11:26.230 --> 05:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
know what are the implications if this
 
05:11:28.030 --> 05:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
wording gets inserted
 
05:11:31.868 --> 05:11:31.878 align:start position:0%
in followup followup so right now
 
05:11:34.430 --> 05:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
there's no such thing as a community
 
05:11:36.510 --> 05:11:36.520 align:start position:0%
generator uh not to my understanding
 
05:11:41.708 --> 05:11:41.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:41.718 --> 05:11:44.510 align:start position:0%
 
additional

05:11:44.510 --> 05:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:47.910 --> 05:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
questions saying none thank you both
 
05:11:47.920 --> 05:11:48.868 align:start position:0%
questions saying none thank you both
appreciate

05:11:48.868 --> 05:11:48.878 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
05:11:51.750 --> 05:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
it next we'll hear from Sam Evans Brown
 
05:12:07.708 --> 05:12:07.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:10.670 --> 05:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
haire I moved up in the rotation so you
 
05:12:15.510 --> 05:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:17.948 --> 05:12:17.958 align:start position:0%
rush thank you Mr chair thank you
 
05:12:19.430 --> 05:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh Sam Evans
 
05:12:21.270 --> 05:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
brown with clean energy New Hampshire uh
 
05:12:23.590 --> 05:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
cleanery Hampshire is in favor of this
 
05:12:27.670 --> 05:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
bill um similar to last year when we
 
05:12:30.628 --> 05:12:30.638 align:start position:0%
heard House Bill 1600 um I'd like to
 
05:12:33.830 --> 05:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
just convey what I think are some of the
 
05:12:36.350 --> 05:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
the elegant uh features of the program
 
05:12:39.150 --> 05:12:39.160 align:start position:0%
as envisioned here currently if you're
 
05:12:40.390 --> 05:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
trying to do a
 
05:12:44.548 --> 05:12:44.558 align:start position:0%
community uh scale generation project
 
05:12:48.390 --> 05:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
you're we're engaged in in sort of a a a
 
05:12:51.150 --> 05:12:51.160 align:start position:0%
a game of accounting where generators
 
05:12:53.110 --> 05:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
build their project or have an existing
 
05:12:55.670 --> 05:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
project and then they have to line up uh
 
05:12:57.548 --> 05:12:57.558 align:start position:0%
what are referred to as off-takers that
 
05:13:00.708 --> 05:13:00.718 align:start position:0%
are to to whose accounts are credited
 
05:13:03.990 --> 05:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
for the generation that a community um
 
05:13:06.310 --> 05:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
either solar or Hydro are the two
 
05:13:07.788 --> 05:13:07.798 align:start position:0%
dominant the two dominant technologies
 
05:13:09.350 --> 05:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
that access group net metering the New
 
05:13:11.190 --> 05:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they receive these Bill
 
05:13:15.110 --> 05:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
credits it to a certain extent um to be
 
05:13:19.190 --> 05:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
glib is is a accounting fiction the
 
05:13:22.230 --> 05:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
electrons go where they go uh and and
 
05:13:23.750 --> 05:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
certain customers get the credit for
 
05:13:26.510 --> 05:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
those electrons regardless of uh whether
 
05:13:27.990 --> 05:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
or not they're actually consuming set
 
05:13:30.350 --> 05:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
electrons and and we allow that
 
05:13:32.670 --> 05:13:32.680 align:start position:0%
accounting fiction because we are trying
 
05:13:34.990 --> 05:13:35.000 align:start position:0%
to be encouraging of this community
 
05:13:36.590 --> 05:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
scale generation for many of the reasons
 
05:13:37.830 --> 05:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
that I'm sure this committee has heard
 
05:13:39.510 --> 05:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
me talk about in the past the unique
 
05:13:42.030 --> 05:13:42.040 align:start position:0%
value of generation that is cited close
 
05:13:45.030 --> 05:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
to load um that that is recognized
 
05:13:46.990 --> 05:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
through the states net metering program
 
05:13:50.628 --> 05:13:50.638 align:start position:0%
um however all of that rigoll of signing
 
05:13:53.390 --> 05:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
up these customers of registering groups
 
05:13:55.910 --> 05:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
is administrating administratively
 
05:13:58.070 --> 05:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
burdensome and meaningfully does add
 
05:14:00.470 --> 05:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
costs to the process of bringing these
 
05:14:02.548 --> 05:14:02.558 align:start position:0%
generators online versus what is
 
05:14:04.628 --> 05:14:04.638 align:start position:0%
contemplated in this bill which is to
 
05:14:07.670 --> 05:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
Simply allow those generators to be seen
 
05:14:10.430 --> 05:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
as as essentially a a load offset for a
 
05:14:12.670 --> 05:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
community power aggregation through
 
05:14:14.990 --> 05:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
which all of the members of that
 
05:14:16.628 --> 05:14:16.638 align:start position:0%
aggregation would see the financial
 
05:14:18.430 --> 05:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
benefits of that Community generation
 
05:14:21.310 --> 05:14:21.320 align:start position:0%
coming online which um you know many of
 
05:14:24.030 --> 05:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
us over uh in my neck of the woods have
 
05:14:25.670 --> 05:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
have been concerned for a very long time
 
05:14:27.750 --> 05:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
about who does have access to the
 
05:14:29.948 --> 05:14:29.958 align:start position:0%
distributed energy Revolution that we
 
05:14:32.310 --> 05:14:32.320 align:start position:0%
think that we're we're experiencing in
 
05:14:34.910 --> 05:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
the US uh and right now the answer to
 
05:14:37.948 --> 05:14:37.958 align:start position:0%
that is homeowners uh you know the folks
 
05:14:39.708 --> 05:14:39.718 align:start position:0%
who are Savvy enough to sign themselves
 
05:14:41.948 --> 05:14:41.958 align:start position:0%
up to be part of a community generator
 
05:14:44.230 --> 05:14:44.240 align:start position:0%
um and it's not your regular Tom Dick
 
05:14:45.670 --> 05:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
and Harry who are just regular rate
 
05:14:47.350 --> 05:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
payers they're not necessarily getting
 
05:14:50.070 --> 05:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
access to uh the state's net metering
 
05:14:53.750 --> 05:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
program and I see this approach as being
 
05:14:55.708 --> 05:14:55.718 align:start position:0%
a very elegant solution to that problem
 
05:14:58.548 --> 05:14:58.558 align:start position:0%
by which all rate payers similar to when
 
05:15:00.430 --> 05:15:00.440 align:start position:0%
uh utilities make investments in
 
05:15:02.868 --> 05:15:02.878 align:start position:0%
distributed energy resources see the the
 
05:15:07.150 --> 05:15:07.160 align:start position:0%
rate benefit of this this de Revolution
 
05:15:09.230 --> 05:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
so um that is why we support this bill
 
05:15:10.750 --> 05:15:10.760 align:start position:0%
certainly I think there are there are
 
05:15:12.310 --> 05:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
maybe some issues to be sorted out I've
 
05:15:14.948 --> 05:15:14.958 align:start position:0%
heard uh some thought about the the
 
05:15:18.270 --> 05:15:18.280 align:start position:0%
language around Peak capacity I think um
 
05:15:20.230 --> 05:15:20.240 align:start position:0%
you know all of that can be solved and I
 
05:15:21.670 --> 05:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
would just encourage the committee to to
 
05:15:22.868 --> 05:15:22.878 align:start position:0%
take a hard look at this one because we
 
05:15:26.548 --> 05:15:26.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:30.030 --> 05:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
approach thank you Sam as usual very
 
05:15:32.390 --> 05:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
good testimony to the point any
 
05:15:34.670 --> 05:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
questions for representative Harrington
 
05:15:34.680 --> 05:15:35.470 align:start position:0%
questions for representative Harrington
has

05:15:35.470 --> 05:15:35.480 align:start position:0%
has
 
05:15:37.708 --> 05:15:37.718 align:start position:0%
one yeah just just to try to make sure
 
05:15:39.590 --> 05:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
we get this straight again now other
 
05:15:42.628 --> 05:15:42.638 align:start position:0%
than the maximum output uh which goes up
 
05:15:44.390 --> 05:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
to less than five for Community
 
05:15:47.910 --> 05:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
generator and up to one for a customer
 
05:15:49.990 --> 05:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
generator are there any real differences
 
05:15:53.110 --> 05:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
in in this the way they're being treated
 
05:15:56.270 --> 05:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
other than the amount of Maximum output
 
05:15:57.150 --> 05:15:57.160 align:start position:0%
I think the answer to that is
 
05:15:59.150 --> 05:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
essentially no you know I would rely on
 
05:16:00.190 --> 05:16:00.200 align:start position:0%
the folks from the community power
 
05:16:01.510 --> 05:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
Coalition who brought this bill forward
 
05:16:03.750 --> 05:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
to answer the more detailed questions um
 
05:16:06.390 --> 05:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
but but the question of how you do the
 
05:16:09.270 --> 05:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
accounting um you know I think I think
 
05:16:11.270 --> 05:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
that really when we discussed this bill
 
05:16:13.030 --> 05:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
last year this was essentially seen as a
 
05:16:14.470 --> 05:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
clarification of something that we
 
05:16:16.390 --> 05:16:16.400 align:start position:0%
thought might be already allowed under
 
05:16:19.390 --> 05:16:19.400 align:start position:0%
the the municipal host definition um so
 
05:16:21.270 --> 05:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
so I I think this is a fairly
 
05:16:24.030 --> 05:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
incremental step and and really isn't a
 
05:16:26.708 --> 05:16:26.718 align:start position:0%
huge change to the current status quo
 
05:16:29.830 --> 05:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
quick followup yes what's a heat Le
 
05:16:33.470 --> 05:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
combined heat and power system uh a
 
05:16:35.230 --> 05:16:35.240 align:start position:0%
great question well so so typically
 
05:16:37.948 --> 05:16:37.958 align:start position:0%
combin heat and power you you can have a
 
05:16:40.390 --> 05:16:40.400 align:start position:0%
system that generates electricity first
 
05:16:42.510 --> 05:16:42.520 align:start position:0%
and then and then the the waste heat is
 
05:16:45.670 --> 05:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
used to for some you know lower heat
 
05:16:47.990 --> 05:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
right exactly uh but but Heat lead is
 
05:16:50.350 --> 05:16:50.360 align:start position:0%
the opposite where you have a a heat uh
 
05:16:52.190 --> 05:16:52.200 align:start position:0%
a heat Le you know you have a heating
 
05:16:54.270 --> 05:16:54.280 align:start position:0%
system and and any excess that you've
 
05:16:56.310 --> 05:16:56.320 align:start position:0%
got can be siphoned off to to run a
 
05:16:57.788 --> 05:16:57.798 align:start position:0%
small turbine typically they don't
 
05:17:00.670 --> 05:17:00.680 align:start position:0%
generate terribly much I believe uh an
 
05:17:05.590 --> 05:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
example of this is the um the the um the
 
05:17:07.190 --> 05:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh the equipment that is installed down
 
05:17:09.628 --> 05:17:09.638 align:start position:0%
at froling uh folks have heard from from
 
05:17:11.190 --> 05:17:11.200 align:start position:0%
froling energy a number of times and
 
05:17:13.990 --> 05:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
they they believe have a heat Le system
 
05:17:16.868 --> 05:17:16.878 align:start position:0%
where they have um uh essentially they
 
05:17:18.510 --> 05:17:18.520 align:start position:0%
they're drying chips and then with the
 
05:17:20.310 --> 05:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
excess the excess they're spinning a
 
05:17:22.230 --> 05:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
small turbine okay thank
 
05:17:24.350 --> 05:17:24.360 align:start position:0%
you I believe there are a couple of
 
05:17:27.190 --> 05:17:27.200 align:start position:0%
Sawmills up north that that use the same
 
05:17:30.150 --> 05:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
thing did I hear you imply that this
 
05:17:32.670 --> 05:17:32.680 align:start position:0%
could be a substitute for group net
 
05:17:35.708 --> 05:17:35.718 align:start position:0%
metering uh yeah and and I would say
 
05:17:37.548 --> 05:17:37.558 align:start position:0%
that uh the membership of clean enery
 
05:17:38.788 --> 05:17:38.798 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you clean Hampshire memb
 
05:17:40.430 --> 05:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
membersip is is quite broad but there
 
05:17:42.350 --> 05:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
are a lot of solar developers that are
 
05:17:44.670 --> 05:17:44.680 align:start position:0%
represented in our membership um and and
 
05:17:47.590 --> 05:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
I'd say their Interest really comes from
 
05:17:50.030 --> 05:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
comes from that specific uh that
 
05:17:53.708 --> 05:17:53.718 align:start position:0%
specific uh Market segment that that
 
05:17:55.990 --> 05:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
currently uh there's a great deal of
 
05:17:58.230 --> 05:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
regulatory risk in the group net
 
05:18:00.470 --> 05:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
metering program in New Hampshire um
 
05:18:03.070 --> 05:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
because of the the 2040 end date and the
 
05:18:05.230 --> 05:18:05.240 align:start position:0%
lack of certainty as to what will what
 
05:18:07.788 --> 05:18:07.798 align:start position:0%
will be in place um when the the net
 
05:18:11.310 --> 05:18:11.320 align:start position:0%
metering program is allowed to to Sunset
 
05:18:13.830 --> 05:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
um and so something that is that is more
 
05:18:16.150 --> 05:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
Market driven and wouldn't be subject to
 
05:18:18.750 --> 05:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
the same regulatory risk is is immensely
 
05:18:20.110 --> 05:18:20.120 align:start position:0%
appealing to a lot of those developers
 
05:18:22.548 --> 05:18:22.558 align:start position:0%
since these are very long-lived assets
 
05:18:24.230 --> 05:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
and they're trying to they're trying to
 
05:18:26.910 --> 05:18:26.920 align:start position:0%
get loans so they can get their projects
 
05:18:26.920 --> 05:18:28.708 align:start position:0%
get loans so they can get their projects
built

05:18:28.708 --> 05:18:28.718 align:start position:0%
built
 
05:18:31.350 --> 05:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions we'll
 
05:18:33.948 --> 05:18:33.958 align:start position:0%
move along and next call
 
05:18:42.310 --> 05:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:43.750 --> 05:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
they fell on the
 
05:18:46.190 --> 05:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
floor sorry about that they fell on the
 
05:18:49.990 --> 05:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
floor let's hear next from Deana Dennis
 
05:18:52.510 --> 05:18:52.520 align:start position:0%
of the community power Coalition of New
 
05:18:52.520 --> 05:19:10.390 align:start position:0%
of the community power Coalition of New
Hampshire

05:19:10.390 --> 05:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:10.400 --> 05:19:12.628 align:start position:0%
 
good

05:19:12.628 --> 05:19:12.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:15.110 --> 05:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
afternoon for the record my name is Dena
 
05:19:18.350 --> 05:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
Dennis and here with me today is Clifton
 
05:19:20.590 --> 05:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
below we're both with the community
 
05:19:23.750 --> 05:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
power Coalition of New Hampshire um we
 
05:19:26.230 --> 05:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
support House Bill 759 uh because it
 
05:19:28.990 --> 05:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
provides a market-based alternative to
 
05:19:31.670 --> 05:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
utility default service net metering um
 
05:19:34.470 --> 05:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
in a way that offers new options for
 
05:19:37.230 --> 05:19:37.240 align:start position:0%
customers and local generators um up to
 
05:19:39.470 --> 05:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
5 megawatts and in a way that can lower
 
05:19:42.270 --> 05:19:42.280 align:start position:0%
costs for all rate payers um this change
 
05:19:44.510 --> 05:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
is needed because current law only
 
05:19:46.708 --> 05:19:46.718 align:start position:0%
allows Community power programs and
 
05:19:48.868 --> 05:19:48.878 align:start position:0%
competitive suppliers to do to offer net
 
05:19:51.830 --> 05:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
metering programs to customers up to one
 
05:19:55.470 --> 05:19:55.480 align:start position:0%
megawatts um as uh others alluded to um
 
05:19:57.470 --> 05:19:57.480 align:start position:0%
just wanted to remind the committee of
 
05:19:59.590 --> 05:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
its unanimous support for this policy
 
05:20:01.990 --> 05:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
concept last year um and we hope that
 
05:20:03.990 --> 05:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
the committee will uh take a similar
 
05:20:07.070 --> 05:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
position for this year um so just a
 
05:20:09.230 --> 05:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
couple of things about this bill
 
05:20:12.830 --> 05:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh so this bill opens up new options for
 
05:20:15.548 --> 05:20:15.558 align:start position:0%
competitive entities in a I'll call it a
 
05:20:18.150 --> 05:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
competitively neutral way so it allows
 
05:20:20.390 --> 05:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
this construct for not only Community
 
05:20:23.190 --> 05:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
power aggregations which what is what
 
05:20:24.788 --> 05:20:24.798 align:start position:0%
the bill did last year but it also
 
05:20:28.548 --> 05:20:28.558 align:start position:0%
allows this concept to be open to um
 
05:20:31.190 --> 05:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
competitive suppliers so for customers
 
05:20:32.708 --> 05:20:32.718 align:start position:0%
that are served by a competitive
 
05:20:34.628 --> 05:20:34.638 align:start position:0%
supplier they would also have the option
 
05:20:37.548 --> 05:20:37.558 align:start position:0%
to um partake in these programs and just
 
05:20:39.628 --> 05:20:39.638 align:start position:0%
underscoring that in the this way these
 
05:20:41.948 --> 05:20:41.958 align:start position:0%
Community generators lower wholesale
 
05:20:44.270 --> 05:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
power costs and transmission costs that
 
05:20:45.948 --> 05:20:45.958 align:start position:0%
benefit all
 
05:20:49.750 --> 05:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
consumers um and then lastly um in
 
05:20:54.350 --> 05:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
relation to uh section I believe three
 
05:20:56.110 --> 05:20:56.120 align:start position:0%
um makes an important change to the
 
05:20:57.750 --> 05:20:57.760 align:start position:0%
requirements for how net meter
 
05:20:59.830 --> 05:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
generation exports to the distribution
 
05:21:01.750 --> 05:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
grid are settled for competitive
 
05:21:04.628 --> 05:21:04.638 align:start position:0%
suppliers and Community power programs
 
05:21:07.030 --> 05:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
um because the current requirements in
 
05:21:08.948 --> 05:21:08.958 align:start position:0%
or the requirements and current law have
 
05:21:11.150 --> 05:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
not yet been implemented this bill
 
05:21:13.868 --> 05:21:13.878 align:start position:0%
provides the commission with a starting
 
05:21:16.150 --> 05:21:16.160 align:start position:0%
point to determine what's called an
 
05:21:18.830 --> 05:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate line loss adjustment so as
 
05:21:21.030 --> 05:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
electricity is transported on the bulk
 
05:21:23.390 --> 05:21:23.400 align:start position:0%
the high voltage transmission system
 
05:21:26.070 --> 05:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
steps down um at substations goes down
 
05:21:28.270 --> 05:21:28.280 align:start position:0%
to distribution level um there are
 
05:21:30.990 --> 05:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
losses so part of the law requires the
 
05:21:32.590 --> 05:21:32.600 align:start position:0%
commission to make an appropriate line
 
05:21:35.030 --> 05:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
loss of termination that that law has
 
05:21:36.548 --> 05:21:36.558 align:start position:0%
been on the books for almost five years
 
05:21:38.868 --> 05:21:38.878 align:start position:0%
now and a a termination has not been
 
05:21:42.310 --> 05:21:42.320 align:start position:0%
made um so this bill would provide a
 
05:21:47.150 --> 05:21:47.160 align:start position:0%
starting point which is 50% of um 50% of
 
05:21:49.510 --> 05:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
what the utilities um
 
05:21:51.628 --> 05:21:51.638 align:start position:0%
report um so we think this will help
 
05:21:53.390 --> 05:21:53.400 align:start position:0%
jump start the market and provide
 
05:21:56.070 --> 05:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
Clarity and I believe Clifton has a few
 
05:21:58.190 --> 05:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
additional comments about that
 
05:22:00.628 --> 05:22:00.638 align:start position:0%
Beast um
 
05:22:04.470 --> 05:22:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:09.230 --> 05:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
um a couple of things one is um this the
 
05:22:11.788 --> 05:22:11.798 align:start position:0%
notion that this um form of load
 
05:22:16.470 --> 05:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
settlement is unusual is um not exactly
 
05:22:20.510 --> 05:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
true um uh the state of Texas for
 
05:22:23.750 --> 05:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
instance more than a decade ago um
 
05:22:26.708 --> 05:22:26.718 align:start position:0%
created a competitive market where if a
 
05:22:28.788 --> 05:22:28.798 align:start position:0%
generator was a customer of a particular
 
05:22:31.430 --> 05:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
supplier that export to the grid would
 
05:22:34.750 --> 05:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
be counted in their load settlement um
 
05:22:37.350 --> 05:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward uh more recently
 
05:22:39.990 --> 05:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
in Maine Central Main power uh either
 
05:22:43.030 --> 05:22:43.040 align:start position:0%
has or was proposing to um make a
 
05:22:45.830 --> 05:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
similar change uh in a presentation that
 
05:22:47.628 --> 05:22:47.638 align:start position:0%
they made to the metering work group of
 
05:22:50.390 --> 05:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
iso New England uh back in September uh
 
05:22:52.750 --> 05:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
they did explain that in Maine there's
 
05:22:55.470 --> 05:22:55.480 align:start position:0%
two options for net metering uh one is a
 
05:22:57.390 --> 05:22:57.400 align:start position:0%
what they called net Energy billing
 
05:23:01.270 --> 05:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
credit and that uh credit uh is tracked
 
05:23:04.150 --> 05:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
of the supplier re record and it is used
 
05:23:05.670 --> 05:23:05.680 align:start position:0%
to offset what they otherwise have to
 
05:23:08.110 --> 05:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
buy um that's sort of the notion of the
 
05:23:11.470 --> 05:23:11.480 align:start position:0%
load reducer it's not load reduction is
 
05:23:14.110 --> 05:23:14.120 align:start position:0%
relative to the regional transmission
 
05:23:16.670 --> 05:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
grid and the bulk power supply so if
 
05:23:19.990 --> 05:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
you're local and you offset local load
 
05:23:21.590 --> 05:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh and reduce the power that comes from
 
05:23:23.788 --> 05:23:23.798 align:start position:0%
the transmission grid that's load
 
05:23:25.750 --> 05:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
reduction relative to the iso New
 
05:23:28.590 --> 05:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
England market so in Maine both are
 
05:23:30.948 --> 05:23:30.958 align:start position:0%
enabled that or the power can be sold
 
05:23:33.590 --> 05:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
into ISO New England and they have or
 
05:23:35.390 --> 05:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
are implementing a load settlement
 
05:23:37.390 --> 05:23:37.400 align:start position:0%
system that accounts for both um but
 
05:23:38.948 --> 05:23:38.958 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't really change change
 
05:23:40.510 --> 05:23:40.520 align:start position:0%
anything about the load settlement
 
05:23:43.990 --> 05:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
question except to provide a starting
 
05:23:46.510 --> 05:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
point in determining uh what the line
 
05:23:49.510 --> 05:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
loss is and um that that's we've kind of
 
05:23:51.948 --> 05:23:51.958 align:start position:0%
been around on circles on that uh
 
05:23:54.190 --> 05:23:54.200 align:start position:0%
eversource keeps its line loss studies
 
05:23:55.948 --> 05:23:55.958 align:start position:0%
confidential they didn't say they could
 
05:23:58.190 --> 05:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
come up with a number uh we've asked a
 
05:24:00.150 --> 05:24:00.160 align:start position:0%
number of engineering firms that do this
 
05:24:01.350 --> 05:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
and they all sort of shrugged their
 
05:24:02.948 --> 05:24:02.958 align:start position:0%
shoulders and said we we don't we don't
 
05:24:05.110 --> 05:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
know how to come up with a number what
 
05:24:07.750 --> 05:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
we do know is the line loss from the
 
05:24:10.590 --> 05:24:10.600 align:start position:0%
high voltage transmission grid uh every
 
05:24:12.990 --> 05:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
time you go through uh transformation of
 
05:24:15.910 --> 05:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
the voltage you lose energy in the form
 
05:24:18.110 --> 05:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
of heat and you also lose energy in the
 
05:24:19.708 --> 05:24:19.718 align:start position:0%
form of heat when it travels through
 
05:24:22.270 --> 05:24:22.280 align:start position:0%
wires so line loss is both line and
 
05:24:25.110 --> 05:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
trans Transformer loss and uh there's a
 
05:24:26.510 --> 05:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
certain amount when you step down from
 
05:24:28.788 --> 05:24:28.798 align:start position:0%
the transmission grid there's less when
 
05:24:31.510 --> 05:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
you put Power onto the local grid and
 
05:24:34.350 --> 05:24:34.360 align:start position:0%
and um it it's offsetting the nearest
 
05:24:36.788 --> 05:24:36.798 align:start position:0%
loads on the distribution grid so that's
 
05:24:39.470 --> 05:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
just how that's resolved um and I would
 
05:24:43.868 --> 05:24:43.878 align:start position:0%
also note that um uh to to the extent
 
05:24:46.788 --> 05:24:46.798 align:start position:0%
load settlement uh needs to change there
 
05:24:48.750 --> 05:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
are vendors out there who are changing
 
05:24:50.708 --> 05:24:50.718 align:start position:0%
it to do precisely this kind of
 
05:24:53.948 --> 05:24:53.958 align:start position:0%
accounting and one example is Ron's
 
05:24:57.070 --> 05:24:57.080 align:start position:0%
Advanced settlement uh system uh that is
 
05:24:59.510 --> 05:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
specifically designed to account for uh
 
05:25:02.110 --> 05:25:02.120 align:start position:0%
energy in all these different ways and
 
05:25:04.430 --> 05:25:04.440 align:start position:0%
uh be able to support that kind of
 
05:25:05.948 --> 05:25:05.958 align:start position:0%
settlement but that that's really a
 
05:25:08.150 --> 05:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
question for the commission to determine
 
05:25:09.788 --> 05:25:09.798 align:start position:0%
and and I think the only other point I
 
05:25:12.910 --> 05:25:12.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to make is um the maximum rated
 
05:25:16.430 --> 05:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
export capacity is um that is a concept
 
05:25:20.470 --> 05:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
from those model IR rules that uh the
 
05:25:22.990 --> 05:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
department was asked to develop model
 
05:25:25.350 --> 05:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
rules or rules for distributed energy
 
05:25:27.708 --> 05:25:27.718 align:start position:0%
resources and it simply recognizes the
 
05:25:30.830 --> 05:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
fact that today there are
 
05:25:33.548 --> 05:25:33.558 align:start position:0%
Technologies uh including inverter based
 
05:25:36.230 --> 05:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
systems smart inverters that can be
 
05:25:38.590 --> 05:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
engineered to limit how much goes onto
 
05:25:41.670 --> 05:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
the grid so for example you could couple
 
05:25:43.590 --> 05:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh if you knew a place on the grid that
 
05:25:47.150 --> 05:25:47.160 align:start position:0%
only has capacity for say 1.5 megawatts
 
05:25:49.590 --> 05:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
you could maybe put in a solar project
 
05:25:52.510 --> 05:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
that's more than that Plus Storage that
 
05:25:54.310 --> 05:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
has a combined because maybe all the
 
05:25:56.430 --> 05:25:56.440 align:start position:0%
power goes to the storage inverter it
 
05:25:58.470 --> 05:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
can be engineered so it can be limited
 
05:26:00.910 --> 05:26:00.920 align:start position:0%
to that 1.5 megawatts even if the
 
05:26:03.350 --> 05:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
nominal name plate capacity is more it
 
05:26:05.310 --> 05:26:05.320 align:start position:0%
just never would export more and it
 
05:26:06.708 --> 05:26:06.718 align:start position:0%
might be that that is what the
 
05:26:08.708 --> 05:26:08.718 align:start position:0%
distribution system can handle at that
 
05:26:11.430 --> 05:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
point so it just it just updates the
 
05:26:13.990 --> 05:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
language but it it's not a critical part
 
05:26:16.110 --> 05:26:16.120 align:start position:0%
of the bill what's critical is how this
 
05:26:18.788 --> 05:26:18.798 align:start position:0%
is different than a municipal host
 
05:26:20.350 --> 05:26:20.360 align:start position:0%
because a municipal host there are no
 
05:26:23.070 --> 05:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
real off-takers um it doesn't offset
 
05:26:25.270 --> 05:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
anyone's individual load to the extent
 
05:26:27.990 --> 05:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
it reduces load it's socialized across
 
05:26:30.150 --> 05:26:30.160 align:start position:0%
all rate payers so this gives an
 
05:26:32.788 --> 05:26:32.798 align:start position:0%
opportunity for uh projects particularly
 
05:26:35.788 --> 05:26:35.798 align:start position:0%
in the 1 to 5 megawatt range to not be
 
05:26:38.470 --> 05:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
comp that you would not qualify for any
 
05:26:40.628 --> 05:26:40.638 align:start position:0%
compensation from the utility for energy
 
05:26:42.990 --> 05:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
or capacity it has to come from the
 
05:26:46.070 --> 05:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
community power aggregation or uh the
 
05:26:48.150 --> 05:26:48.160 align:start position:0%
the competitive power supplier who's
 
05:26:50.708 --> 05:26:50.718 align:start position:0%
buying that power uh in in a net
 
05:26:53.230 --> 05:26:53.240 align:start position:0%
metering relationship and uh that
 
05:26:56.310 --> 05:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
Surplus power so in that way it it
 
05:26:59.948 --> 05:26:59.958 align:start position:0%
avoids the issue of cost shifting that
 
05:27:03.150 --> 05:27:03.160 align:start position:0%
occurs now with Municipal host um and
 
05:27:05.868 --> 05:27:05.878 align:start position:0%
and for the city of Lebanon we just
 
05:27:08.788 --> 05:27:08.798 align:start position:0%
recently uh finished work on a one
 
05:27:11.070 --> 05:27:11.080 align:start position:0%
megawatt landfill gas to energy project
 
05:27:12.830 --> 05:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
and the only practical option for it was
 
05:27:17.310 --> 05:27:17.320 align:start position:0%
to be uh selling its um Power to uh
 
05:27:20.070 --> 05:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
Liberty through uh net metering and what
 
05:27:21.990 --> 05:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
both the city would like and the
 
05:27:24.590 --> 05:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
Coalition serving lebanan Community
 
05:27:26.910 --> 05:27:26.920 align:start position:0%
power would like is to use that one
 
05:27:30.548 --> 05:27:30.558 align:start position:0%
megawatt of power uh to offset a Lebanon
 
05:27:32.830 --> 05:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
Community Po's load uh which is always
 
05:27:34.670 --> 05:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
much more than that uh what it can
 
05:27:36.628 --> 05:27:36.638 align:start position:0%
export to the grid so it's just it's a
 
05:27:38.788 --> 05:27:38.798 align:start position:0%
it's a way it's an alternative that's
 
05:27:40.708 --> 05:27:40.718 align:start position:0%
gets us out of the utility having to
 
05:27:42.590 --> 05:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
provide the compensation and gets the
 
05:27:44.830 --> 05:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
utility of out of having to do all this
 
05:27:46.948 --> 05:27:46.958 align:start position:0%
accounting for group net metering or
 
05:27:50.910 --> 05:27:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:53.430 --> 05:27:53.440 align:start position:0%
situations so do you anticipate that
 
05:27:53.440 --> 05:27:54.510 align:start position:0%
situations so do you anticipate that
Community

05:27:54.510 --> 05:27:54.520 align:start position:0%
Community
 
05:27:58.230 --> 05:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
power member communities would take
 
05:28:00.350 --> 05:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
advantage of this legislation should it
 
05:28:05.910 --> 05:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
pass to install up to 5 megawatts of of
 
05:28:08.510 --> 05:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
u local generation
 
05:28:11.990 --> 05:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
um yes I would yeah go ahead yes thank
 
05:28:14.350 --> 05:28:14.360 align:start position:0%
you for the question chairman Vose um
 
05:28:16.230 --> 05:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
actually the Coalition did a survey of
 
05:28:18.590 --> 05:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
its membership last spring and I think
 
05:28:21.548 --> 05:28:21.558 align:start position:0%
about 40 of the 60 members 60 members at
 
05:28:24.350 --> 05:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
the time last year responded and there's
 
05:28:27.510 --> 05:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
about 30 projects in mind that um
 
05:28:30.270 --> 05:28:30.280 align:start position:0%
communities are either they have plans
 
05:28:32.110 --> 05:28:32.120 align:start position:0%
or they're interested in developing or
 
05:28:34.070 --> 05:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
they'd be interested in you know being
 
05:28:36.270 --> 05:28:36.280 align:start position:0%
this off-taker of such a community
 
05:28:38.350 --> 05:28:38.360 align:start position:0%
generator facility so we know that there
 
05:28:40.628 --> 05:28:40.638 align:start position:0%
is interest
 
05:28:43.670 --> 05:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
there further questions representative
 
05:28:45.350 --> 05:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah thank you thank you for
 
05:28:47.270 --> 05:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question so it sounds like
 
05:28:50.548 --> 05:28:50.558 align:start position:0%
this is giving the um the biggest change
 
05:28:52.390 --> 05:28:52.400 align:start position:0%
here is it's giving someone from one to
 
05:28:55.910 --> 05:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
five um one to less than 5 megaw the
 
05:28:58.510 --> 05:28:58.520 align:start position:0%
option of getting out of net metering
 
05:29:00.750 --> 05:29:00.760 align:start position:0%
and going to this community generator
 
05:29:04.750 --> 05:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
thing where the effect of what they what
 
05:29:06.310 --> 05:29:06.320 align:start position:0%
they're doing I mean you could take an
 
05:29:08.110 --> 05:29:08.120 align:start position:0%
existing net metering system now that
 
05:29:10.430 --> 05:29:10.440 align:start position:0%
was 4 megaw and switch it over to this
 
05:29:14.788 --> 05:29:14.798 align:start position:0%
is that correct um yes yeah you could
 
05:29:16.590 --> 05:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
have a group host situation where they
 
05:29:18.708 --> 05:29:18.718 align:start position:0%
say because of the uncertainty as to
 
05:29:21.070 --> 05:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
Future default service crises prices we
 
05:29:22.590 --> 05:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
have a competitive supplier who will
 
05:29:24.910 --> 05:29:24.920 align:start position:0%
give us a fixed price for a longer term
 
05:29:27.110 --> 05:29:27.120 align:start position:0%
we'd rather do that contract and then
 
05:29:29.150 --> 05:29:29.160 align:start position:0%
they're out of this whole issue of cost
 
05:29:31.470 --> 05:29:31.480 align:start position:0%
shifting between the utility uh
 
05:29:33.190 --> 05:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
compensating the net meter generation
 
05:29:36.310 --> 05:29:36.320 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up so it it doesn't it
 
05:29:38.750 --> 05:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
just gives another option then for this
 
05:29:41.910 --> 05:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
one to five range of things rather than
 
05:29:44.030 --> 05:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
net metering it basically gets you out
 
05:29:46.788 --> 05:29:46.798 align:start position:0%
of the default service business or even
 
05:29:49.230 --> 05:29:49.240 align:start position:0%
tie into that it's still technically
 
05:29:50.990 --> 05:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
within net metering it's just that it's
 
05:29:54.310 --> 05:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
no longer net metering with the utility
 
05:29:57.990 --> 05:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I think I get it thank
 
05:30:01.788 --> 05:30:01.798 align:start position:0%
you representative Kaplan has a question
 
05:30:03.110 --> 05:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair this is a related
 
05:30:04.350 --> 05:30:04.360 align:start position:0%
question I just wonder if you could
 
05:30:10.070 --> 05:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:10.080 --> 05:30:15.110 align:start position:0%
 
lines

05:30:15.110 --> 05:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:18.030 --> 05:30:18.040 align:start position:0%
uh okay lines 28 and 29 where it says
 
05:30:19.750 --> 05:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
accounting and compensation for the
 
05:30:21.830 --> 05:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
energy Supply and avoided generation
 
05:30:23.628 --> 05:30:23.638 align:start position:0%
capacity value of its
 
05:30:25.830 --> 05:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
output is that the same as net metering
 
05:30:28.070 --> 05:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
or if it's not what's the difference
 
05:30:30.590 --> 05:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
yeah that that it's referencing RSA 362
 
05:30:34.948 --> 05:30:34.958 align:start position:0%
A9 Roman 2 is a part of the net metering
 
05:30:37.670 --> 05:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
statute um because this would be is
 
05:30:40.830 --> 05:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
being defined within the context of net
 
05:30:44.548 --> 05:30:44.558 align:start position:0%
metering um and the the text of that
 
05:30:46.750 --> 05:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
statute is on page two at the bottom in
 
05:30:53.990 --> 05:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:56.910 --> 05:30:56.920 align:start position:0%
testimony additional comments or
 
05:30:59.430 --> 05:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
questions representative McGee thank you
 
05:31:02.430 --> 05:31:02.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you uh Dina and
 
05:31:05.270 --> 05:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
and Cliff for being here um it's coming
 
05:31:07.070 --> 05:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
back to me now why we were unanimous on
 
05:31:13.190 --> 05:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
hb6 00 last year and um and so I guess
 
05:31:14.708 --> 05:31:14.718 align:start position:0%
my question
 
05:31:14.718 --> 05:31:17.070 align:start position:0%
my question
is

05:31:17.070 --> 05:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:31:21.830 --> 05:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh is enabling this allowing more
 
05:31:25.390 --> 05:31:25.400 align:start position:0%
um communities to be able to actively
 
05:31:28.510 --> 05:31:28.520 align:start position:0%
lower their energy costs which I think
 
05:31:31.510 --> 05:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
is a goal of everybody on this
 
05:31:33.990 --> 05:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
committee yes I would say the answer is
 
05:31:36.670 --> 05:31:36.680 align:start position:0%
yes it's just giving um actually two
 
05:31:38.548 --> 05:31:38.558 align:start position:0%
more options for
 
05:31:41.150 --> 05:31:41.160 align:start position:0%
um local energy projects or existing
 
05:31:44.030 --> 05:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
generators they want to sell their offut
 
05:31:46.190 --> 05:31:46.200 align:start position:0%
uh their their power produced um they
 
05:31:48.070 --> 05:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
now would have two other options because
 
05:31:51.030 --> 05:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
right now the only option they have is
 
05:31:53.310 --> 05:31:53.320 align:start position:0%
uh through default service utility
 
05:31:56.110 --> 05:31:56.120 align:start position:0%
default service net metering um or they
 
05:31:57.910 --> 05:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
could you know not do net metering
 
05:31:59.910 --> 05:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
metering and you know participate in the
 
05:32:02.590 --> 05:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
iso New England markets and
 
05:32:05.670 --> 05:32:05.680 align:start position:0%
followup followup so my follow-up
 
05:32:08.190 --> 05:32:08.200 align:start position:0%
question would be then would you think
 
05:32:10.030 --> 05:32:10.040 align:start position:0%
that the implementation of this language
 
05:32:10.040 --> 05:32:11.708 align:start position:0%
that the implementation of this language
would

05:32:11.708 --> 05:32:11.718 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:32:17.110 --> 05:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
um increase people wanting to um enact
 
05:32:19.310 --> 05:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
these kinds of projects to solve some of
 
05:32:22.670 --> 05:32:22.680 align:start position:0%
their own local energy
 
05:32:26.310 --> 05:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
problems yeah I do I do think that um
 
05:32:28.270 --> 05:32:28.280 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire legislature opening
 
05:32:30.990 --> 05:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
the market by making this this change in
 
05:32:33.750 --> 05:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
statute would cause um you know more
 
05:32:35.628 --> 05:32:35.638 align:start position:0%
interest in this construct I think the
 
05:32:37.868 --> 05:32:37.878 align:start position:0%
other piece to that uh though is the
 
05:32:40.948 --> 05:32:40.958 align:start position:0%
interconnection que um and it's it's a
 
05:32:42.670 --> 05:32:42.680 align:start position:0%
very long process and I know the
 
05:32:44.350 --> 05:32:44.360 align:start position:0%
department of energy is working to
 
05:32:47.230 --> 05:32:47.240 align:start position:0%
develop Draft rules um that would be you
 
05:32:49.470 --> 05:32:49.480 align:start position:0%
know uniformly applied across all
 
05:32:51.990 --> 05:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
utilities in the state um so that's you
 
05:32:54.390 --> 05:32:54.400 align:start position:0%
know another good thing that puts us in
 
05:32:58.270 --> 05:32:58.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:01.310 --> 05:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
direction representative Wendy Thomas
 
05:33:04.788 --> 05:33:04.798 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um first of all thank
 
05:33:06.670 --> 05:33:06.680 align:start position:0%
you for being here you always do a good
 
05:33:08.948 --> 05:33:08.958 align:start position:0%
job of explaining things and making it
 
05:33:11.310 --> 05:33:11.320 align:start position:0%
very clear um I just want to give you
 
05:33:12.628 --> 05:33:12.638 align:start position:0%
some feedback you're you're probably
 
05:33:14.350 --> 05:33:14.360 align:start position:0%
never going to hear this again but I
 
05:33:16.948 --> 05:33:16.958 align:start position:0%
just really appreciate that you use a
 
05:33:16.958 --> 05:33:19.230 align:start position:0%
just really appreciate that you use a
larger

05:33:19.230 --> 05:33:19.240 align:start position:0%
larger
 
05:33:24.030 --> 05:33:24.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:26.990 --> 05:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
you additional questions or comments
 
05:33:27.000 --> 05:33:30.430 align:start position:0%
you additional questions or comments
representative

05:33:30.430 --> 05:33:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:33.750 --> 05:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
Harrington um the part about the uh line
 
05:33:36.510 --> 05:33:36.520 align:start position:0%
loss uh it seems kind of arbitrary that
 
05:33:39.110 --> 05:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
just picked one half of the utility
 
05:33:41.310 --> 05:33:41.320 align:start position:0%
published distribution system losses is
 
05:33:42.948 --> 05:33:42.958 align:start position:0%
this sort of a kick in the pants to the
 
05:33:45.110 --> 05:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
Pu to say come up with a number because
 
05:33:47.628 --> 05:33:47.638 align:start position:0%
no one's coming up with
 
05:33:50.590 --> 05:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
one yeah I mean it is arbitrary it's as
 
05:33:53.110 --> 05:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
good of a guess as uh you know the
 
05:33:55.590 --> 05:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
squirrel out in the tree could make um
 
05:33:58.350 --> 05:33:58.360 align:start position:0%
but in the absence of action because
 
05:34:00.350 --> 05:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
there hasn't been action on that um and
 
05:34:03.350 --> 05:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
the law that provided this was passed
 
05:34:06.150 --> 05:34:06.160 align:start position:0%
nearly 5 years ago we're just saying hey
 
05:34:08.990 --> 05:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
here's probably a ballpark figure um you
 
05:34:10.788 --> 05:34:10.798 align:start position:0%
know unless or until the utilities are
 
05:34:13.390 --> 05:34:13.400 align:start position:0%
willing to share that data um and
 
05:34:15.670 --> 05:34:15.680 align:start position:0%
provide that information to us to other
 
05:34:17.510 --> 05:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and to the commission we
 
05:34:20.510 --> 05:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
think that's a good starting
 
05:34:22.670 --> 05:34:22.680 align:start position:0%
Place follow
 
05:34:27.030 --> 05:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
up no followup needed okay further
 
05:34:30.070 --> 05:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
05:34:32.390 --> 05:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
Kaplan yeah uh thank you Mr chair and
 
05:34:35.070 --> 05:34:35.080 align:start position:0%
while we have you here uh my my good
 
05:34:36.948 --> 05:34:36.958 align:start position:0%
friend the representative Prime sponsor
 
05:34:39.150 --> 05:34:39.160 align:start position:0%
from the micro of Lebanon mentioned that
 
05:34:41.350 --> 05:34:41.360 align:start position:0%
it partially solved his problem but it
 
05:34:43.590 --> 05:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
didn't completely solve his problem and
 
05:34:45.548 --> 05:34:45.558 align:start position:0%
that that there was still issues with
 
05:34:48.230 --> 05:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
the billing so it seems like there the
 
05:34:50.590 --> 05:34:50.600 align:start position:0%
these customer generators or whatever
 
05:34:53.548 --> 05:34:53.558 align:start position:0%
Community generators will be paid by the
 
05:34:56.750 --> 05:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
aggregator for their net metering so do
 
05:34:59.830 --> 05:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
you is that billing a problem or is like
 
05:35:02.190 --> 05:35:02.200 align:start position:0%
how where's the hangup on that the
 
05:35:03.948 --> 05:35:03.958 align:start position:0%
billing itself is not a problem we're
 
05:35:05.788 --> 05:35:05.798 align:start position:0%
we're prepared to dual Bill meaning
 
05:35:07.830 --> 05:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
separately bill or credit such a
 
05:35:09.990 --> 05:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
customer cu the utilities can't really
 
05:35:12.830 --> 05:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
support that now and we're not asking
 
05:35:16.788 --> 05:35:16.798 align:start position:0%
them to do that um uh at you know at
 
05:35:19.948 --> 05:35:19.958 align:start position:0%
this scale
 
05:35:22.910 --> 05:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
so we're we and I think most competitive
 
05:35:24.868 --> 05:35:24.878 align:start position:0%
suppliers are perfectly capable of do
 
05:35:26.350 --> 05:35:26.360 align:start position:0%
separately billing outside of the
 
05:35:30.470 --> 05:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:32.948 --> 05:35:32.958 align:start position:0%
this you know be ideal if we could use
 
05:35:35.830 --> 05:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
the utility system but um it's not
 
05:35:38.310 --> 05:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
critical are questions representative
 
05:35:41.030 --> 05:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
McGee this is just a knit but I I think
 
05:35:42.948 --> 05:35:42.958 align:start position:0%
I remember somewhere on line seven on
 
05:35:45.708 --> 05:35:45.718 align:start position:0%
page two there's a uh the bolded
 
05:35:48.948 --> 05:35:48.958 align:start position:0%
language yes says load servicing isn't
 
05:35:50.750 --> 05:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
that supposed to be load serving entity
 
05:35:52.430 --> 05:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
it is all right well I'm gonna I'm going
 
05:35:54.590 --> 05:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
to mention that for you Clifton yes
 
05:35:57.270 --> 05:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
thank you it's somehow it ended up as
 
05:36:00.430 --> 05:36:00.440 align:start position:0%
load service then they said it was
 
05:36:02.590 --> 05:36:02.600 align:start position:0%
trying to fix that to load serving
 
05:36:04.470 --> 05:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
entity but it ended up at load's
 
05:36:07.788 --> 05:36:07.798 align:start position:0%
servicing entity
 
05:36:09.910 --> 05:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
be comedy of eror status there right
 
05:36:11.670 --> 05:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
right but so we could make that change
 
05:36:13.910 --> 05:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
if we were interested in having it go
 
05:36:16.390 --> 05:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
into statute correctly right okay thank
 
05:36:16.400 --> 05:36:20.430 align:start position:0%
into statute correctly right okay thank
you

05:36:20.430 --> 05:36:20.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:22.310 --> 05:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
05:36:26.430 --> 05:36:26.440 align:start position:0%
noted that change is noted okay any
 
05:36:28.350 --> 05:36:28.360 align:start position:0%
further questions seeing none we'll call
 
05:36:32.110 --> 05:36:32.120 align:start position:0%
next on Miss Jody grimas from the
 
05:36:40.230 --> 05:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:40.240 --> 05:36:41.150 align:start position:0%
 
good

05:36:41.150 --> 05:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
good
 
05:36:43.910 --> 05:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
afternoon good afternoon uh you're not
 
05:36:46.628 --> 05:36:46.638 align:start position:0%
typically used to seeing me today but my
 
05:36:49.590 --> 05:36:49.600 align:start position:0%
colleague hey croll had a conflict so um
 
05:36:51.270 --> 05:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
I will be here today just to give some
 
05:36:53.590 --> 05:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
quick remarks from garet State hydrop
 
05:36:56.230 --> 05:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
Power Association they have a concern
 
05:36:58.070 --> 05:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
and it's a very specific concern on this
 
05:36:59.910 --> 05:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
bill it's specifically and I think it's
 
05:37:02.270 --> 05:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
already been alluded to by Mr Belo is
 
05:37:05.990 --> 05:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
not critical um page one line 14 the
 
05:37:08.110 --> 05:37:08.120 align:start position:0%
bill proposes to strike the fairy phrase
 
05:37:10.548 --> 05:37:10.558 align:start position:0%
total Peak generating capacity and
 
05:37:13.070 --> 05:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
replace it with brand new language um
 
05:37:14.350 --> 05:37:14.360 align:start position:0%
that existing phrase has been
 
05:37:15.990 --> 05:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
interpreted for many years to mean name
 
05:37:18.590 --> 05:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
plate capacity and we believe that that
 
05:37:20.310 --> 05:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
Capa that interpretation has been
 
05:37:22.510 --> 05:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
working well we're not sure of any
 
05:37:24.310 --> 05:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
issues with it and we're very concerned
 
05:37:26.070 --> 05:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
about why that change is necessary
 
05:37:26.868 --> 05:37:26.878 align:start position:0%
because we're concerned there's
 
05:37:30.350 --> 05:37:30.360 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences to changing that
 
05:37:33.350 --> 05:37:33.360 align:start position:0%
well-known interpreted um language for
 
05:37:35.510 --> 05:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
something new and I will leave it at
 
05:37:36.670 --> 05:37:36.680 align:start position:0%
that if you have questions I'll bring
 
05:37:37.910 --> 05:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
them back I don't make not have the
 
05:37:41.670 --> 05:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:45.030 --> 05:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
concerns questions for Miss
 
05:37:48.230 --> 05:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
grimas representative McGee thank you Mr
 
05:37:50.190 --> 05:37:50.200 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you M grimas for
 
05:37:53.110 --> 05:37:53.120 align:start position:0%
taking my question so on that on that
 
05:37:56.948 --> 05:37:56.958 align:start position:0%
point um total Peak generating capacity
 
05:37:59.948 --> 05:37:59.958 align:start position:0%
seems pretty clear uh rated name PL
 
05:38:02.830 --> 05:38:02.840 align:start position:0%
plate capacity seems to be clearly
 
05:38:06.390 --> 05:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
understood maximum rated export capacity
 
05:38:09.750 --> 05:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
at the point of interconn action um I I
 
05:38:11.868 --> 05:38:11.878 align:start position:0%
don't think I've ever seen that language
 
05:38:14.590 --> 05:38:14.600 align:start position:0%
used before but I guess the point would
 
05:38:16.830 --> 05:38:16.840 align:start position:0%
be what it is the bill is trying to get
 
05:38:19.150 --> 05:38:19.160 align:start position:0%
at in terms of determining I think there
 
05:38:21.990 --> 05:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
was a an example given that you might
 
05:38:25.350 --> 05:38:25.360 align:start position:0%
not be um you might not be qualified at
 
05:38:27.030 --> 05:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
the point of interconnection to put
 
05:38:29.030 --> 05:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
Power on the system that is commiserate
 
05:38:31.350 --> 05:38:31.360 align:start position:0%
with the full plate capacity correct
 
05:38:32.628 --> 05:38:32.638 align:start position:0%
right that's what I just heard today in
 
05:38:34.310 --> 05:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
testimony I'll bring that back to the
 
05:38:36.070 --> 05:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
organization but again they wanted to
 
05:38:38.270 --> 05:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
bring that to your attention that
 
05:38:40.230 --> 05:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
if that language isn't really
 
05:38:41.990 --> 05:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily to change then maybe it
 
05:38:44.948 --> 05:38:44.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to so I I'll Circle back
 
05:38:47.830 --> 05:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
and and respond in writing and followup
 
05:38:51.548 --> 05:38:51.558 align:start position:0%
well then followup can I just ask I I
 
05:38:52.830 --> 05:38:52.840 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying in terms
 
05:38:55.990 --> 05:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
of having a consistent understanding um
 
05:38:58.628 --> 05:38:58.638 align:start position:0%
or consistent language so that your
 
05:39:01.190 --> 05:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
understanding of how this works is is is
 
05:39:04.590 --> 05:39:04.600 align:start position:0%
remaining the way it's understood so
 
05:39:07.708 --> 05:39:07.718 align:start position:0%
what would be the language I know
 
05:39:09.430 --> 05:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
there's stricken language here are you
 
05:39:11.270 --> 05:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
advocating for that stricken language or
 
05:39:12.628 --> 05:39:12.638 align:start position:0%
is there some other interpretation
 
05:39:14.788 --> 05:39:14.798 align:start position:0%
you're trying to get to no no other
 
05:39:16.070 --> 05:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
interpretation we would just say leave
 
05:39:18.990 --> 05:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
it alone like take take go back to Total
 
05:39:20.708 --> 05:39:20.718 align:start position:0%
Peak generating capacity take out the
 
05:39:22.830 --> 05:39:22.840 align:start position:0%
new language because we think it's not
 
05:39:24.670 --> 05:39:24.680 align:start position:0%
clear and we think there's potential
 
05:39:26.310 --> 05:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences we just want to
 
05:39:29.110 --> 05:39:29.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're not um and again
 
05:39:30.390 --> 05:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
maybe there's another way to get at the
 
05:39:31.868 --> 05:39:31.878 align:start position:0%
issue that Mr Belo was trying to speak
 
05:39:36.230 --> 05:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
to and so can I just ask um based on the
 
05:39:38.590 --> 05:39:38.600 align:start position:0%
language that's here then if it was
 
05:39:41.390 --> 05:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
total Peak generating capacity like
 
05:39:42.830 --> 05:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
commisure it with the point of
 
05:39:44.270 --> 05:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
interconnection I mean I'm I'm just
 
05:39:45.750 --> 05:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what they're trying
 
05:39:47.830 --> 05:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
to get at here with the specificity
 
05:39:50.628 --> 05:39:50.638 align:start position:0%
that's here we are trying to get at the
 
05:39:52.030 --> 05:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
concern that we don't think we need to
 
05:39:55.070 --> 05:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
change the language um I will certainly
 
05:39:57.190 --> 05:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
go back to the group and ask if they
 
05:39:59.468 --> 05:39:59.478 align:start position:0%
have any other suggestions or maybe talk
 
05:40:03.390 --> 05:40:03.400 align:start position:0%
to Deanna and and Mr Belo um but that is
 
05:40:04.628 --> 05:40:04.638 align:start position:0%
their concern is when they read this
 
05:40:06.350 --> 05:40:06.360 align:start position:0%
language they went why are we doing that
 
05:40:08.430 --> 05:40:08.440 align:start position:0%
that's unintended con consquences to
 
05:40:09.948 --> 05:40:09.958 align:start position:0%
come and we'd like to not have that
 
05:40:14.548 --> 05:40:14.558 align:start position:0%
happen thank you sure thank you any
 
05:40:18.270 --> 05:40:18.280 align:start position:0%
additional questions seeing
 
05:40:21.190 --> 05:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
none we will give the last word on this
 
05:40:24.110 --> 05:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
legislation to Michael Lata from
 
05:40:24.120 --> 05:40:37.788 align:start position:0%
legislation to Michael Lata from
eversource

05:40:37.788 --> 05:40:37.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:40.110 --> 05:40:40.120 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh again Michael AATA
 
05:40:42.270 --> 05:40:42.280 align:start position:0%
representing eversource energy
 
05:40:44.590 --> 05:40:44.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to testify
 
05:40:46.868 --> 05:40:46.878 align:start position:0%
before you this afternoon um we are
 
05:40:49.750 --> 05:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
opposed uh to HB
 
05:40:52.788 --> 05:40:52.798 align:start position:0%
759 uh a lot of the concepts contained
 
05:40:54.788 --> 05:40:54.798 align:start position:0%
within this bill uh have been previously
 
05:40:58.510 --> 05:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
discussed in part of earlier um uh
 
05:41:01.310 --> 05:41:01.320 align:start position:0%
testimony on on earlier bills uh I would
 
05:41:03.788 --> 05:41:03.798 align:start position:0%
note that several of these Concepts as
 
05:41:05.548 --> 05:41:05.558 align:start position:0%
was previously discussed are part of
 
05:41:07.628 --> 05:41:07.638 align:start position:0%
active adjudications
 
05:41:11.350 --> 05:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
um just two or three quick areas of of
 
05:41:15.590 --> 05:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
concern uh to point out uh one are uh
 
05:41:20.510 --> 05:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
the changes on page two um we would have
 
05:41:23.350 --> 05:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
a concern one that has been discussed
 
05:41:27.708 --> 05:41:27.718 align:start position:0%
that uh simply reducing the line loss by
 
05:41:31.110 --> 05:41:31.120 align:start position:0%
half of of the utility uh assumption is
 
05:41:34.750 --> 05:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
is just an arbitrary uh figure um I
 
05:41:37.310 --> 05:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
think that the onus of of how this is
 
05:41:40.750 --> 05:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
constructed is for uh The Entity who
 
05:41:43.310 --> 05:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
seeks the commission to review their net
 
05:41:46.190 --> 05:41:46.200 align:start position:0%
metering proposal uh should come forth
 
05:41:49.948 --> 05:41:49.958 align:start position:0%
with uh a line loss uh study to show
 
05:41:53.070 --> 05:41:53.080 align:start position:0%
that there is actual data uh behind that
 
05:41:55.510 --> 05:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
uh so again concerned with the arbitrary
 
05:41:57.868 --> 05:41:57.878 align:start position:0%
nature of just picking a number out of
 
05:42:00.750 --> 05:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
the air uh also on on that point has
 
05:42:04.708 --> 05:42:04.718 align:start position:0%
been discussed um previously uh a number
 
05:42:07.628 --> 05:42:07.638 align:start position:0%
of these proposals uh could
 
05:42:11.708 --> 05:42:11.718 align:start position:0%
implicate uh utility uh load uh load
 
05:42:15.830 --> 05:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
settlement processes Lo utility um uh
 
05:42:18.590 --> 05:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
systems and so we we certainly would not
 
05:42:20.830 --> 05:42:20.840 align:start position:0%
want to erode the requirement that the
 
05:42:23.150 --> 05:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission has to has a
 
05:42:25.708 --> 05:42:25.718 align:start position:0%
role in reviewing uh those proposals
 
05:42:27.990 --> 05:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
before they move forward uh and then
 
05:42:30.548 --> 05:42:30.558 align:start position:0%
finally uh and it's it's you know
 
05:42:33.190 --> 05:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
obviously this is uh there's a lot to
 
05:42:35.910 --> 05:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
this language uh but as with previous
 
05:42:37.708 --> 05:42:37.718 align:start position:0%
bills I I would also point point out
 
05:42:41.270 --> 05:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
that uh Provisions allowing either a
 
05:42:44.270 --> 05:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
community generator distributed energy
 
05:42:46.830 --> 05:42:46.840 align:start position:0%
resource to assign portions of their
 
05:42:50.230 --> 05:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
output to other load assets um in our
 
05:42:52.750 --> 05:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
view uh and this is an act of
 
05:42:54.868 --> 05:42:54.878 align:start position:0%
adjudication uh before the Public
 
05:42:57.708 --> 05:42:57.718 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission uh those wholesale
 
05:43:00.750 --> 05:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
transactions are are the exclusive
 
05:43:02.990 --> 05:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of the federal Regulatory
 
05:43:05.990 --> 05:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
Commission and so trying to construct a
 
05:43:10.310 --> 05:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
state uh system to bypass uh those
 
05:43:12.070 --> 05:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
wholesale transactions at the the
 
05:43:14.910 --> 05:43:14.920 align:start position:0%
regional and federal level uh we do
 
05:43:17.868 --> 05:43:17.878 align:start position:0%
think is is in violation of the law
 
05:43:21.110 --> 05:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions that I
 
05:43:23.628 --> 05:43:23.638 align:start position:0%
can okay thank you questions
 
05:43:26.270 --> 05:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington yeah it's it
 
05:43:28.070 --> 05:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
says in here the utility published
 
05:43:30.510 --> 05:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
distribution system line losses so I
 
05:43:32.030 --> 05:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
assuming that means there must be a
 
05:43:34.628 --> 05:43:34.638 align:start position:0%
utility publish distribution value for
 
05:43:37.830 --> 05:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
line loss where does that come from so
 
05:43:40.548 --> 05:43:40.558 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to go back to our team on
 
05:43:43.670 --> 05:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
how they estimate the line losses and
 
05:43:47.708 --> 05:43:47.718 align:start position:0%
how those are communicated okay thank
 
05:43:50.468 --> 05:43:50.478 align:start position:0%
you additional questions representative
 
05:43:52.708 --> 05:43:52.718 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:43:55.230 --> 05:43:55.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr Lata for taking my question so
 
05:43:57.708 --> 05:43:57.718 align:start position:0%
when you mentioned that the jurisdiction
 
05:43:59.270 --> 05:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
of the Federal Energy Regulatory
 
05:44:04.070 --> 05:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
Commission is that true for inter versus
 
05:44:04.080 --> 05:44:06.030 align:start position:0%
Commission is that true for inter versus
intra

05:44:06.030 --> 05:44:06.040 align:start position:0%
intra
 
05:44:08.468 --> 05:44:08.478 align:start position:0%
state energy transactions like I thought
 
05:44:10.628 --> 05:44:10.638 align:start position:0%
there was a distinction there they would
 
05:44:13.590 --> 05:44:13.600 align:start position:0%
not be involved if it was interstate so
 
05:44:17.670 --> 05:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
that exact question is the topic of
 
05:44:19.430 --> 05:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
basically legal briefs before the Public
 
05:44:22.468 --> 05:44:22.478 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission uh in it's called
 
05:44:25.910 --> 05:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
the leapa docket uh it has been ongoing
 
05:44:27.788 --> 05:44:27.798 align:start position:0%
how long has that been ongoing because I
 
05:44:29.590 --> 05:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
I recall this question for a really long
 
05:44:32.510 --> 05:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
time in my history I I know it's been an
 
05:44:36.030 --> 05:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
open question for I think well over a
 
05:44:37.590 --> 05:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
year or two I I don't have the exact
 
05:44:39.948 --> 05:44:39.958 align:start position:0%
number but we're at the you know
 
05:44:41.990 --> 05:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
obviously procedural schedule of the
 
05:44:44.150 --> 05:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities
 
05:44:49.788 --> 05:44:49.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:51.868 --> 05:44:51.878 align:start position:0%
thanks seeing
 
05:44:54.750 --> 05:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
none that's the last pink card we have
 
05:44:57.510 --> 05:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
for this bill so I'm going to close the
 
05:44:59.510 --> 05:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill
 
05:44:59.520 --> 05:45:02.190 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill
759

05:45:02.190 --> 05:45:02.200 align:start position:0%
759
 
05:45:05.590 --> 05:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:08.590 --> 05:45:08.600 align:start position:0%
next we'll open a public hearing on
 
05:45:09.910 --> 05:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
05:45:13.708 --> 05:45:13.718 align:start position:0%
760 FN this is relative to utility
 
05:45:13.718 --> 05:45:14.788 align:start position:0%
760 FN this is relative to utility
default

05:45:14.788 --> 05:45:14.798 align:start position:0%
default
 
05:45:18.750 --> 05:45:18.760 align:start position:0%
service and I will recognize the prime
 
05:45:20.350 --> 05:45:20.360 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this
 
05:45:23.190 --> 05:45:23.200 align:start position:0%
legislation representative Thomas Corman
 
05:45:30.948 --> 05:45:30.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:45.150 --> 05:45:45.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:47.110 --> 05:45:47.120 align:start position:0%
all right well thank you Mr chairman for
 
05:45:49.590 --> 05:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
the record Tom Corman representing
 
05:45:53.390 --> 05:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
Grafton 15 The Fabulous micropolis of
 
05:45:56.110 --> 05:45:56.120 align:start position:0%
Lebanon but I represent officially only
 
05:46:02.350 --> 05:46:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:06.190 --> 05:46:06.200 align:start position:0%
city utilities provide default service
 
05:46:09.110 --> 05:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
not everybody takes default service
 
05:46:10.750 --> 05:46:10.760 align:start position:0%
there are people on community power
 
05:46:14.868 --> 05:46:14.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:18.670 --> 05:46:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:21.190 --> 05:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
utilities get rates set for default
 
05:46:25.110 --> 05:46:25.120 align:start position:0%
service twice a year set by the
 
05:46:29.510 --> 05:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
Pu and it can happen that the actual
 
05:46:32.430 --> 05:46:32.440 align:start position:0%
cost borne by the utility exceeds what
 
05:46:35.270 --> 05:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
they're able to recover in those rates
 
05:46:38.190 --> 05:46:38.200 align:start position:0%
that were set and and this is actually
 
05:46:39.430 --> 05:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
going to
 
05:46:42.990 --> 05:46:43.000 align:start position:0%
be more likely going forward because the
 
05:46:46.350 --> 05:46:46.360 align:start position:0%
puc is encouraging the utilities to
 
05:46:48.708 --> 05:46:48.718 align:start position:0%
purchase less of their electricity on
 
05:46:51.868 --> 05:46:51.878 align:start position:0%
fixed contracts and more on the spot
 
05:46:54.310 --> 05:46:54.320 align:start position:0%
markets which of course are volatile and
 
05:46:56.270 --> 05:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
we've seen in fact sometimes very
 
05:46:59.310 --> 05:46:59.320 align:start position:0%
extreme volatility so it could come to
 
05:47:01.708 --> 05:47:01.718 align:start position:0%
pass that a
 
05:47:05.548 --> 05:47:05.558 align:start position:0%
utility is not recovering its costs from
 
05:47:08.270 --> 05:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
the rates that were there and therefore
 
05:47:11.030 --> 05:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
needs to recover those costs
 
05:47:14.548 --> 05:47:14.558 align:start position:0%
somehow currently they can actually
 
05:47:16.948 --> 05:47:16.958 align:start position:0%
recover those costs through n non
 
05:47:20.430 --> 05:47:20.440 align:start position:0%
bypassable charges that go to all the
 
05:47:23.430 --> 05:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
utility customers regardless of whether
 
05:47:25.590 --> 05:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
those customers are on default
 
05:47:28.990 --> 05:47:29.000 align:start position:0%
service so I while I'm not on community
 
05:47:31.628 --> 05:47:31.638 align:start position:0%
power but um chairman Vose I believe
 
05:47:35.110 --> 05:47:35.120 align:start position:0%
you're in community power so um
 
05:47:39.548 --> 05:47:39.558 align:start position:0%
if if you're default service rate is is
 
05:47:42.110 --> 05:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
insufficient you could end up paying for
 
05:47:43.468 --> 05:47:43.478 align:start position:0%
that even though you're not a default
 
05:47:47.190 --> 05:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
service customer so what this bill says
 
05:47:51.910 --> 05:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
pretty simply is that when those rates
 
05:47:53.590 --> 05:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
or when those charges need to be
 
05:47:56.868 --> 05:47:56.878 align:start position:0%
recovered for default service they're
 
05:48:00.150 --> 05:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
recovered from only default service
 
05:48:02.708 --> 05:48:02.718 align:start position:0%
customers so those on community power
 
05:48:06.150 --> 05:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
those on on uh competitive suppliers
 
05:48:08.070 --> 05:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
they had nothing to do with it and they
 
05:48:10.788 --> 05:48:10.798 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be paying for it and this uh
 
05:48:13.510 --> 05:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
Bill also sets a time frame for this
 
05:48:17.548 --> 05:48:17.558 align:start position:0%
saying that the recovery should take no
 
05:48:19.270 --> 05:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
longer than a year you can't just keep
 
05:48:21.310 --> 05:48:21.320 align:start position:0%
stretching it out and really that's what
 
05:48:25.350 --> 05:48:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:28.990 --> 05:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
about okay thank you for that a couple
 
05:48:31.468 --> 05:48:31.478 align:start position:0%
of quick questions for you are you aware
 
05:48:36.230 --> 05:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
of any attempt by the utilities to uh
 
05:48:36.240 --> 05:48:38.110 align:start position:0%
of any attempt by the utilities to uh
extract

05:48:38.110 --> 05:48:38.120 align:start position:0%
extract
 
05:48:42.190 --> 05:48:42.200 align:start position:0%
over or under collected monies from
 
05:48:46.070 --> 05:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
their entire distribution base well they
 
05:48:48.230 --> 05:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
they have the ability to to bake that
 
05:48:50.270 --> 05:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
into distribution rates they have the
 
05:48:53.468 --> 05:48:53.478 align:start position:0%
ability to uh bake it into any of the
 
05:48:57.070 --> 05:48:57.080 align:start position:0%
non- bypassable charges as far as I know
 
05:49:00.788 --> 05:49:00.798 align:start position:0%
um the concern I have of course is that
 
05:49:03.910 --> 05:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
with utilities relying on more volatile
 
05:49:06.910 --> 05:49:06.920 align:start position:0%
markets going forward the prospect for
 
05:49:10.390 --> 05:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
this happening is
 
05:49:12.788 --> 05:49:12.798 align:start position:0%
increasing so this is proactive
 
05:49:14.948 --> 05:49:14.958 align:start position:0%
legislation then that tries to get ahead
 
05:49:16.350 --> 05:49:16.360 align:start position:0%
of something that hasn't actually
 
05:49:18.430 --> 05:49:18.440 align:start position:0%
happened yet as far as I know that's
 
05:49:22.510 --> 05:49:22.520 align:start position:0%
true um others who testify may have more
 
05:49:25.548 --> 05:49:25.558 align:start position:0%
information okay thank you questions for
 
05:49:28.270 --> 05:49:28.280 align:start position:0%
the prime
 
05:49:31.230 --> 05:49:31.240 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman thank you everyone
 
05:50:15.070 --> 05:50:15.080 align:start position:0%
uh this my name is Jim G I'm a resident
 
05:50:18.468 --> 05:50:18.478 align:start position:0%
of Atkinson New Hampshire and I just
 
05:50:22.910 --> 05:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
handed out a real brief outline um I
 
05:50:24.670 --> 05:50:24.680 align:start position:0%
shouldn't take more than three
 
05:50:27.708 --> 05:50:27.718 align:start position:0%
minutes I come to this issue from a
 
05:50:30.310 --> 05:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
perspect four different uh perspectives
 
05:50:32.070 --> 05:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
as a former legislator I served here
 
05:50:36.230 --> 05:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
from 2004 to 2012 served as as the chair
 
05:50:37.628 --> 05:50:37.638 align:start position:0%
in my last
 
05:50:41.548 --> 05:50:41.558 align:start position:0%
term and I'm also a member of the
 
05:50:44.110 --> 05:50:44.120 align:start position:0%
residential rate payers Advisory Board
 
05:50:47.430 --> 05:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
the board that advises the consumer
 
05:50:49.990 --> 05:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
Advocate and I've been on that board
 
05:50:52.830 --> 05:50:52.840 align:start position:0%
since I was appointed by the speaker in
 
05:50:55.230 --> 05:50:55.240 align:start position:0%
2013 through
 
05:50:59.150 --> 05:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
2025 and I specifically represent
 
05:51:02.868 --> 05:51:02.878 align:start position:0%
residential rate payers before the OCA
 
05:51:06.190 --> 05:51:06.200 align:start position:0%
so in other words all of you I speak for
 
05:51:08.788 --> 05:51:08.798 align:start position:0%
you before the
 
05:51:10.910 --> 05:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
OCA I'm also on the board of directors
 
05:51:13.110 --> 05:51:13.120 align:start position:0%
of the community power Coalition of New
 
05:51:17.468 --> 05:51:17.478 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cpcn ainson just joined last
 
05:51:20.910 --> 05:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
June and we've saved I think we've saved
 
05:51:22.708 --> 05:51:22.718 align:start position:0%
$270,000 through
 
05:51:25.708 --> 05:51:25.718 align:start position:0%
December uh it's been a great program
 
05:51:28.628 --> 05:51:28.638 align:start position:0%
and I'm also the chair of the Atkinson
 
05:51:30.708 --> 05:51:30.718 align:start position:0%
energy commission which is our local
 
05:51:33.070 --> 05:51:33.080 align:start position:0%
energy commission been doing that since
 
05:51:35.628 --> 05:51:35.638 align:start position:0%
2004 and in those 20 years I've been
 
05:51:38.350 --> 05:51:38.360 align:start position:0%
basically a one and a Hal trick pony I
 
05:51:42.030 --> 05:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
believe that electric rates can go down
 
05:51:42.040 --> 05:51:43.350 align:start position:0%
believe that electric rates can go down
it's

05:51:43.350 --> 05:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:51:46.670 --> 05:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
achievable and we always want to tell
 
05:51:49.750 --> 05:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
people you know the cheapest kilowatt is
 
05:51:51.868 --> 05:51:51.878 align:start position:0%
the one you never use so shut off the
 
05:51:53.230 --> 05:51:53.240 align:start position:0%
lights when I was chairman here we used
 
05:51:55.510 --> 05:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
to shut off the side lights because said
 
05:51:57.510 --> 05:51:57.520 align:start position:0%
these are useless we we don't need these
 
05:52:00.548 --> 05:52:00.558 align:start position:0%
but in any case that's uh that that's
 
05:52:02.628 --> 05:52:02.638 align:start position:0%
where I'm coming from and I want to
 
05:52:05.430 --> 05:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
leave you with a one two three one
 
05:52:08.150 --> 05:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
question you should always be be asking
 
05:52:10.510 --> 05:52:10.520 align:start position:0%
on any piece of legislation how will
 
05:52:13.030 --> 05:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
this impact rates when I was a
 
05:52:15.628 --> 05:52:15.638 align:start position:0%
legislator and the lobbyists would come
 
05:52:18.628 --> 05:52:18.638 align:start position:0%
through here I'd always say how will
 
05:52:21.350 --> 05:52:21.360 align:start position:0%
this impact rates they going up or they
 
05:52:23.310 --> 05:52:23.320 align:start position:0%
going down as a member of the
 
05:52:24.868 --> 05:52:24.878 align:start position:0%
residential rate payers Advisory board
 
05:52:26.628 --> 05:52:26.638 align:start position:0%
when Don Cree is going through some of
 
05:52:29.110 --> 05:52:29.120 align:start position:0%
the Pu dockets say I'll always raise my
 
05:52:31.350 --> 05:52:31.360 align:start position:0%
hand say Don what's this going to do to
 
05:52:32.948 --> 05:52:32.958 align:start position:0%
electric rates are they going to go up
 
05:52:35.030 --> 05:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
or down if he says they'll probably go
 
05:52:37.948 --> 05:52:37.958 align:start position:0%
up I say you got to fight this done you
 
05:52:40.708 --> 05:52:40.718 align:start position:0%
can't let them do this as a board of
 
05:52:43.628 --> 05:52:43.638 align:start position:0%
directors of community power Coalition
 
05:52:45.990 --> 05:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh the reason I wanted to be on the
 
05:52:48.468 --> 05:52:48.478 align:start position:0%
board was to remind the
 
05:52:50.390 --> 05:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
Coalition never
 
05:52:56.430 --> 05:52:56.440 align:start position:0%
forget the foundational value of lower
 
05:52:59.990 --> 05:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
electric rates That's The Power of cpcn
 
05:53:02.868 --> 05:53:02.878 align:start position:0%
that's the foundation of cpcn and I
 
05:53:04.948 --> 05:53:04.958 align:start position:0%
always like to remind him look we can
 
05:53:06.990 --> 05:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
change the world but lower electric
 
05:53:09.390 --> 05:53:09.400 align:start position:0%
rates is what we're about and we need to
 
05:53:11.708 --> 05:53:11.718 align:start position:0%
keep doing that and then on the ainson
 
05:53:14.468 --> 05:53:14.478 align:start position:0%
energy commission you know we always ask
 
05:53:16.390 --> 05:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
ourselves how can we lower rates for the
 
05:53:19.590 --> 05:53:19.600 align:start position:0%
town government and for people in town
 
05:53:21.030 --> 05:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
and that's why we went through this
 
05:53:23.708 --> 05:53:23.718 align:start position:0%
community power exercise it's been a
 
05:53:26.910 --> 05:53:26.920 align:start position:0%
huge success people love it love us they
 
05:53:28.510 --> 05:53:28.520 align:start position:0%
think we're rock
 
05:53:30.788 --> 05:53:30.798 align:start position:0%
stars so the three questions that was
 
05:53:32.670 --> 05:53:32.680 align:start position:0%
the first question how will this impact
 
05:53:35.948 --> 05:53:35.958 align:start position:0%
rates one question two evils that have
 
05:53:38.390 --> 05:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
been facing us since I've been a
 
05:53:42.070 --> 05:53:42.080 align:start position:0%
legislator cost shifting that's evil and
 
05:53:43.670 --> 05:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
subsidies are
 
05:53:48.270 --> 05:53:48.280 align:start position:0%
evil because rate payers end up paying
 
05:53:48.280 --> 05:53:49.670 align:start position:0%
evil because rate payers end up paying
those

05:53:49.670 --> 05:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
those
 
05:53:52.590 --> 05:53:52.600 align:start position:0%
costs they always end up on the left
 
05:53:54.468 --> 05:53:54.478 align:start position:0%
side of the electric bill and some kind
 
05:53:56.868 --> 05:53:56.878 align:start position:0%
of a hidden stranded cost somewhere we
 
05:53:59.030 --> 05:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
can't let that happen and then I leave
 
05:54:01.830 --> 05:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
you with three principles free market
 
05:54:04.390 --> 05:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
competition Works we've seen that happen
 
05:54:06.910 --> 05:54:06.920 align:start position:0%
with the community power law that
 
05:54:10.070 --> 05:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
you folks amended a few years ago to
 
05:54:12.590 --> 05:54:12.600 align:start position:0%
make it happen it's been an amazing
 
05:54:16.030 --> 05:54:16.040 align:start position:0%
success in just a year and a half you've
 
05:54:17.910 --> 05:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
you've seen what's happened rates have
 
05:54:20.788 --> 05:54:20.798 align:start position:0%
gone from I paid 26 Cents a kilowatt
 
05:54:24.230 --> 05:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
hour as unial customer uh not too long
 
05:54:28.708 --> 05:54:28.718 align:start position:0%
ago now I'm paying less than N9 cents
 
05:54:32.270 --> 05:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
right it works competition works the
 
05:54:36.670 --> 05:54:36.680 align:start position:0%
power of group purchasing works
 
05:54:39.230 --> 05:54:39.240 align:start position:0%
the second principle those who take
 
05:54:43.350 --> 05:54:43.360 align:start position:0%
risks should pay for the risks so if
 
05:54:45.150 --> 05:54:45.160 align:start position:0%
competitive suppliers if the community
 
05:54:47.910 --> 05:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
power Coalition if we're going out to
 
05:54:51.990 --> 05:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
hedge our power purchases and we guess
 
05:54:55.830 --> 05:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
wrong then we need to pay for those
 
05:54:59.830 --> 05:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
risks by drawing from our reserves in
 
05:55:02.990 --> 05:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
the same way the default investor own
 
05:55:05.230 --> 05:55:05.240 align:start position:0%
utilities need to do the same if they
 
05:55:07.670 --> 05:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
guess wrong and they don't make enough
 
05:55:10.110 --> 05:55:10.120 align:start position:0%
money they should recover that through
 
05:55:12.510 --> 05:55:12.520 align:start position:0%
either their customers their customers
 
05:55:14.830 --> 05:55:14.840 align:start position:0%
not everyone else or they are an
 
05:55:17.830 --> 05:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
investor own utility so maybe they
 
05:55:21.190 --> 05:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
should be investor owned risks but don't
 
05:55:23.590 --> 05:55:23.600 align:start position:0%
take it from a
 
05:55:28.548 --> 05:55:28.558 align:start position:0%
socialized assessment on all rate Pairs
 
05:55:31.430 --> 05:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
and last legislative Clarity brings
 
05:55:31.440 --> 05:55:33.548 align:start position:0%
and last legislative Clarity brings
regulatory

05:55:33.548 --> 05:55:33.558 align:start position:0%
regulatory
 
05:55:36.788 --> 05:55:36.798 align:start position:0%
Clarity you as legislators

have the power to tell the
 
05:55:42.270 --> 05:55:42.280 align:start position:0%
Pu in the competitive Supply space there
 
05:55:45.230 --> 05:55:45.240 align:start position:0%
will be no cost shifting there'll be no
 
05:55:48.910 --> 05:55:48.920 align:start position:0%
stranded costs associated with
 
05:55:53.150 --> 05:55:53.160 align:start position:0%
losses and no socializing those losses
 
05:55:55.110 --> 05:55:55.120 align:start position:0%
across people that aren't even your
 
05:55:57.750 --> 05:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
power customers so I would urge you to
 
05:56:01.310 --> 05:56:01.320 align:start position:0%
please vote ought to pass on House Bill
 
05:56:03.990 --> 05:56:04.000 align:start position:0%

very
 
05:56:18.868 --> 05:56:18.878 align:start position:0%
much questions for The Honorable Mr
 
05:56:23.270 --> 05:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
gy I have one oh yes sir do you think
 
05:56:26.310 --> 05:56:26.320 align:start position:0%
that the
 
05:56:29.590 --> 05:56:29.600 align:start position:0%
Pu has a responsibility even an
 
05:56:32.270 --> 05:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
obligation to protect default service
 
05:56:34.750 --> 05:56:34.760 align:start position:0%
because it is the provision or it is the
 
05:56:36.868 --> 05:56:36.878 align:start position:0%
service of Last Resort short for the
 
05:56:38.150 --> 05:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
provision of
 
05:56:41.948 --> 05:56:41.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:46.750 --> 05:56:46.760 align:start position:0%
yeah okay y short and sweet appreciate
 
05:56:49.670 --> 05:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
it any further questions seeing none
 
05:56:52.190 --> 05:56:52.200 align:start position:0%
we'll move along thank you sir thank you
 
05:56:55.190 --> 05:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
very next we'll call on Alex spidel of
 
05:57:03.070 --> 05:57:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:05.670 --> 05:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
pu good afternoon chairman those members
 
05:57:07.910 --> 05:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
of the committee thank you for having us
 
05:57:10.070 --> 05:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
here this afternoon uh the Public
 
05:57:12.230 --> 05:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission would like to speak
 
05:57:14.070 --> 05:57:14.080 align:start position:0%
in opposition to this
 
05:57:18.070 --> 05:57:18.080 align:start position:0%
bill and the first piece of important
 
05:57:19.310 --> 05:57:19.320 align:start position:0%
information I think there was some
 
05:57:21.750 --> 05:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
hinting at it earlier but it's important
 
05:57:25.390 --> 05:57:25.400 align:start position:0%
to clarify that uh with regards to the
 
05:57:28.468 --> 05:57:28.478 align:start position:0%
changes that are being proposed under
 
05:57:31.750 --> 05:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
part one of this bill there are actually
 
05:57:34.628 --> 05:57:34.638 align:start position:0%
two definitely open and
 
05:57:37.788 --> 05:57:37.798 align:start position:0%
one potentially open dockets at the
 
05:57:39.590 --> 05:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
commission where we're adjudicating this
 
05:57:44.868 --> 05:57:44.878 align:start position:0%
very same issue so uh eversource in
 
05:57:48.468 --> 05:57:48.478 align:start position:0%
de24 d112 in the stranded cost
 
05:57:51.910 --> 05:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
reconciliation charge proceeding they
 
05:57:54.468 --> 05:57:54.478 align:start position:0%
actually made this proposal on their own
 
05:57:56.788 --> 05:57:56.798 align:start position:0%
reflecting their practice down in
 
05:57:59.430 --> 05:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts as a suggestion because of
 
05:58:03.110 --> 05:58:03.120 align:start position:0%
the back stop or a service of Last
 
05:58:05.788 --> 05:58:05.798 align:start position:0%
Resort role of default service that
 
05:58:08.628 --> 05:58:08.638 align:start position:0%
these reconciliation under collections
 
05:58:10.430 --> 05:58:10.440 align:start position:0%
or over collections would either be
 
05:58:12.190 --> 05:58:12.200 align:start position:0%
collected from all distribution rate
 
05:58:15.150 --> 05:58:15.160 align:start position:0%
payers or flowed back to distribution
 
05:58:16.990 --> 05:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
rate payers as a
 
05:58:21.270 --> 05:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
credit and we obliged eversource by
 
05:58:24.270 --> 05:58:24.280 align:start position:0%
opening a proceeding on the basis of
 
05:58:26.788 --> 05:58:26.798 align:start position:0%
their petition we haven't decided it yet
 
05:58:29.750 --> 05:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a hearing on it in
 
05:58:31.990 --> 05:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
on May the eth and testimony is going to
 
05:58:35.670 --> 05:58:35.680 align:start position:0%
be filed on March 11th and thereafter
 
05:58:38.070 --> 05:58:38.080 align:start position:0%
and it's also connected with their D
 
05:58:40.750 --> 05:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
24046 default service proposal so that's
 
05:58:42.430 --> 05:58:42.440 align:start position:0%
being adjudicated right now we haven't
 
05:58:45.390 --> 05:58:45.400 align:start position:0%
decided anything at the Pu on that for
 
05:58:47.750 --> 05:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
Unitil likewise in
 
05:58:50.510 --> 05:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
24065 uh the Unitil company just filed a
 
05:58:53.510 --> 05:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
proposal on February the 14th regarding
 
05:58:56.510 --> 05:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
the same reconciliation treatment and
 
05:58:59.270 --> 05:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
Unitil landed saying we think that this
 
05:59:02.310 --> 05:59:02.320 align:start position:0%
may be a fair way to proceed to have it
 
05:59:04.070 --> 05:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
shifted over to the distribution
 
05:59:06.230 --> 05:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
consumers both as ACC credited if
 
05:59:08.270 --> 05:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
there's an over collection or is a debit
 
05:59:11.190 --> 05:59:11.200 align:start position:0%
if it's an under collection and in the
 
05:59:12.628 --> 05:59:12.638 align:start position:0%
Liberty de
 
05:59:14.910 --> 05:59:14.920 align:start position:0%
24061 March hearings that are
 
05:59:16.990 --> 05:59:17.000 align:start position:0%
forthcoming uh there's expected to be
 
05:59:19.628 --> 05:59:19.638 align:start position:0%
discussion on this point uh it's not
 
05:59:21.390 --> 05:59:21.400 align:start position:0%
directional the company hasn't proposed
 
05:59:22.948 --> 05:59:22.958 align:start position:0%
anything but there're they have an open
 
05:59:25.230 --> 05:59:25.240 align:start position:0%
mind about a number of different uh
 
05:59:26.468 --> 05:59:26.478 align:start position:0%
reforms that they're interested in
 
05:59:28.590 --> 05:59:28.600 align:start position:0%
talking about so why is all that
 
05:59:30.708 --> 05:59:30.718 align:start position:0%
relevant the commission has not yet
 
05:59:32.510 --> 05:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
decided that it's just reasonable and in
 
05:59:34.788 --> 05:59:34.798 align:start position:0%
the public interest to have these
 
05:59:37.230 --> 05:59:37.240 align:start position:0%
charges applied to distribution
 
05:59:39.350 --> 05:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
consumers the theory that's been
 
05:59:41.628 --> 05:59:41.638 align:start position:0%
presented by two of the three
 
05:59:45.270 --> 05:59:45.280 align:start position:0%
utilities is that uh as the service of
 
05:59:47.468 --> 05:59:47.478 align:start position:0%
Last Resort it's important to protect
 
05:59:49.670 --> 05:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
the financial Integrity of default
 
05:59:53.150 --> 05:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
service and furthermore uh we do know at
 
05:59:54.390 --> 05:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
the commission based on our
 
05:59:57.070 --> 05:59:57.080 align:start position:0%
investigation data regarding our new
 
05:59:57.080 --> 05:59:58.150 align:start position:0%
investigation data regarding our new
market-based

05:59:58.150 --> 05:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
market-based
 
06:00:01.788 --> 06:00:01.798 align:start position:0%
procurements that the upside is more
 
06:00:04.430 --> 06:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
common in nearly every instance than the
 
06:00:07.750 --> 06:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
downside so we've crunched some numbers
 
06:00:10.948 --> 06:00:10.958 align:start position:0%
I'll give this as a general figure but
 
06:00:13.070 --> 06:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
um there is volatility in the markets
 
06:00:16.548 --> 06:00:16.558 align:start position:0%
but because we have proxy prices that
 
06:00:20.548 --> 06:00:20.558 align:start position:0%
build in NX Futures and other expected
 
06:00:23.510 --> 06:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
outcomes over the years it's hard to
 
06:00:25.430 --> 06:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
beat the wholesale markets it's
 
06:00:27.150 --> 06:00:27.160 align:start position:0%
impossible to beat the wholesale markets
 
06:00:29.708 --> 06:00:29.718 align:start position:0%
because that's the no middleman lowest
 
06:00:33.868 --> 06:00:33.878 align:start position:0%
price option so in such an instance
 
06:00:35.548 --> 06:00:35.558 align:start position:0%
where the commission is working to add
 
06:00:38.750 --> 06:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
more and more up to the 50% Mark those
 
06:00:40.990 --> 06:00:41.000 align:start position:0%
are the proposals that are on the table
 
06:00:43.030 --> 06:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
for the utilities right now compared to
 
06:00:46.350 --> 06:00:46.360 align:start position:0%
say 125% about a year ago the prices
 
06:00:48.030 --> 06:00:48.040 align:start position:0%
that we're offering default service
 
06:00:51.350 --> 06:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
customers are lower they're all below 9
 
06:00:54.750 --> 06:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
cents at the present time so moving on
 
06:00:58.270 --> 06:00:58.280 align:start position:0%
to part two of the bill um this is also
 
06:00:59.990 --> 06:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
of concern to the commission because it
 
06:01:02.708 --> 06:01:02.718 align:start position:0%
says repeal RSA
 
06:01:07.468 --> 06:01:07.478 align:start position:0%
374 DF colon 3 Roman
 
06:01:10.510 --> 06:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
5df of the utility restructuring
 
06:01:13.350 --> 06:01:13.360 align:start position:0%
principles regarding Universal service
 
06:01:15.788 --> 06:01:15.798 align:start position:0%
are repealed so when you actually thumb
 
06:01:17.510 --> 06:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
through the rsas on that there's some
 
06:01:20.670 --> 06:01:20.680 align:start position:0%
good things in here under D which would
 
06:01:23.190 --> 06:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
be repealed by this proposal it says the
 
06:01:25.350 --> 06:01:25.360 align:start position:0%
commission should establish transition
 
06:01:27.270 --> 06:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
and default service appropriate to the
 
06:01:28.910 --> 06:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
particular circumstances of each
 
06:01:31.110 --> 06:01:31.120 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional utility that means it's
 
06:01:33.468 --> 06:01:33.478 align:start position:0%
not a one-size fitall for our three
 
06:01:35.190 --> 06:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
investor owned utilities that's good to
 
06:01:38.830 --> 06:01:38.840 align:start position:0%
have remain in there then there's part e
 
06:01:40.510 --> 06:01:40.520 align:start position:0%
not withstanding any provision of
 
06:01:42.788 --> 06:01:42.798 align:start position:0%
subparagraphs B and C as competitive
 
06:01:44.868 --> 06:01:44.878 align:start position:0%
markets develop the commission may
 
06:01:47.230 --> 06:01:47.240 align:start position:0%
approve alternative means of providing
 
06:01:49.990 --> 06:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
transition or default Services which are
 
06:01:52.548 --> 06:01:52.558 align:start position:0%
designed to minimize customer risk not
 
06:01:53.990 --> 06:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
unduly harm the development of
 
06:01:56.548 --> 06:01:56.558 align:start position:0%
competitive markets and mitigate against
 
06:01:58.350 --> 06:01:58.360 align:start position:0%
price volatility without creating new
 
06:02:00.548 --> 06:02:00.558 align:start position:0%
deferred costs if the commission
 
06:02:01.948 --> 06:02:01.958 align:start position:0%
determines such means to be in the
 
06:02:04.110 --> 06:02:04.120 align:start position:0%
public interest uh the commission views
 
06:02:05.590 --> 06:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
that public interest standard to be very
 
06:02:07.590 --> 06:02:07.600 align:start position:0%
important important and helpful and this
 
06:02:09.868 --> 06:02:09.878 align:start position:0%
alternative means of providing default
 
06:02:11.670 --> 06:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
service to have a good thing in our back
 
06:02:14.590 --> 06:02:14.600 align:start position:0%
pocket we live in very uh uncertain
 
06:02:17.430 --> 06:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
times we recognize this our regional
 
06:02:19.430 --> 06:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
electricity markets are performing very
 
06:02:22.230 --> 06:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
well what we worked for 15 years ago to
 
06:02:24.750 --> 06:02:24.760 align:start position:0%
bring that to fruition I think folks
 
06:02:27.628 --> 06:02:27.638 align:start position:0%
like Mr Belo were working 25 or 30 years
 
06:02:29.350 --> 06:02:29.360 align:start position:0%
ago to bring that to fruition are
 
06:02:31.788 --> 06:02:31.798 align:start position:0%
finally coming to the benefit of the New
 
06:02:33.350 --> 06:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rape pair because of all the
 
06:02:34.910 --> 06:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
work that iso's done that our local
 
06:02:37.548 --> 06:02:37.558 align:start position:0%
Regulators have done firk has done and
 
06:02:40.670 --> 06:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
so yes that's good but if in the future
 
06:02:43.430 --> 06:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
we need to revamp default service using
 
06:02:45.910 --> 06:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
alternative means based on emergency
 
06:02:47.910 --> 06:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
conditions that may develop in this
 
06:02:50.030 --> 06:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
world of ours that's good to not have
 
06:02:52.788 --> 06:02:52.798 align:start position:0%
that removed and then finally partf
 
06:02:55.910 --> 06:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
relates to renewable energy source
 
06:02:58.948 --> 06:02:58.958 align:start position:0%
default service so uh that essentially
 
06:03:02.270 --> 06:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
is designed to offer the utilities of
 
06:03:04.190 --> 06:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
renewable default service offering if
 
06:03:07.750 --> 06:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
they'd like so I would encourage the uh
 
06:03:10.510 --> 06:03:10.520 align:start position:0%
committee to um vote against this
 
06:03:14.150 --> 06:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:17.990 --> 06:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
you well thank you and uh I just want to
 
06:03:19.948 --> 06:03:19.958 align:start position:0%
make sure I understood what you said you
 
06:03:22.948 --> 06:03:22.958 align:start position:0%
said upside was more common than
 
06:03:27.468 --> 06:03:27.478 align:start position:0%
downsides does that mean that if the
 
06:03:31.150 --> 06:03:31.160 align:start position:0%
utilities were to um try to recover
 
06:03:34.628 --> 06:03:34.638 align:start position:0%
their costs from with a non- bypassable
 
06:03:36.548 --> 06:03:36.558 align:start position:0%
charge that
 
06:03:38.708 --> 06:03:38.718 align:start position:0%
they'd occasionally collect from rate
 
06:03:40.548 --> 06:03:40.558 align:start position:0%
payers but more often they would give
 
06:03:42.868 --> 06:03:42.878 align:start position:0%
back to rate payers yes based on the
 
06:03:45.910 --> 06:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
data that I've seen uh what we developed
 
06:03:46.868 --> 06:03:46.878 align:start position:0%
at the
 
06:03:49.310 --> 06:03:49.320 align:start position:0%
commission the proxy prices that are
 
06:03:52.190 --> 06:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
being built into the market program are
 
06:03:56.910 --> 06:03:56.920 align:start position:0%
such that you would always see in 99 out
 
06:03:59.628 --> 06:03:59.638 align:start position:0%
of 100 instances an over collection that
 
06:04:01.590 --> 06:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
means you get a refund to the ratee
 
06:04:04.030 --> 06:04:04.040 align:start position:0%
payers so that's a benefit for the ratee
 
06:04:05.708 --> 06:04:05.718 align:start position:0%
payer to have it brought to the entire
 
06:04:08.750 --> 06:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
ire distribution Community however again
 
06:04:10.990 --> 06:04:11.000 align:start position:0%
this is information that we have
 
06:04:13.070 --> 06:04:13.080 align:start position:0%
developed internally and we're looking
 
06:04:15.390 --> 06:04:15.400 align:start position:0%
at but the utilities that are making
 
06:04:17.788 --> 06:04:17.798 align:start position:0%
these proposals have to justify these
 
06:04:19.750 --> 06:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
these positions themselves and they've
 
06:04:22.910 --> 06:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
brought very um compelling arguments
 
06:04:25.190 --> 06:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
there are of course compelling arguments
 
06:04:27.350 --> 06:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
against and we and the commission is
 
06:04:29.390 --> 06:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
very carefully examining those arguments
 
06:04:31.430 --> 06:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
one of the arguments is a socialization
 
06:04:33.270 --> 06:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
argument where you have two sets of rate
 
06:04:35.270 --> 06:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
pairs you've got the default service
 
06:04:35.280 --> 06:04:36.430 align:start position:0%
pairs you've got the default service
community

06:04:36.430 --> 06:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
community
 
06:04:38.910 --> 06:04:38.920 align:start position:0%
and then you have on the other hand the
 
06:04:41.030 --> 06:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
distribution rapay Community which is
 
06:04:43.190 --> 06:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
everybody one of the counter arguments
 
06:04:44.948 --> 06:04:44.958 align:start position:0%
again I'm just providing information
 
06:04:46.310 --> 06:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
that was presented to the commission I'm
 
06:04:48.468 --> 06:04:48.478 align:start position:0%
not aining on any of this one of the
 
06:04:51.670 --> 06:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
counter arguments is that well look
 
06:04:53.628 --> 06:04:53.638 align:start position:0%
anyone can go back onto default service
 
06:04:54.750 --> 06:04:54.760 align:start position:0%
if they're not happy with their
 
06:04:56.708 --> 06:04:56.718 align:start position:0%
competitive supplier if they're not
 
06:04:59.030 --> 06:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
happy with the terms of service uh one
 
06:05:00.628 --> 06:05:00.638 align:start position:0%
thing that's popped up in the competitor
 
06:05:02.150 --> 06:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
supplier Community some of your
 
06:05:04.390 --> 06:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
constituents may have heard about this
 
06:05:06.310 --> 06:05:06.320 align:start position:0%
is that you get a teaser rate and it's
 
06:05:08.110 --> 06:05:08.120 align:start position:0%
kind of like a balloon mortgage all of a
 
06:05:10.510 --> 06:05:10.520 align:start position:0%
sudden your rates start really going up
 
06:05:12.708 --> 06:05:12.718 align:start position:0%
well up until now you've been able to
 
06:05:15.230 --> 06:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
call uh Folks at the department of
 
06:05:17.150 --> 06:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
energy and maybe get some of that
 
06:05:18.788 --> 06:05:18.798 align:start position:0%
straighten out but in any event you're
 
06:05:20.510 --> 06:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
definitely able to go back onto default
 
06:05:22.430 --> 06:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
service at the first available
 
06:05:25.750 --> 06:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity so default service is a safe
 
06:05:28.948 --> 06:05:28.958 align:start position:0%
harbor it is uh meant to offer consumers
 
06:05:30.590 --> 06:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
a sense of certainty that yes
 
06:05:33.310 --> 06:05:33.320 align:start position:0%
competition is great um it's very good
 
06:05:36.948 --> 06:05:36.958 align:start position:0%
to Embark upon that but the incumbent
 
06:05:38.990 --> 06:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
utilities through the legislator's
 
06:05:42.110 --> 06:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
enactments are offering this to enable
 
06:05:44.190 --> 06:05:44.200 align:start position:0%
consumers a sense of security that no
 
06:05:45.868 --> 06:05:45.878 align:start position:0%
matter what they're able to have that
 
06:05:48.230 --> 06:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
six-month fix rate they're able to get
 
06:05:49.750 --> 06:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
that and they know that the Public
 
06:05:51.150 --> 06:05:51.160 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission and the department
 
06:05:54.868 --> 06:05:54.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:57.390 --> 06:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
structure okay one other quick question
 
06:06:00.670 --> 06:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
you mentioned some docket numbers the24
 
06:06:04.548 --> 06:06:04.558 align:start position:0%
d122 is an eversource docket uh yes
 
06:06:07.510 --> 06:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
24112 that's SCRC stranded cost
 
06:06:09.390 --> 06:06:09.400 align:start position:0%
reconciliation charge docket and that's
 
06:06:13.030 --> 06:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
under review so the the eversource
 
06:06:14.350 --> 06:06:14.360 align:start position:0%
company actually came up with this on
 
06:06:16.030 --> 06:06:16.040 align:start position:0%
their own and they came to the
 
06:06:17.190 --> 06:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
commission they said could you please
 
06:06:20.590 --> 06:06:20.600 align:start position:0%
review this proposal and we said okay
 
06:06:23.230 --> 06:06:23.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to have this moved over to
 
06:06:26.310 --> 06:06:26.320 align:start position:0%
to this part of the SCRC docket and
 
06:06:27.868 --> 06:06:27.878 align:start position:0%
we're going to have further process so
 
06:06:30.070 --> 06:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
there's interveners there's pros there's
 
06:06:32.310 --> 06:06:32.320 align:start position:0%
cons all the parties are coming to the
 
06:06:33.750 --> 06:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
table and they're going to be able to
 
06:06:35.990 --> 06:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
develop testimony and off for that to
 
06:06:38.230 --> 06:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
the commission for our consideration and
 
06:06:40.150 --> 06:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
no definitive rulings have been made on
 
06:06:42.510 --> 06:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
that were there docket numbers for
 
06:06:45.750 --> 06:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
Unitil and Liberty uh yes the uni till
 
06:06:48.788 --> 06:06:48.798 align:start position:0%
default service proposal where they made
 
06:06:51.830 --> 06:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
um that request regarding reconciliation
 
06:06:51.840 --> 06:06:53.230 align:start position:0%
um that request regarding reconciliation
is

06:06:53.230 --> 06:06:53.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:06:56.430 --> 06:06:56.440 align:start position:0%
24-65 the proposal was filed on February
 
06:06:56.440 --> 06:06:58.070 align:start position:0%
24-65 the proposal was filed on February
the

06:06:58.070 --> 06:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:07:00.788 --> 06:07:00.798 align:start position:0%
14th and so what how it was structured
 
06:07:03.350 --> 06:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
was uh the commission said you know
 
06:07:06.030 --> 06:07:06.040 align:start position:0%
based on what ever source is doing would
 
06:07:08.430 --> 06:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
you be able to assess whether it is
 
06:07:10.628 --> 06:07:10.638 align:start position:0%
reasonable to make such a proposal in
 
06:07:12.510 --> 06:07:12.520 align:start position:0%
your own structure and they responded in
 
06:07:14.910 --> 06:07:14.920 align:start position:0%
the affirmative and they did
 
06:07:17.990 --> 06:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
so okay additional questions for Mr
 
06:07:20.070 --> 06:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
spidel Tony
 
06:07:22.628 --> 06:07:22.638 align:start position:0%
Kaplan DAV chair and thank you Mr spidel
 
06:07:26.150 --> 06:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
for coming in U you you say that the puc
 
06:07:29.270 --> 06:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
has an open mind on this legislation uh
 
06:07:32.150 --> 06:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
and uh an open mind I presume on the the
 
06:07:34.628 --> 06:07:34.638 align:start position:0%
question about whether uh the idea
 
06:07:36.708 --> 06:07:36.718 align:start position:0%
behind legislation is actually
 
06:07:39.468 --> 06:07:39.478 align:start position:0%
beneficial to you know the state's
 
06:07:43.548 --> 06:07:43.558 align:start position:0%
interest um but you seem to be coming
 
06:07:46.590 --> 06:07:46.600 align:start position:0%
down on the side of protecting the
 
06:07:48.788 --> 06:07:48.798 align:start position:0%
utilities as a safe harbor as you call
 
06:07:51.670 --> 06:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
them um but I don't hear you say
 
06:07:55.708 --> 06:07:55.718 align:start position:0%
anything about opening up the utility
 
06:07:58.750 --> 06:07:58.760 align:start position:0%
space to Market forces which this bill
 
06:08:00.948 --> 06:08:00.958 align:start position:0%
to my mind seems to be doing it seems to
 
06:08:02.548 --> 06:08:02.558 align:start position:0%
be trying to F you
 
06:08:05.788 --> 06:08:05.798 align:start position:0%
know you know reset the market Market
 
06:08:07.910 --> 06:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
forces so that they're actually working
 
06:08:10.030 --> 06:08:10.040 align:start position:0%
in a fair way
 
06:08:13.110 --> 06:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
so how do you how do you reconcile those
 
06:08:15.590 --> 06:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
two interests the interest for Market
 
06:08:17.788 --> 06:08:17.798 align:start position:0%
reform and the interest for protecting
 
06:08:21.590 --> 06:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
the utility as a as a as a default Prov
 
06:08:23.750 --> 06:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
um could you be a little more specific
 
06:08:26.350 --> 06:08:26.360 align:start position:0%
in terms of how you're characterizing
 
06:08:28.708 --> 06:08:28.718 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to get us across because
 
06:08:31.350 --> 06:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
what I was trying to explain was that
 
06:08:33.510 --> 06:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
default service is a it's offered by the
 
06:08:36.070 --> 06:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
utilities not as a profit Center but
 
06:08:38.590 --> 06:08:38.600 align:start position:0%
it's just a pass through the idea behind
 
06:08:41.910 --> 06:08:41.920 align:start position:0%
it is that it's a service of Last Resort
 
06:08:44.628 --> 06:08:44.638 align:start position:0%
that whenever the consumer wants to go
 
06:08:46.430 --> 06:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
back to Homebase so to speak they can
 
06:08:47.788 --> 06:08:47.798 align:start position:0%
come back to home based the default
 
06:08:49.670 --> 06:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
service utilities make no profit off of
 
06:08:52.070 --> 06:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
it and the commission through its orders
 
06:08:54.788 --> 06:08:54.798 align:start position:0%
has encouraged the utilities to seek the
 
06:08:57.750 --> 06:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
lowest price wholesale price with no
 
06:09:01.628 --> 06:09:01.638 align:start position:0%
middleman to offer that benefit to the
 
06:09:03.990 --> 06:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
consumers so if you look at the pricing
 
06:09:06.628 --> 06:09:06.638 align:start position:0%
Trend over the the last three years is
 
06:09:11.468 --> 06:09:11.478 align:start position:0%
decidedly downward now uh if you were
 
06:09:13.750 --> 06:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
to talk about
 
06:09:16.590 --> 06:09:16.600 align:start position:0%
competition I would say that every
 
06:09:18.868 --> 06:09:18.878 align:start position:0%
competitive supplier has to figure out
 
06:09:21.510 --> 06:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
the market strategy for themselves the
 
06:09:23.910 --> 06:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
commission has nothing to do with that
 
06:09:25.708 --> 06:09:25.718 align:start position:0%
we we don't we don't manage the
 
06:09:28.030 --> 06:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
community power structure we only
 
06:09:29.910 --> 06:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
register the different plans that come
 
06:09:33.190 --> 06:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
through and we don't regulate the uh
 
06:09:35.990 --> 06:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
competitive thirdparty poter suppliers
 
06:09:37.628 --> 06:09:37.638 align:start position:0%
I mean not not to enter into a debate
 
06:09:38.990 --> 06:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
but I mean I'll just try to phrase this
 
06:09:41.830 --> 06:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
as a question don't you see that uh or
 
06:09:45.510 --> 06:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
would you would you not agree that by
 
06:09:47.070 --> 06:09:47.080 align:start position:0%
protecting the
 
06:09:51.030 --> 06:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
utilities risk in this manner you you're
 
06:09:53.830 --> 06:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
basically prejudicing uh competitive
 
06:09:55.948 --> 06:09:55.958 align:start position:0%
suppliers well the the question hasn't
 
06:09:57.948 --> 06:09:57.958 align:start position:0%
been definitively decided it's being
 
06:10:00.830 --> 06:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
adjudicated right now so I I I
 
06:10:03.310 --> 06:10:03.320 align:start position:0%
personally have no capability of of
 
06:10:05.430 --> 06:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
protecting anyone the commission will
 
06:10:07.350 --> 06:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
decide the the three Commissioners are
 
06:10:08.548 --> 06:10:08.558 align:start position:0%
going to hear the
 
06:10:11.390 --> 06:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
arguments and they are keenly interested
 
06:10:14.510 --> 06:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
in this area and there's a lot of I
 
06:10:17.390 --> 06:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
would imagine uh debate and interest in
 
06:10:18.830 --> 06:10:18.840 align:start position:0%
the regulatory Community we've been
 
06:10:20.910 --> 06:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
getting a lot of filings on it and I'm
 
06:10:23.510 --> 06:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
sure we'll get a lot of testimony and
 
06:10:26.670 --> 06:10:26.680 align:start position:0%
interesting data points to ponder but I
 
06:10:28.430 --> 06:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
would say that it's a live issue at the
 
06:10:31.430 --> 06:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
commission right now for this winter and
 
06:10:33.548 --> 06:10:33.558 align:start position:0%
spring it hasn't been decided
 
06:10:37.150 --> 06:10:37.160 align:start position:0%
definitively and perhaps if once the
 
06:10:39.070 --> 06:10:39.080 align:start position:0%
commission rules if the legislature
 
06:10:40.990 --> 06:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
wishes to revisit the issue that would
 
06:10:43.670 --> 06:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
be another matter but um I would
 
06:10:47.110 --> 06:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
recommend to the committee that give the
 
06:10:49.030 --> 06:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
commission a chance to go through its
 
06:10:51.430 --> 06:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
process to enable the participants and
 
06:10:53.708 --> 06:10:53.718 align:start position:0%
the parties to make their arguments for
 
06:10:56.190 --> 06:10:56.200 align:start position:0%
the commission to make its assessment
 
06:11:00.430 --> 06:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
and perhaps to see how things
 
06:11:05.390 --> 06:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:07.350 --> 06:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
representative McGee I think I have a
 
06:11:09.590 --> 06:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
question hi Mr spidel how are you very
 
06:11:13.948 --> 06:11:13.958 align:start position:0%
well thank you good thanks um so I I
 
06:11:16.910 --> 06:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
guess where I want to go with this is it
 
06:11:19.270 --> 06:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
your testimony has brought us to in my
 
06:11:20.628 --> 06:11:20.638 align:start position:0%
mind a different place than where we
 
06:11:24.190 --> 06:11:24.200 align:start position:0%
started with testimony on the bill and I
 
06:11:26.110 --> 06:11:26.120 align:start position:0%
understand there's quite a bit going on
 
06:11:29.708 --> 06:11:29.718 align:start position:0%
um relative to stranded charge proposals
 
06:11:31.510 --> 06:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
with the osaurus case and I wrote down
 
06:11:33.548 --> 06:11:33.558 align:start position:0%
all the other cases that are currently
 
06:11:36.310 --> 06:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
pending that deal with this question but
 
06:11:38.230 --> 06:11:38.240 align:start position:0%
to get back to the original intent of
 
06:11:38.240 --> 06:11:39.750 align:start position:0%
to get back to the original intent of
the

06:11:39.750 --> 06:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:11:42.868 --> 06:11:42.878 align:start position:0%
bill uh it it sounded to me as though
 
06:11:47.468 --> 06:11:47.478 align:start position:0%
the concern was that uh Under and Over
 
06:11:49.948 --> 06:11:49.958 align:start position:0%
charges would be socialized across
 
06:11:52.030 --> 06:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
customers who were not necessarily on
 
06:11:54.270 --> 06:11:54.280 align:start position:0%
default service right that that was one
 
06:11:56.190 --> 06:11:56.200 align:start position:0%
of the things that it sought to
 
06:11:56.200 --> 06:11:57.948 align:start position:0%
of the things that it sought to
address

06:11:57.948 --> 06:11:57.958 align:start position:0%
address
 
06:12:02.468 --> 06:12:02.478 align:start position:0%
so I so the question is
 
06:12:05.270 --> 06:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh is that something that the public
 
06:12:07.510 --> 06:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
ities commission is actually about to
 
06:12:11.070 --> 06:12:11.080 align:start position:0%
respond to or is there any U end in
 
06:12:12.788 --> 06:12:12.798 align:start position:0%
sight for when we will have an
 
06:12:14.750 --> 06:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
understanding of whether those costs
 
06:12:16.468 --> 06:12:16.478 align:start position:0%
should be borne by all customers
 
06:12:18.270 --> 06:12:18.280 align:start position:0%
including people who are not on default
 
06:12:20.990 --> 06:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
Service uh yes there will be decisions
 
06:12:24.110 --> 06:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
rendered relatively soon so Unitil has
 
06:12:26.390 --> 06:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
requested that a ruling be rendered by
 
06:12:30.590 --> 06:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
early April okay and in the ever
 
06:12:33.110 --> 06:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
instance uh again the hearing is on May
 
06:12:36.150 --> 06:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
the 8th so those are two firm timelines
 
06:12:38.390 --> 06:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
that you can hang your hat on Liberty
 
06:12:40.830 --> 06:12:40.840 align:start position:0%
again uh Liberty has taken an approach
 
06:12:42.390 --> 06:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
with the commission where they're more
 
06:12:44.910 --> 06:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
open-ended in terms of they don't make
 
06:12:46.830 --> 06:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
them directional petitions but they
 
06:12:48.628 --> 06:12:48.638 align:start position:0%
throw out ideas for the commission's
 
06:12:50.868 --> 06:12:50.878 align:start position:0%
consideration in the default service
 
06:12:54.030 --> 06:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
context uh they've been I would say in
 
06:12:58.390 --> 06:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
some ways uh they've been kind of a a
 
06:13:01.110 --> 06:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
Pathfinder in offering solutions to the
 
06:13:03.110 --> 06:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
commission for example when the
 
06:13:05.548 --> 06:13:05.558 align:start position:0%
2022 Market Panic happened happened in
 
06:13:07.548 --> 06:13:07.558 align:start position:0%
Western Europe as a partly as a
 
06:13:10.868 --> 06:13:10.878 align:start position:0%
consequence of events in Eastern Europe
 
06:13:13.310 --> 06:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
uh Liberty's Personnel offered to the
 
06:13:15.468 --> 06:13:15.478 align:start position:0%
commission uh Insight regarding what was
 
06:13:17.468 --> 06:13:17.478 align:start position:0%
going on in their Affiliates in the
 
06:13:19.270 --> 06:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
midwest with direct Market procurement
 
06:13:21.830 --> 06:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
having been successful and also they
 
06:13:23.590 --> 06:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
were warning us of the potential for
 
06:13:25.070 --> 06:13:25.080 align:start position:0%
what is called a failed auction on the
 
06:13:27.990 --> 06:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
fixed price side of things and in fact
 
06:13:30.310 --> 06:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
they suffered a situation that initially
 
06:13:32.390 --> 06:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
they found no takers for the fixed price
 
06:13:34.868 --> 06:13:34.878 align:start position:0%
contracts because things were so tight
 
06:13:36.350 --> 06:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
that things were tight on Wall Street
 
06:13:38.990 --> 06:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
things were tight in Calgary and Houston
 
06:13:40.750 --> 06:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
and all these places where they decide
 
06:13:43.628 --> 06:13:43.638 align:start position:0%
these things the the Panic Abad but the
 
06:13:47.510 --> 06:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
idea lived on and so uh I think the
 
06:13:49.350 --> 06:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
definite directional thing for two of
 
06:13:52.430 --> 06:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
the investor own utilities I would say
 
06:13:53.990 --> 06:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
by the end of May you'll know what's
 
06:13:56.230 --> 06:13:56.240 align:start position:0%
going on and of course there's scope for
 
06:13:58.670 --> 06:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
rehearing and things like that but end
 
06:14:02.510 --> 06:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
of May early June and followup followup
 
06:14:04.310 --> 06:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
the last thing I'd like to understand
 
06:14:09.230 --> 06:14:09.240 align:start position:0%
better is the idea of protecting the
 
06:14:12.390 --> 06:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
default service providers I I think we
 
06:14:14.948 --> 06:14:14.958 align:start position:0%
all agree that we want default service
 
06:14:17.110 --> 06:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
to be to continue to be a back stop for
 
06:14:19.868 --> 06:14:19.878 align:start position:0%
customers if they go into the supply
 
06:14:23.788 --> 06:14:23.798 align:start position:0%
market and then want to retreat back or
 
06:14:25.150 --> 06:14:25.160 align:start position:0%
uh they find that they're not getting
 
06:14:26.910 --> 06:14:26.920 align:start position:0%
the value that they're hoping to with
 
06:14:28.270 --> 06:14:28.280 align:start position:0%
the whoever they're using for their
 
06:14:29.868 --> 06:14:29.878 align:start position:0%
supply and they they want to be able to
 
06:14:31.628 --> 06:14:31.638 align:start position:0%
go back to a default service provider we
 
06:14:34.390 --> 06:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
want that to be preserved but I I'm not
 
06:14:35.750 --> 06:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
really sure
 
06:14:37.430 --> 06:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
I understand the argument for how that
 
06:14:39.230 --> 06:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
is in any way threatened by the fact
 
06:14:40.628 --> 06:14:40.638 align:start position:0%
that there would be other competitors in
 
06:14:42.070 --> 06:14:42.080 align:start position:0%
the market I wonder if you could maybe
 
06:14:45.670 --> 06:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
speak to that a little bit um well to be
 
06:14:48.468 --> 06:14:48.478 align:start position:0%
honest uh when in reading the language
 
06:14:50.390 --> 06:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh there's there's not much having to do
 
06:14:53.350 --> 06:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
with expanding the competitive framework
 
06:14:55.548 --> 06:14:55.558 align:start position:0%
it's just uh you get rid of those three
 
06:14:58.310 --> 06:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
Provisions essentially renewable energy
 
06:15:01.190 --> 06:15:01.200 align:start position:0%
default Services gone alternative means
 
06:15:03.468 --> 06:15:03.478 align:start position:0%
of providing default Services gone under
 
06:15:05.390 --> 06:15:05.400 align:start position:0%
part two of the bill which again the
 
06:15:06.990 --> 06:15:07.000 align:start position:0%
commission thinks is pretty important
 
06:15:09.270 --> 06:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
given in the world in which we exist and
 
06:15:12.990 --> 06:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
the first thing is is that you have the
 
06:15:15.150 --> 06:15:15.160 align:start position:0%
the theory of default service that's
 
06:15:16.750 --> 06:15:16.760 align:start position:0%
presented under Part
 
06:15:19.788 --> 06:15:19.798 align:start position:0%
D and I took off my sticky which is
 
06:15:23.270 --> 06:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
always a dangerous a dangerous angle but
 
06:15:25.628 --> 06:15:25.638 align:start position:0%
uh the commission should establish
 
06:15:27.708 --> 06:15:27.718 align:start position:0%
default service appropriate to the
 
06:15:29.430 --> 06:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
particular circumstances of each
 
06:15:32.310 --> 06:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional utility so it kind of it
 
06:15:34.030 --> 06:15:34.040 align:start position:0%
gets rid of the language that enables
 
06:15:35.990 --> 06:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
the commission to tailor things to
 
06:15:37.590 --> 06:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
different companies so you have
 
06:15:39.230 --> 06:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
eversource which is very big they have a
 
06:15:41.670 --> 06:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
lot of Market power in terms of being
 
06:15:43.230 --> 06:15:43.240 align:start position:0%
able to go out on the markets and say
 
06:15:44.750 --> 06:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
hey we're serving this Billion Dollar
 
06:15:46.750 --> 06:15:46.760 align:start position:0%
Plus load can we can we make a deal
 
06:15:48.468 --> 06:15:48.478 align:start position:0%
that's what they do during their uh
 
06:15:52.468 --> 06:15:52.478 align:start position:0%
bidding but for our smaller uh investor
 
06:15:55.150 --> 06:15:55.160 align:start position:0%
owned utilities the participation space
 
06:15:57.270 --> 06:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
of sellers is getting smaller for these
 
06:15:59.070 --> 06:15:59.080 align:start position:0%
fixed contracts it's not as big as it
 
06:16:01.910 --> 06:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
used to be and as part of that there is
 
06:16:03.708 --> 06:16:03.718 align:start position:0%
a lot of what is called migration not
 
06:16:06.310 --> 06:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
only to third party supply suppers but
 
06:16:09.270 --> 06:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
also to uh the community aggregation
 
06:16:10.948 --> 06:16:10.958 align:start position:0%
structure and that's and that's fine
 
06:16:14.230 --> 06:16:14.240 align:start position:0%
that's that's okay but they're kind of
 
06:16:15.948 --> 06:16:15.958 align:start position:0%
the World At Large is telling us you
 
06:16:18.190 --> 06:16:18.200 align:start position:0%
know why would we bid on a fixed price
 
06:16:20.190 --> 06:16:20.200 align:start position:0%
contract on a smaller and smaller piece
 
06:16:22.390 --> 06:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
of the pie because you have so many
 
06:16:25.948 --> 06:16:25.958 align:start position:0%
towns and cities moving off so we're
 
06:16:27.830 --> 06:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
just trying TOA we're just trying to
 
06:16:30.628 --> 06:16:30.638 align:start position:0%
alert the legislature that certainly
 
06:16:33.390 --> 06:16:33.400 align:start position:0%
part two of the bill uh we want to
 
06:16:34.868 --> 06:16:34.878 align:start position:0%
remain Nimble we want to keep those
 
06:16:36.868 --> 06:16:36.878 align:start position:0%
authorities in place they've worked well
 
06:16:38.990 --> 06:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
and under part one of the bill give us a
 
06:16:41.110 --> 06:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
chance to adjudicate the issue the
 
06:16:43.190 --> 06:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
legislature always has the capability to
 
06:16:45.948 --> 06:16:45.958 align:start position:0%
revisit issues uh and has in the past
 
06:16:48.430 --> 06:16:48.440 align:start position:0%
based on adjudications that might not
 
06:16:50.548 --> 06:16:50.558 align:start position:0%
sit well but I would say in this
 
06:16:53.230 --> 06:16:53.240 align:start position:0%
instance uh the commission has been
 
06:16:55.270 --> 06:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
taking an Eagle Eye to this issue and
 
06:16:58.548 --> 06:16:58.558 align:start position:0%
really is very focused on this right now
 
06:17:01.110 --> 06:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
thank you that's very helpful thank you
 
06:17:01.120 --> 06:17:02.390 align:start position:0%
thank you that's very helpful thank you
further

06:17:02.390 --> 06:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
further
 
06:17:04.430 --> 06:17:04.440 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none I want to thank
 
06:17:06.310 --> 06:17:06.320 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony and call Matt
 
06:17:19.670 --> 06:17:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:22.110 --> 06:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
energy guess we've kept you busy today
 
06:17:24.830 --> 06:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
huh yeah good to see everybody again
 
06:17:25.868 --> 06:17:25.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
06:17:27.350 --> 06:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
committee for the record Matt Young from
 
06:17:28.670 --> 06:17:28.680 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of
 
06:17:32.948 --> 06:17:32.958 align:start position:0%
energy um the uh department is um
 
06:17:34.868 --> 06:17:34.878 align:start position:0%
neutral on this bill but we do Echo the
 
06:17:36.150 --> 06:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
concerns of the Public Utilities
 
06:17:38.788 --> 06:17:38.798 align:start position:0%
Commission uh that you just heard um
 
06:17:42.590 --> 06:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
prior to me coming up here um I think
 
06:17:45.310 --> 06:17:45.320 align:start position:0%
that it's important to note that this is
 
06:17:47.030 --> 06:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
as as just heard sort of at length um I
 
06:17:49.948 --> 06:17:49.958 align:start position:0%
won't go too much into it that this is a
 
06:17:52.310 --> 06:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh focus of an active adjudication um
 
06:17:53.708 --> 06:17:53.718 align:start position:0%
and I I mentioned this earlier but
 
06:17:56.590 --> 06:17:56.600 align:start position:0%
there's quite a bit of of uh information
 
06:17:58.670 --> 06:17:58.680 align:start position:0%
and back and forth that goes on in those
 
06:18:02.670 --> 06:18:02.680 align:start position:0%
um those adjudications and uh that doc
 
06:18:05.548 --> 06:18:05.558 align:start position:0%
it includes Reams and reams of um sworn
 
06:18:09.190 --> 06:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
sworn uh statements testimony um filings
 
06:18:11.708 --> 06:18:11.718 align:start position:0%
uh that would uh help maybe provide a
 
06:18:13.430 --> 06:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
little more context on kind of what the
 
06:18:14.510 --> 06:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
issue is here
 
06:18:17.868 --> 06:18:17.878 align:start position:0%
today um and then next you know it's
 
06:18:21.468 --> 06:18:21.478 align:start position:0%
it's sort of been talked about um sort
 
06:18:23.270 --> 06:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
of in questions and testimony here this
 
06:18:24.030 --> 06:18:24.040 align:start position:0%
uh this
 
06:18:26.788 --> 06:18:26.798 align:start position:0%
afternoon um but I think what's maybe
 
06:18:30.070 --> 06:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
getting lost is uh just the the first
 
06:18:32.830 --> 06:18:32.840 align:start position:0%
part of the uh sub paragraph C there
 
06:18:33.948 --> 06:18:33.958 align:start position:0%
that a default service should be
 
06:18:36.990 --> 06:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
designed to be a safe net and chairman
 
06:18:37.788 --> 06:18:37.798 align:start position:0%
Vose I think you asked one of the
 
06:18:39.868 --> 06:18:39.878 align:start position:0%
speakers earlier whether the utilities
 
06:18:41.830 --> 06:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
um or the commission have have a duty to
 
06:18:43.230 --> 06:18:43.240 align:start position:0%
protect that um and I think that's an
 
06:18:44.468 --> 06:18:44.478 align:start position:0%
important question that this uh
 
06:18:46.030 --> 06:18:46.040 align:start position:0%
committee should consider in this
 
06:18:49.430 --> 06:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
legislation um you know as as a safety
 
06:18:52.868 --> 06:18:52.878 align:start position:0%
net um Pro as a last resort sort of
 
06:18:55.390 --> 06:18:55.400 align:start position:0%
option for for everybody that's that's
 
06:18:57.310 --> 06:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
um kind of very important consideration
 
06:18:59.390 --> 06:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
and one of the previous um speakers they
 
06:19:01.868 --> 06:19:01.878 align:start position:0%
ask the question will this raise rates
 
06:19:03.390 --> 06:19:03.400 align:start position:0%
and the answer is this will raise rates
 
06:19:05.670 --> 06:19:05.680 align:start position:0%
for people on default service
 
06:19:07.750 --> 06:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
and with that what the department is
 
06:19:10.868 --> 06:19:10.878 align:start position:0%
concerned about is a sort of default
 
06:19:13.230 --> 06:19:13.240 align:start position:0%
service death spiral and what I mean by
 
06:19:17.510 --> 06:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
that is as costs go up for default
 
06:19:20.390 --> 06:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
Service rates and people leave default
 
06:19:22.948 --> 06:19:22.958 align:start position:0%
service and go to competitive suppliers
 
06:19:25.310 --> 06:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
um Community power whether towns adopt
 
06:19:28.788 --> 06:19:28.798 align:start position:0%
uh the community power um program that
 
06:19:31.110 --> 06:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
leaves certain customers on default
 
06:19:32.990 --> 06:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
service and they can remain on default
 
06:19:34.430 --> 06:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
service for any number of reasons it
 
06:19:36.468 --> 06:19:36.478 align:start position:0%
could be um you know lack of
 
06:19:39.868 --> 06:19:39.878 align:start position:0%
sophistication in energy markets um
 
06:19:42.510 --> 06:19:42.520 align:start position:0%
inability to obtain competitive Supply
 
06:19:45.270 --> 06:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
like a credit could be anything
 
06:19:48.270 --> 06:19:48.280 align:start position:0%
and by that term default service death
 
06:19:50.430 --> 06:19:50.440 align:start position:0%
spiral eventually it'll only be only a
 
06:19:52.910 --> 06:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
few people left on that default service
 
06:19:54.910 --> 06:19:54.920 align:start position:0%
and if all of these charges are to go
 
06:19:56.510 --> 06:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
onto those
 
06:19:59.190 --> 06:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
few that's a that's a burden that that I
 
06:20:01.510 --> 06:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
think um we should be considering as as
 
06:20:05.350 --> 06:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:08.590 --> 06:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
um the other um sort of aspect that has
 
06:20:09.830 --> 06:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
been discussed today that I just wanted
 
06:20:11.990 --> 06:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
to touch on was sort of this idea of
 
06:20:15.750 --> 06:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
default Service as a a competition um
 
06:20:17.390 --> 06:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not sure that that was sort
 
06:20:20.230 --> 06:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
of the intent of this safety net of uh
 
06:20:21.708 --> 06:20:21.718 align:start position:0%
default service that the legislature
 
06:20:23.670 --> 06:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
laid out and restructuring um the
 
06:20:23.680 --> 06:20:25.030 align:start position:0%
laid out and restructuring um the
utilities

06:20:25.030 --> 06:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
06:20:27.510 --> 06:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
are I guess to put it in simple terms
 
06:20:30.310 --> 06:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
they're ordered to PR to prefer to
 
06:20:32.708 --> 06:20:32.718 align:start position:0%
provide default service in a certain way
 
06:20:37.070 --> 06:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
and they do it um it's not necessarily
 
06:20:40.468 --> 06:20:40.478 align:start position:0%
a competition for them as I I believe Mr
 
06:20:42.150 --> 06:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
spidal testified to it's it's just a
 
06:20:43.628 --> 06:20:43.638 align:start position:0%
pass through they don't earn a profit on
 
06:20:46.788 --> 06:20:46.798 align:start position:0%
this um so I think kind of framing that
 
06:20:48.590 --> 06:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
that uh this competition competitive
 
06:20:49.868 --> 06:20:49.878 align:start position:0%
markets of default service I think that
 
06:20:52.708 --> 06:20:52.718 align:start position:0%
needs to be taken into account as
 
06:20:52.718 --> 06:20:56.468 align:start position:0%
needs to be taken into account as
well

06:20:56.468 --> 06:20:56.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:58.868 --> 06:20:58.878 align:start position:0%
um I think that is all the notes I had
 
06:21:01.030 --> 06:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
for today happy to answer any
 
06:21:06.628 --> 06:21:06.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:08.788 --> 06:21:08.798 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very
 
06:21:12.030 --> 06:21:12.040 align:start position:0%
much next we'll ask Mr Michael Lata from
 
06:21:20.628 --> 06:21:20.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:23.390 --> 06:21:23.400 align:start position:0%
legislation welcome
 
06:21:26.070 --> 06:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
back we've kept you busy today too
 
06:21:28.190 --> 06:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
haven't we well I suppose you've all
 
06:21:31.990 --> 06:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
been busy as well um thank you uh again
 
06:21:35.110 --> 06:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
Michael Lata uh representing eversource
 
06:21:37.750 --> 06:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
energy uh appreciate the opportunity to
 
06:21:40.910 --> 06:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
testify uh ever source is is opposed to
 
06:21:45.110 --> 06:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
the bill um before you today um I won't
 
06:21:46.708 --> 06:21:46.718 align:start position:0%
be duplicative with a lot of the
 
06:21:49.030 --> 06:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
comments that um were raised by the
 
06:21:50.390 --> 06:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission and
 
06:21:52.548 --> 06:21:52.558 align:start position:0%
Department of energy uh but I did want
 
06:21:56.270 --> 06:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
to highlight one or two uh two issues so
 
06:22:00.670 --> 06:22:00.680 align:start position:0%
um first again uh as a base issue we
 
06:22:02.628 --> 06:22:02.638 align:start position:0%
certainly agree that this is a very
 
06:22:05.030 --> 06:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
active adjudication currently before the
 
06:22:07.510 --> 06:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission uh there are
 
06:22:09.830 --> 06:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
technical sessions that have been held
 
06:22:12.990 --> 06:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
there is a a hearing scheduled uh and so
 
06:22:15.390 --> 06:22:15.400 align:start position:0%
our view is that uh the legislature
 
06:22:17.990 --> 06:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
should not intervene and short circuit
 
06:22:20.030 --> 06:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
that regulatory process but instead
 
06:22:22.628 --> 06:22:22.638 align:start position:0%
allow the commission The Authority uh to
 
06:22:24.390 --> 06:22:24.400 align:start position:0%
to make a determination based upon the
 
06:22:26.310 --> 06:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
merits presented before it by the
 
06:22:30.150 --> 06:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
various parties um in regards to the
 
06:22:32.670 --> 06:22:32.680 align:start position:0%
utility role in providing default
 
06:22:35.270 --> 06:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
Service uh so the first thing I would
 
06:22:40.150 --> 06:22:40.160 align:start position:0%
say is uh as has been said utilities are
 
06:22:42.590 --> 06:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
uh do not profit on the provision of
 
06:22:44.468 --> 06:22:44.478 align:start position:0%
default service we are completely
 
06:22:47.868 --> 06:22:47.878 align:start position:0%
agnostic as to whether our uh customers
 
06:22:50.628 --> 06:22:50.638 align:start position:0%
take default service or get their energy
 
06:22:52.868 --> 06:22:52.878 align:start position:0%
Supply from a third party or Community
 
06:22:56.150 --> 06:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
aggregator aggregation in fact uh when
 
06:22:59.070 --> 06:22:59.080 align:start position:0%
we do have a change in rates uh we
 
06:23:02.150 --> 06:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
actively promote third-party options to
 
06:23:04.788 --> 06:23:04.798 align:start position:0%
our customers uh as a way that they can
 
06:23:06.510 --> 06:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
achieve savings whether that's through
 
06:23:09.868 --> 06:23:09.878 align:start position:0%
long-term contracts available to them or
 
06:23:11.230 --> 06:23:11.240 align:start position:0%
uh or different offerings in the
 
06:23:13.628 --> 06:23:13.638 align:start position:0%
marketplace that the utility cannot uh
 
06:23:16.430 --> 06:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
offer um as has been said the utilities
 
06:23:19.110 --> 06:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
are ordered by the Public Utilities
 
06:23:21.310 --> 06:23:21.320 align:start position:0%
Commission to procure default service in
 
06:23:24.628 --> 06:23:24.638 align:start position:0%
a very specific manner uh in response to
 
06:23:27.990 --> 06:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
the price spikes in 2022 and
 
06:23:31.510 --> 06:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
2023 largely caused by the the war in
 
06:23:34.628 --> 06:23:34.638 align:start position:0%
Ukraine the Public Utilities Commission
 
06:23:37.788 --> 06:23:37.798 align:start position:0%
uh focused very much on uh the the
 
06:23:40.830 --> 06:23:40.840 align:start position:0%
concept of a risk premium that utilities
 
06:23:42.830 --> 06:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
through our default service procurements
 
06:23:44.910 --> 06:23:44.920 align:start position:0%
where we would go out every six months
 
06:23:46.948 --> 06:23:46.958 align:start position:0%
procure load following energy for all
 
06:23:48.788 --> 06:23:48.798 align:start position:0%
default service customers at a fixed
 
06:23:51.350 --> 06:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
price that the suppliers who were
 
06:23:54.190 --> 06:23:54.200 align:start position:0%
responding to that were building in a
 
06:23:57.110 --> 06:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
risk premium uh because they did not
 
06:23:59.150 --> 06:23:59.160 align:start position:0%
want to get caught short in the market
 
06:24:01.468 --> 06:24:01.478 align:start position:0%
if the market rates again spiked as they
 
06:24:04.430 --> 06:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
did uh in response to the Ukraine war
 
06:24:06.868 --> 06:24:06.878 align:start position:0%
the supplier would be financially harmed
 
06:24:09.070 --> 06:24:09.080 align:start position:0%
so they would build in a risk premium
 
06:24:12.468 --> 06:24:12.478 align:start position:0%
into the the responses they're you know
 
06:24:14.390 --> 06:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
acting responsibly and protecting their
 
06:24:16.390 --> 06:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
financial interest as as any company
 
06:24:21.070 --> 06:24:21.080 align:start position:0%
would um so to get at that issue uh the
 
06:24:24.230 --> 06:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
utilities were were directed uh by the
 
06:24:25.708 --> 06:24:25.718 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission and you
 
06:24:27.708 --> 06:24:27.718 align:start position:0%
heard commissioner chattai speak at
 
06:24:30.788 --> 06:24:30.798 align:start position:0%
length about this during the orientation
 
06:24:33.350 --> 06:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
to procure a certain portion of default
 
06:24:35.868 --> 06:24:35.878 align:start position:0%
service from directly from the market
 
06:24:38.070 --> 06:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
term self- Supply uh but what
 
06:24:40.070 --> 06:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
essentially is is making uh real-time
 
06:24:43.390 --> 06:24:43.400 align:start position:0%
dayhe head uh purchases on behalf of of
 
06:24:46.910 --> 06:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
our customers uh and so uh at first we
 
06:24:50.868 --> 06:24:50.878 align:start position:0%
were directed to procure uh 12 a half%
 
06:24:53.150 --> 06:24:53.160 align:start position:0%
uh into the marketplace uh that was the
 
06:24:55.310 --> 06:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
last rate period this current rate
 
06:24:59.150 --> 06:24:59.160 align:start position:0%
period uh it's 30% and uh there's talk
 
06:25:02.390 --> 06:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
there's uh dire direction to go uh
 
06:25:06.270 --> 06:25:06.280 align:start position:0%
potentially up to 50% so half uh in the
 
06:25:09.350 --> 06:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
market how that's done is uh because
 
06:25:11.310 --> 06:25:11.320 align:start position:0%
obviously the rates don't fluctuate
 
06:25:14.430 --> 06:25:14.440 align:start position:0%
every day every week every month uh we
 
06:25:17.830 --> 06:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
set a proxy price for what we believe uh
 
06:25:20.990 --> 06:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
the market cost will be over that term
 
06:25:23.628 --> 06:25:23.638 align:start position:0%
and the way that that market price uh
 
06:25:27.030 --> 06:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
was set was again directed by the Public
 
06:25:28.788 --> 06:25:28.798 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission it was not
 
06:25:32.230 --> 06:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
something developed by the utilities so
 
06:25:35.070 --> 06:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
we have a construct where our regulator
 
06:25:36.948 --> 06:25:36.958 align:start position:0%
has told us we have to make Market
 
06:25:39.750 --> 06:25:39.760 align:start position:0%
purchases we have to set a market price
 
06:25:43.310 --> 06:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
based upon uh their specific criteria
 
06:25:46.430 --> 06:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
and so that is is how we are providing
 
06:25:49.948 --> 06:25:49.958 align:start position:0%
default service today and so if the cost
 
06:25:52.948 --> 06:25:52.958 align:start position:0%
of the actual procurement exceeds or is
 
06:25:56.430 --> 06:25:56.440 align:start position:0%
less than that proxy market price uh at
 
06:26:00.510 --> 06:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
the end of each year we reconcile that
 
06:26:02.708 --> 06:26:02.718 align:start position:0%
uh and so what we have proposed and is
 
06:26:04.468 --> 06:26:04.478 align:start position:0%
currently before the public utility
 
06:26:07.430 --> 06:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
commission is that because in our view
 
06:26:10.190 --> 06:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
all customers benefit from the provision
 
06:26:13.390 --> 06:26:13.400 align:start position:0%
of default service whether they it is a
 
06:26:16.750 --> 06:26:16.760 align:start position:0%
as been discussed a safety net a back
 
06:26:19.310 --> 06:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
stop if customers for creditworthiness
 
06:26:21.910 --> 06:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
or for another reason uh aren't able to
 
06:26:24.590 --> 06:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
access thirdparty Supply default service
 
06:26:26.788 --> 06:26:26.798 align:start position:0%
is there for them if a supplier is
 
06:26:29.830 --> 06:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
unable to fill its obligations uh and
 
06:26:32.030 --> 06:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
those customers have to come back to
 
06:26:34.548 --> 06:26:34.558 align:start position:0%
default service it is there for them and
 
06:26:37.110 --> 06:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
so in our view all customers do receive
 
06:26:39.430 --> 06:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
a benefit of that essentially social
 
06:26:41.868 --> 06:26:41.878 align:start position:0%
safety net that default service provides
 
06:26:44.390 --> 06:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
and so we felt it was appropriate to
 
06:26:47.548 --> 06:26:47.558 align:start position:0%
flow that over or under recovery back to
 
06:26:50.310 --> 06:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
to all customers uh through a non
 
06:26:53.030 --> 06:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
bypassable charge uh I do want to point
 
06:26:56.990 --> 06:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
out just two other quick things um uh
 
06:27:00.310 --> 06:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
with the bill one
 
06:27:03.468 --> 06:27:03.478 align:start position:0%
is if you see this through to a a
 
06:27:06.548 --> 06:27:06.558 align:start position:0%
possible pathetical where the utility
 
06:27:08.788 --> 06:27:08.798 align:start position:0%
has been directed to make these
 
06:27:11.750 --> 06:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
procurements and there is an under uh
 
06:27:14.510 --> 06:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
recovery and because we have been
 
06:27:17.910 --> 06:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
directed by puc order those procurements
 
06:27:20.190 --> 06:27:20.200 align:start position:0%
are deemed just and reasonable and
 
06:27:23.430 --> 06:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
prudent if to use the hypothetical that
 
06:27:26.310 --> 06:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
the department of energy used we had a a
 
06:27:28.270 --> 06:27:28.280 align:start position:0%
default service death spiral and all
 
06:27:31.230 --> 06:27:31.240 align:start position:0%
customers had left default service this
 
06:27:33.590 --> 06:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
bill would prohibit us from being able
 
06:27:35.868 --> 06:27:35.878 align:start position:0%
to recover those prudently incurred
 
06:27:38.750 --> 06:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
costs from another portion of the bill
 
06:27:41.468 --> 06:27:41.478 align:start position:0%
which would create uh essentially an
 
06:27:43.868 --> 06:27:43.878 align:start position:0%
illegal construct it has been found by
 
06:27:45.948 --> 06:27:45.958 align:start position:0%
the United States Supreme Court that
 
06:27:48.750 --> 06:27:48.760 align:start position:0%
utilities are entitled to recover
 
06:27:51.510 --> 06:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
prudently incurred costs um the other
 
06:27:53.830 --> 06:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
issue that I just wanted to to flag and
 
06:27:55.910 --> 06:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
this is more specific is just kind of
 
06:28:00.030 --> 06:28:00.040 align:start position:0%
the arbitrary nature of lines uh 12 and
 
06:28:04.350 --> 06:28:04.360 align:start position:0%
13 that utilities must recover the these
 
06:28:06.670 --> 06:28:06.680 align:start position:0%
over collections uh through default
 
06:28:10.310 --> 06:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
Service rates over no more than one year
 
06:28:12.868 --> 06:28:12.878 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not sure what the Genesis of that
 
06:28:16.110 --> 06:28:16.120 align:start position:0%
language is what benefit it provides uh
 
06:28:18.110 --> 06:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
but it seems to be taking a significant
 
06:28:20.230 --> 06:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
amount of flexibility even if the bill
 
06:28:23.628 --> 06:28:23.638 align:start position:0%
were to go forward away from the Public
 
06:28:24.990 --> 06:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission to make a
 
06:28:27.110 --> 06:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
determination of the best way to recover
 
06:28:30.110 --> 06:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
these charges to benefit customers uh
 
06:28:32.708 --> 06:28:32.718 align:start position:0%
and so with that uh happy to answer any
 
06:28:38.150 --> 06:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:40.708 --> 06:28:40.718 align:start position:0%
do you have an alternative time period
 
06:28:44.110 --> 06:28:44.120 align:start position:0%
to suggest or do you just think that
 
06:28:46.548 --> 06:28:46.558 align:start position:0%
that should be left up to the commission
 
06:28:48.350 --> 06:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
we're opposed to the bill as a as a
 
06:28:49.590 --> 06:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
whole and don't think that it should
 
06:28:52.670 --> 06:28:52.680 align:start position:0%
move forward but uh we do think if if it
 
06:28:54.948 --> 06:28:54.958 align:start position:0%
were to move forward uh there should not
 
06:28:57.708 --> 06:28:57.718 align:start position:0%
be a time period it should be left to
 
06:28:59.270 --> 06:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
the commission to make that
 
06:29:01.868 --> 06:29:01.878 align:start position:0%
determination thank you further
 
06:29:06.750 --> 06:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:08.310 --> 06:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
representative Mickey it's sort of a
 
06:29:09.788 --> 06:29:09.798 align:start position:0%
follow on to yours it's another thought
 
06:29:11.190 --> 06:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
that I'm having on the same thing which
 
06:29:14.270 --> 06:29:14.280 align:start position:0%
is we're saying maybe the commission
 
06:29:15.868 --> 06:29:15.878 align:start position:0%
will decide that as part of the rate
 
06:29:18.868 --> 06:29:18.878 align:start position:0%
case that's uh persisting there now but
 
06:29:21.190 --> 06:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
I guess my question would be what would
 
06:29:22.910 --> 06:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
be the normal course of action for
 
06:29:24.948 --> 06:29:24.958 align:start position:0%
recovering these types of costs would it
 
06:29:26.750 --> 06:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
depend on how large they are or do you
 
06:29:28.990 --> 06:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
have a regular cycle that that would go
 
06:29:31.670 --> 06:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
over that's beyond a year yeah so we are
 
06:29:33.788 --> 06:29:33.798 align:start position:0%
in I'll just say the the normal course
 
06:29:35.390 --> 06:29:35.400 align:start position:0%
we are in a little bit of Uncharted
 
06:29:38.150 --> 06:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
Territory as I I said uh this is a
 
06:29:40.190 --> 06:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
relatively new development that the
 
06:29:43.190 --> 06:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
utilities are being directed to um set
 
06:29:46.110 --> 06:29:46.120 align:start position:0%
these proxy prices and have this
 
06:29:48.830 --> 06:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
reconciliation um certainly I think it's
 
06:29:51.230 --> 06:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
important not to set up a construct that
 
06:29:54.190 --> 06:29:54.200 align:start position:0%
could lead to price spikes in in default
 
06:29:57.310 --> 06:29:57.320 align:start position:0%
service so if there was a large uh under
 
06:30:01.310 --> 06:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
collection um it may be best for
 
06:30:04.190 --> 06:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
customers to allow for the the recover
 
06:30:06.350 --> 06:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
of that over a longer period of time
 
06:30:09.270 --> 06:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
than if there was a smaller uh underr
 
06:30:11.708 --> 06:30:11.718 align:start position:0%
collection and I would note you know as
 
06:30:15.548 --> 06:30:15.558 align:start position:0%
as is been um uh mentioned you know it
 
06:30:18.708 --> 06:30:18.718 align:start position:0%
works both ways all if we sort of over
 
06:30:20.708 --> 06:30:20.718 align:start position:0%
recovered because the proxy price was
 
06:30:23.430 --> 06:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
set too high and the market prices came
 
06:30:25.750 --> 06:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
in uh a bit lower all customers would
 
06:30:28.948 --> 06:30:28.958 align:start position:0%
benefit from uh getting revenues
 
06:30:34.070 --> 06:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:35.910 --> 06:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
okay seeing no further questions we'll
 
06:30:41.750 --> 06:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
next ask Matthew F fum fom rather of the
 
06:30:43.910 --> 06:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
office of the consumer Advocate to give
 
06:30:46.548 --> 06:30:46.558 align:start position:0%
us his
 
06:30:49.548 --> 06:30:49.558 align:start position:0%
perspective good afternoon
 
06:30:52.270 --> 06:30:52.280 align:start position:0%
welcome good afternoon Mr chairman uh
 
06:30:55.070 --> 06:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee um yes my
 
06:30:57.468 --> 06:30:57.478 align:start position:0%
name is Matthew fwom and uh I am the
 
06:30:59.548 --> 06:30:59.558 align:start position:0%
assistant consumer Advocate and I hope
 
06:31:01.628 --> 06:31:01.638 align:start position:0%
you'll indulge me for just 30 seconds
 
06:31:02.868 --> 06:31:02.878 align:start position:0%
while I give you a little bit of my
 
06:31:05.030 --> 06:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
personal history just so that I can give
 
06:31:09.350 --> 06:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
you a I know a bit about what I speak um
 
06:31:12.990 --> 06:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
I uh was Once Upon a Time 15ish years
 
06:31:14.670 --> 06:31:14.680 align:start position:0%
ago employed as a staff attorney with
 
06:31:17.150 --> 06:31:17.160 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission and
 
06:31:19.230 --> 06:31:19.240 align:start position:0%
after that time spent about a decade
 
06:31:21.310 --> 06:31:21.320 align:start position:0%
working for two of the state's investor
 
06:31:22.948 --> 06:31:22.958 align:start position:0%
owned utilities including a large
 
06:31:24.948 --> 06:31:24.958 align:start position:0%
portion of my time uh on behalf of
 
06:31:26.670 --> 06:31:26.680 align:start position:0%
eversource and including through the
 
06:31:29.430 --> 06:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
time that it divested its
 
06:31:32.030 --> 06:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
generation so I've been doing this a bit
 
06:31:34.230 --> 06:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
of time and I found my way back uh to
 
06:31:36.230 --> 06:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
state service a little over a year ago
 
06:31:39.150 --> 06:31:39.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm now uh the assistant consumer
 
06:31:41.788 --> 06:31:41.798 align:start position:0%
Advocate with that little uh Preamble
 
06:31:43.670 --> 06:31:43.680 align:start position:0%
I'll say the Office of Consumer Advocate
 
06:31:46.868 --> 06:31:46.878 align:start position:0%
is is here to support uh House Bill
 
06:31:50.590 --> 06:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
760 and uh for a few reasons and I'll
 
06:31:52.388 --> 06:31:52.398 align:start position:0%
lay those out very quickly and also I
 
06:31:54.310 --> 06:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
hope to respond to a bit of the other uh
 
06:31:56.788 --> 06:31:56.798 align:start position:0%
issues I've heard this afternoon first
 
06:31:58.670 --> 06:31:58.680 align:start position:0%
I'll say the the office is aligned very
 
06:32:00.788 --> 06:32:00.798 align:start position:0%
much with the comments you heard uh from
 
06:32:04.270 --> 06:32:04.280 align:start position:0%
representative G uh on the reasons uh
 
06:32:07.590 --> 06:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
why this bill is worthy of your support
 
06:32:10.468 --> 06:32:10.478 align:start position:0%
760 broadly speaking assigns costs to
 
06:32:13.388 --> 06:32:13.398 align:start position:0%
those who cause them um at the end of
 
06:32:15.628 --> 06:32:15.638 align:start position:0%
the day there may be over collections
 
06:32:18.030 --> 06:32:18.040 align:start position:0%
there may be under collections
 
06:32:20.590 --> 06:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
but yeah I have a hard time imagining
 
06:32:22.350 --> 06:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
that a substantial under or over
 
06:32:24.190 --> 06:32:24.200 align:start position:0%
collection is ever going to be caused by
 
06:32:26.990 --> 06:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
the residential rate payers of any
 
06:32:30.070 --> 06:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
utility in fact uh the docket
 
06:32:32.468 --> 06:32:32.478 align:start position:0%
24112 mentioned by Mr spidel a little
 
06:32:35.030 --> 06:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
bit ago has has to do with eversource's
 
06:32:37.548 --> 06:32:37.558 align:start position:0%
underc collection of uh close to $7
 
06:32:39.990 --> 06:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
million from its large customer class
 
06:32:41.788 --> 06:32:41.798 align:start position:0%
that it's looking to socialize including
 
06:32:44.510 --> 06:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
onto residential
 
06:32:47.190 --> 06:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
customers now maybe socializing costs
 
06:32:49.468 --> 06:32:49.478 align:start position:0%
would have been more acceptable back uh
 
06:32:51.590 --> 06:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
before migration really took hold and
 
06:32:54.310 --> 06:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
maybe even before Community power uh
 
06:32:56.830 --> 06:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
became what it is today where largely
 
06:32:58.750 --> 06:32:58.760 align:start position:0%
default service customers were the same
 
06:33:01.990 --> 06:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
customers as uh those who took all nine
 
06:33:04.830 --> 06:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
by passable charges but that's not the
 
06:33:07.868 --> 06:33:07.878 align:start position:0%
case customers have moved on they should
 
06:33:09.430 --> 06:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
be expected to pay for the cost they
 
06:33:13.350 --> 06:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:17.708 --> 06:33:17.718 align:start position:0%
do now uh you've heard I I'll address
 
06:33:19.910 --> 06:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
one thing very quickly uh Mr spidel
 
06:33:22.150 --> 06:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
brought up part two and the elimination
 
06:33:25.350 --> 06:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
of some of the provisions of um RSA
 
06:33:30.590 --> 06:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
374 F3 Roman 5 I not the language that's
 
06:33:32.990 --> 06:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
added at lines uh four and five
 
06:33:35.788 --> 06:33:35.798 align:start position:0%
addresses much of that uh so it's not
 
06:33:38.628 --> 06:33:38.638 align:start position:0%
really going away it's just been moved
 
06:33:40.670 --> 06:33:40.680 align:start position:0%
um and as for the elimination of subpart
 
06:33:43.270 --> 06:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
F that has to do with resident uh with
 
06:33:46.430 --> 06:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
uh renewable energy uh offerings by the
 
06:33:48.350 --> 06:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
utilities um I was part of the
 
06:33:49.910 --> 06:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
eversource crew that did away with
 
06:33:51.590 --> 06:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
eversource's last offering in that
 
06:33:53.670 --> 06:33:53.680 align:start position:0%
because nobody took them uh they were
 
06:33:55.670 --> 06:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
offered by utilities for over a decade
 
06:33:58.310 --> 06:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
had no customers that language is fine
 
06:34:01.030 --> 06:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:04.030 --> 06:34:04.040 align:start position:0%
eliminated um one of the things that I
 
06:34:05.468 --> 06:34:05.478 align:start position:0%
most particularly wanted to address and
 
06:34:07.030 --> 06:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
I'm grateful to be able to do it in this
 
06:34:10.150 --> 06:34:10.160 align:start position:0%
order or in in having spoken after both
 
06:34:13.830 --> 06:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
the Pu and the department of energy is
 
06:34:16.388 --> 06:34:16.398 align:start position:0%
and as well as eversource is that I feel
 
06:34:17.990 --> 06:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
like there's an awful lot of finger
 
06:34:19.510 --> 06:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
pointing in various directions that's
 
06:34:20.910 --> 06:34:20.920 align:start position:0%
not really getting us
 
06:34:23.190 --> 06:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
anywhere the Pu has said that they've
 
06:34:25.708 --> 06:34:25.718 align:start position:0%
established a series of proxy
 
06:34:28.070 --> 06:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
prices uh that and they have directed
 
06:34:30.750 --> 06:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
the utilities to procure service in line
 
06:34:33.270 --> 06:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
with those proxy prices I don't know how
 
06:34:35.230 --> 06:34:35.240 align:start position:0%
they've developed those proxy prices Mr
 
06:34:36.510 --> 06:34:36.520 align:start position:0%
spidel has even told you that they
 
06:34:37.788 --> 06:34:37.798 align:start position:0%
haven't shown them to anybody they've
 
06:34:39.548 --> 06:34:39.558 align:start position:0%
developed them in
 
06:34:42.270 --> 06:34:42.280 align:start position:0%
house so they're saying well we've
 
06:34:44.628 --> 06:34:44.638 align:start position:0%
developed a thing utilities go and do it
 
06:34:46.388 --> 06:34:46.398 align:start position:0%
and the utilities say okay we've done a
 
06:34:48.708 --> 06:34:48.718 align:start position:0%
thing we were told to do and everybody
 
06:34:50.548 --> 06:34:50.558 align:start position:0%
is saying so we've just done what we
 
06:34:53.110 --> 06:34:53.120 align:start position:0%
were told to do and if there's a bunch
 
06:34:55.910 --> 06:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
of money that is left out there to be
 
06:34:58.750 --> 06:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
dealt with that falls to the customers
 
06:35:00.548 --> 06:35:00.558 align:start position:0%
to deal with regardless of whose fault
 
06:35:03.070 --> 06:35:03.080 align:start position:0%
it is whose decision it was how those
 
06:35:05.750 --> 06:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
prices came to be what they are and
 
06:35:07.750 --> 06:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't make a lot of sense to
 
06:35:10.270 --> 06:35:10.280 align:start position:0%
me as I said at the outset customers
 
06:35:12.190 --> 06:35:12.200 align:start position:0%
should be expected to pay for the cost
 
06:35:15.388 --> 06:35:15.398 align:start position:0%
they cause residential customers are by
 
06:35:17.350 --> 06:35:17.360 align:start position:0%
and large not the cause of these uh
 
06:35:19.388 --> 06:35:19.398 align:start position:0%
costs and they shouldn't be expected to
 
06:35:21.788 --> 06:35:21.798 align:start position:0%
Bear them
 
06:35:24.350 --> 06:35:24.360 align:start position:0%
uh and finally I guess I'll get to the
 
06:35:28.510 --> 06:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
issue of uh the potential for a death
 
06:35:31.030 --> 06:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
spiral so we'd heard you've heard
 
06:35:34.070 --> 06:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
testimony this afternoon that uh I
 
06:35:36.628 --> 06:35:36.638 align:start position:0%
believe it was 99 times out of a 100 it
 
06:35:38.948 --> 06:35:38.958 align:start position:0%
would be an over collection to be
 
06:35:41.388 --> 06:35:41.398 align:start position:0%
returned uh rather than under collection
 
06:35:43.030 --> 06:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
to be further collected from customers
 
06:35:44.230 --> 06:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
if that's the case then I don't think
 
06:35:45.750 --> 06:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
there should be any concern about a
 
06:35:49.468 --> 06:35:49.478 align:start position:0%
death spiral there'll always be extra
 
06:35:52.190 --> 06:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
money but to the extent that there is a
 
06:35:54.110 --> 06:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
concern about a death spiral there's
 
06:35:55.628 --> 06:35:55.638 align:start position:0%
nothing about this legislation that I
 
06:35:57.150 --> 06:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
can tell that removes the ability of the
 
06:35:58.948 --> 06:35:58.958 align:start position:0%
Pu to further
 
06:36:01.708 --> 06:36:01.718 align:start position:0%
augment how it is that utilities procure
 
06:36:04.590 --> 06:36:04.600 align:start position:0%
and provide default service
 
06:36:05.670 --> 06:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
if they're seeing that they're
 
06:36:08.270 --> 06:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
developing large under collections they
 
06:36:10.230 --> 06:36:10.240 align:start position:0%
can deal with that the utilities can
 
06:36:12.230 --> 06:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
improve their forecasting and improve
 
06:36:14.350 --> 06:36:14.360 align:start position:0%
their rate setting there are ways to
 
06:36:16.070 --> 06:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
deal with these issues that don't have
 
06:36:18.628 --> 06:36:18.638 align:start position:0%
to put costs on residential
 
06:36:20.868 --> 06:36:20.878 align:start position:0%
consumers so with that I think that's
 
06:36:23.310 --> 06:36:23.320 align:start position:0%
all I had and I'm happy to take any
 
06:36:25.708 --> 06:36:25.718 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for that testimony
 
06:36:30.468 --> 06:36:30.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:33.590 --> 06:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
fwom well seeing none want to thank you
 
06:36:36.190 --> 06:36:36.200 align:start position:0%
yes I did a good job thank you I'll call
 
06:36:38.468 --> 06:36:38.478 align:start position:0%
uh yes you did a very good job so I'll
 
06:36:41.070 --> 06:36:41.080 align:start position:0%
call next on David Greer from
 
06:36:41.080 --> 06:36:51.670 align:start position:0%
call next on David Greer from
Constellation

06:36:51.670 --> 06:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:54.030 --> 06:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
Energy welcome haven't seen you in a
 
06:37:16.070 --> 06:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:17.510 --> 06:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
gosh I don't feel that old but I'm
 
06:37:19.910 --> 06:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
seeming that old so uh thank you
 
06:37:21.868 --> 06:37:21.878 align:start position:0%
committee for having me uh my name is
 
06:37:23.548 --> 06:37:23.558 align:start position:0%
David career I am with
 
06:37:26.310 --> 06:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
constellation um a lot of what's been
 
06:37:28.070 --> 06:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
said already in support of this bill I
 
06:37:30.230 --> 06:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
should say we support the bill uh we
 
06:37:31.948 --> 06:37:31.958 align:start position:0%
Echo those comments I do want to touch
 
06:37:33.948 --> 06:37:33.958 align:start position:0%
on just couple a couple of things
 
06:37:38.388 --> 06:37:38.398 align:start position:0%
from our perspective one is the matter
 
06:37:40.708 --> 06:37:40.718 align:start position:0%
of these underc collections or overc
 
06:37:42.788 --> 06:37:42.798 align:start position:0%
collections being put on non- bypassable
 
06:37:45.070 --> 06:37:45.080 align:start position:0%
charges uh obviously as a competitive
 
06:37:47.030 --> 06:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
supplier that means our customers are
 
06:37:49.070 --> 06:37:49.080 align:start position:0%
going to unfairly pay what are
 
06:37:51.628 --> 06:37:51.638 align:start position:0%
essentially Supply charges even though
 
06:37:53.230 --> 06:37:53.240 align:start position:0%
they are getting their supply from us
 
06:37:56.190 --> 06:37:56.200 align:start position:0%
and not from default service um true it
 
06:37:58.628 --> 06:37:58.638 align:start position:0%
it may be possible that they would get
 
06:38:01.708 --> 06:38:01.718 align:start position:0%
those um the benefits if the prices are
 
06:38:04.230 --> 06:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
actually decreased or below what that
 
06:38:07.110 --> 06:38:07.120 align:start position:0%
proxy price is um but we think what's
 
06:38:08.350 --> 06:38:08.360 align:start position:0%
more likely than that is that there's
 
06:38:10.150 --> 06:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
going to be swings in both directions so
 
06:38:11.270 --> 06:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes they'll be benefiting
 
06:38:13.350 --> 06:38:13.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes they won't be uh it leads to
 
06:38:15.510 --> 06:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
customer confusion and it's not great
 
06:38:16.910 --> 06:38:16.920 align:start position:0%
the whole reason you pick a competitive
 
06:38:19.468 --> 06:38:19.478 align:start position:0%
supplier is to not pay the default
 
06:38:19.478 --> 06:38:20.670 align:start position:0%
supplier is to not pay the default
service

06:38:20.670 --> 06:38:20.680 align:start position:0%
service
 
06:38:23.910 --> 06:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
price I do want to add that from our
 
06:38:25.350 --> 06:38:25.360 align:start position:0%
perspective we actually would like to
 
06:38:28.110 --> 06:38:28.120 align:start position:0%
see this bill go a little bit further
 
06:38:32.388 --> 06:38:32.398 align:start position:0%
um the the Crux of this bill is to um
 
06:38:35.670 --> 06:38:35.680 align:start position:0%
prevent those uh those reconciliations
 
06:38:37.788 --> 06:38:37.798 align:start position:0%
from being on the nine bypassable
 
06:38:40.788 --> 06:38:40.798 align:start position:0%
charges um we think this issue in itself
 
06:38:43.948 --> 06:38:43.958 align:start position:0%
would actually be reduced if we
 
06:38:46.510 --> 06:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
prevented the current plan of
 
06:38:49.948 --> 06:38:49.958 align:start position:0%
procuring um default Supply on the
 
06:38:52.548 --> 06:38:52.558 align:start position:0%
wholesale or not the I'm sorry the um
 
06:38:55.948 --> 06:38:55.958 align:start position:0%
day ahead and um realtime markets run by
 
06:38:59.750 --> 06:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
Isa New England the problem here is that
 
06:39:02.270 --> 06:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
default Service as many even the Pu
 
06:39:03.910 --> 06:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
admitted this is supposed to be
 
06:39:08.350 --> 06:39:08.360 align:start position:0%
of Last Resort and so by that nature you
 
06:39:10.948 --> 06:39:10.958 align:start position:0%
would like that to be a stable price
 
06:39:13.628 --> 06:39:13.638 align:start position:0%
that is a reasonable price and then
 
06:39:15.670 --> 06:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
people can shop around for a different
 
06:39:16.910 --> 06:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
price if they don't like the default
 
06:39:18.910 --> 06:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
service by purchasing on the wholesale
 
06:39:21.510 --> 06:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
Market what you're doing is basically
 
06:39:24.310 --> 06:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
introducing a variable rate and sure for
 
06:39:26.990 --> 06:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
the last year wholesale um those markets
 
06:39:28.990 --> 06:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
have been relatively inexpensive largely
 
06:39:31.548 --> 06:39:31.558 align:start position:0%
due because natural gas prices have been
 
06:39:34.670 --> 06:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
decreasing but a country invades another
 
06:39:36.830 --> 06:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
country and natural gas prices increase
 
06:39:38.948 --> 06:39:38.958 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden the rate payers pay all
 
06:39:42.110 --> 06:39:42.120 align:start position:0%
of that whereas under the current system
 
06:39:44.788 --> 06:39:44.798 align:start position:0%
suppliers are taking that risk so if
 
06:39:46.708 --> 06:39:46.718 align:start position:0%
there is I mean lack for better of a
 
06:39:48.190 --> 06:39:48.200 align:start position:0%
term if there's an underc collection
 
06:39:51.110 --> 06:39:51.120 align:start position:0%
it's us who has to bear that cost it's
 
06:39:52.388 --> 06:39:52.398 align:start position:0%
not the
 
06:39:54.868 --> 06:39:54.878 align:start position:0%
rayer and so I just wanted to also kind
 
06:39:59.070 --> 06:39:59.080 align:start position:0%
of clarify that if if this bill passes
 
06:40:03.910 --> 06:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
and the pu's plan or um proposal of
 
06:40:05.990 --> 06:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
procuring more and more on the iso New
 
06:40:08.750 --> 06:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
England markets comes to fruition you're
 
06:40:11.830 --> 06:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
actually going to see large swings in
 
06:40:14.070 --> 06:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
that price of default service because
 
06:40:15.628 --> 06:40:15.638 align:start position:0%
they have to recover that those costs
 
06:40:17.628 --> 06:40:17.638 align:start position:0%
from somewhere or give credit to those
 
06:40:19.990 --> 06:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
costs from somewhere so if they under
 
06:40:21.910 --> 06:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
collect massively and they have to put
 
06:40:23.830 --> 06:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
those costs into the supply portion of
 
06:40:25.708 --> 06:40:25.718 align:start position:0%
the bill you're going to create
 
06:40:26.910 --> 06:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
essentially an
 
06:40:29.948 --> 06:40:29.958 align:start position:0%
artificial uh Supply price that isn't
 
06:40:31.230 --> 06:40:31.240 align:start position:0%
reflective of what the New England
 
06:40:34.670 --> 06:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
markets are actually uh showing and so
 
06:40:35.990 --> 06:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
then that would cause a really high
 
06:40:37.868 --> 06:40:37.878 align:start position:0%
default service price and you get Mass
 
06:40:40.110 --> 06:40:40.120 align:start position:0%
migration off of default service and
 
06:40:41.548 --> 06:40:41.558 align:start position:0%
then in the next 6 months well now
 
06:40:43.430 --> 06:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
they've undercollected and so it's
 
06:40:44.830 --> 06:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
really low and then everyone leaves
 
06:40:46.070 --> 06:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
their competitive supplier back to
 
06:40:48.110 --> 06:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
default service and this makes it
 
06:40:51.070 --> 06:40:51.080 align:start position:0%
extremely hard to hedge prices and it
 
06:40:54.030 --> 06:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
ends up costing everyone more money as
 
06:40:56.548 --> 06:40:56.558 align:start position:0%
those hedging um risk premiums are
 
06:40:59.270 --> 06:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
increased to account for that type of
 
06:41:01.788 --> 06:41:01.798 align:start position:0%
migration uh I think with that I'll
 
06:41:02.990 --> 06:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
leave it alone and see if there's any
 
06:41:06.388 --> 06:41:06.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:09.350 --> 06:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
me okay any questions representative
 
06:41:11.868 --> 06:41:11.878 align:start position:0%
McGee I would like to know why every
 
06:41:14.270 --> 06:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
single presenter has brought us more and
 
06:41:14.280 --> 06:41:15.750 align:start position:0%
single presenter has brought us more and
different

06:41:15.750 --> 06:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
different
 
06:41:18.270 --> 06:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
information so your points are very well
 
06:41:22.750 --> 06:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
taken that um that it is about how uh
 
06:41:24.150 --> 06:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
how this is going to affect the market
 
06:41:28.030 --> 06:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
as a whole and you said that you're that
 
06:41:30.750 --> 06:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
constellation is in support of the bill
 
06:41:33.990 --> 06:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming for the support for
 
06:41:36.388 --> 06:41:36.398 align:start position:0%
competitive markets that it would bring
 
06:41:38.788 --> 06:41:38.798 align:start position:0%
to the suppliers that are really trying
 
06:41:41.990 --> 06:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
to um create that competition which
 
06:41:44.990 --> 06:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
helps to be a hedge and drive prices
 
06:41:49.430 --> 06:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
down but uh to your point about what
 
06:41:52.830 --> 06:41:52.840 align:start position:0%
might happen in a bit of a you know uh
 
06:41:54.788 --> 06:41:54.798 align:start position:0%
not a roller coaster but sort of a back
 
06:41:55.868 --> 06:41:55.878 align:start position:0%
and forth
 
06:41:58.948 --> 06:41:58.958 align:start position:0%
seesaw uh within the market for under
 
06:42:02.150 --> 06:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
and overcharges affecting the perceived
 
06:42:06.270 --> 06:42:06.280 align:start position:0%
default service rate uh as fluctuating
 
06:42:08.388 --> 06:42:08.398 align:start position:0%
significantly I'm sure that's a concern
 
06:42:10.030 --> 06:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
as well for the utilities and the and
 
06:42:12.430 --> 06:42:12.440 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission so in
 
06:42:14.190 --> 06:42:14.200 align:start position:0%
your assessment of this and you're
 
06:42:15.990 --> 06:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
falling down on the side of supporting
 
06:42:18.948 --> 06:42:18.958 align:start position:0%
the bill why do you think that passing
 
06:42:22.030 --> 06:42:22.040 align:start position:0%
this legislation would assist the market
 
06:42:23.468 --> 06:42:23.478 align:start position:0%
more than it would
 
06:42:25.468 --> 06:42:25.478 align:start position:0%
harm uh the concerns that have been
 
06:42:27.830 --> 06:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
raised already this this this afternoon
 
06:42:29.750 --> 06:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a great question um and in
 
06:42:31.388 --> 06:42:31.398 align:start position:0%
the interest time I it is in my written
 
06:42:33.868 --> 06:42:33.878 align:start position:0%
testimony but we did have a couple of
 
06:42:36.070 --> 06:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
suggestions for improvements what we
 
06:42:38.070 --> 06:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
believe are improvements of the bill uh
 
06:42:40.510 --> 06:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
the first one which I want to address is
 
06:42:40.520 --> 06:42:41.708 align:start position:0%
the first one which I want to address is
uh

06:42:41.708 --> 06:42:41.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:42:46.310 --> 06:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
online three of the bill it says uh
 
06:42:48.030 --> 06:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
which really repeats language that's
 
06:42:50.190 --> 06:42:50.200 align:start position:0%
already in existing law and then adds
 
06:42:51.788 --> 06:42:51.798 align:start position:0%
some things which I'll get to it says
 
06:42:53.750 --> 06:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
default service should be designed to
 
06:42:57.230 --> 06:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
provide a safety net and then it says um
 
06:42:59.830 --> 06:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
and it kind of gives the bill adds some
 
06:43:02.310 --> 06:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
language to kind of clarify the purpose
 
06:43:03.948 --> 06:43:03.958 align:start position:0%
of default service and how it should be
 
06:43:06.230 --> 06:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
designed to minimize customer risk not
 
06:43:07.670 --> 06:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
unduly harm the development of
 
06:43:09.868 --> 06:43:09.878 align:start position:0%
competitive markets and mitigate against
 
06:43:12.628 --> 06:43:12.638 align:start position:0%
price volatility our suggestion is to
 
06:43:15.030 --> 06:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
take the word should there in line three
 
06:43:17.070 --> 06:43:17.080 align:start position:0%
and make that a shall so it is a
 
06:43:19.190 --> 06:43:19.200 align:start position:0%
requirement for default service to
 
06:43:21.628 --> 06:43:21.638 align:start position:0%
minimize customer risk not unduly harm
 
06:43:22.910 --> 06:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
the development of competitive markets
 
06:43:25.270 --> 06:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
and mitigate against price volatility if
 
06:43:27.750 --> 06:43:27.760 align:start position:0%
that's a requirement then procuring on
 
06:43:29.868 --> 06:43:29.878 align:start position:0%
the iso New England markets would not
 
06:43:31.830 --> 06:43:31.840 align:start position:0%
really be available because it fails all
 
06:43:33.750 --> 06:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
three of those um it would only
 
06:43:35.788 --> 06:43:35.798 align:start position:0%
introduce volatility and it would not
 
06:43:38.388 --> 06:43:38.398 align:start position:0%
minimize customer it places risk on
 
06:43:44.270 --> 06:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:46.510 --> 06:43:46.520 align:start position:0%
markets was that number one or was that
 
06:43:49.230 --> 06:43:49.240 align:start position:0%
all you had to say sorry um and then our
 
06:43:54.070 --> 06:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
second suggestion um was just down in uh
 
06:43:57.750 --> 06:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
line nine where they have added um some
 
06:44:01.430 --> 06:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
language for uh default Service uh the
 
06:44:03.830 --> 06:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
the prudently incl uh curred costs
 
06:44:06.910 --> 06:44:06.920 align:start position:0%
arising from um securing default service
 
06:44:08.990 --> 06:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
for purchase of power capacity antier
 
06:44:11.310 --> 06:44:11.320 align:start position:0%
Services we would add operational cost
 
06:44:13.948 --> 06:44:13.958 align:start position:0%
to that so any cost associated with
 
06:44:17.070 --> 06:44:17.080 align:start position:0%
procuring default service itself um and
 
06:44:20.948 --> 06:44:20.958 align:start position:0%
then just add the word uh bypassable in
 
06:44:23.910 --> 06:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
line I want to see where it is uh sorry
 
06:44:26.788 --> 06:44:26.798 align:start position:0%
uh line 10 so it' be the uh bypassable
 
06:44:29.708 --> 06:44:29.718 align:start position:0%
default service charges just to really
 
06:44:33.070 --> 06:44:33.080 align:start position:0%
make clear that the um any cost aod
 
06:44:36.590 --> 06:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
associated with uh procuring supply for
 
06:44:38.030 --> 06:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
their default service customers would
 
06:44:44.310 --> 06:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:44:47.430 --> 06:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
Bill yes so would having it in the
 
06:44:49.310 --> 06:44:49.320 align:start position:0%
supply portion of the bill then make it
 
06:44:52.948 --> 06:44:52.958 align:start position:0%
easier for people to
 
06:44:55.948 --> 06:44:55.958 align:start position:0%
ascertain the the accurate Supply costs
 
06:44:57.510 --> 06:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
is that the reason that it would be
 
06:44:59.388 --> 06:44:59.398 align:start position:0%
beneficial to have it that
 
06:45:01.910 --> 06:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
way if you're talking about both of
 
06:45:04.590 --> 06:45:04.600 align:start position:0%
those uh changes that we suggest at the
 
06:45:07.670 --> 06:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
same time yes I think what this bill
 
06:45:12.070 --> 06:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
would do already is force the um
 
06:45:13.948 --> 06:45:13.958 align:start position:0%
reconciliations to be in the supply
 
06:45:15.708 --> 06:45:15.718 align:start position:0%
portion because they can't be in the
 
06:45:17.510 --> 06:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
non- bypassable portion according to
 
06:45:21.190 --> 06:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
this uh and so that's where the issue
 
06:45:23.388 --> 06:45:23.398 align:start position:0%
comes where you're going to have kind of
 
06:45:26.110 --> 06:45:26.120 align:start position:0%
a false price if you're procuring on
 
06:45:28.150 --> 06:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
wholesale markets using a proxy price
 
06:45:30.270 --> 06:45:30.280 align:start position:0%
and then have to reconcile that in the
 
06:45:33.468 --> 06:45:33.478 align:start position:0%
next six-month period that cons ilation
 
06:45:34.628 --> 06:45:34.638 align:start position:0%
has to go somewhere and if it could only
 
06:45:36.468 --> 06:45:36.478 align:start position:0%
legally go on the supply part that's
 
06:45:37.548 --> 06:45:37.558 align:start position:0%
where it's going to start causing
 
06:45:40.310 --> 06:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
massive swings one way or the other but
 
06:45:42.270 --> 06:45:42.280 align:start position:0%
both of our suggestions taken together
 
06:45:44.868 --> 06:45:44.878 align:start position:0%
yes that would then give an accurate uh
 
06:45:47.110 --> 06:45:47.120 align:start position:0%
depiction of what it actually costs to
 
06:45:49.948 --> 06:45:49.958 align:start position:0%
supply that customer as opposed to
 
06:45:52.190 --> 06:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
delivery charges which is the desire I
 
06:45:54.590 --> 06:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
would assume correct yes because then we
 
06:45:56.468 --> 06:45:56.478 align:start position:0%
um when we give you a supply price that
 
06:45:59.510 --> 06:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
includes all of our operational costs um
 
06:46:00.830 --> 06:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
that's the cost to generate the
 
06:46:02.948 --> 06:46:02.958 align:start position:0%
electricity procure electricity the rcks
 
06:46:04.910 --> 06:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
everything and so this would just make
 
06:46:08.190 --> 06:46:08.200 align:start position:0%
sure that all stays um Apples to Apples
 
06:46:09.708 --> 06:46:09.718 align:start position:0%
when you're comparing your prices thank
 
06:46:13.070 --> 06:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
you that's great yep further
 
06:46:15.788 --> 06:46:15.798 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
06:46:17.350 --> 06:46:17.360 align:start position:0%
much good to see you
 
06:46:22.030 --> 06:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
again cpcn is up next Dena Dennis and
 
06:46:44.230 --> 06:46:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:46.708 --> 06:46:46.718 align:start position:0%
thanks very much good afternoon thank
 
06:46:48.430 --> 06:46:48.440 align:start position:0%
you for having me back again for the
 
06:46:51.230 --> 06:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
record I'm Dena Dennis and with me this
 
06:46:53.830 --> 06:46:53.840 align:start position:0%
afternoon is uh Henry
 
06:46:56.190 --> 06:46:56.200 align:start position:0%
heren director of member services
 
06:46:57.830 --> 06:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
director of member services we're both
 
06:46:59.430 --> 06:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
with Community power Coalition of New
 
06:47:01.628 --> 06:47:01.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um the community power
 
06:47:04.030 --> 06:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
Coalition of New Hampshire um supports
 
06:47:06.670 --> 06:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
House Bill 760 because it protects the
 
06:47:08.430 --> 06:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
continued viability of New Hampshire's
 
06:47:10.868 --> 06:47:10.878 align:start position:0%
competitive Supply Market um by ensuring
 
06:47:12.830 --> 06:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
that customers of community power and
 
06:47:14.868 --> 06:47:14.878 align:start position:0%
competitive Supply are not forced to
 
06:47:18.270 --> 06:47:18.280 align:start position:0%
subsidize Utility Supply rates um you've
 
06:47:21.430 --> 06:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
heard a number of um pieces of
 
06:47:24.628 --> 06:47:24.638 align:start position:0%
information uh from folks today so um I
 
06:47:26.030 --> 06:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
want to touch on a couple of things and
 
06:47:28.310 --> 06:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
then also um maybe respond to a few
 
06:47:33.910 --> 06:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
things that were said um I think that uh
 
06:47:37.830 --> 06:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
to address the issue that um this
 
06:47:39.788 --> 06:47:39.798 align:start position:0%
committee and the legislature should
 
06:47:42.670 --> 06:47:42.680 align:start position:0%
wait to act because there's active
 
06:47:44.548 --> 06:47:44.558 align:start position:0%
adjudication I would respectfully
 
06:47:47.070 --> 06:47:47.080 align:start position:0%
disagree with that the legislature
 
06:47:49.510 --> 06:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
grants the authority of the commission
 
06:47:51.388 --> 06:47:51.398 align:start position:0%
and of the department and they can take
 
06:47:53.468 --> 06:47:53.478 align:start position:0%
it you all can take it away at any time
 
06:47:56.510 --> 06:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
so I would encourage you to not wait and
 
06:48:01.110 --> 06:48:01.120 align:start position:0%
to act before this possibly happens and
 
06:48:04.388 --> 06:48:04.398 align:start position:0%
customers end up having to pay for costs
 
06:48:06.948 --> 06:48:06.958 align:start position:0%
that they they did not
 
06:48:11.590 --> 06:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
incur um I'd also like to address the um
 
06:48:16.468 --> 06:48:16.478 align:start position:0%
the eversource proposal in pu doet de24
 
06:48:19.830 --> 06:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
d112 um that's seeking cost recovery of
 
06:48:19.840 --> 06:48:20.750 align:start position:0%
d112 um that's seeking cost recovery of
a

06:48:20.750 --> 06:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:48:23.830 --> 06:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
6.5 I think it's now up to about $6.9
 
06:48:26.868 --> 06:48:26.878 align:start position:0%
million in an underc collection from
 
06:48:29.110 --> 06:48:29.120 align:start position:0%
prior periods from the large customer
 
06:48:32.830 --> 06:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
group um something that we learned
 
06:48:35.270 --> 06:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
relatively recently um at a technical
 
06:48:37.910 --> 06:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
session in that case um and this is also
 
06:48:39.910 --> 06:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
included on page three of my testimony
 
06:48:43.468 --> 06:48:43.478 align:start position:0%
as a footnote is that um 4.3 at least
 
06:48:47.590 --> 06:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
4.3 million of that um happened before
 
06:48:49.868 --> 06:48:49.878 align:start position:0%
Community power aggregation programs
 
06:48:51.910 --> 06:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
launched um and one of the things that
 
06:48:55.788 --> 06:48:55.798 align:start position:0%
eversource has said is that uh that that
 
06:48:58.310 --> 06:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
6 and a half million under collection
 
06:48:59.948 --> 06:48:59.958 align:start position:0%
was largely attributed to community
 
06:49:02.150 --> 06:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
power aggregation when that is actually
 
06:49:03.708 --> 06:49:03.718 align:start position:0%
not not the
 
06:49:06.468 --> 06:49:06.478 align:start position:0%
case um and then kind of going to the
 
06:49:08.868 --> 06:49:08.878 align:start position:0%
proxy price and the forecasting
 
06:49:10.750 --> 06:49:10.760 align:start position:0%
methodologies you know you hear from the
 
06:49:12.868 --> 06:49:12.878 align:start position:0%
Pu and they're telling you the proxy
 
06:49:14.670 --> 06:49:14.680 align:start position:0%
price is likely going to result in an
 
06:49:17.070 --> 06:49:17.080 align:start position:0%
upside and then you hear the doe and
 
06:49:18.310 --> 06:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
they think it's likely going to raise
 
06:49:20.548 --> 06:49:20.558 align:start position:0%
rates so which is it which is it going
 
06:49:22.830 --> 06:49:22.840 align:start position:0%
to be and I think that's the point it's
 
06:49:25.430 --> 06:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
a flip of a coin forecasts are always
 
06:49:29.590 --> 06:49:29.600 align:start position:0%
imperfect and you don't know what what
 
06:49:31.708 --> 06:49:31.718 align:start position:0%
is going to come of it um and that's why
 
06:49:33.388 --> 06:49:33.398 align:start position:0%
there's risk management
 
06:49:36.468 --> 06:49:36.478 align:start position:0%
uh strategies that you can take um but
 
06:49:39.270 --> 06:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
we think that uh utilities may be
 
06:49:41.510 --> 06:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
understating electricity costs in their
 
06:49:44.110 --> 06:49:44.120 align:start position:0%
price forecasts um and as a result
 
06:49:46.430 --> 06:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
Supply rates have been anti-competitive
 
06:49:48.510 --> 06:49:48.520 align:start position:0%
priced underneath what competitive
 
06:49:50.708 --> 06:49:50.718 align:start position:0%
suppliers including Community power
 
06:49:52.830 --> 06:49:52.840 align:start position:0%
Coalition anticipate the cost of service
 
06:49:55.190 --> 06:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
will be um and again just want to
 
06:49:57.750 --> 06:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
underscore that artificially low Utility
 
06:50:00.070 --> 06:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
Supply rates will stop the growth of New
 
06:50:01.708 --> 06:50:01.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's competitive market in its
 
06:50:04.830 --> 06:50:04.840 align:start position:0%
tracks um and I'll just point out that
 
06:50:07.430 --> 06:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
um this current rate period that we're
 
06:50:11.110 --> 06:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
in starting February 1st um CBC and had
 
06:50:13.190 --> 06:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
to actually increase our rates at the
 
06:50:16.548 --> 06:50:16.558 align:start position:0%
end of January um and part of that was
 
06:50:19.310 --> 06:50:19.320 align:start position:0%
due to a um an agreement that we had
 
06:50:21.388 --> 06:50:21.398 align:start position:0%
with a local generator that did not pan
 
06:50:23.990 --> 06:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
out and you know we had to um adjust
 
06:50:25.868 --> 06:50:25.878 align:start position:0%
some of our hedging strategy and and
 
06:50:28.830 --> 06:50:28.840 align:start position:0%
prices came in a little bit higher um
 
06:50:31.948 --> 06:50:31.958 align:start position:0%
but as a result of where we landed we
 
06:50:35.030 --> 06:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
are having to pause the launch of 12
 
06:50:37.230 --> 06:50:37.240 align:start position:0%
Community power aggregation programs
 
06:50:39.628 --> 06:50:39.638 align:start position:0%
this spring so those are all communities
 
06:50:41.868 --> 06:50:41.878 align:start position:0%
that have gone through the arduous
 
06:50:44.670 --> 06:50:44.680 align:start position:0%
process um of working through their Town
 
06:50:47.388 --> 06:50:47.398 align:start position:0%
energy committee and select boards uh
 
06:50:48.708 --> 06:50:48.718 align:start position:0%
getting this a lot of them were going to
 
06:50:50.830 --> 06:50:50.840 align:start position:0%
be going to town meeting next month and
 
06:50:53.350 --> 06:50:53.360 align:start position:0%
now they're putting that on hold so this
 
06:50:55.350 --> 06:50:55.360 align:start position:0%
is a big deal for us this is a big deal
 
06:50:58.110 --> 06:50:58.120 align:start position:0%
for other competitive suppliers and we
 
06:51:01.468 --> 06:51:01.478 align:start position:0%
can't let um we can't let this precedent
 
06:51:03.510 --> 06:51:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh be set
 
06:51:06.948 --> 06:51:06.958 align:start position:0%
um so again passing House Bill 760 will
 
06:51:08.708 --> 06:51:08.718 align:start position:0%
demonstrate the legislature's commitment
 
06:51:11.190 --> 06:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
to the goals of the restructuring act
 
06:51:13.230 --> 06:51:13.240 align:start position:0%
that greater customer choice and Market
 
06:51:15.430 --> 06:51:15.440 align:start position:0%
competition are the preferred means to
 
06:51:18.230 --> 06:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
pursue efficiency and cost savings and
 
06:51:20.670 --> 06:51:20.680 align:start position:0%
protect competitive Supply customers
 
06:51:22.310 --> 06:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
from being penalized and forced to
 
06:51:24.830 --> 06:51:24.840 align:start position:0%
subsidize the mistakes of the Monopoly
 
06:51:27.350 --> 06:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your
 
06:51:30.830 --> 06:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
time and thank you for your
 
06:51:33.230 --> 06:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
information questions for the community
 
06:51:33.240 --> 06:51:35.750 align:start position:0%
information questions for the community
power

06:51:35.750 --> 06:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:51:38.990 --> 06:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
Coalition seeing none we'll move
 
06:51:42.708 --> 06:51:42.718 align:start position:0%
along and next we'll call on Howard KET
 
06:51:49.590 --> 06:51:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:05.788 --> 06:52:05.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:08.548 --> 06:52:08.558 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh I'd like to
 
06:52:12.910 --> 06:52:12.920 align:start position:0%
introduce myself um I'm Howard khed I'm
 
06:52:14.990 --> 06:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
from Ryan New Hampshire I'm a co-chair
 
06:52:17.990 --> 06:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
of the energy committee and we were in
 
06:52:20.548 --> 06:52:20.558 align:start position:0%
the first round of towns that adopted
 
06:52:23.468 --> 06:52:23.478 align:start position:0%
CPC and as our
 
06:52:28.350 --> 06:52:28.360 align:start position:0%
supplier of choice so um I I guess the
 
06:52:31.310 --> 06:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
key points I want to stress to kind of
 
06:52:32.948 --> 06:52:32.958 align:start position:0%
go after uh
 
06:52:35.868 --> 06:52:35.878 align:start position:0%
what's in my heart is that presently I
 
06:52:38.468 --> 06:52:38.478 align:start position:0%
feel as if utilities have an unfair
 
06:52:41.708 --> 06:52:41.718 align:start position:0%
advantage in How To Source Supply as a
 
06:52:44.708 --> 06:52:44.718 align:start position:0%
result of that it's going to be
 
06:52:47.230 --> 06:52:47.240 align:start position:0%
non-competitive for anybody who's not a
 
06:52:50.030 --> 06:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
utility to be a supplier and that's
 
06:52:53.430 --> 06:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
really what it comes down to uh we we
 
06:52:54.708 --> 06:52:54.718 align:start position:0%
saw what
 
06:52:58.350 --> 06:52:58.360 align:start position:0%
happened uh over recent years where in
 
06:53:03.910 --> 06:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:53:06.670 --> 06:53:06.680 align:start position:0%
since we adopted CPC andh as our
 
06:53:07.830 --> 06:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
supplier of
 
06:53:10.708 --> 06:53:10.718 align:start position:0%
choice and for a small town of Ry that
 
06:53:14.990 --> 06:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
is a huge huge number at the same
 
06:53:17.750 --> 06:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
time uh we have seen double- digigit
 
06:53:19.110 --> 06:53:19.120 align:start position:0%
increases in
 
06:53:22.430 --> 06:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
taxation so it puts even more emphasis
 
06:53:25.628 --> 06:53:25.638 align:start position:0%
on saving money and anything that's
 
06:53:28.388 --> 06:53:28.398 align:start position:0%
anti-competitive just works in the wrong
 
06:53:31.910 --> 06:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
direction case of overc collections I I
 
06:53:34.350 --> 06:53:34.360 align:start position:0%
view that as is like tax returns it's
 
06:53:36.948 --> 06:53:36.958 align:start position:0%
nice to get a little extra money at the
 
06:53:39.190 --> 06:53:39.200 align:start position:0%
end of the year in April May whenever
 
06:53:40.868 --> 06:53:40.878 align:start position:0%
you get your tax
 
06:53:44.430 --> 06:53:44.440 align:start position:0%
return rather which would reduce future
 
06:53:48.310 --> 06:53:48.320 align:start position:0%
rates if that was the case and rather
 
06:53:49.868 --> 06:53:49.878 align:start position:0%
than to pay up
 
06:53:52.670 --> 06:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
front and then share those proceeds with
 
06:53:57.350 --> 06:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
everybody it just doesn't seem right and
 
06:54:00.910 --> 06:54:00.920 align:start position:0%
um you know Ju Just in summation uh New
 
06:54:03.070 --> 06:54:03.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has historically High rates
 
06:54:05.990 --> 06:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
for electricity as you look across the
 
06:54:09.150 --> 06:54:09.160 align:start position:0%
country this potentially limits our
 
06:54:12.110 --> 06:54:12.120 align:start position:0%
state to prosper as we know there's an
 
06:54:14.468 --> 06:54:14.478 align:start position:0%
ever increasing demand for electricity
 
06:54:16.670 --> 06:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
in all of what we do whether it's
 
06:54:20.388 --> 06:54:20.398 align:start position:0%
manufacturing AI technology
 
06:54:22.708 --> 06:54:22.718 align:start position:0%
computerization uh there's an expansion
 
06:54:24.788 --> 06:54:24.798 align:start position:0%
in electrification for
 
06:54:27.468 --> 06:54:27.478 align:start position:0%
heating and lastly we shouldn't forget
 
06:54:29.788 --> 06:54:29.798 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles so there's more and
 
06:54:31.830 --> 06:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
more electric demand as we go forward we
 
06:54:33.590 --> 06:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
need to get this right we need to have
 
06:54:35.270 --> 06:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
it competitive for
 
06:54:38.670 --> 06:54:38.680 align:start position:0%
all and um that's why I urge you to
 
06:54:41.350 --> 06:54:41.360 align:start position:0%
support H Bill 760 to preserve
 
06:54:44.548 --> 06:54:44.558 align:start position:0%
competitive electric suppliers for all
 
06:54:46.110 --> 06:54:46.120 align:start position:0%
in the state of New
 
06:54:47.830 --> 06:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I thank you for the
 
06:54:49.830 --> 06:54:49.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity to share my
 
06:54:51.910 --> 06:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
comments well we thank you for bringing
 
06:54:55.230 --> 06:54:55.240 align:start position:0%
them to us all the way from Ry thank you

06:55:01.310 --> 06:55:01.320 align:start position:0%
K representative McGee I guess I'll just
 
06:55:02.590 --> 06:55:02.600 align:start position:0%
ask when did you start with the
 
06:55:03.948 --> 06:55:03.958 align:start position:0%
community power Coalition that you've
 
06:55:06.830 --> 06:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
realized in March that much savings was
 
06:55:08.788 --> 06:55:08.798 align:start position:0%
what did you say well it was really uh
 
06:55:11.388 --> 06:55:11.398 align:start position:0%
in March is when we kicked off but April
 
06:55:13.788 --> 06:55:13.798 align:start position:0%
of just under two years ago so we were
 
06:55:15.948 --> 06:55:15.958 align:start position:0%
in the first wave of
 
06:55:20.750 --> 06:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
towns uh to endorse as CPC andh as our
 
06:55:23.110 --> 06:55:23.120 align:start position:0%
supplier thank you and I believe I saw
 
06:55:25.990 --> 06:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
you submitted online testimony right I
 
06:55:29.430 --> 06:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
received something I did not but I urged
 
06:55:32.830 --> 06:55:32.840 align:start position:0%
our select board to that consider
 
06:55:37.510 --> 06:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:41.468 --> 06:55:41.478 align:start position:0%
you okay seeing no further questions
 
06:55:43.270 --> 06:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr KET appreciate you being
 
06:55:46.590 --> 06:55:46.600 align:start position:0%
here thank you we'll give the last word
 
06:55:49.590 --> 06:55:49.600 align:start position:0%
on this legislation to Cliff
 
06:55:52.350 --> 06:55:52.360 align:start position:0%

Hampshire representing the exitor energy
 
06:55:55.360 --> 06:56:03.910 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representing the exitor energy
committee

06:56:03.910 --> 06:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:05.270 --> 06:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman boss and members of
 
06:56:07.110 --> 06:56:07.120 align:start position:0%
the committee it's a heavy burden to
 
06:56:09.388 --> 06:56:09.398 align:start position:0%
have the last word I guess uh but there
 
06:56:12.590 --> 06:56:12.600 align:start position:0%
have been a lot of words um and I've
 
06:56:14.868 --> 06:56:14.878 align:start position:0%
been here for a while this afternoon and
 
06:56:18.270 --> 06:56:18.280 align:start position:0%
I realized that I may be a little over
 
06:56:21.468 --> 06:56:21.478 align:start position:0%
my depth here um with the excellent
 
06:56:25.590 --> 06:56:25.600 align:start position:0%
testimony that's been made um I
 
06:56:28.548 --> 06:56:28.558 align:start position:0%
represent the energy uh the exitor
 
06:56:30.070 --> 06:56:30.080 align:start position:0%
energy committee I'm the chairman of
 
06:56:32.990 --> 06:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
that uh committee and um writing and
 
06:56:35.388 --> 06:56:35.398 align:start position:0%
here to express our strong support for
 
06:56:35.398 --> 06:56:36.270 align:start position:0%
here to express our strong support for
this

06:56:36.270 --> 06:56:36.280 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:56:40.708 --> 06:56:40.718 align:start position:0%
bill um as we see it it sort of uh
 
06:56:43.948 --> 06:56:43.958 align:start position:0%
clarifies what the limited purpose of
 
06:56:46.590 --> 06:56:46.600 align:start position:0%
the default service is supposed to
 
06:56:50.708 --> 06:56:50.718 align:start position:0%
be and and it would prohibit that cost
 
06:56:53.628 --> 06:56:53.638 align:start position:0%
shifting that has been you know
 
06:56:56.350 --> 06:56:56.360 align:start position:0%
discussed and described earlier in this
 
06:56:59.350 --> 06:56:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh in this um
 
06:57:03.070 --> 06:57:03.080 align:start position:0%
hearing um seems to to us that it makes
 
06:57:06.310 --> 06:57:06.320 align:start position:0%
some common sense straightforward
 
06:57:10.910 --> 06:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
changes in the language um of the
 
06:57:10.920 --> 06:57:13.030 align:start position:0%
changes in the language um of the
statute

06:57:13.030 --> 06:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
statute
 
06:57:16.388 --> 06:57:16.398 align:start position:0%
um especially when it comes to how uh
 
06:57:19.628 --> 06:57:19.638 align:start position:0%
default service is to be
 
06:57:22.350 --> 06:57:22.360 align:start position:0%
procured um our sense is that the recent
 
06:57:23.910 --> 06:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
changes at the
 
06:57:27.948 --> 06:57:27.958 align:start position:0%
puc um directing uh this change in
 
06:57:30.590 --> 06:57:30.600 align:start position:0%
procurement that would introduce um
 
06:57:34.548 --> 06:57:34.558 align:start position:0%
wholesale Market components to that um
 
06:57:37.628 --> 06:57:37.638 align:start position:0%
comes with quite a lot of
 
06:57:42.110 --> 06:57:42.120 align:start position:0%
risk and as uh representative G said so
 
06:57:43.868 --> 06:57:43.878 align:start position:0%
well at the beginning of this hearing
 
06:57:46.350 --> 06:57:46.360 align:start position:0%
that that risk in our opinion should
 
06:57:46.360 --> 06:57:47.310 align:start position:0%
that that risk in our opinion should
rest

06:57:47.310 --> 06:57:47.320 align:start position:0%
rest
 
06:57:49.868 --> 06:57:49.878 align:start position:0%
with um the people who are either
 
06:57:53.548 --> 06:57:53.558 align:start position:0%
benefiting or being harmed by that
 
06:57:57.750 --> 06:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
risk um we presume that the change U
 
06:57:59.788 --> 06:57:59.798 align:start position:0%
from the Pu is
 
06:58:04.788 --> 06:58:04.798 align:start position:0%
is being recommended being proposed to
 
06:58:09.628 --> 06:58:09.638 align:start position:0%
um avoid that um risk premium that uh Mr
 
06:58:14.430 --> 06:58:14.440 align:start position:0%
Lata referred to um and that's fine um
 
06:58:18.430 --> 06:58:18.440 align:start position:0%
but what's not fine is um attributing
 
06:58:21.910 --> 06:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
that risk to all to all customers that
 
06:58:24.350 --> 06:58:24.360 align:start position:0%
sort of violates that principle that the
 
06:58:28.110 --> 06:58:28.120 align:start position:0%
the risks should lie with um those um
 
06:58:28.120 --> 06:58:29.350 align:start position:0%
the risks should lie with um those um
causing

06:58:29.350 --> 06:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
causing
 
06:58:33.388 --> 06:58:33.398 align:start position:0%
it um one further concern that we have
 
06:58:38.670 --> 06:58:38.680 align:start position:0%
is that um this setup that um allows the
 
06:58:43.788 --> 06:58:43.798 align:start position:0%
risk to be um socialized to be spread
 
06:58:45.708 --> 06:58:45.718 align:start position:0%
sort of creates
 
06:58:50.190 --> 06:58:50.200 align:start position:0%
a um an incentive to um underestimate
 
06:58:52.788 --> 06:58:52.798 align:start position:0%
the cost of the of the default
 
06:58:56.670 --> 06:58:56.680 align:start position:0%
service and when sort of moral hazard
 
06:58:59.868 --> 06:58:59.878 align:start position:0%
territory and I think that um that's
 
06:59:02.628 --> 06:59:02.638 align:start position:0%
something that is just not a good idea
 
06:59:05.910 --> 06:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
and and not necessary we think that as
 
06:59:09.310 --> 06:59:09.320 align:start position:0%
the cpcn just said that would have the
 
06:59:12.190 --> 06:59:12.200 align:start position:0%
effect of undermining the viability of
 
06:59:12.200 --> 06:59:13.230 align:start position:0%
effect of undermining the viability of
community

06:59:13.230 --> 06:59:13.240 align:start position:0%
community
 
06:59:19.150 --> 06:59:19.160 align:start position:0%
power and as with Ry um exitor was in
 
06:59:23.070 --> 06:59:23.080 align:start position:0%
the first um group of communities that
 
06:59:24.788 --> 06:59:24.798 align:start position:0%
uh that started Community power with
 
06:59:27.990 --> 06:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
cpcn and we have seen similar benefits
 
06:59:29.708 --> 06:59:29.718 align:start position:0%
really kind of startling
 
06:59:34.070 --> 06:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
benefits um in our time with
 
06:59:37.990 --> 06:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
cpcn we've seen a a net savings for our
 
06:59:40.070 --> 06:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
customers of $1.3
 
06:59:44.868 --> 06:59:44.878 align:start position:0%
million average of $400 per customer
 
06:59:48.388 --> 06:59:48.398 align:start position:0%
over um that two and a half year
 
06:59:52.430 --> 06:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
period um it's been a win-win for us and
 
06:59:54.590 --> 06:59:54.600 align:start position:0%
we would hate to see anything
 
06:59:57.670 --> 06:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
happen uh because of pu policy or
 
06:59:59.708 --> 06:59:59.718 align:start position:0%
otherwise that would undermine it
 
07:00:02.510 --> 07:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
undermine the viability of it and so we
 
07:00:05.190 --> 07:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
would urge you to support this Bill
 
07:00:05.200 --> 07:00:06.788 align:start position:0%
would urge you to support this Bill
thank

07:00:06.788 --> 07:00:06.798 align:start position:0%
thank
 
07:00:09.230 --> 07:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
you okay thank
 
07:00:14.270 --> 07:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
you any questions for Mr
 
07:00:18.270 --> 07:00:18.280 align:start position:0%
s seeing none that's the last pink card
 
07:00:20.750 --> 07:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
I have so we're going to close the
 
07:00:24.628 --> 07:00:24.638 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 760
 
07:00:27.548 --> 07:00:27.558 align:start position:0%
FN and before we leave for the day I
 
07:00:30.948 --> 07:00:30.958 align:start position:0%
just want to let everybody know where we
 
07:00:30.958 --> 07:00:33.270 align:start position:0%
just want to let everybody know where we
stand

07:00:33.270 --> 07:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
stand
 
07:00:36.830 --> 07:00:36.840 align:start position:0%
as uh next week of course will be a
 
07:00:38.948 --> 07:00:38.958 align:start position:0%
vacation week a week off we won't be
 
07:00:42.110 --> 07:00:42.120 align:start position:0%
meeting at all and uh so we won't be
 
07:00:45.830 --> 07:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
back here until March the
 
07:00:50.270 --> 07:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
3 and as it stands right now on March
 
07:00:54.430 --> 07:00:54.440 align:start position:0%
the 3 we will need to have an executive
 
07:00:57.788 --> 07:00:57.798 align:start position:0%
session on four bills that are early
 
07:01:00.990 --> 07:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
bills that need to be to the clerk by
 
07:01:04.388 --> 07:01:04.398 align:start position:0%
March 5th those are hb2
 
07:01:06.628 --> 07:01:06.638 align:start position:0%
219 HB
 
07:01:09.030 --> 07:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
567 HB
 
07:01:11.708 --> 07:01:11.718 align:start position:0%
9696 and HB
 
07:01:14.830 --> 07:01:14.840 align:start position:0%
764 so we will definitely have an exec
 
07:01:17.670 --> 07:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
session on Monday March
 
07:01:20.070 --> 07:01:20.080 align:start position:0%
3rd in addition to that as I look
 
07:01:21.990 --> 07:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
through the list of bills I see that we
 
07:01:23.510 --> 07:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
only have three
 
07:01:26.548 --> 07:01:26.558 align:start position:0%
bills remaining that need a public
 
07:01:29.910 --> 07:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
hearing so that same day Monday March
 
07:01:32.468 --> 07:01:32.478 align:start position:0%
3rd we will have public hearings on the
 
07:01:37.788 --> 07:01:37.798 align:start position:0%
 
07:01:41.388 --> 07:01:41.398 align:start position:0%
us Tuesday we very likely we'll meet
 
07:01:44.708 --> 07:01:44.718 align:start position:0%
again to have exec session because at
 
07:01:47.110 --> 07:01:47.120 align:start position:0%
that point we will have heard all the
 
07:01:50.190 --> 07:01:50.200 align:start position:0%
bills and so we probably need to have
 
07:01:52.670 --> 07:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
some work sessions and exec sessions to
 
07:01:54.750 --> 07:01:54.760 align:start position:0%
figure out what to do with the rest of
 
07:01:54.760 --> 07:01:55.388 align:start position:0%
figure out what to do with the rest of
the

07:01:55.388 --> 07:01:55.398 align:start position:0%
the
 
07:01:58.750 --> 07:01:58.760 align:start position:0%
bills so that is the tentative plan I
 
07:02:00.708 --> 07:02:00.718 align:start position:0%
hope you all enjoy your week off next
 
07:02:05.788 --> 07:02:05.798 align:start position:0%
week and and we'll see you Thursday in
 
07:02:07.750 --> 07:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
