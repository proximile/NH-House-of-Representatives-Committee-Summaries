Dave Borden passed away Wednesday May
 
00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
3rd 2023 he was born April 14 1936 and
 
00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:21.180 align:start position:0%
raised on a Farm in Vermont as you heard
 
00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:22.980 align:start position:0%
his fingerprints can be found all over
 
00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:25.140 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire on projects that will
 
00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:27.660 align:start position:0%
continue to benefit Granite Staters one
 
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
of his last projects was to initiate in
 
00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
the town of Newcastle the safe path
 
00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
which affords a safe walking path along
 
00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
Route 1B all through Newcastle for
 
00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839 align:start position:0%
children going to School Walkers Runners
 
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
families with strollers the path is
 
00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:43.980 align:start position:0%
nearing completion
 
00:12:46.009 --> 00:12:46.019 align:start position:0%
Newcastle is a small tightly knit
 
00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
Community where word travels quickly
 
00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:51.180 align:start position:0%
so when David decided not to run again
 
00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:53.700 align:start position:0%
word got back to me that my name was
 
00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:55.980 align:start position:0%
being bandied about as someone to run
 
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
for his seat
 
00:12:59.810 --> 00:12:59.820 align:start position:0%
I'd never considered the eye before the
 
00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:01.740 align:start position:0%
idea before and my first reaction is
 
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
I knew there was going to be a meeting
 
00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:09.959 align:start position:0%
to discuss the possibility of my running
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
and I figured I had better go to protect
 
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
myself from absentee volunteerism
 
00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
you know when you leave to use the
 
00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
restroom and you come back and now your
 
00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:22.260 align:start position:0%
chair no
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
yet after the meeting and hearing people
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
talk I could reconsider it and here I am
 
00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:28.980 align:start position:0%
David took on the role of Mentor teacher
 
00:13:32.509 --> 00:13:32.519 align:start position:0%
Guardian Angel debate partner so so many
 
00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
roles I could not list he told me that
 
00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
he would go campaigning with me door to
 
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
door in Newcastle and in Rye we walked
 
00:13:43.069 --> 00:13:43.079 align:start position:0%
and we cycled and we drove I was the
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
only one who fell off the bike
 
00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
and I wish I knew how many miles that we
 
00:13:50.329 --> 00:13:50.339 align:start position:0%
traveled every time before we went out I
 
00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:52.620 align:start position:0%
told him you don't have to go with me I
 
00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
can do this by myself and there are tons
 
00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:55.980 align:start position:0%
of other people who are willing to go
 
00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:56.940 align:start position:0%
with me
 
00:13:59.030 --> 00:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
he told me that he wasn't exactly doing
 
00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
this for me even though he was but he
 
00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:04.380 align:start position:0%
went on to add that he was doing this so
 
00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:06.959 align:start position:0%
that when my tenure was over it would be
 
00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:09.420 align:start position:0%
my turn to go door to door with the
 
00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:11.700 align:start position:0%
person who followed me just as he was
 
00:14:14.269 --> 00:14:14.279 align:start position:0%
doing with me now I did not know that
 
00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:16.500 align:start position:0%
was going to be part of the job but I
 
00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:18.060 align:start position:0%
can see that's exactly what I will be
 
00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:19.740 align:start position:0%
doing it's like thanks a lot David for
 
00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:20.930 align:start position:0%
doing it's like thanks a lot David for
that

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:20.940 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
but this defines an important
 
00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.170 align:start position:0%
but this defines an important
characteristic

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:24.180 align:start position:0%
characteristic
 
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
which made David so special
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
did not think a lot about the president
 
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:36.060 align:start position:0%
he was thinking always of the long long
 
00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:38.030 align:start position:0%
he was thinking always of the long long
game

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:38.040 align:start position:0%
game
 
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
he was never thinking of himself he was
 
00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:43.260 align:start position:0%
thinking of others he was the farmer who
 
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
planted the trees that he would never
 
00:14:47.629 --> 00:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
taste but that would be enjoyed and
 
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
valued by every subsequent generation
 
00:14:51.769 --> 00:14:51.779 align:start position:0%
there are many of these trees in
 
00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:54.180 align:start position:0%
Newcastle many more across the state of
 
00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:55.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:14:59.210 --> 00:14:59.220 align:start position:0%
this is his legacy and this creates and
 
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:02.220 align:start position:0%
ensures his immortality thank you David

Amendment 1676 to SB 128. almost every
 
00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:47.220 align:start position:0%
day our constituents ask us to do more
 
00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
to address the lack of mental health
 
00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:50.940 align:start position:0%
services available available to them

while we can and should do more we
 
00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:55.500 align:start position:0%
should most certainly refrain from
 
00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:57.480 align:start position:0%
making things worse something this

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill that this amendment
 
00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
impacts would make three changes related

00:24:09.289 --> 00:24:09.299 align:start position:0%
whether there is probable cause to
 
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:11.460 align:start position:0%
continue to hold the individual
 
00:24:13.549 --> 00:24:13.559 align:start position:0%
these hearings must occur within three
 
00:24:15.049 --> 00:24:15.059 align:start position:0%
days of the transport to the hospital
 
00:24:16.669 --> 00:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
and a person could be held up to 10
 
00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
working days under certain circumstances
 
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
if the court ultimately finds a probable
 
00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:22.740 align:start position:0%
cause the person may be required to
 
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
remain in emergency departments for an
 
00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:26.700 align:start position:0%
extended period of time with little to
 
00:24:29.210 --> 00:24:29.220 align:start position:0%
no psychiatric treatment until a bed is
 
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
available at New Hampshire hospital or
 
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
another appropriate facility
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
during this process New Hampshire law
 
00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:37.020 align:start position:0%
rightfully requires that the person
 
00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:39.480 align:start position:0%
facing institutionalization must have
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
legal representation typically one of
 
00:24:44.029 --> 00:24:44.039 align:start position:0%
the small panel attorneys contracted
 
00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
with the state is appointed to represent
 
00:24:47.690 --> 00:24:47.700 align:start position:0%
the individual
 
00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:50.340 align:start position:0%
this amendment would require non-indage
 
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
Indigent individuals to pay for their
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
court appointed attorneys a cost which
 
00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
currently averages a hundred dollars per
 
00:24:59.930 --> 00:24:59.940 align:start position:0%
iea case and may not exceed 600 per
 
00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:02.220 align:start position:0%
involuntary commitment cases
 
00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:04.620 align:start position:0%
if the court cannot determine indigency
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
which will likely be which will be
 
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
likely in most cases the office of Cost
 
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
Containment makes the determination and
 
00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
could pursue collection
 
00:25:15.649 --> 00:25:15.659 align:start position:0%
at first blush this amendment might seem
 
00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:17.940 align:start position:0%
fair it says if someone is Indigent and
 
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
cannot pay for legal representation they
 
00:25:22.669 --> 00:25:22.679 align:start position:0%
should not pay and the alternative if
 
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
they are not Indigent they should pay
 
00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:27.900 align:start position:0%
legal representation costs the amendment
 
00:25:30.169 --> 00:25:30.179 align:start position:0%
resolves any free rider problem to the
 
00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:32.340 align:start position:0%
extent it exists it would seem
 
00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:34.140 align:start position:0%
but the Amendments of study and Paradox
 
00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:35.940 align:start position:0%
while it may appear to make things fair
 
00:25:38.029 --> 00:25:38.039 align:start position:0%
and serve the taxpayer interests it does
 
00:25:39.409 --> 00:25:39.419 align:start position:0%
just the opposite
 
00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:41.700 align:start position:0%
to begin with it is fundamentally unfair
 
00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:43.140 align:start position:0%
to force someone in a mental health
 
00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:44.450 align:start position:0%
to force someone in a mental health
crisis

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:44.460 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:46.380 align:start position:0%
for required legal represent
 
00:25:48.649 --> 00:25:48.659 align:start position:0%
representation in a proceeding intended
 
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
to deprive them of their Liberty and
 
00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:52.860 align:start position:0%
brought against them only because they
 
00:25:54.409 --> 00:25:54.419 align:start position:0%
are in crisis they would be forced to
 
00:25:55.490 --> 00:25:55.500 align:start position:0%
pay for that
 
00:25:57.409 --> 00:25:57.419 align:start position:0%
quite apart from the means testing
 
00:25:59.570 --> 00:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
contemplated by this amendment consider
 
00:26:02.330 --> 00:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
this imbalancing fairness even if
 
00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:04.740 align:start position:0%
someone has the ability to pay is it
 
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
fair we require them to pay for state
 
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
required legal representation in a
 
00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:11.820 align:start position:0%
required hearing they didn't ask for and
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
one that could result in the state
 
00:26:15.409 --> 00:26:15.419 align:start position:0%
taking away their Liberty and focusing
 
00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:17.460 align:start position:0%
them forcing them into treatment
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
worse yet and however improbable what if
 
00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
a judge determines that no probable
 
00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
cause to commit exists in that case
 
00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:26.580 align:start position:0%
should we require anyone even those with
 
00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:29.220 align:start position:0%
or without means to pay for required
 
00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:31.620 align:start position:0%
legal representation this amendment
 
00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:33.900 align:start position:0%
requires that result
 
00:26:36.049 --> 00:26:36.059 align:start position:0%
moreover and we heard testimonies this
 
00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:37.860 align:start position:0%
effect pursuing collection of a payment
 
00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:39.900 align:start position:0%
only exacerbates someone's Mental Health
 
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
crisis thus effectively contributing to
 
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
the very conditions that led to the
 
00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:47.340 align:start position:0%
involuntary proceeding
 
00:26:48.769 --> 00:26:48.779 align:start position:0%
and importantly it's unfair to remember
 
00:26:51.409 --> 00:26:51.419 align:start position:0%
this that the taxpayer this is unfair to
 
00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer because the real costs
 
00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:55.740 align:start position:0%
associated with determining and pursuing
 
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
someone who might be able to pay exceeds
 
00:26:59.570 --> 00:26:59.580 align:start position:0%
the amount the state would ever recover
 
00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
in reality the overwhelming majority of
 
00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
individuals facing commitment are
 
00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
Indigent thus qualifying the state for
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
state subsidy subsidization
 
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
this makes sense people with means have
 
00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:14.100 align:start position:0%
access to prevent the occurrence of an
 
00:27:15.529 --> 00:27:15.539 align:start position:0%
extreme Mental Health crisis in the
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
first place and chances are less likely
 
00:27:19.250 --> 00:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
that they're going to find themselves in
 
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
a situation where a court determines
 
00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:22.500 align:start position:0%
whether they should be involuntarily
 
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
admitted in other words the pool of
 
00:27:27.409 --> 00:27:27.419 align:start position:0%
people who might not qualify for State
 
00:27:30.049 --> 00:27:30.059 align:start position:0%
subsidized legal representation is small
 
00:27:32.269 --> 00:27:32.279 align:start position:0%
is it even exists
 
00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:34.740 align:start position:0%
so this amendment effectively focuses on
 
00:27:36.649 --> 00:27:36.659 align:start position:0%
seeking repayment from a tiny fraction
 
00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
if that of non-indigent individuals to
 
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
be pursued for collection
 
00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:43.860 align:start position:0%
the costs associated with this effort
 
00:27:45.649 --> 00:27:45.659 align:start position:0%
investigating individuals Financial
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
circumstances filing to seek a court
 
00:27:50.810 --> 00:27:50.820 align:start position:0%
order for repayment are quite high but
 
00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:53.220 align:start position:0%
the benefits are quite low as we heard
 
00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:55.020 align:start position:0%
from one witness the office of cost
 
00:27:57.049 --> 00:27:57.059 align:start position:0%
containment's efforts our collection at
 
00:27:59.870 --> 00:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
collection are typically quote less than
 
00:28:02.269 --> 00:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
successful and even investigating
 
00:28:04.370 --> 00:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
whether someone's not Indigent carries
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
significant transaction and opportunity
 
00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity costs
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
some the amendment creates costs two
 
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
Hydro the taxpayer and too high in cost
 
00:28:15.409 --> 00:28:15.419 align:start position:0%
of disregarding principles of
 
00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:17.400 align:start position:0%
fundamental fairness and I urge my
 
00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:18.900 align:start position:0%
colleagues to reject this Amanda thank
 
00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
you Mr Speaker
 
00:28:28.130 --> 00:28:28.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
colleagues I rise in support of
 
00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:36.620 align:start position:0%
amendment 2023 1676 to SB 128.
 
00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
SB 128 as it came to us from the other
 
00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:41.940 align:start position:0%
body does two things
 
00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
first it transfers responsibility for
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
making payments for legal counsel
 
00:28:48.169 --> 00:28:48.179 align:start position:0%
provided to Indigent persons sought to
 
00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
be involuntarily admitted to the state's
 
00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:52.260 align:start position:0%
mental health system from the Department
 
00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:54.900 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services where such
 
00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility currently lies to the
 
00:28:59.510 --> 00:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
judicial Council which is responsible
 
00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:01.260 align:start position:0%
for the payment of legal counsel for
 
00:29:03.649 --> 00:29:03.659 align:start position:0%
other types of cases such as criminal
 
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
Juvenile and abuse and neglect cases
 
00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:08.220 align:start position:0%
this part of the bill makes perfect
 
00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:10.140 align:start position:0%
sense and nothing in the proposed
 
00:29:12.049 --> 00:29:12.059 align:start position:0%
amendment changes this aspect of the
 
00:29:12.059 --> 00:29:12.769 align:start position:0%
amendment changes this aspect of the
bill

00:29:12.769 --> 00:29:12.779 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
however the other thing that the bill
 
00:29:17.210 --> 00:29:17.220 align:start position:0%
does is to eliminate the requirement
 
00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:19.860 align:start position:0%
that persons who can afford to pay for
 
00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:23.340 align:start position:0%
legal counsel be required to do so the
 
00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:25.260 align:start position:0%
requirement that persons who can afford
 
00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
to do so pay for legal counsel in
 
00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
involuntarily admission admission
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
proceedings has been a part of our law
 
00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
since RSA chapter 135c was first enacted
 
00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:40.500 align:start position:0%
in 1986 and I respectfully submit there
 
00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
has been no showing made of any reason
 
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
to change that requirement yet the way
 
00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
SB 128 is currently worded if a very
 
00:29:51.889 --> 00:29:51.899 align:start position:0%
wealthy person and yes it is not only
 
00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
poor people who can suffer from mental
 
00:29:56.330 --> 00:29:56.340 align:start position:0%
from mental illness were petitioned to
 
00:29:58.669 --> 00:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
be involuntarily admitted such person
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
would have the right to a
 
00:30:01.789 --> 00:30:01.799 align:start position:0%
court-appointed attorney and the state
 
00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
would have no ability to recover payment
 
00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
of the costs of providing such services
 
00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:08.700 align:start position:0%
from the person in question
 
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
there is simply no valid reason for
 
00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:13.860 align:start position:0%
placing this cost person burden on the
 
00:30:15.889 --> 00:30:15.899 align:start position:0%
taxpayers when the person in question
 
00:30:18.889 --> 00:30:18.899 align:start position:0%
has the ability to repay the amendment
 
00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:20.820 align:start position:0%
before you changes this part of the bill
 
00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
so as to uh so as to require repayment
 
00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
of the costs from and I have to
 
00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:28.380 align:start position:0%
emphasize this from persons who are able
 
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
to do so
 
00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:32.220 align:start position:0%
let me now address the arguments
 
00:30:34.669 --> 00:30:34.679 align:start position:0%
advanced in opposition to this amendment
 
00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
first it is claimed that per that
 
00:30:38.630 --> 00:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
person's facing involuntary emergency
 
00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:41.240 align:start position:0%
admission are often in a highly volatile
 
00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:43.860 align:start position:0%
emotional state and that requiring them
 
00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
to pay for their Council will only
 
00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
increase uh their uh their emotional
 
00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.070 align:start position:0%
increase uh their uh their emotional
distress

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
distress
 
00:30:51.529 --> 00:30:51.539 align:start position:0%
persons petition for involuntarily
 
00:30:54.169 --> 00:30:54.179 align:start position:0%
admission often are upset and emotional
 
00:30:56.930 --> 00:30:56.940 align:start position:0%
however it is the fact of this happening
 
00:30:59.090 --> 00:30:59.100 align:start position:0%
in the first place that is likely the
 
00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:01.380 align:start position:0%
greatest cause of their upset wait
 
00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
against the emotional reaction of being
 
00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:05.700 align:start position:0%
hauled off to a receiving facility
 
00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:08.220 align:start position:0%
usually a hospital and brought before a
 
00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:10.740 align:start position:0%
judge for a hearing having to pay for an
 
00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:13.500 align:start position:0%
attorney likely pales in comparison it
 
00:31:15.289 --> 00:31:15.299 align:start position:0%
is also important to note that in many
 
00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:17.340 align:start position:0%
of these cases the person is
 
00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:19.620 align:start position:0%
involuntarily held at a hospital as I
 
00:31:21.409 --> 00:31:21.419 align:start position:0%
said and if the person doesn't have
 
00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and and can afford to repay for
 
00:31:27.169 --> 00:31:27.179 align:start position:0%
the time spent at the hospital the
 
00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:29.340 align:start position:0%
person is responsible for those costs
 
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
which again are likely to be much
 
00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
greater than the cost of an attorney
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
second it is asserted that persons who
 
00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
are candidates for involuntary emergency
 
00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
admission will not be able to complete
 
00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
the financial affidavit necessary to
 
00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
determine if they qualify for appointed
 
00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:46.980 align:start position:0%
counsel especially because of the short
 
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:49.200 align:start position:0%
three-day time period in which the court
 
00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:52.140 align:start position:0%
must hold a hearing in such cases this
 
00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
is a very legitimate concern but based
 
00:31:57.649 --> 00:31:57.659 align:start position:0%
on conversations I had with judge Keene
 
00:31:59.330 --> 00:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
of the circuit court and with
 
00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner arlinghaus of the
 
00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:02.360 align:start position:0%
Department of administrative Services
 
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
the amendment is specifically drafted to
 
00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
deal with this situation it says that if
 
00:32:10.909 --> 00:32:10.919 align:start position:0%
the court is unable to determine whether
 
00:32:13.669 --> 00:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
a person qualifies for appointed counsel
 
00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
because of the person's emotional state
 
00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:18.500 align:start position:0%
the court must appoint counsel anyway
 
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
and then the court is directed to refer
 
00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:22.559 align:start position:0%
the matter to the office of Cost
 
00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
Containment in the department of
 
00:32:26.450 --> 00:32:26.460 align:start position:0%
administrative services this is the
 
00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
office that has been in existence for a
 
00:32:30.529 --> 00:32:30.539 align:start position:0%
long time and whose Duty it is to
 
00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:32.100 align:start position:0%
collect repayment of the cost of
 
00:32:34.669 --> 00:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
attorneys provided by the state to
 
00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:37.020 align:start position:0%
persons in various types of cases not
 
00:32:39.409 --> 00:32:39.419 align:start position:0%
just involuntary admission under the
 
00:32:41.090 --> 00:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
amendment The Cost Containment office
 
00:32:43.789 --> 00:32:43.799 align:start position:0%
looks into the matter after the fact
 
00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:46.500 align:start position:0%
that is after the hearing is over and
 
00:32:48.769 --> 00:32:48.779 align:start position:0%
the person presumably has had a chance
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
to calm down the office of Cost
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
Containment decides whether the person
 
00:32:55.370 --> 00:32:55.380 align:start position:0%
was Indigent and whether the person has
 
00:32:58.010 --> 00:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
the ability to repay it then provides a
 
00:32:59.570 --> 00:32:59.580 align:start position:0%
report and recommendation to the court
 
00:33:01.549 --> 00:33:01.559 align:start position:0%
which makes the final decision on
 
00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
whether the person has the ability to
 
00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.130 align:start position:0%
whether the person has the ability to
repay

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:04.140 align:start position:0%
repay
 
00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
please note that in many of this these
 
00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
situations it may be obvious from the
 
00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
facts presented at the hearing that the
 
00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:14.100 align:start position:0%
person is Indigent and can't afford to
 
00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:16.380 align:start position:0%
pay for example if the police are a
 
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
family member show that the person has
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
been homeless for several months and has
 
00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:23.820 align:start position:0%
been begging for food that very likely
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
is sufficient for the court to make a
 
00:33:27.049 --> 00:33:27.059 align:start position:0%
finding that the person is Indigent and
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
does not have the ability to repay
 
00:33:30.769 --> 00:33:30.779 align:start position:0%
without ever making other without even
 
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
needing to make a referral to the office
 
00:33:35.810 --> 00:33:35.820 align:start position:0%
of Cost Containment if a referral is
 
00:33:37.549 --> 00:33:37.559 align:start position:0%
made and Cost Containment determines
 
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
that the person does have the ability to
 
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
repay it will so inform the court and
 
00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:43.919 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry it does not have the ability
 
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
to repay
 
00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:47.220 align:start position:0%
Cost Containment again can so inform the
 
00:33:48.889 --> 00:33:48.899 align:start position:0%
court and the court can waive the right
 
00:33:50.330 --> 00:33:50.340 align:start position:0%
of repayment
 
00:33:52.269 --> 00:33:52.279 align:start position:0%
Cost Containment
 
00:33:55.549 --> 00:33:55.559 align:start position:0%
may also determine I may also recommend
 
00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
where it is determined that it will cost
 
00:33:58.789 --> 00:33:58.799 align:start position:0%
the state more to attempt to collect
 
00:34:00.769 --> 00:34:00.779 align:start position:0%
than it is likely to require to recover
 
00:34:03.889 --> 00:34:03.899 align:start position:0%
that no effort at recovery should be
 
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
made the amendment is designed to give
 
00:34:08.450 --> 00:34:08.460 align:start position:0%
the courts and the office of Cost
 
00:34:11.629 --> 00:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
Containment maximum flexibility to
 
00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:13.740 align:start position:0%
ensure that repayment is ordered only
 
00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:15.720 align:start position:0%
where the person actually has the
 
00:34:17.149 --> 00:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
ability to do so
 
00:34:19.609 --> 00:34:19.619 align:start position:0%
third it is argued that persons sought
 
00:34:21.290 --> 00:34:21.300 align:start position:0%
to be involuntarily admitted shouldn't
 
00:34:23.089 --> 00:34:23.099 align:start position:0%
have to pay for their lawyers because
 
00:34:24.889 --> 00:34:24.899 align:start position:0%
they didn't ask to have such proceedings
 
00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
brought against them
 
00:34:29.089 --> 00:34:29.099 align:start position:0%
but the same could be said about any
 
00:34:31.790 --> 00:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
person who is named as a defendant in
 
00:34:34.129 --> 00:34:34.139 align:start position:0%
any civil or criminal proceeding brought
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
against them by the state or even by a
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
private party yet except in in very
 
00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:41.820 align:start position:0%
limited circumstances all such persons
 
00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
are responsible for paying for their own
 
00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:46.020 align:start position:0%
Legal Services that's what's known as
 
00:34:49.129 --> 00:34:49.139 align:start position:0%
the American rule uh in in the legal
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
system you pay for your you pay for your
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
own attorney
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
two other quick points the right to
 
00:34:57.890 --> 00:34:57.900 align:start position:0%
counsel under chapter 135 applies not
 
00:35:00.109 --> 00:35:00.119 align:start position:0%
only to emergency involuntary admissions
 
00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
but also to non-emergency involuntary
 
00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
admissions which involve admissions for
 
00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
longer than 10 days and where Court
 
00:35:09.770 --> 00:35:09.780 align:start position:0%
proceedings can be longer more
 
00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
complicated and more costly to the state
 
00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
than the 100 fee typically pay to an
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
attorney for the Emergency hearings the
 
00:35:19.250 --> 00:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on this bill estimates that
 
00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
the total expenditure for year for
 
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
Council Services is approximately 1.5
 
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
million dollars for these types of cases
 
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
this is only the amount for the
 
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
attorney's fees and does not include the
 
00:35:34.609 --> 00:35:34.619 align:start position:0%
costs for related services such as
 
00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
investigators or expert Witnesses which
 
00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:39.420 align:start position:0%
sometimes can be far more than the cost
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
for attorneys
 
00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
although the state will not be able to
 
00:35:46.069 --> 00:35:46.079 align:start position:0%
recover all of these funds I submit that
 
00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:49.140 align:start position:0%
fiscal Prudence to the taxpayers demands
 
00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:51.300 align:start position:0%
that the state state make reasonable
 
00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:53.460 align:start position:0%
efforts to recover as much as is
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
possible from persons again who persons
 
00:35:59.630 --> 00:35:59.640 align:start position:0%
who are in a position to repay I
 
00:36:02.329 --> 00:36:02.339 align:start position:0%
therefore urge you to support the
 
00:36:06.109 --> 00:36:06.119 align:start position:0%
bipartisan uh committee amendment to
 
00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:08.520 align:start position:0%

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.170 align:start position:0%
Speaker and I would ask for a division
vote

that was a lot of words
 
00:36:22.450 --> 00:36:23.089 align:start position:0%
that was a lot of words
[Music]

00:36:23.089 --> 00:36:23.099 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:36:23.099 --> 00:36:24.230 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:25.430 align:start position:0%
um
but

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
out of it I I think most of us want to
 
00:36:29.930 --> 00:36:29.940 align:start position:0%
know if someone can repay they would
 
00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
have to repay how much how much are we
 
00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
talking about what isn't it capped
 
00:36:35.329 --> 00:36:35.339 align:start position:0%
what's the amount these people would
 
00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
have to repay if you can
 
00:36:40.849 --> 00:36:40.859 align:start position:0%
yes under the under the law as it now
 
00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
stands and this bill would not change
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
this aspect of it the amount of the fees
 
00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:48.180 align:start position:0%
for attorneys are set by the court and
 
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
as representative of the as the prior
 
00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:52.380 align:start position:0%

purpose of transferring the cost of

legal counsel from the Department of
 
00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:38.700 align:start position:0%
Human Services to the judicial Council
 
00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
if I know that people in involuntary
 
00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:43.069 align:start position:0%
if I know that people in involuntary
commitment

00:38:43.069 --> 00:38:43.079 align:start position:0%
commitment
 
00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:44.820 align:start position:0%
do not have
 
00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
the wherewithal to choose about legal
 
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:50.760 align:start position:0%

Mr Speaker if I know that

recovery cost agents
 
00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:20.940 align:start position:0%
are likely to impair the ability for
 
00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:22.320 align:start position:0%
someone who has gone through an
 
00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:24.540 align:start position:0%

00:48:30.349 --> 00:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:48:35.569 --> 00:48:35.579 align:start position:0%
I rise today in opposition to SB 120 FN
 
00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
because those of us on the Ways and
 
00:48:40.089 --> 00:48:40.099 align:start position:0%
Means Committee who recommended the itl
 
00:48:43.130 --> 00:48:43.140 align:start position:0%
agreed that increasing the maximum
 
00:48:47.270 --> 00:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
single wager from 10 to 50 dollars goes
 
00:48:48.589 --> 00:48:48.599 align:start position:0%
too far
 
00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
however we do support an interim step of
 
00:48:54.530 --> 00:48:54.540 align:start position:0%
moving to 25 dollars before the fifty
 
00:48:58.609 --> 00:48:58.619 align:start position:0%
dollar limit is voted into law
 
00:49:01.069 --> 00:49:01.079 align:start position:0%
or limit is a responsible move that
 
00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
would increase revenue for chosen
 
00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:05.700 align:start position:0%
non-profits and mitigate potential
 
00:49:07.910 --> 00:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
losses to players
 
00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
going to fifty dollars is a five-fold
 
00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:12.890 align:start position:0%
going to fifty dollars is a five-fold
increase

00:49:12.890 --> 00:49:12.900 align:start position:0%
increase
 
00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
over current law
 
00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
and the legislature does have the power
 
00:49:19.250 --> 00:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
to go to fifty dollars once we see how
 
00:49:22.010 --> 00:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
the market responds
 
00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:25.740 align:start position:0%
SB 51 is another reason to wait on this
 
00:49:28.370 --> 00:49:28.380 align:start position:0%
vote it creates a study commission that
 
00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
will look at our New Hampshire
 
00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:34.280 align:start position:0%
non-profit gaming structure
 
00:49:36.650 --> 00:49:36.660 align:start position:0%
including the revenue from historic
 
00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
horse racing changes to the selection
 
00:49:42.589 --> 00:49:42.599 align:start position:0%
and allocation of funds to non-profits
 
00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:44.700 align:start position:0%
and the effects of wagering on our New
 
00:49:46.550 --> 00:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens
 
00:49:49.370 --> 00:49:49.380 align:start position:0%
we'll have those results by November of
 
00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:51.290 align:start position:0%
we'll have those results by November of
2024.

00:49:51.290 --> 00:49:51.300 align:start position:0%
2024.
 
00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:52.740 align:start position:0%
so it's prudent to wait for the
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
committee's findings before making this
 
00:49:58.130 --> 00:49:58.140 align:start position:0%
bold move today
 
00:50:00.829 --> 00:50:00.839 align:start position:0%
if you believe that gambling becomes an
 
00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:04.140 align:start position:0%
addiction when people lose money they
 
00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
cannot afford
 
00:50:08.569 --> 00:50:08.579 align:start position:0%
and seek to save themselves by gambling
 
00:50:08.579 --> 00:50:10.130 align:start position:0%
and seek to save themselves by gambling
more

00:50:10.130 --> 00:50:10.140 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:50:12.530 --> 00:50:12.540 align:start position:0%
let's give the 25 limit a try before
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
moving to 50 and consider the findings
 
00:50:18.290 --> 00:50:18.300 align:start position:0%
proposed by the study Commission
 
00:50:19.790 --> 00:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
I believe we'll make a more informed
 
00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:21.540 align:start position:0%
decision about the risks of problem
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
gambling and the amount of money raised
 
00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
for the chosen New Hampshire nonprofits
 
00:50:30.349 --> 00:50:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:50:41.329 --> 00:50:41.339 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker colleagues I rise in support
 
00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:45.660 align:start position:0%
of SB 120 which makes a host of changes
 
00:50:47.809 --> 00:50:47.819 align:start position:0%
to current law governing charitable
 
00:50:47.819 --> 00:50:48.890 align:start position:0%
to current law governing charitable
gaming

00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:48.900 align:start position:0%
gaming
 
00:50:53.049 --> 00:50:53.059 align:start position:0%
essentially for the purpose of reducing
 
00:50:55.130 --> 00:50:55.140 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic hurdles
 
00:50:58.309 --> 00:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
and raising various caps that have been
 
00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
placed more or less since 2006.
 
00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:04.260 align:start position:0%
the only point of difference between the
 
00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:06.839 align:start position:0%
minority and the majority is the one
 
00:51:08.930 --> 00:51:08.940 align:start position:0%
question just addressed
 
00:51:12.049 --> 00:51:12.059 align:start position:0%
whether to raise the current cap
 
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
from ten dollars to fifty dollars
 
00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
the perception
 
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
seems to be that the amount we raise the
 
00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:24.180 align:start position:0%
cap to is going to make a difference in
 
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
where the general were typical or
 
00:51:28.970 --> 00:51:28.980 align:start position:0%
average wager is placed
 
00:51:31.549 --> 00:51:31.559 align:start position:0%
we don't believe that's true
 
00:51:34.370 --> 00:51:34.380 align:start position:0%
currently with a ten dollar cap
 
00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
the typical
 
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
wager is one dollar or two dollars
 
00:51:42.829 --> 00:51:42.839 align:start position:0%
that's where most participants play
 
00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:44.940 align:start position:0%
so the point of the cap
 
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
is not to elevate the practices of the
 
00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:49.140 align:start position:0%
typical Gainer
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
point of the cap
 
00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
is to allow gaming operators to appeal
 
00:51:57.170 --> 00:51:57.180 align:start position:0%
to and draw in
 
00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
a narrow niche of high-stakes Gamers
 
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
many of whom are coming across the
 
00:52:05.569 --> 00:52:05.579 align:start position:0%
border to where most of these operations
 
00:52:07.370 --> 00:52:07.380 align:start position:0%
are played
 
00:52:10.270 --> 00:52:10.280 align:start position:0%
we don't believe there's a harm
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
the bill is a very good bill across the
 
00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:15.900 align:start position:0%
board and this is not a sufficient
 
00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:18.420 align:start position:0%
reason to vote against it please support
 
00:52:24.549 --> 00:52:24.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is the majority
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
committee report of autopass has amended
 
00:52:38.349 --> 00:52:38.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:42.170 --> 00:52:42.180 align:start position:0%
okay the vision was just called for
 
00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
this will be a division vote members
 
00:53:23.150 --> 00:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is ought to pass as
 
00:53:27.890 --> 00:53:27.900 align:start position:0%
amended on House Bill 120 this is a
 
00:53:30.109 --> 00:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
division vote care recognizes
 
00:53:31.370 --> 00:53:31.380 align:start position:0%
representative Bolton for a
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:53:41.270 --> 00:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
if I know that as executive director of
 
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire nonprofit
 
00:53:45.170 --> 00:53:45.180 align:start position:0%
that I find charitable gambling very
 
00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
helpful in supporting many Charities
 
00:53:49.370 --> 00:53:49.380 align:start position:0%
throughout the state and if I know that
 
00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
previous house votes have supported
 
00:53:54.589 --> 00:53:54.599 align:start position:0%
increasing the single wager from 10 to
 
00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
25 dollars
 
00:53:58.370 --> 00:53:58.380 align:start position:0%
but if I also know that an increase to
 
00:54:01.010 --> 00:54:01.020 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars goes too far and may
 
00:54:03.770 --> 00:54:03.780 align:start position:0%
contribute to probable gambling would I
 
00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
now press the red button and oppose
 
00:54:09.290 --> 00:54:09.300 align:start position:0%
passage of SB 120.
 
00:54:12.049 --> 00:54:12.059 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker nice representative
 
00:54:14.569 --> 00:54:14.579 align:start position:0%
Doucette for parliamentary inquiry thank
 
00:54:17.450 --> 00:54:17.460 align:start position:0%
you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I know this
 
00:54:20.089 --> 00:54:20.099 align:start position:0%
body has supported charitable gaming for
 
00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
the last I believe it's 17 years but I
 
00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
also know that the house approved a bill
 
00:54:29.530 --> 00:54:29.540 align:start position:0%
that did have the 25 Max bet
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
in it and that went to the Wayside on
 
00:54:36.530 --> 00:54:36.540 align:start position:0%
the other side of the wall and if I know
 
00:54:39.290 --> 00:54:39.300 align:start position:0%
that the Charities count on these
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
dollars and we cannot let the perfect be
 
00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:46.380 align:start position:0%
the replacement for the good would I
 
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
vote green on the octopus
 
00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:51.960 align:start position:0%

00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:03.410 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:57:03.410 --> 00:57:03.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:57:05.030 --> 00:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
the next bill that we're going to be
 
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
taking up is Senate bill 272.
 
00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
I realize this is a highly controversial
 
00:57:14.930 --> 00:57:14.940 align:start position:0%
and emotional issue
 
00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to be very strict when
 
00:57:20.329 --> 00:57:20.339 align:start position:0%
people give their testimony
 
00:57:23.589 --> 00:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
you will not in any way infringe or
 
00:57:26.270 --> 00:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
consider somebody else's motives or
 
00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
impinge somebody else's motives and the
 
00:57:32.329 --> 00:57:32.339 align:start position:0%
Chamber will remain respectful to the
 
00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:35.640 align:start position:0%
speakers no booing yelling hollering and
 
00:57:49.549 --> 00:57:49.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:51.349 --> 00:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
committee on education to which those
 
00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
referred Senate Bill 272 FN establishing
 
00:57:56.450 --> 00:57:56.460 align:start position:0%
a parental Bill of Rights in education
 
00:58:00.890 --> 00:58:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:07.309 --> 00:58:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:10.609 --> 00:58:10.619 align:start position:0%
the first amendment is
 
00:58:12.650 --> 00:58:12.660 align:start position:0%
the Builds on second reading open to
 
00:58:15.970 --> 00:58:15.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
I move indefinite postponement of Senate
 
00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:33.170 --> 00:58:33.180 align:start position:0%
I'm being informed that to consideration
 
00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
of the Amendments is a higher priority
 
00:58:41.390 --> 00:58:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:44.329 --> 00:58:44.339 align:start position:0%
so we're on to the First Amendment
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
which is floor Amendment one eight one
 
00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:49.490 align:start position:0%
which is floor Amendment one eight one
eight

00:58:49.490 --> 00:58:49.500 align:start position:0%
eight
 
00:59:03.770 --> 00:59:03.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:06.589 --> 00:59:06.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment one eight
 
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
one eight is uh 272. this amendment
 
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
would change the definition of school
 
00:59:20.809 --> 00:59:20.819 align:start position:0%
that's within this bill currently the
 
00:59:22.910 --> 00:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
definition in the bill states that a
 
00:59:26.089 --> 00:59:26.099 align:start position:0%
school is without limitation any school
 
00:59:26.099 --> 00:59:27.230 align:start position:0%
school is without limitation any school
board

00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
School District school administrative
 
00:59:32.809 --> 00:59:32.819 align:start position:0%
District or Public Charter School the
 
00:59:35.630 --> 00:59:35.640 align:start position:0%
amendment changes that definition to
 
00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:37.980 align:start position:0%
read those
 
00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:41.640 align:start position:0%
organizations I just mentioned and
 
00:59:44.990 --> 00:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
any entity that directly or indirectly
 
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:51.770 --> 00:59:51.780 align:start position:0%
so now we've opened this thing up and
 
00:59:55.130 --> 00:59:55.140 align:start position:0%
we've gone a lot farther than the law
 
00:59:58.309 --> 00:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
will actually permit us to go
 
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
up in my neck of the woods
 
01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
a number of our students
 
01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:08.940 align:start position:0%
attend elementary school in Vermont
 
01:00:12.589 --> 01:00:12.599 align:start position:0%
Samuel Mori school down in Orford is in
 
01:00:15.069 --> 01:00:15.079 align:start position:0%
Fairly Vermont and part of the
 
01:00:17.809 --> 01:00:17.819 align:start position:0%
interstate government District what we
 
01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:20.700 align:start position:0%
have up there between Fairlee Vermont
 
01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:23.220 align:start position:0%
and Orford New Hampshire
 
01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:25.260 align:start position:0%
so now what we're doing we're passing
 
01:00:27.289 --> 01:00:27.299 align:start position:0%
legislation here
 
01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
that's going to authorize
 
01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
or try to authorize what's happening to
 
01:00:36.289 --> 01:00:36.299 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire students in another state
 
01:00:40.309 --> 01:00:40.319 align:start position:0%
governed by state laws of that state and
 
01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
also that intergovernmental school
 
01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
district is governed by articles of
 
01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.250 align:start position:0%
district is governed by articles of
agreement

01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:46.260 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
01:00:48.530 --> 01:00:48.540 align:start position:0%
and policies
 
01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
and School Board decisions approved by
 
01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
the Congress of the United States of
 
01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:55.190 align:start position:0%
the Congress of the United States of
America

01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
America
 
01:00:57.170 --> 01:00:57.180 align:start position:0%
so we're going to override that as well
 
01:00:59.690 --> 01:00:59.700 align:start position:0%
not a bad idea but
 
01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:00.890 align:start position:0%
not a bad idea but
um

01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:00.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:04.130 --> 01:01:04.140 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't be doing it also
 
01:01:06.410 --> 01:01:06.420 align:start position:0%
there are a number all up and down that
 
01:01:09.049 --> 01:01:09.059 align:start position:0%
Connecticut River we have our students
 
01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:10.740 align:start position:0%
going to schools and entities which
 
01:01:12.349 --> 01:01:12.359 align:start position:0%
receive funds
 
01:01:15.470 --> 01:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
from the state of New Hampshire our
 
01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:17.220 align:start position:0%
Career Technical Education Centers we
 
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
have five receiving centers in Vermont
 
01:01:24.289 --> 01:01:24.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:26.280 align:start position:0%
what we're again doing is passing
 
01:01:28.490 --> 01:01:28.500 align:start position:0%
legislation which is going to tell how
 
01:01:30.410 --> 01:01:30.420 align:start position:0%
the state over there is going to do
 
01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
their business but there's another area
 
01:01:34.970 --> 01:01:34.980 align:start position:0%
we have a number of students in the
 
01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:38.700 align:start position:0%
state that receive education and support
 
01:01:41.450 --> 01:01:41.460 align:start position:0%
from residential placement and medical
 
01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:45.180 align:start position:0%
institutions approximately 600 students
 
01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
and those students are in those
 
01:01:51.349 --> 01:01:51.359 align:start position:0%
residential centers 24 7. there's
 
01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
students which come as a result of what
 
01:01:55.370 --> 01:01:55.380 align:start position:0%
we used to call catastrophic Aid not
 
01:01:58.069 --> 01:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
special education Aid they all have IEPs
 
01:02:01.730 --> 01:02:01.740 align:start position:0%
which require this 24 7 attention and
 
01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:02.870 align:start position:0%
which require this 24 7 attention and
support

01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
so now we're going to write in
 
01:02:06.770 --> 01:02:06.780 align:start position:0%
legislation telling how these
 
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
residential centers because there are
 
01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
other entities which receive our funding
 
01:02:14.450 --> 01:02:14.460 align:start position:0%
how to do business I don't think it will
 
01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
work seeing that there's different
 
01:02:19.250 --> 01:02:19.260 align:start position:0%
situations where students are living and
 
01:02:21.410 --> 01:02:21.420 align:start position:0%
boarding in those particular locations
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
or housed in a hospital
 
01:02:26.809 --> 01:02:26.819 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion this amendment never
 
01:02:28.970 --> 01:02:28.980 align:start position:0%
came before the house education
 
01:02:31.609 --> 01:02:31.619 align:start position:0%
committee this error would have been
 
01:02:31.619 --> 01:02:32.690 align:start position:0%
committee this error would have been
caught

01:02:32.690 --> 01:02:32.700 align:start position:0%
caught
 
01:02:35.329 --> 01:02:35.339 align:start position:0%
but no it's a floor Amendment and we did
 
01:02:37.370 --> 01:02:37.380 align:start position:0%
not have a proper hearing on it it is
 
01:02:40.970 --> 01:02:40.980 align:start position:0%
simply not ready for legislation thank
 
01:02:44.569 --> 01:02:44.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:47.089 --> 01:02:47.099 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is floor Amendment
 
01:02:49.549 --> 01:02:49.559 align:start position:0%

the school they attend

and if I know the non-public schools
 
01:04:17.030 --> 01:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
should be subject to the same state
 
01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:19.799 align:start position:0%

01:04:22.309 --> 01:04:22.319 align:start position:0%

raised as to how the amendment will
 
01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
impact tuition program schools located

Congress and if I also know this
 
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
definition change will have unforeseen

01:08:00.829 --> 01:08:00.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker I rise
 
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
today to ask the house to support this
 
01:08:05.870 --> 01:08:05.880 align:start position:0%
amendment in the wording on this bill if
 
01:08:07.490 --> 01:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
I know that the wording on this bill is
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
somewhat ambiguous as if it applies to
 
01:08:13.069 --> 01:08:13.079 align:start position:0%
certified police officers at a school
 
01:08:15.170 --> 01:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
resource offices
 
01:08:17.390 --> 01:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
and if I know that
 
01:08:20.749 --> 01:08:20.759 align:start position:0%
no child or an adult in a school
 
01:08:23.090 --> 01:08:23.100 align:start position:0%
district should be afraid to talk to a
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer and conversely
 
01:08:27.829 --> 01:08:27.839 align:start position:0%
that a law enforcement officer shouldn't
 
01:08:29.570 --> 01:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
be able to interact with a child who
 
01:08:31.249 --> 01:08:31.259 align:start position:0%
wants to tell them something
 
01:08:33.229 --> 01:08:33.239 align:start position:0%
and they should not be handcuffed by
 
01:08:34.610 --> 01:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:08:37.070 --> 01:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
and I also know that if a police officer
 
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
who's a resource officer is
 
01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:42.420 align:start position:0%
investigating a sexual assault case
 
01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
articulable suspicion to get a warrant
 
01:08:49.269 --> 01:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
to take
 
01:08:52.490 --> 01:08:52.500 align:start position:0%
bodily fluids from a 17 year old who is
 
01:08:54.050 --> 01:08:54.060 align:start position:0%
a prime suspect
 
01:08:56.510 --> 01:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
that an attorney should not be able to
 
01:08:58.789 --> 01:08:58.799 align:start position:0%
come back at a later date when that
 
01:09:01.249 --> 01:09:01.259 align:start position:0%
evidence is conclusive to say it should
 
01:09:04.189 --> 01:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
not be admitted in court because of this
 
01:09:06.829 --> 01:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
law I would ask the house to please vote
 
01:09:09.289 --> 01:09:09.299 align:start position:0%
green on this amendment and not handcuff
 
01:09:11.209 --> 01:09:11.219 align:start position:0%

01:09:13.669 --> 01:09:13.679 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:09:25.309 --> 01:09:25.319 align:start position:0%
if I know nothing in this bill prohibits
 
01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
law enforcement from acting in their
 
01:09:29.689 --> 01:09:29.699 align:start position:0%
official capacity
 
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
and if I know this is yet another
 
01:09:34.729 --> 01:09:34.739 align:start position:0%
attempt to derail the codification of
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
parent rights
 
01:09:38.809 --> 01:09:38.819 align:start position:0%

01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
recognize the parents not schools
 
01:09:45.289 --> 01:09:45.299 align:start position:0%
not school Personnel are the parents
 
01:09:47.329 --> 01:09:47.339 align:start position:0%
with all those rights and
 
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
responsibilities for their minor

01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility would I then press the

a report a mandatory reporter in fact
 
01:19:59.750 --> 01:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
put our family through along and arduous

family you've taken great care of your
 
01:20:10.550 --> 01:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
children but it wasn't without emotional
 
01:20:14.930 --> 01:20:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:18.649 --> 01:20:18.659 align:start position:0%
every time government gets involved with
 
01:20:20.570 --> 01:20:20.580 align:start position:0%
a family
 
01:20:24.169 --> 01:20:24.179 align:start position:0%
there is some level of harm done
 
01:20:25.729 --> 01:20:25.739 align:start position:0%
the goal
 
01:20:28.550 --> 01:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
is admirable which is if government's
 
01:20:31.310 --> 01:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
getting involved
 
01:20:34.490 --> 01:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
there's less harm at the end
 
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:41.209 --> 01:20:41.219 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure we're there today with
 
01:20:43.130 --> 01:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
01:20:46.189 --> 01:20:46.199 align:start position:0%
teachers are already mandatory reporters
 
01:20:49.490 --> 01:20:49.500 align:start position:0%
if they fundamentally believe that
 
01:20:52.370 --> 01:20:52.380 align:start position:0%
sharing information with the parent will
 
01:20:54.590 --> 01:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
harm the child they already have an
 
01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:56.030 align:start position:0%
harm the child they already have an
obligation

01:20:56.030 --> 01:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
obligation
 
01:20:58.189 --> 01:20:58.199 align:start position:0%
that's not changing in this this law
 
01:20:59.930 --> 01:20:59.940 align:start position:0%
that's not changing in this amendment
 
01:21:02.570 --> 01:21:02.580 align:start position:0%
that is current law
 
01:21:05.090 --> 01:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
and while I believe that the system
 
01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
should be far more efficient it
 
01:21:08.570 --> 01:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
shouldn't take four months to prove your
 
01:21:08.580 --> 01:21:10.250 align:start position:0%
shouldn't take four months to prove your
innocence

01:21:10.250 --> 01:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
innocence
 
01:21:17.810 --> 01:21:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:20.030 --> 01:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
seven years ago eight years ago this
 
01:21:22.490 --> 01:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
chamber voted on a bill relative to 18
 
01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
year olds getting
 
01:21:27.890 --> 01:21:27.900 align:start position:0%
suntan or going to the suntan salons
 
01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know who was in the chamber back
 
01:21:31.970 --> 01:21:31.980 align:start position:0%
then I know I was had a couple of votes
 
01:21:34.250 --> 01:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
against it but we deemed as a
 
01:21:36.590 --> 01:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
legislature that we should not allow
 
01:21:39.050 --> 01:21:39.060 align:start position:0%
those under the age of 18.
 
01:21:40.910 --> 01:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
to go get a suntan
 
01:21:42.770 --> 01:21:42.780 align:start position:0%
they can go hang out on their balcony
 
01:21:44.330 --> 01:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
all day long that's not a problem but
 
01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
they can't go to a sun tanning salon
 
01:21:48.649 --> 01:21:48.659 align:start position:0%
I don't know whether that was a good
 
01:21:50.990 --> 01:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
idea or not there was a child who had
 
01:21:53.810 --> 01:21:53.820 align:start position:0%
contracted melanoma at the time made a
 
01:21:55.250 --> 01:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
good argument at the committee level and
 
01:21:57.229 --> 01:21:57.239 align:start position:0%
eventually on the floor and it passed
 
01:22:00.590 --> 01:22:00.600 align:start position:0%
but this body decided that something as
 
01:22:03.770 --> 01:22:03.780 align:start position:0%
mundane as getting a suntan was worth
 
01:22:07.370 --> 01:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
just what happened
 
01:22:12.350 --> 01:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about today is
 
01:22:14.149 --> 01:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
something where children are far more
 
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
impacted than a suntan and we believe I
 
01:22:19.550 --> 01:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
believe I believe that the state
 
01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:20.750 align:start position:0%
believe I believe that the state
believes

01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
believes
 
01:22:22.430 --> 01:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
that parents have a right to know that
 
01:22:25.550 --> 01:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
this is not about as a prior speaker
 
01:22:30.110 --> 01:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
said mandatory reporting at the
 
01:22:32.209 --> 01:22:32.219 align:start position:0%
at the middle school dance of so and so
 
01:22:34.490 --> 01:22:34.500 align:start position:0%
dance with so and so I'm not sure that's
 
01:22:36.890 --> 01:22:36.900 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about this requires
 
01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
quite simply that when a parent asks the
 
01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
school a question that they be given an
 
01:22:47.030 --> 01:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:49.250 --> 01:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
if there's anything that we should count
 
01:22:50.570 --> 01:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
on government for it should be
 
01:22:53.390 --> 01:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
transparency and openness and honesty if
 
01:22:55.490 --> 01:22:55.500 align:start position:0%
we can't get those simple things then
 
01:23:00.890 --> 01:23:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:02.390 --> 01:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
I would ask that you would oppose this
 
01:23:04.790 --> 01:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
amendment because it fundamentally takes
 
01:23:06.830 --> 01:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
the bill that was the parental Bill of
 
01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
Rights and turns it on its head and
 
01:23:12.350 --> 01:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
actually complicates this both legally
 
01:23:13.970 --> 01:23:13.980 align:start position:0%
and procedurally in such a way that it
 
01:23:16.490 --> 01:23:16.500 align:start position:0%
could damage families please oppose this
 
01:23:20.530 --> 01:23:20.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:33.709 --> 01:23:33.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:37.070 --> 01:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
like everybody else in this chamber I I
 
01:23:38.570 --> 01:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
have received a number of emails
 
01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:40.310 align:start position:0%
have received a number of emails
recently

01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
recently
 
01:23:43.669 --> 01:23:43.679 align:start position:0%
both for and in opposition to Senate
 
01:23:46.370 --> 01:23:46.380 align:start position:0%
bill 272.
 
01:23:48.530 --> 01:23:48.540 align:start position:0%
interestingly a number of those emails
 
01:23:51.649 --> 01:23:51.659 align:start position:0%
that oppose the bill
 
01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
have a subject line that speaks to the
 
01:23:59.330 --> 01:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:02.930 --> 01:24:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:09.229 --> 01:24:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:10.970 --> 01:24:10.980 align:start position:0%
just this past Sunday we celebrated
 
01:24:13.550 --> 01:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
Mother's Day
 
01:24:15.709 --> 01:24:15.719 align:start position:0%
we elevated mothers we put them on a

01:24:21.470 --> 01:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
in another month we'll celebrate the
 
01:24:26.630 --> 01:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:29.810 --> 01:24:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:33.229 --> 01:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
by deleting sections T through W in this
 
01:24:33.239 --> 01:24:35.090 align:start position:0%
by deleting sections T through W in this
bill

01:24:35.090 --> 01:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:24:38.149 --> 01:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
we're rolling that back
 
01:24:40.430 --> 01:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
we're just not sure
 
01:24:42.229 --> 01:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
this amendment says
 
01:24:44.510 --> 01:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
we're just not sure that parents can be
 
01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:47.090 align:start position:0%
we're just not sure that parents can be
trusted

01:24:47.090 --> 01:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:48.830 --> 01:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
last year the chair of the democratic
 
01:24:52.370 --> 01:24:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:54.229 --> 01:24:54.239 align:start position:0%
that if a parental Bill of Rights passes
 
01:24:56.270 --> 01:24:56.280 align:start position:0%
and parents learn that their child is
 
01:24:58.189 --> 01:24:58.199 align:start position:0%
gendered on conforming
 
01:24:59.930 --> 01:24:59.940 align:start position:0%
there's a possibility that they might
 
01:25:04.070 --> 01:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:05.450 --> 01:25:05.460 align:start position:0%
I'd like to offer a different
 
01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:07.910 align:start position:0%
I'd like to offer a different
perspective

01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
this comes from a press release issued
 
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
by the Log Cabin Republicans just this
 
01:25:14.149 --> 01:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
past week in support
 
01:25:17.330 --> 01:25:17.340 align:start position:0%
of Senate Bill 272
 
01:25:21.410 --> 01:25:21.420 align:start position:0%
it says LGBT youth often experience the
 
01:25:23.649 --> 01:25:23.659 align:start position:0%
worst that adolescents has to offer

that says parents have
 
01:26:06.290 --> 01:26:06.300 align:start position:0%

identified as by by School staff
 
01:26:23.689 --> 01:26:23.699 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker this amendment 1675
 
01:27:18.350 --> 01:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
H is a basic simple bipartisan
 
01:27:20.570 --> 01:27:20.580 align:start position:0%
compromise taking out the most
 
01:27:23.390 --> 01:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
controversial parts of this so-called
 
01:27:25.129 --> 01:27:25.139 align:start position:0%
parental Bill of Rights
 
01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
we are focused on parental rights every
 
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
single one in here I'm sure can agree we
 
01:27:33.950 --> 01:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
are four parental rights what sections T
 
01:27:37.129 --> 01:27:37.139 align:start position:0%
through W do is Target a minority group
 
01:27:39.830 --> 01:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
of citizens
 
01:27:42.050 --> 01:27:42.060 align:start position:0%
um and it actually forces teachers and
 
01:27:43.729 --> 01:27:43.739 align:start position:0%
guidance counselors
 
01:27:46.370 --> 01:27:46.380 align:start position:0%

01:27:48.290 --> 01:27:48.300 align:start position:0%
children's privacy
 
01:27:50.629 --> 01:27:50.639 align:start position:0%
children also should have some privacy
 
01:27:52.669 --> 01:27:52.679 align:start position:0%
excuse me please don't laugh children
 
01:27:54.830 --> 01:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
should have some privacy in their class
 
01:27:58.430 --> 01:27:58.440 align:start position:0%

discuss situations that I'm not
 
01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily wanted my parents to know
 
01:28:06.410 --> 01:28:06.420 align:start position:0%

01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:08.159 align:start position:0%

includes what my Amendment does to say
 
01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
that students have the right to privacy
 
01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:17.760 align:start position:0%

process

01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
decades ago the U.S Supreme Court
 
01:36:25.970 --> 01:36:25.980 align:start position:0%
addressed an issue dealing with first
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
amendment in schools they said students
 
01:36:30.350 --> 01:36:30.360 align:start position:0%
do not shed their first amendment rights
 
01:36:32.570 --> 01:36:32.580 align:start position:0%
at the schoolhouse gate I'll suggest
 
01:36:34.490 --> 01:36:34.500 align:start position:0%
that the same is also true for all those
 
01:36:37.010 --> 01:36:37.020 align:start position:0%
other constitutional rights a few years
 
01:36:40.250 --> 01:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
ago when New Hampshire passed or amended
 
01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
our constitution to have the right to
 
01:36:44.510 --> 01:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
privacy it says an individual's right to
 
01:36:46.430 --> 01:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
live free from governmental intrusion in
 
01:36:49.070 --> 01:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
private or personal information is
 
01:36:52.010 --> 01:36:52.020 align:start position:0%
essential it didn't say parents rights
 
01:36:54.770 --> 01:36:54.780 align:start position:0%
in individuals rights I would suggest
 
01:36:57.050 --> 01:36:57.060 align:start position:0%
that students do have these rights and
 
01:36:58.850 --> 01:36:58.860 align:start position:0%
we need to protect it and that's what
 
01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
this amendment does and I ask you to
 
01:37:05.450 --> 01:37:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:08.629 --> 01:37:08.639 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker if I know that this
 
01:38:44.810 --> 01:38:44.820 align:start position:0%
amendment which is a basically a poison
 
01:38:46.430 --> 01:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
pill Amendment will fundamentally
 
01:38:48.410 --> 01:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
undercut the purpose of this bill as it
 
01:38:50.810 --> 01:38:50.820 align:start position:0%
came to us from the Senate and if I know
 
01:38:53.390 --> 01:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
that the various rights of children that
 
01:38:56.090 --> 01:38:56.100 align:start position:0%
the amendment references could easily be
 
01:38:58.310 --> 01:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
construed by a court to be intended to
 
01:39:01.610 --> 01:39:01.620 align:start position:0%
apply against the parents if they were
 
01:39:04.189 --> 01:39:04.199 align:start position:0%
included in this bill whereas they would
 
01:39:06.410 --> 01:39:06.420 align:start position:0%
never otherwise be construed in that way
 
01:39:08.689 --> 01:39:08.699 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker this amendment's
 
01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
more narrow than my last one I don't
 
01:40:37.129 --> 01:40:37.139 align:start position:0%
know if it was the intent of the bill or
 
01:40:39.410 --> 01:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
not or an oversight but my position is
 
01:40:42.410 --> 01:40:42.420 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill would essentially
 
01:40:45.050 --> 01:40:45.060 align:start position:0%
prohibit or not prohibit if a student
 
01:40:46.610 --> 01:40:46.620 align:start position:0%
tells their school counselor something
 
01:40:49.610 --> 01:40:49.620 align:start position:0%
then that counselor is required or
 
01:40:51.229 --> 01:40:51.239 align:start position:0%
psychologist required to tell that
 
01:40:52.669 --> 01:40:52.679 align:start position:0%
information of the parent
 
01:40:55.490 --> 01:40:55.500 align:start position:0%
under the underlying bill this changes
 
01:40:57.770 --> 01:40:57.780 align:start position:0%
that to make an exception so that
 
01:41:00.709 --> 01:41:00.719 align:start position:0%
students have a right to privacy if it's
 
01:41:02.149 --> 01:41:02.159 align:start position:0%
reasonably objective when they tell
 
01:41:03.950 --> 01:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
information to their counselor school
 
01:41:06.050 --> 01:41:06.060 align:start position:0%
psychologists school nurse or other
 
01:41:08.570 --> 01:41:08.580 align:start position:0%
certified health provider when people
 
01:41:10.850 --> 01:41:10.860 align:start position:0%
talk about Secrets I have a different
 
01:41:13.250 --> 01:41:13.260 align:start position:0%
word for that it's called privacy if
 
01:41:16.129 --> 01:41:16.139 align:start position:0%
kids are going to a psychologist or a
 
01:41:17.570 --> 01:41:17.580 align:start position:0%
counselor and they're telling them very
 
01:41:19.070 --> 01:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
intimate things knowing that that's
 
01:41:20.450 --> 01:41:20.460 align:start position:0%
going to be related to their parent when
 
01:41:22.970 --> 01:41:22.980 align:start position:0%
they ask I suggest they're less likely
 
01:41:24.770 --> 01:41:24.780 align:start position:0%
to tell the psychologists that and
 
01:41:26.030 --> 01:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
they're less likely to get the help that
 
01:41:27.729 --> 01:41:27.739 align:start position:0%
they need
 
01:41:30.890 --> 01:41:30.900 align:start position:0%
if parents want to ask a question of
 
01:41:32.750 --> 01:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
their child you should be asking the
 
01:41:34.750 --> 01:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
child not the school
 
01:41:38.330 --> 01:41:38.340 align:start position:0%
different things that people could tell
 
01:41:40.609 --> 01:41:40.619 align:start position:0%
a counselor include their sexual
 
01:41:42.950 --> 01:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
identity gender identity it could be
 
01:41:44.510 --> 01:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
whether they are sexually assaulted
 
01:41:47.209 --> 01:41:47.219 align:start position:0%
could be information regarding STD
 
01:41:47.219 --> 01:41:48.590 align:start position:0%
could be information regarding STD
testing

01:41:48.590 --> 01:41:48.600 align:start position:0%
testing
 
01:41:50.209 --> 01:41:50.219 align:start position:0%
different information regarding birth
 
01:41:52.850 --> 01:41:52.860 align:start position:0%
control a lot of intimate things that
 
01:41:54.770 --> 01:41:54.780 align:start position:0%
someone could be telling a counselor I
 
01:41:56.990 --> 01:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
suggest that should say between them and
 
01:41:59.390 --> 01:41:59.400 align:start position:0%
the counselor I would expect a counselor
 
01:42:01.550 --> 01:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
might talk the child through this and
 
01:42:03.169 --> 01:42:03.179 align:start position:0%
ultimately say hey it would be best to
 
01:42:05.570 --> 01:42:05.580 align:start position:0%
get your parent involved with this but
 
01:42:07.129 --> 01:42:07.139 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day it should be the
 
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
student being the one to make that
 
01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:10.550 align:start position:0%
student being the one to make that
decision

01:42:10.550 --> 01:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
decision
 
01:42:12.890 --> 01:42:12.900 align:start position:0%
um in a case Sterling the borough of
 
01:42:15.410 --> 01:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
Minersville there was a case where a
 
01:42:18.890 --> 01:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
police officer found an 18 year old and
 
01:42:22.609 --> 01:42:22.619 align:start position:0%
a 17 year old engaged in say same-sexual
 
01:42:24.890 --> 01:42:24.900 align:start position:0%
sex relationship and they threatened to
 
01:42:27.169 --> 01:42:27.179 align:start position:0%
tell that person's parent about that
 
01:42:28.970 --> 01:42:28.980 align:start position:0%
relationship that person committed
 
01:42:32.510 --> 01:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
suicide this parent then it sued and the
 
01:42:34.189 --> 01:42:34.199 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court or not Supreme Court the
 
01:42:36.649 --> 01:42:36.659 align:start position:0%
Third District allowed the lawsuit to go
 
01:42:38.709 --> 01:42:38.719 align:start position:0%
forward saying matters of personal
 
01:42:41.149 --> 01:42:41.159 align:start position:0%
intimacy are protected from threats of
 
01:42:44.030 --> 01:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
Disclosure by the right to privacy so
 
01:42:45.709 --> 01:42:45.719 align:start position:0%
there's a limiting bill and I would
 
01:42:48.290 --> 01:42:48.300 align:start position:0%
suggest it's needed so that students can
 
01:42:49.669 --> 01:42:49.679 align:start position:0%
get the mental health help that they
 
01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:56.390 --> 01:42:56.400 align:start position:0%

it is sufficiently seconded this will be

changed the bill and further Mr Speaker
 
01:48:27.470 --> 01:48:27.480 align:start position:0%
if I know that considering that
 
01:48:29.570 --> 01:48:29.580 align:start position:0%
fundamental change of the bill would
 
01:48:32.270 --> 01:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
rise into question what impact any other
 
01:48:34.430 --> 01:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
motion might have for instance
 
01:48:36.410 --> 01:48:36.420 align:start position:0%
indefinite postponement and if I know
 
01:48:38.629 --> 01:48:38.639 align:start position:0%
further that we should not be cutting

a parliamentary inquiry
 
03:25:19.849 --> 03:25:19.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
03:25:22.790 --> 03:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
know allowing cumulative impact analysis
 
03:25:25.670 --> 03:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
to be put into statute as a basis for
 
03:25:27.830 --> 03:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
deciding which projects in the state go
 
03:25:29.809 --> 03:25:29.819 align:start position:0%
forward and which don't that'll
 
03:25:32.570 --> 03:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
basically put everything to a standstill
 
03:25:35.330 --> 03:25:35.340 align:start position:0%
this and if I know Mr Speaker allowing
 
03:25:37.550 --> 03:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
this type of analysis has no end to it
 
03:25:40.610 --> 03:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
you can cumulative impact means you can
 
03:25:42.889 --> 03:25:42.899 align:start position:0%
take this element and that element and
 
03:25:44.510 --> 03:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
analyze that and then someone can say
 
03:25:46.250 --> 03:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
what about another element and so forth
 
03:25:48.290 --> 03:25:48.300 align:start position:0%
and so on if I know organizations like
 
03:25:50.030 --> 03:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
the conservation law Foundation have
 
03:25:51.710 --> 03:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
been pushing this so they can have
 
03:25:53.570 --> 03:25:53.580 align:start position:0%
endless lawsuits to prevent any
 
03:25:55.250 --> 03:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
expansion of anything in New Hampshire
 
03:25:58.190 --> 03:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
and I know Des has not requested this
 
03:25:59.870 --> 03:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
bill would I then push the red button
 
03:26:02.450 --> 03:26:02.460 align:start position:0%
and retain some sanity and out citing
 
03:26:04.550 --> 03:26:04.560 align:start position:0%

Mr Speaker
 
03:26:16.130 --> 03:26:16.140 align:start position:0%

agriculture committee listened to hours
 
03:26:21.050 --> 03:26:21.060 align:start position:0%
of testimony and voted 19-0 all had to

Steel Fabricators so everyone's an
 
03:29:07.610 --> 03:29:07.620 align:start position:0%
agreement the amendment is because a
 
03:29:10.849 --> 03:29:10.859 align:start position:0%
very sharp-eyed legislator actually read
 
03:29:13.070 --> 03:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
the bill without being familiar with it
 
03:29:15.769 --> 03:29:15.779 align:start position:0%
and noticed that between the bottom of
 
03:29:20.210 --> 03:29:20.220 align:start position:0%
page one and the top of page two a line
 
03:29:23.630 --> 03:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
had been left out this amendment puts
 
03:29:26.210 --> 03:29:26.220 align:start position:0%
the line back in and I hope you all
 
03:29:30.889 --> 03:29:30.899 align:start position:0%

03:31:09.710 --> 03:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
speaker today I rise in support of this
 
03:31:11.570 --> 03:31:11.580 align:start position:0%
amendment which combines the minority
 
03:31:13.610 --> 03:31:13.620 align:start position:0%
Amendment with the language of house
 
03:31:15.650 --> 03:31:15.660 align:start position:0%
bill 287.
 
03:31:17.750 --> 03:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
this bill came to our committee without
 
03:31:20.450 --> 03:31:20.460 align:start position:0%
a solid definition of harm reduction and
 
03:31:22.610 --> 03:31:22.620 align:start position:0%
despite opening up the critical opioid
 
03:31:24.710 --> 03:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
trust fund to what could be a blank
 
03:31:24.720 --> 03:31:25.790 align:start position:0%
trust fund to what could be a blank
check

03:31:25.790 --> 03:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
check
 
03:31:27.769 --> 03:31:27.779 align:start position:0%
recognizing that contaminated street
 
03:31:30.290 --> 03:31:30.300 align:start position:0%
drugs caused Great harm for the consumed
 
03:31:32.210 --> 03:31:32.220 align:start position:0%
drug consumers in our state and
 
03:31:34.250 --> 03:31:34.260 align:start position:0%
recognizing that New Hampshire has no
 
03:31:36.889 --> 03:31:36.899 align:start position:0%
eyes on the street to sample or maybe I
 
03:31:39.410 --> 03:31:39.420 align:start position:0%
should say assay the contaminants and
 
03:31:41.570 --> 03:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
street drugs the minority of committee
 
03:31:43.490 --> 03:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
believed that the most clear and present
 
03:31:46.130 --> 03:31:46.140 align:start position:0%
danger for harm reduction would to be
 
03:31:48.590 --> 03:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
ensured to would be to ensure that we
 
03:31:50.929 --> 03:31:50.939 align:start position:0%
are going to test those street drugs for
 
03:31:50.939 --> 03:31:52.610 align:start position:0%
are going to test those street drugs for
contaminants

03:31:52.610 --> 03:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
contaminants
 
03:31:54.050 --> 03:31:54.060 align:start position:0%
this has always been a two-pronged
 
03:31:57.110 --> 03:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
approach we could fund it but unless we
 
03:31:59.269 --> 03:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
change the laws so that the testing
 
03:32:01.190 --> 03:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
equipment is no longer considered drug
 
03:32:04.010 --> 03:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia it wouldn't be possible to
 
03:32:07.309 --> 03:32:07.319 align:start position:0%
use any funds for that in the state
 
03:32:10.309 --> 03:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
so what we have done here is to specify
 
03:32:12.170 --> 03:32:12.180 align:start position:0%
that we would use these funds for drug
 
03:32:14.630 --> 03:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
testing and then also to add back House
 
03:32:18.229 --> 03:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
Bill 287 which was passed unanimously
 
03:32:20.030 --> 03:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately our colleagues on the
 
03:32:21.290 --> 03:32:21.300 align:start position:0%
other side of the wall are looking to
 
03:32:23.090 --> 03:32:23.100 align:start position:0%
reduce this just to fentanyl test strips
 
03:32:25.490 --> 03:32:25.500 align:start position:0%
but we have other threats here that are
 
03:32:28.610 --> 03:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
in our opioids we have tranq that's the
 
03:32:31.370 --> 03:32:31.380 align:start position:0%
drug that does not respond to Narcan we
 
03:32:33.410 --> 03:32:33.420 align:start position:0%
don't know how much of it that of it is
 
03:32:36.170 --> 03:32:36.180 align:start position:0%
in our street drugs in other states they
 
03:32:37.490 --> 03:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
have surveillance and they have street
 
03:32:39.410 --> 03:32:39.420 align:start position:0%
level testing and they're able to see
 
03:32:41.269 --> 03:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
which communities it's moving into so
 
03:32:42.590 --> 03:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
that people can be appropriately
 
03:32:44.990 --> 03:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
cautious and perhaps some of those users
 
03:32:47.090 --> 03:32:47.100 align:start position:0%
will decide to go into treatment and to
 
03:32:49.070 --> 03:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
avoid those street drugs to avoid that
 
03:32:51.410 --> 03:32:51.420 align:start position:0%
clear and present threat of death
 
03:32:53.990 --> 03:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
if you're dead you can't recover and we
 
03:32:55.429 --> 03:32:55.439 align:start position:0%
should give people the tools in order to
 
03:32:56.870 --> 03:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
do this
 
03:32:58.670 --> 03:32:58.680 align:start position:0%
so the amendment in front of you is
 
03:33:00.710 --> 03:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
intended to focus our limited opioid
 
03:33:02.990 --> 03:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
abatement dollars on drug testing as
 
03:33:04.790 --> 03:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
opposed to a broader definition of harm
 
03:33:07.790 --> 03:33:07.800 align:start position:0%
reduction and to also have the legal
 
03:33:09.710 --> 03:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
framework in order to do this
 
03:33:11.570 --> 03:33:11.580 align:start position:0%
I ask for your support so that we can
 
03:33:13.070 --> 03:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
have fewer drug users that are
 
03:33:15.950 --> 03:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
unknowingly taking dangerous deadly
 
03:33:18.229 --> 03:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
contaminants like Fentanyl tranq and
 
03:33:21.950 --> 03:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:30.830 --> 03:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:33.229 --> 03:33:33.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
03:33:33.239 --> 03:33:34.250 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
um

03:33:34.250 --> 03:33:34.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:37.130 --> 03:33:37.140 align:start position:0%
for every complex social problem there
 
03:33:40.130 --> 03:33:40.140 align:start position:0%
is a solution that's neat simple and
 
03:33:40.140 --> 03:33:41.030 align:start position:0%
is a solution that's neat simple and
wrong

03:33:41.030 --> 03:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
03:33:44.030 --> 03:33:44.040 align:start position:0%
That's The Story of My Life anyways
 
03:33:45.950 --> 03:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
first of all I would like to begin by
 
03:33:48.050 --> 03:33:48.060 align:start position:0%
thanking representative Leon for
 
03:33:50.389 --> 03:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
bringing this issue up it's an extremely
 
03:33:52.550 --> 03:33:52.560 align:start position:0%
important issue it's something that we
 
03:33:54.229 --> 03:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
really need to think about
 
03:33:57.050 --> 03:33:57.060 align:start position:0%
the reason why I'm opposing it is
 
03:34:00.170 --> 03:34:00.180 align:start position:0%
because it's it changes the SB 32 in a
 
03:34:01.490 --> 03:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
way that I think could be harmful I
 
03:34:03.590 --> 03:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
don't think I will be harmful
 
03:34:05.630 --> 03:34:05.640 align:start position:0%
for those of you who don't know me
 
03:34:07.969 --> 03:34:07.979 align:start position:0%
um I'm a physician I've worked in New
 
03:34:10.910 --> 03:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for the last 34 years serving
 
03:34:12.590 --> 03:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
the needs of people with complex
 
03:34:14.889 --> 03:34:14.899 align:start position:0%
disability particularly pain
 
03:34:17.809 --> 03:34:17.819 align:start position:0%
I've traveled all over the area the
 
03:34:19.670 --> 03:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
country and internationally to Advocate
 
03:34:22.309 --> 03:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
on the rights of people with chronic
 
03:34:24.410 --> 03:34:24.420 align:start position:0%
pain and as part of that I'm really
 
03:34:26.750 --> 03:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
proud to be the vice chair of the opioid
 
03:34:28.550 --> 03:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
debate commission which is actually the
 
03:34:31.309 --> 03:34:31.319 align:start position:0%
subject of says p32
 
03:34:33.290 --> 03:34:33.300 align:start position:0%
the words harm reduction which this
 
03:34:35.570 --> 03:34:35.580 align:start position:0%
amendment would actually strike from SB
 
03:34:38.510 --> 03:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
332 are very important to me and to
 
03:34:40.429 --> 03:34:40.439 align:start position:0%
those I represent and I'm honored to be
 
03:34:42.469 --> 03:34:42.479 align:start position:0%
standing here in support of them and to
 
03:34:44.570 --> 03:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
oppose the amendment
 
03:34:46.729 --> 03:34:46.739 align:start position:0%
first of all the primary purpose of SB
 
03:34:49.729 --> 03:34:49.739 align:start position:0%
32 is actually to align two programs one
 
03:34:51.530 --> 03:34:51.540 align:start position:0%
is the governor's Commission on Alcohol
 
03:34:53.870 --> 03:34:53.880 align:start position:0%
and Other Drugs with the opioid
 
03:34:56.809 --> 03:34:56.819 align:start position:0%
abatement advisory commission both in
 
03:35:00.110 --> 03:35:00.120 align:start position:0%
terms of function and terminology
 
03:35:02.630 --> 03:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
the governor's commission was created in
 
03:35:04.910 --> 03:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
2000 to address what at that time was
 
03:35:07.429 --> 03:35:07.439 align:start position:0%
already an important existing drug
 
03:35:09.590 --> 03:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
crisis and we've had a drug crisis for
 
03:35:11.330 --> 03:35:11.340 align:start position:0%
as long as the 40 years as I've been
 
03:35:11.340 --> 03:35:12.130 align:start position:0%
as long as the 40 years as I've been
here

03:35:12.130 --> 03:35:12.140 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:35:15.050 --> 03:35:15.060 align:start position:0%
alcohol has been a huge problem and that
 
03:35:16.790 --> 03:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
was one of the major reasons that was
 
03:35:20.630 --> 03:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
created it's function is to advise the
 
03:35:22.729 --> 03:35:22.739 align:start position:0%
executive department and the legislature
 
03:35:24.590 --> 03:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
on the delivery of effective
 
03:35:26.330 --> 03:35:26.340 align:start position:0%
collaborative and coordinated prevention
 
03:35:28.969 --> 03:35:28.979 align:start position:0%
treatment and Recovery substance use
 
03:35:31.849 --> 03:35:31.859 align:start position:0%
programs and other services
 
03:35:34.010 --> 03:35:34.020 align:start position:0%
the action plans that they've created
 
03:35:35.870 --> 03:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
for this next two years and for the
 
03:35:38.450 --> 03:35:38.460 align:start position:0%
previous two years stress harm reduction
 
03:35:40.429 --> 03:35:40.439 align:start position:0%
as a priority
 
03:35:42.950 --> 03:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
the opioid abatement advisory commission
 
03:35:45.130 --> 03:35:45.140 align:start position:0%
was created
 
03:35:49.429 --> 03:35:49.439 align:start position:0%
in 2020 and it manages the opioid
 
03:35:51.650 --> 03:35:51.660 align:start position:0%
abatement trust fund which comes from
 
03:35:54.050 --> 03:35:54.060 align:start position:0%
dollars and cents that come from the
 
03:35:56.809 --> 03:35:56.819 align:start position:0%
lawsuits from various pharmaceutical
 
03:35:58.550 --> 03:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
agencies and whatever
 
03:36:00.889 --> 03:36:00.899 align:start position:0%
as part of our function we review Grant
 
03:36:02.809 --> 03:36:02.819 align:start position:0%
applications and award funding to
 
03:36:04.250 --> 03:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
deserving community and government
 
03:36:07.190 --> 03:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
agencies using one or more of 16
 
03:36:11.090 --> 03:36:11.100 align:start position:0%
different criteria which are in statute
 
03:36:14.150 --> 03:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
it's important for you to know that
 
03:36:16.670 --> 03:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
There are rules on how who gets this
 
03:36:19.070 --> 03:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
money it has to be only for the use of
 
03:36:22.610 --> 03:36:22.620 align:start position:0%
opioid abatement nothing else
 
03:36:24.469 --> 03:36:24.479 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's missing from
 
03:36:26.450 --> 03:36:26.460 align:start position:0%
this statute though is that there's no
 
03:36:28.429 --> 03:36:28.439 align:start position:0%
mention of harm reduction and that's
 
03:36:31.729 --> 03:36:31.739 align:start position:0%
what SB 32 seeks to remedy and includes
 
03:36:34.550 --> 03:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
the word support secondary and tertiary
 
03:36:36.050 --> 03:36:36.060 align:start position:0%
prevention through harm reduction
 
03:36:38.929 --> 03:36:38.939 align:start position:0%
programs is a criteria for dispensing
 
03:36:38.939 --> 03:36:40.790 align:start position:0%
programs is a criteria for dispensing
funds

03:36:40.790 --> 03:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
funds
 
03:36:43.849 --> 03:36:43.859 align:start position:0%
a critical pillar of both programs then
 
03:36:45.710 --> 03:36:45.720 align:start position:0%
is harm reduction which is a
 
03:36:48.170 --> 03:36:48.180 align:start position:0%
comprehensive preventative strategy it
 
03:36:50.870 --> 03:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
is not a single intervention I've been
 
03:36:52.309 --> 03:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
working with people for complex
 
03:36:54.769 --> 03:36:54.779 align:start position:0%
disabilities my entire life and the one
 
03:36:56.570 --> 03:36:56.580 align:start position:0%
thing that we have learned is that
 
03:36:59.150 --> 03:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
single modality treatment does not work
 
03:37:01.429 --> 03:37:01.439 align:start position:0%
you can give somebody methadone but
 
03:37:03.349 --> 03:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
methadone does not alone does not work
 
03:37:05.030 --> 03:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
you can give somebody buprenorphine
 
03:37:07.429 --> 03:37:07.439 align:start position:0%
buprenorphine alone does not work you
 
03:37:09.590 --> 03:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
need to have people working together in
 
03:37:12.110 --> 03:37:12.120 align:start position:0%
a collegial Cooperative environment
 
03:37:14.870 --> 03:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
for effective treatment prevention
 
03:37:17.929 --> 03:37:17.939 align:start position:0%
whatever and that is what harm reduction
 
03:37:19.670 --> 03:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
actually is
 
03:37:22.370 --> 03:37:22.380 align:start position:0%
the thing that bothers me a lot is that
 
03:37:23.929 --> 03:37:23.939 align:start position:0%
this has been acknowledged in eastern
 
03:37:26.990 --> 03:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
medicine for over 2 000 years we in the
 
03:37:30.229 --> 03:37:30.239 align:start position:0%
west are slow in catching on to this
 
03:37:32.150 --> 03:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
I would say that the Insight of
 
03:37:34.190 --> 03:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
stressing harm reduction is a primary
 
03:37:36.229 --> 03:37:36.239 align:start position:0%
strategy for managing substance use
 
03:37:37.729 --> 03:37:37.739 align:start position:0%
disorder in New Hampshire is both
 
03:37:40.429 --> 03:37:40.439 align:start position:0%
ingenious and necessary
 
03:37:42.769 --> 03:37:42.779 align:start position:0%
this is consistent with published
 
03:37:45.830 --> 03:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
opinions from the substance abuse mental
 
03:37:47.530 --> 03:37:47.540 align:start position:0%
health services
 
03:37:50.210 --> 03:37:50.220 align:start position:0%
Administration which I will from here on
 
03:37:52.250 --> 03:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
in refer to as samsa because I don't
 
03:37:54.229 --> 03:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
feel like saying all those words
 
03:37:57.290 --> 03:37:57.300 align:start position:0%
and the Rand corporation whose state
 
03:37:59.290 --> 03:37:59.300 align:start position:0%
harm reduction is a critical
 
03:38:01.550 --> 03:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
evidence-based element to the Strategic
 
03:38:05.030 --> 03:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
success of opioid abatement programs as
 
03:38:08.030 --> 03:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
part of a comprehensive strategy samhsa
 
03:38:09.950 --> 03:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
outlines Seven Elements to harm
 
03:38:12.110 --> 03:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
reduction which have been shown to
 
03:38:13.370 --> 03:38:13.380 align:start position:0%
prevent death
 
03:38:16.610 --> 03:38:16.620 align:start position:0%
injury disease overdose infectious
 
03:38:19.729 --> 03:38:19.739 align:start position:0%
disease transmission and misuse
 
03:38:21.469 --> 03:38:21.479 align:start position:0%
all of those are present in the
 
03:38:22.790 --> 03:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
governor's statement commission
 
03:38:22.800 --> 03:38:24.349 align:start position:0%
governor's statement commission
statement

03:38:24.349 --> 03:38:24.359 align:start position:0%
statement
 
03:38:26.450 --> 03:38:26.460 align:start position:0%
the problem is if this amend would have
 
03:38:26.460 --> 03:38:27.710 align:start position:0%
the problem is if this amend would have
approved

03:38:27.710 --> 03:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
approved
 
03:38:29.570 --> 03:38:29.580 align:start position:0%
all these critical harm reduction
 
03:38:31.010 --> 03:38:31.020 align:start position:0%
Services would be moved from
 
03:38:33.110 --> 03:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
consideration by the opioid abatement
 
03:38:35.510 --> 03:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
advisory commission except for drug
 
03:38:37.309 --> 03:38:37.319 align:start position:0%
checking which again is extremely
 
03:38:39.710 --> 03:38:39.720 align:start position:0%
important but only one of things I would
 
03:38:41.630 --> 03:38:41.640 align:start position:0%
say that this is functional like asking
 
03:38:43.849 --> 03:38:43.859 align:start position:0%
me to build a house giving me a toolbox
 
03:38:47.450 --> 03:38:47.460 align:start position:0%
but only putting a screwdriver in it
 
03:38:50.690 --> 03:38:50.700 align:start position:0%
while drug checking is important this
 
03:38:52.670 --> 03:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
amendment would arbitrarily deny many
 
03:38:54.889 --> 03:38:54.899 align:start position:0%
other very worthy programs access to
 
03:38:56.990 --> 03:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
funding that they desperately need and
 
03:38:59.030 --> 03:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
would unnecessarily harm those in need
 
03:39:01.690 --> 03:39:01.700 align:start position:0%
of comprehensive integrative
 
03:39:04.010 --> 03:39:04.020 align:start position:0%
interdisciplinary Services by denying
 
03:39:06.710 --> 03:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
them access to those services
 
03:39:09.110 --> 03:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
we do have a very large drug problem in
 
03:39:10.969 --> 03:39:10.979 align:start position:0%
this state which I'm sure everybody in
 
03:39:13.490 --> 03:39:13.500 align:start position:0%
this room is aware of real people who
 
03:39:15.110 --> 03:39:15.120 align:start position:0%
could benefit from these funds are
 
03:39:17.090 --> 03:39:17.100 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily suffering from Pain
 
03:39:20.510 --> 03:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
addiction mental health disorders they
 
03:39:23.389 --> 03:39:23.399 align:start position:0%
need this funding now and they deserve a
 
03:39:26.150 --> 03:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
better comprehensive care plan this
 
03:39:27.950 --> 03:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
amendment would unnecessarily create a
 
03:39:29.990 --> 03:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
barrier which I would ask us to not
 
03:39:32.269 --> 03:39:32.279 align:start position:0%
create and I would also like to add that
 
03:39:34.849 --> 03:39:34.859 align:start position:0%
we representative Leon is totally right
 
03:39:37.250 --> 03:39:37.260 align:start position:0%
one of our big concerns was definitions
 
03:39:40.010 --> 03:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
and we will talk about that with SB 239
 
03:39:42.110 --> 03:39:42.120 align:start position:0%
we do have a definition of harm
 
03:39:43.849 --> 03:39:43.859 align:start position:0%
reduction which we will share for you at
 
03:39:46.070 --> 03:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
that time that I think clarifies a lot
 
03:39:48.830 --> 03:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
of this for these reasons though I would
 
03:39:50.870 --> 03:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
ask you to please press the red button
 
03:39:53.210 --> 03:39:53.220 align:start position:0%
so that this overly restrictive
 
03:39:55.670 --> 03:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment may be defeated and More in
 
03:39:58.610 --> 03:39:58.620 align:start position:0%
need may have access to life-saving
 
03:40:05.809 --> 03:40:05.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:08.030 --> 03:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
a division has been requested members
 
03:40:52.790 --> 03:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:55.010 --> 03:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
the motion before us is to lay on floor
 
03:40:57.889 --> 03:40:57.899 align:start position:0%
Amendment one eight three three h
 
03:40:59.990 --> 03:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
on let's say division vote
 
03:41:01.610 --> 03:41:01.620 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker if I know that 381
 
03:41:13.250 --> 03:41:13.260 align:start position:0%
million dollars is a large amount of
 
03:41:15.710 --> 03:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
money but still has a lot of areas where
 
03:41:18.290 --> 03:41:18.300 align:start position:0%
it needs to serve and if I know that it
 
03:41:20.150 --> 03:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
is critical to make sure that we
 
03:41:22.429 --> 03:41:22.439 align:start position:0%
emphasize that we need to have drug
 
03:41:25.490 --> 03:41:25.500 align:start position:0%
checking available in this state would I
 
03:41:27.170 --> 03:41:27.180 align:start position:0%
then press the green button to support
 
03:41:29.630 --> 03:41:29.640 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
03:41:39.349 --> 03:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
I've just been asked a wonderful
 
03:41:41.510 --> 03:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
question that I've edited a little part
 
03:41:44.090 --> 03:41:44.100 align:start position:0%
to Mr Speaker if I knew that people with
 
03:41:46.910 --> 03:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
chronic pain who represent 66 million
 
03:41:49.030 --> 03:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
people in America
 
03:41:52.070 --> 03:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
1.25 of people or million people in
 
03:41:54.229 --> 03:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
Hospice in a hollerative care who
 
03:41:56.870 --> 03:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
previously got decent pain management
 
03:41:59.750 --> 03:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
prior to the public policy response to
 
03:42:02.510 --> 03:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
opioid epidemic who now can't get it
 
03:42:04.790 --> 03:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
would now be able to access funds if
 
03:42:07.610 --> 03:42:07.620 align:start position:0%
harm reduction was included in our
 
03:42:10.250 --> 03:42:10.260 align:start position:0%
definition and if I know
 
03:42:12.410 --> 03:42:12.420 align:start position:0%
that this amendment or this bill without
 
03:42:14.269 --> 03:42:14.279 align:start position:0%
Amendment passed our committee with a
 
03:42:17.450 --> 03:42:17.460 align:start position:0%
vote of 16-3 and if I know many worthy
 
03:42:19.670 --> 03:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
organizations desperate for funding and
 
03:42:22.250 --> 03:42:22.260 align:start position:0%
Manpower which provide life-saving harm
 
03:42:24.290 --> 03:42:24.300 align:start position:0%
reduction services for opioid use
 
03:42:26.269 --> 03:42:26.279 align:start position:0%
disorder would be denied access to
 
03:42:28.370 --> 03:42:28.380 align:start position:0%
opioid abatement funds if this amendment
 
03:42:31.550 --> 03:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
passed and if I know it is critical that
 
03:42:33.309 --> 03:42:33.319 align:start position:0%
these two commissions share
 
03:42:35.510 --> 03:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
well-established evidence-based
 
03:42:37.490 --> 03:42:37.500 align:start position:0%

03:42:40.429 --> 03:42:40.439 align:start position:0%
terminology and practices not just to
 
03:42:42.530 --> 03:42:42.540 align:start position:0%
distribute opioid abatement funds but
 
03:42:44.870 --> 03:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
also to remain competitive in receiving
 
03:42:47.330 --> 03:42:47.340 align:start position:0%
grants and awards from other sources
 
03:42:50.450 --> 03:42:50.460 align:start position:0%

and good afternoon members
 
03:46:50.570 --> 03:46:50.580 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker Madam speaker excuse me I
 
03:46:53.330 --> 03:46:53.340 align:start position:0%
rise in opposition to the 10 to 9
 
03:46:56.570 --> 03:46:56.580 align:start position:0%
committee vote of itl for Senate bill
 
03:46:59.889 --> 03:46:59.899 align:start position:0%
85. this bill passed the other body
 
03:47:03.950 --> 03:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
unanimously with support across the full
 
03:47:06.290 --> 03:47:06.300 align:start position:0%
political Spectrum
 
03:47:08.990 --> 03:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
it would Place Mental Health emergencies
 
03:47:11.870 --> 03:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
On a par with physical health
 
03:47:13.910 --> 03:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
emergencies and that's to say when
 
03:47:15.769 --> 03:47:15.779 align:start position:0%
someone is having a heart attack
 
03:47:17.990 --> 03:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
currently that person needs to be
 
03:47:19.550 --> 03:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
treated right now
 
03:47:22.370 --> 03:47:22.380 align:start position:0%
not after an insurance company has given
 
03:47:24.530 --> 03:47:24.540 align:start position:0%
its prior authorization
 
03:47:27.290 --> 03:47:27.300 align:start position:0%
so similarly when someone is having a
 
03:47:29.750 --> 03:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
mental health crisis that person needs
 
03:47:32.389 --> 03:47:32.399 align:start position:0%
immediate professional attention
 
03:47:35.870 --> 03:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
not professional health attention after
 
03:47:38.110 --> 03:47:38.120 align:start position:0%
an insurance company has allowed it
 
03:47:41.269 --> 03:47:41.279 align:start position:0%
timing is critical
 
03:47:42.889 --> 03:47:42.899 align:start position:0%
there are many in the house who believe
 
03:47:46.729 --> 03:47:46.739 align:start position:0%
that recent events and specifically mass
 
03:47:49.250 --> 03:47:49.260 align:start position:0%
shootings that we are witnessing and not
 
03:47:51.950 --> 03:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
because of guns but because of mental
 
03:47:53.690 --> 03:47:53.700 align:start position:0%
health issues
 
03:47:55.670 --> 03:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
with the individuals carrying out these
 
03:47:57.050 --> 03:47:57.060 align:start position:0%
horrible Acts
 
03:47:58.969 --> 03:47:58.979 align:start position:0%
irrespective of what we may believe
 
03:48:00.889 --> 03:48:00.899 align:start position:0%
about guns it seems to be true that many
 
03:48:02.690 --> 03:48:02.700 align:start position:0%
of the shooters had
 
03:48:05.330 --> 03:48:05.340 align:start position:0%
and have mental health issues
 
03:48:07.490 --> 03:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
what if when someone is seen to be
 
03:48:09.830 --> 03:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
having a crisis that treatment is
 
03:48:12.410 --> 03:48:12.420 align:start position:0%
delayed as a result wouldn't many people
 
03:48:14.030 --> 03:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
then conclude
 
03:48:15.889 --> 03:48:15.899 align:start position:0%
myself included that the only answer
 
03:48:18.290 --> 03:48:18.300 align:start position:0%
left would be to Red Flag such a person
 
03:48:22.130 --> 03:48:22.140 align:start position:0%
and confiscate the guns
 
03:48:25.729 --> 03:48:25.739 align:start position:0%
that's what voting itl might lead to
 
03:48:27.530 --> 03:48:27.540 align:start position:0%
at present there was a committee to
 
03:48:29.389 --> 03:48:29.399 align:start position:0%
examine how many committees should be
 
03:48:31.969 --> 03:48:31.979 align:start position:0%
abolished so why add another one which
 
03:48:34.610 --> 03:48:34.620 align:start position:0%
is referenced in Senate Bill 85
 
03:48:37.429 --> 03:48:37.439 align:start position:0%
but actually if you read the bill what
 
03:48:39.050 --> 03:48:39.060 align:start position:0%
happens is a replacement of one
 
03:48:40.790 --> 03:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
committee with another so therefore
 
03:48:44.269 --> 03:48:44.279 align:start position:0%
there's a net zero gain in terms of the
 
03:48:45.769 --> 03:48:45.779 align:start position:0%
number of committees
 
03:48:47.750 --> 03:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
the newly constituted committee will
 
03:48:49.670 --> 03:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
look at how other states fund programs
 
03:48:52.370 --> 03:48:52.380 align:start position:0%
similar to what Senate Bill 85 is
 
03:48:52.380 --> 03:48:53.750 align:start position:0%
similar to what Senate Bill 85 is
establishing

03:48:53.750 --> 03:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
establishing
 
03:48:55.490 --> 03:48:55.500 align:start position:0%
there are some Frugal States in our
 
03:48:58.070 --> 03:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
country which have programs similar to
 
03:49:01.370 --> 03:49:01.380 align:start position:0%
what Senate Bill 85 proposes how they do
 
03:49:01.380 --> 03:49:02.090 align:start position:0%
what Senate Bill 85 proposes how they do
it

03:49:02.090 --> 03:49:02.100 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:49:05.330 --> 03:49:05.340 align:start position:0%
and how do they achieve their goals with
 
03:49:07.969 --> 03:49:07.979 align:start position:0%
good economic sense
 
03:49:09.889 --> 03:49:09.899 align:start position:0%
further how can we address the crisis in
 
03:49:13.190 --> 03:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
real and Frugal ways that's one issue
 
03:49:15.950 --> 03:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
that this reconstituted committee
 
03:49:18.110 --> 03:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
we'll examine
 
03:49:20.630 --> 03:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
further concern was raised that someone
 
03:49:23.690 --> 03:49:23.700 align:start position:0%
might fake a Comm a mental crisis simply
 
03:49:24.889 --> 03:49:24.899 align:start position:0%
to get attention
 
03:49:27.410 --> 03:49:27.420 align:start position:0%
the bill speaks however and I'll quote
 
03:49:30.290 --> 03:49:30.300 align:start position:0%
it's in the bill the sudden onset of a
 
03:49:32.750 --> 03:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
medical or mental health condition or
 
03:49:35.090 --> 03:49:35.100 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder that manifests
 
03:49:35.100 --> 03:49:36.290 align:start position:0%
substance use disorder that manifests
itself

03:49:36.290 --> 03:49:36.300 align:start position:0%
itself
 
03:49:39.830 --> 03:49:39.840 align:start position:0%
by symptoms of sufficient severity that
 
03:49:42.170 --> 03:49:42.180 align:start position:0%
a prudent layperson with average
 
03:49:44.570 --> 03:49:44.580 align:start position:0%
knowledge of health and Medicine could
 
03:49:47.269 --> 03:49:47.279 align:start position:0%
reasonably expect that the absence of
 
03:49:50.389 --> 03:49:50.399 align:start position:0%
immediate medical or mental health
 
03:49:53.150 --> 03:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
attention could be expected to result in
 
03:49:55.309 --> 03:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
any of the following and I'll stop there
 
03:49:57.590 --> 03:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
that's unquote because what follows is
 
03:49:59.330 --> 03:49:59.340 align:start position:0%
already in law and that's in the bill
 
03:50:01.670 --> 03:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
that hopefully youth have in front of
 
03:50:01.680 --> 03:50:03.410 align:start position:0%
that hopefully youth have in front of
you

03:50:03.410 --> 03:50:03.420 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:50:05.809 --> 03:50:05.819 align:start position:0%
the law is there already for sudden
 
03:50:08.389 --> 03:50:08.399 align:start position:0%
physical health conditions
 
03:50:10.610 --> 03:50:10.620 align:start position:0%
the bill recognizes that mental health
 
03:50:13.130 --> 03:50:13.140 align:start position:0%
conditions are parallel
 
03:50:14.570 --> 03:50:14.580 align:start position:0%
so we asked
 
03:50:14.580 --> 03:50:15.830 align:start position:0%
so we asked
together

03:50:15.830 --> 03:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
together
 
03:50:17.929 --> 03:50:17.939 align:start position:0%
for your support
 
03:50:19.670 --> 03:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
with the unanimous decision from the
 
03:50:20.750 --> 03:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
other body
 
03:50:22.510 --> 03:50:22.520 align:start position:0%
and with a
 
03:50:25.610 --> 03:50:25.620 align:start position:0%
enhanced common sense of the
 
03:50:27.530 --> 03:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
multitasking it takes to meet the
 
03:50:29.750 --> 03:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
challenges of both mental and physical
 
03:50:32.090 --> 03:50:32.100 align:start position:0%
health emergencies
 
03:50:35.450 --> 03:50:35.460 align:start position:0%
that we vote no on itl
 
03:50:38.750 --> 03:50:38.760 align:start position:0%
and consider another motion to then be
 
03:50:38.760 --> 03:50:39.590 align:start position:0%
and consider another motion to then be
made

03:50:39.590 --> 03:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
made
 
03:50:42.229 --> 03:50:42.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam speaker
 
03:50:44.330 --> 03:50:44.340 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative Leon
 
03:50:45.469 --> 03:50:45.479 align:start position:0%
to speak for the majority of the
 
03:50:45.479 --> 03:50:49.729 align:start position:0%
to speak for the majority of the
committee

03:50:49.729 --> 03:50:49.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:51.590 --> 03:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam speaker
 
03:50:53.630 --> 03:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
I rise in favor of inexpedient to
 
03:50:56.510 --> 03:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
legislate on Senate bill 85. this bill
 
03:50:58.670 --> 03:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
has the noble intention of addressing
 
03:51:00.769 --> 03:51:00.779 align:start position:0%
the emergency room boarding crisis and
 
03:51:02.929 --> 03:51:02.939 align:start position:0%
mental health problems but in trying to
 
03:51:05.090 --> 03:51:05.100 align:start position:0%
cover one square foot it covers many
 
03:51:06.590 --> 03:51:06.600 align:start position:0%
many acres
 
03:51:08.389 --> 03:51:08.399 align:start position:0%
now I recognize that we have a mental
 
03:51:10.790 --> 03:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
health crisis and it appears that just
 
03:51:13.190 --> 03:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
yesterday multiple lives were lost to
 
03:51:15.349 --> 03:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
the Mental Health crisis very close to
 
03:51:19.490 --> 03:51:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:21.530 --> 03:51:21.540 align:start position:0%
it's a tragedy and every person unable
 
03:51:23.690 --> 03:51:23.700 align:start position:0%
to access appropriate care and every
 
03:51:25.670 --> 03:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
life's lost to violence which stems from
 
03:51:28.250 --> 03:51:28.260 align:start position:0%
a mental illness is a tragedy but we
 
03:51:30.530 --> 03:51:30.540 align:start position:0%
don't we don't solve this problem by
 
03:51:33.590 --> 03:51:33.600 align:start position:0%
providing a solution that is so broad as
 
03:51:35.990 --> 03:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
to use pressure precious resources in an
 
03:51:37.729 --> 03:51:37.739 align:start position:0%
inefficient manner
 
03:51:39.530 --> 03:51:39.540 align:start position:0%
if you have one weed in the middle of
 
03:51:41.450 --> 03:51:41.460 align:start position:0%
your lawn you don't coat the whole lawn
 
03:51:43.969 --> 03:51:43.979 align:start position:0%
with Roundup if it's a dandelion or an
 
03:51:45.889 --> 03:51:45.899 align:start position:0%
Autumn Olive you go to the root and get
 
03:51:48.050 --> 03:51:48.060 align:start position:0%
the whole route out if it's crabgrass
 
03:51:49.849 --> 03:51:49.859 align:start position:0%
you mow down in that area so that it
 
03:51:52.250 --> 03:51:52.260 align:start position:0%
doesn't keep spreading if you have a
 
03:51:54.590 --> 03:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
mental health crisis that's as large as
 
03:51:56.690 --> 03:51:56.700 align:start position:0%
we have you make sure that you're not
 
03:51:58.910 --> 03:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
increasing your mandates for insurance
 
03:52:02.929 --> 03:52:02.939 align:start position:0%
coverage so much that you lose access to
 
03:52:04.670 --> 03:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
the very limited care providers that we
 
03:52:06.530 --> 03:52:06.540 align:start position:0%
have today we need to have other
 
03:52:08.150 --> 03:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
processes in order to be able to
 
03:52:09.590 --> 03:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
increase the amount of care that we are
 
03:52:11.990 --> 03:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
able to provide and having a massive
 
03:52:14.090 --> 03:52:14.100 align:start position:0%
broad reaching increase in Insurance
 
03:52:17.510 --> 03:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
mandates in order to try to address a
 
03:52:19.790 --> 03:52:19.800 align:start position:0%
problem is not the right solution we're
 
03:52:22.190 --> 03:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
going to dilute our offerings and we're
 
03:52:24.769 --> 03:52:24.779 align:start position:0%
not going to get to where we need to be
 
03:52:27.170 --> 03:52:27.180 align:start position:0%
simply put this bill has good intentions
 
03:52:29.450 --> 03:52:29.460 align:start position:0%
but the unintended consequences will set
 
03:52:32.150 --> 03:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
us back not move us forward therefore I
 
03:52:33.590 --> 03:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
ask that you support the inexpedient
 
03:52:37.250 --> 03:52:37.260 align:start position:0%
legislate motion thank you
 
03:52:39.110 --> 03:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
the motion before the house is the
 
03:52:41.570 --> 03:52:41.580 align:start position:0%

a division vote all members will take
 
03:53:34.969 --> 03:53:34.979 align:start position:0%

thank you madam speaker
 
03:53:57.349 --> 03:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
Madam speaker if I know that the mobile
 
03:54:00.410 --> 03:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
crisis teams are a key strategy enacted
 
03:54:02.929 --> 03:54:02.939 align:start position:0%
by this legislature and implemented by
 
03:54:04.490 --> 03:54:04.500 align:start position:0%
the Community Mental Health Centers
 
03:54:07.070 --> 03:54:07.080 align:start position:0%
across the state to alleviate the ER
 
03:54:09.050 --> 03:54:09.060 align:start position:0%
boarding crisis
 
03:54:11.450 --> 03:54:11.460 align:start position:0%
and if I know that mobile crisis teams
 
03:54:13.550 --> 03:54:13.560 align:start position:0%
are but one part of a comprehensive
 
03:54:16.910 --> 03:54:16.920 align:start position:0%
behavioral crisis stabilization system
 
03:54:18.830 --> 03:54:18.840 align:start position:0%

03:54:18.840 --> 03:54:20.150 align:start position:0%

Services

03:54:20.150 --> 03:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
Services
 
03:54:22.250 --> 03:54:22.260 align:start position:0%
and if I further know that the funding
 
03:54:24.309 --> 03:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
to complete and sustain these Services
 
03:54:27.110 --> 03:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
is uncertain
 
03:54:29.870 --> 03:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
and Madam speaker if I know that the
 
03:54:32.689 --> 03:54:32.699 align:start position:0%
limitation on pre-authorizations refers
 
03:54:34.610 --> 03:54:34.620 align:start position:0%
only to the mobile crisis team
 
03:54:38.630 --> 03:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
responding to acute psychiatric crises
 
03:54:41.090 --> 03:54:41.100 align:start position:0%
and if I know that psychiatric crises
 
03:54:44.150 --> 03:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
acute psychiatric crisis is not the time
 
03:54:46.610 --> 03:54:46.620 align:start position:0%
to pursue pre-authorizations from an
 
03:54:48.110 --> 03:54:48.120 align:start position:0%
insurance company
 
03:54:50.510 --> 03:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
would I then push the red button to
 
03:54:52.790 --> 03:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
defeat the itl motion so that another
 
03:54:56.090 --> 03:54:56.100 align:start position:0%
motion can be made to ensure sustainably
 
03:54:59.450 --> 03:54:59.460 align:start position:0%
funded effective community-based crisis
 
03:55:03.830 --> 03:55:03.840 align:start position:0%

03:55:14.450 --> 03:55:14.460 align:start position:0%
large increases Insurance in Insurance
 
03:55:16.670 --> 03:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
mandates require careful consideration
 
03:55:18.650 --> 03:55:18.660 align:start position:0%
and that our resources need to be
 
03:55:20.750 --> 03:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
appropriately allocated would I then
 
03:55:24.290 --> 03:55:24.300 align:start position:0%

Madam speaker if I know we are facing a
 
03:57:56.809 --> 03:57:56.819 align:start position:0%
serious and growing Mental Health crisis
 
03:57:58.670 --> 03:57:58.680 align:start position:0%
that needs addressing
 
03:58:00.469 --> 03:58:00.479 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this bill does not
 
03:58:02.689 --> 03:58:02.699 align:start position:0%
add a new committee to the hundreds we
 
03:58:05.330 --> 03:58:05.340 align:start position:0%
already have but rather changes an
 
03:58:07.490 --> 03:58:07.500 align:start position:0%
existing committee to one that is tasked
 
03:58:09.710 --> 03:58:09.720 align:start position:0%

chair of the PTSD commission this is
 
03:58:25.380 --> 03:58:26.630 align:start position:0%

medical drug for public health funding
 
04:04:04.969 --> 04:04:04.979 align:start position:0%
it's free and yet it provides billions
 
04:04:07.429 --> 04:04:07.439 align:start position:0%
of dollars for manufacturers and
 
04:04:09.710 --> 04:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
millions in federal transfers for New
 
04:04:12.590 --> 04:04:12.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire health organizations and it
 
04:04:15.410 --> 04:04:15.420 align:start position:0%
gives them Unity to those involved legal
 
04:04:18.349 --> 04:04:18.359 align:start position:0%
immunity but what about real immunity
 
04:04:21.290 --> 04:04:21.300 align:start position:0%
since this bill was introduced new
 
04:04:24.229 --> 04:04:24.239 align:start position:0%
scientific data showed that the ringing
 
04:04:26.830 --> 04:04:26.840 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness if at all
 
04:04:30.950 --> 04:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
antibody level drops so fast that it
 
04:04:34.610 --> 04:04:34.620 align:start position:0%
would require several boosters a year to
 
04:04:39.910 --> 04:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:44.210 --> 04:04:44.220 align:start position:0%
this month on my second published that
 
04:04:46.729 --> 04:04:46.739 align:start position:0%
individuals with covid-19 vaccinations
 
04:04:50.210 --> 04:04:50.220 align:start position:0%
had a high risk of all forms of retinal
 
04:04:52.729 --> 04:04:52.739 align:start position:0%
vascular occlusion they want
 
04:04:55.910 --> 04:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
optometrists to inject something that in
 
04:05:00.170 --> 04:05:00.180 align:start position:0%
two years causes occlusion in your eyes
 
04:05:03.050 --> 04:05:03.060 align:start position:0%
and federal agencies since recognized
 
04:05:05.750 --> 04:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
those connections between these vaccines
 
04:05:08.990 --> 04:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
and strokes and lowered doses of this
 
04:05:11.630 --> 04:05:11.640 align:start position:0%
vaccines for certain demographics not
 
04:05:13.550 --> 04:05:13.560 align:start position:0%
because it's too efficient because it
 
04:05:15.410 --> 04:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
doesn't stop transmission and doesn't
 
04:05:18.290 --> 04:05:18.300 align:start position:0%
prevent disease because it's dangerous
 
04:05:21.170 --> 04:05:21.180 align:start position:0%
if we use optometrist to vaccinate
 
04:05:24.830 --> 04:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
everyone has certain candidates will die
 
04:05:28.490 --> 04:05:28.500 align:start position:0%
and it's a bipartisan position of the
 
04:05:31.309 --> 04:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
health human services and the llfs
 
04:05:35.030 --> 04:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
committee that side effects of covid-19
 
04:05:37.790 --> 04:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
vaccines are underreported that's why we
 
04:05:41.090 --> 04:05:41.100 align:start position:0%
just voted for majority Amendment but
 
04:05:43.309 --> 04:05:43.319 align:start position:0%
majority Amendment doesn't go far enough
 
04:05:47.090 --> 04:05:47.100 align:start position:0%
we can't wait two years to protect our
 
04:05:50.150 --> 04:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
constituents we need to do it now this
 
04:05:52.610 --> 04:05:52.620 align:start position:0%
medicine disproportionately harms
 
04:05:55.849 --> 04:05:55.859 align:start position:0%
liberal constituents who on the specific
 
04:05:58.309 --> 04:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
issue class that the former president
 
04:06:01.030 --> 04:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
and our government administrations
 
04:06:04.030 --> 04:06:04.040 align:start position:0%
saying that it is safe and effective
 
04:06:07.309 --> 04:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
it's everything but safe anything but
 
04:06:09.290 --> 04:06:09.300 align:start position:0%
safe and effective and for this reason
 
04:06:12.710 --> 04:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
Madam speaker I use the support of this
 
04:06:16.189 --> 04:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
amendment press the green button and I
 
04:06:18.950 --> 04:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
ask for division vote and I'm right
 
04:06:23.510 --> 04:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:24.830 --> 04:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
with the
 
04:06:26.750 --> 04:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
representative Yale for a question
 
04:06:28.670 --> 04:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
the representative yields you may ask
 
04:06:30.050 --> 04:06:30.060 align:start position:0%
your question thank you madam speaker
 
04:06:31.550 --> 04:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
and thank you representative for taking
 
04:06:34.790 --> 04:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
my question is there an importance to
 
04:06:37.370 --> 04:06:37.380 align:start position:0%
address this uh some of these new
 
04:06:39.070 --> 04:06:39.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine technology
 
04:06:42.830 --> 04:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
even as we see now with the flu vaccine
 
04:06:49.330 --> 04:06:49.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:52.309 --> 04:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for these questions uh
 
04:06:55.490 --> 04:06:55.500 align:start position:0%
opponents of this amendment saying that
 
04:06:58.729 --> 04:06:58.739 align:start position:0%
mRNA technology is safe and effective
 
04:07:01.189 --> 04:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
because it was researched for many years
 
04:07:04.010 --> 04:07:04.020 align:start position:0%
but if it was fully researched why
 
04:07:07.210 --> 04:07:07.220 align:start position:0%
nobody informed us that it won't stop
 
04:07:09.889 --> 04:07:09.899 align:start position:0%
the transmission and won't prevent the
 
04:07:12.710 --> 04:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
disease why nobody told us two years ago
 
04:07:14.450 --> 04:07:14.460 align:start position:0%
that it will be associated with
 
04:07:19.010 --> 04:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
myocarditis and slog so so and and why
 
04:07:22.429 --> 04:07:22.439 align:start position:0%
women were gaslighted who had periods
 
04:07:26.330 --> 04:07:26.340 align:start position:0%
messed up by these medications so side
 
04:07:30.889 --> 04:07:30.899 align:start position:0%
effects are not well researched I I saw
 
04:07:34.130 --> 04:07:34.140 align:start position:0%
this certificate data of 60 plus years
 
04:07:36.170 --> 04:07:36.180 align:start position:0%
old New Hampshire residents who perished
 
04:07:38.650 --> 04:07:38.660 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts Hospital
 
04:07:42.610 --> 04:07:42.620 align:start position:0%
killed by lipid nanoparticles
 
04:07:48.429 --> 04:07:48.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:50.929 --> 04:07:50.939 align:start position:0%
phospholipids and it's not the single
 
04:07:53.929 --> 04:07:53.939 align:start position:0%
case we don't know how often it happens
 
04:07:56.269 --> 04:07:56.279 align:start position:0%
the same with the American Technology
 
04:07:58.030 --> 04:07:58.040 align:start position:0%
and new report shows that there's
 
04:08:01.130 --> 04:08:01.140 align:start position:0%
contaminations with DNA in this vaccines
 
04:08:06.110 --> 04:08:06.120 align:start position:0%
is it important finally most common case
 
04:08:08.210 --> 04:08:08.220 align:start position:0%
they're saying that Spike protein itself
 
04:08:11.389 --> 04:08:11.399 align:start position:0%
that is being produced in the body after
 
04:08:15.469 --> 04:08:15.479 align:start position:0%
this vaccination can have
 
04:08:21.469 --> 04:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
cardio toxicity and other effects so we
 
04:08:23.330 --> 04:08:23.340 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
04:08:23.340 --> 04:08:24.490 align:start position:0%
don't know
science

04:08:24.490 --> 04:08:24.500 align:start position:0%
science
 
04:08:26.990 --> 04:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
needs a year or two
 
04:08:29.990 --> 04:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
to figure out which one of this or some
 
04:08:32.469 --> 04:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
other Technologies in this new
 
04:08:35.809 --> 04:08:35.819 align:start position:0%
vaccines causing side effects blindness
 
04:08:39.290 --> 04:08:39.300 align:start position:0%
and sometimes death so I the only thing
 
04:08:42.710 --> 04:08:42.720 align:start position:0%
I'm asking is give us a year or two to
 
04:08:46.670 --> 04:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
properly research this topic thank you
 
04:08:48.349 --> 04:08:48.359 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
04:08:50.929 --> 04:08:50.939 align:start position:0%
Koval and I'll mention that a division
 
04:08:52.790 --> 04:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
vote has been requested so you want to
 
04:08:56.570 --> 04:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:59.750 --> 04:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:01.250 --> 04:09:01.260 align:start position:0%
many members of this chamber may know
 
04:09:03.229 --> 04:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
that I have a keen interest in the topic
 
04:09:05.210 --> 04:09:05.220 align:start position:0%
of vaccination I've introduced a number
 
04:09:09.050 --> 04:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
of bills that have to do with it
 
04:09:11.030 --> 04:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
that interest is driven by several
 
04:09:15.110 --> 04:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
principles including patient consent
 
04:09:17.210 --> 04:09:17.220 align:start position:0%
parental consent
 
04:09:20.269 --> 04:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
and maximizing Freedom both for
 
04:09:23.870 --> 04:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
practitioners and for patients
 
04:09:25.849 --> 04:09:25.859 align:start position:0%
the underlying Bill to which this
 
04:09:27.790 --> 04:09:27.800 align:start position:0%
amendment applies
 
04:09:31.250 --> 04:09:31.260 align:start position:0%
expands Freedom it increases the number
 
04:09:33.650 --> 04:09:33.660 align:start position:0%
of people who are authorized to
 
04:09:35.450 --> 04:09:35.460 align:start position:0%
administer vaccines in the state of New
 
04:09:39.530 --> 04:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to include optometrists
 
04:09:42.530 --> 04:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
that authorization extends only to
 
04:09:45.889 --> 04:09:45.899 align:start position:0%
administering vaccines to adults not to
 
04:09:45.899 --> 04:09:49.189 align:start position:0%
administering vaccines to adults not to
children

04:09:49.189 --> 04:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:56.870 --> 04:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:58.849 --> 04:09:58.859 align:start position:0%
like my esteemed colleague who just
 
04:09:58.859 --> 04:09:59.990 align:start position:0%
like my esteemed colleague who just
spoke

04:09:59.990 --> 04:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
spoke
 
04:10:02.570 --> 04:10:02.580 align:start position:0%
I I also believe that the covid-19
 
04:10:07.070 --> 04:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
vaccines and mRNA vaccines have not been
 
04:10:09.469 --> 04:10:09.479 align:start position:0%
proven to be safe and effective that's
 
04:10:12.410 --> 04:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
why I personally have chosen not to get
 
04:10:15.050 --> 04:10:15.060 align:start position:0%
the covet vaccine
 
04:10:17.750 --> 04:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
I respect the rights of everyone else in
 
04:10:20.809 --> 04:10:20.819 align:start position:0%
this room and out there to make up their
 
04:10:22.490 --> 04:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
own mind about whether or not they want
 
04:10:25.610 --> 04:10:25.620 align:start position:0%
to get that vaccine
 
04:10:28.969 --> 04:10:28.979 align:start position:0%
by amending this bill we are
 
04:10:33.950 --> 04:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
expanding freedom to to offer to to to
 
04:10:35.809 --> 04:10:35.819 align:start position:0%
allow more people to give vaccinations
 
04:10:38.090 --> 04:10:38.100 align:start position:0%
but then we are clawing back some of
 
04:10:39.889 --> 04:10:39.899 align:start position:0%
that authorization by saying well you
 
04:10:41.269 --> 04:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
can only do certain kinds of
 
04:10:41.279 --> 04:10:42.889 align:start position:0%
can only do certain kinds of
vaccinations

04:10:42.889 --> 04:10:42.899 align:start position:0%
vaccinations
 
04:10:44.750 --> 04:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
so in the spirit of maximizing freedom
 
04:10:47.389 --> 04:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
for patients and practitioners I urge my
 
04:10:49.729 --> 04:10:49.739 align:start position:0%
colleagues to vote no on this amendment
 
04:10:52.550 --> 04:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
so that we can pass a good clean bill
 
04:10:54.469 --> 04:10:54.479 align:start position:0%
that expands Freedom thank you madam
 
04:10:54.479 --> 04:10:55.849 align:start position:0%

thank you madam speaker if I know that
 
04:11:53.330 --> 04:11:53.340 align:start position:0%
optometrists will be under enormous
 
04:11:56.450 --> 04:11:56.460 align:start position:0%
pressure if this bill passes and if I
 
04:11:58.490 --> 04:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
know that they typically do not listen
 
04:12:01.490 --> 04:12:01.500 align:start position:0%
to patients Hearts do not take patients
 
04:12:03.769 --> 04:12:03.779 align:start position:0%
blood pressure and do not have a handle
 
04:12:06.650 --> 04:12:06.660 align:start position:0%
on the patient's full medical history
 
04:12:08.750 --> 04:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
and if I know that side effects
 
04:12:11.510 --> 04:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
associated with covid-19 vaccines are
 
04:12:11.520 --> 04:12:13.010 align:start position:0%
associated with covid-19 vaccines are
underreported

04:12:13.010 --> 04:12:13.020 align:start position:0%
underreported
 
04:12:15.769 --> 04:12:15.779 align:start position:0%
and finally if I know that more
 
04:12:17.750 --> 04:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed studies were published
 
04:12:17.760 --> 04:12:18.950 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed studies were published
regarding

04:12:18.950 --> 04:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
04:12:21.349 --> 04:12:21.359 align:start position:0%
blindness and even deaths caused by
 
04:12:22.910 --> 04:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
these vaccines
 
04:12:25.550 --> 04:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
would I now press the green button to
 
04:12:28.070 --> 04:12:28.080 align:start position:0%
allow for a reasonable delay for these
 
04:12:31.250 --> 04:12:31.260 align:start position:0%

thank you madam speaker
 
04:12:41.210 --> 04:12:41.220 align:start position:0%

04:12:43.790 --> 04:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
support patient freedom of choice
 
04:12:45.590 --> 04:12:45.600 align:start position:0%

thank you madam speaker I believe a
division

04:15:26.809 --> 04:15:26.819 align:start position:0%
division
 
04:15:29.570 --> 04:15:29.580 align:start position:0%

the gravel
 
04:15:32.330 --> 04:15:32.340 align:start position:0%
therefore I think we should do the

therefore I think we should do the
division

04:15:33.410 --> 04:15:33.420 align:start position:0%

it I apologize I did not hear the
 
04:16:20.929 --> 04:16:20.939 align:start position:0%
request for a division but this will be

a division vote the challenge though now
 
04:16:25.670 --> 04:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
is I if people have left the room or

04:22:18.710 --> 04:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
I'm a teacher thank you madam chairman
 
04:22:21.950 --> 04:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
speaker speaker sorry
 
04:22:25.550 --> 04:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
the running theme of um Senate Bill 239
 
04:22:27.650 --> 04:22:27.660 align:start position:0%
was aligning the terminologies in the
 
04:22:29.269 --> 04:22:29.279 align:start position:0%
governor's commission and the opioid
 
04:22:31.250 --> 04:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
abatement advisory commission with best
 
04:22:33.849 --> 04:22:33.859 align:start position:0%
practice nationally accepted language
 
04:22:36.590 --> 04:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
specifically replacing the word
 
04:22:38.630 --> 04:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
substance abuse with the broader term
 
04:22:41.330 --> 04:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
substance misuse which would allow us to
 
04:22:43.790 --> 04:22:43.800 align:start position:0%
increase certain groups with access to
 
04:22:46.910 --> 04:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
abatement funds including pain-related
 
04:22:49.490 --> 04:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
issues that we talked about earlier but
 
04:22:50.929 --> 04:22:50.939 align:start position:0%
more importantly as we're going to talk
 
04:22:53.090 --> 04:22:53.100 align:start position:0%
about now at emphasizing harm reduction
 
04:22:55.309 --> 04:22:55.319 align:start position:0%
strategies the problem is that neither
 
04:22:57.229 --> 04:22:57.239 align:start position:0%
of those two terms was defined in
 
04:23:00.110 --> 04:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
statute where substance abuse is defined
 
04:23:03.349 --> 04:23:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:07.070 --> 04:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
the term misuse does appear in RSA 12j
 
04:23:08.750 --> 04:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
which creates the governor's permission
 
04:23:11.689 --> 04:23:11.699 align:start position:0%
but again it's not defined the term harm
 
04:23:13.969 --> 04:23:13.979 align:start position:0%
reduction does not appear anywhere but
 
04:23:16.250 --> 04:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
is prominently appears in the last two
 
04:23:18.769 --> 04:23:18.779 align:start position:0%
Governors commission action plans
 
04:23:20.929 --> 04:23:20.939 align:start position:0%
we concluded that these two definitions
 
04:23:22.670 --> 04:23:22.680 align:start position:0%
both needed warrant a warranted
 
04:23:25.189 --> 04:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
definition by Statute
 
04:23:27.530 --> 04:23:27.540 align:start position:0%
what you just voted on actually created
 
04:23:30.950 --> 04:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
a definition for misuse but it created a
 
04:23:32.870 --> 04:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
definition for harm reduction that many
 
04:23:35.210 --> 04:23:35.220 align:start position:0%
of us had a trouble a problem with
 
04:23:37.370 --> 04:23:37.380 align:start position:0%
so we talked a great deal about how to
 
04:23:40.309 --> 04:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
fix that initially we used the samsa
 
04:23:43.070 --> 04:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
definition that basically harm reduction
 
04:23:45.830 --> 04:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
is an approach that emphasizes engaging
 
04:23:48.469 --> 04:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
directly with people who use drugs to
 
04:23:50.809 --> 04:23:50.819 align:start position:0%
prevent overdose and infectious disease
 
04:23:53.570 --> 04:23:53.580 align:start position:0%
transmission improve physical mental and
 
04:23:56.030 --> 04:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
social function of those served and
 
04:23:57.889 --> 04:23:57.899 align:start position:0%
offer low threshold options for
 
04:24:00.290 --> 04:24:00.300 align:start position:0%
accessing substance use disorder
 
04:24:03.170 --> 04:24:03.180 align:start position:0%
treatment and other health care
 
04:24:05.510 --> 04:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
some of us felt that that definition was
 
04:24:07.429 --> 04:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
too narrow some of us felt that it was
 
04:24:09.349 --> 04:24:09.359 align:start position:0%
too broad so a couple of us sat down
 
04:24:11.269 --> 04:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
tried to figure that out and what we did
 
04:24:13.429 --> 04:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
was we looked at number National
 
04:24:16.790 --> 04:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
websites also the governor's commission
 
04:24:18.830 --> 04:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
existing language and that's what we
 
04:24:21.650 --> 04:24:21.660 align:start position:0%
came up with was what you see now is the
 
04:24:21.660 --> 04:24:23.269 align:start position:0%
came up with was what you see now is the
current

04:24:23.269 --> 04:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
current
 
04:24:26.450 --> 04:24:26.460 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1861.
 
04:24:29.269 --> 04:24:29.279 align:start position:0%
um it reconciles these concerns by
 
04:24:31.490 --> 04:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
reitering samhsa definition of harm
 
04:24:34.490 --> 04:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
reduction and limiting the scope to
 
04:24:36.290 --> 04:24:36.300 align:start position:0%
eight harm reduction interventions which
 
04:24:38.269 --> 04:24:38.279 align:start position:0%
are both listed by samhsa and already
 
04:24:39.950 --> 04:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
exists in the governor's commission
 
04:24:42.950 --> 04:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
action plan by adopting this definition
 
04:24:45.650 --> 04:24:45.660 align:start position:0%
we can increase the potential list of
 
04:24:48.410 --> 04:24:48.420 align:start position:0%
grantees for the opioid abatement fund
 
04:24:50.030 --> 04:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
through a broader definition of harm
 
04:24:52.370 --> 04:24:52.380 align:start position:0%
reduction and Drug misuse use
 
04:24:55.010 --> 04:24:55.020 align:start position:0%
terminology that is more consistent with
 
04:24:57.650 --> 04:24:57.660 align:start position:0%
what is considered best practice and
 
04:25:00.229 --> 04:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
used nationally promote a coordinated
 
04:25:02.809 --> 04:25:02.819 align:start position:0%
Cooperative interdisciplinary model of
 
04:25:04.969 --> 04:25:04.979 align:start position:0%
care which is badly needed for substance
 
04:25:07.910 --> 04:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
use disorder in the state and promote a
 
04:25:10.429 --> 04:25:10.439 align:start position:0%
comprehensive preventive strategy as a
 
04:25:12.170 --> 04:25:12.180 align:start position:0%
ways of controlling the adverse effect
 
04:25:15.290 --> 04:25:15.300 align:start position:0%
of opioids and the other drugs in crisis
 
04:25:15.300 --> 04:25:16.269 align:start position:0%
of opioids and the other drugs in crisis
now

04:25:16.269 --> 04:25:16.279 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:25:18.469 --> 04:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
also that's important it will increase
 
04:25:21.469 --> 04:25:21.479 align:start position:0%
the access for underfunding sources for
 
04:25:24.349 --> 04:25:24.359 align:start position:0%
these programs and finally affect more
 
04:25:27.050 --> 04:25:27.060 align:start position:0%
lives in a positive way in order to
 
04:25:28.849 --> 04:25:28.859 align:start position:0%
improve access to care for those
 
04:25:31.490 --> 04:25:31.500 align:start position:0%

reauthorization of granted advantage to
 
04:31:49.729 --> 04:31:49.739 align:start position:0%

access to medical care for low-income

when it expires at the end of this year
 
04:32:11.030 --> 04:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
this was the clear and empath and
 
04:32:13.490 --> 04:32:13.500 align:start position:0%
emphatic recommendation of the
 
04:32:15.290 --> 04:32:15.300 align:start position:0%
commission created to evaluate the
 
04:32:18.410 --> 04:32:18.420 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of granted advantage
 
04:32:21.170 --> 04:32:21.180 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage provides tens of
 
04:32:22.849 --> 04:32:22.859 align:start position:0%
thousands of New Hampshire residents
 
04:32:25.670 --> 04:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
with primary care preventive services
 
04:32:29.149 --> 04:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
and Specialty Care when necessary
 
04:32:31.490 --> 04:32:31.500 align:start position:0%
it has resulted in significant reduction
 
04:32:34.130 --> 04:32:34.140 align:start position:0%
in uninsured residents and in
 
04:32:37.309 --> 04:32:37.319 align:start position:0%
uncompensated care costs

additionally granted advantages
 
04:32:46.189 --> 04:32:46.199 align:start position:0%

04:32:50.269 --> 04:32:50.279 align:start position:0%
the availability of coverage through
 
04:32:53.030 --> 04:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
granted Advantage has also proven to be
 
04:32:55.729 --> 04:32:55.739 align:start position:0%
an essential Lifeline for those

reducing the term of granted advantage
 
04:33:39.170 --> 04:33:39.180 align:start position:0%
to six years will unnecessarily
 
04:33:41.390 --> 04:33:41.400 align:start position:0%
complicate Medicaid expansion going

forward
 
04:33:44.750 --> 04:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
it is less than optimal for the

the current 90 percent match

discontinued

permanent reauthorization of granted
 
04:34:20.689 --> 04:34:20.699 align:start position:0%

low-income residents and for health care

considerable stress

there is simply no reason for a sunset
 
04:34:41.150 --> 04:34:41.160 align:start position:0%
with that I urge you to push the red
 
04:34:43.490 --> 04:34:43.500 align:start position:0%
button to defeat the amendment under
 
04:34:46.250 --> 04:34:46.260 align:start position:0%
consideration so that we can ensure the
 
04:34:50.449 --> 04:34:50.459 align:start position:0%
future of granite Advantage thank you
 
04:35:01.250 --> 04:35:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:03.529 --> 04:35:03.539 align:start position:0%
I rise today in support of the residents
 
04:35:05.390 --> 04:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
of our state who make between 100
 
04:35:08.269 --> 04:35:08.279 align:start position:0%
percent and 138 percent of the federal
 
04:35:10.849 --> 04:35:10.859 align:start position:0%
poverty level those who aren't disabled

aren't pregnant when they enter the
 
04:35:15.410 --> 04:35:15.420 align:start position:0%
program who aren't of retirement age and
 
04:35:17.330 --> 04:35:17.340 align:start position:0%
don't have children to qualify them for
 
04:35:19.070 --> 04:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
traditional Medicaid
 
04:35:22.010 --> 04:35:22.020 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion serves a far smaller
 
04:35:23.689 --> 04:35:23.699 align:start position:0%
group of people than your emails may
 
04:35:23.699 --> 04:35:24.590 align:start position:0%
group of people than your emails may
suggest

04:35:24.590 --> 04:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
suggest
 
04:35:26.150 --> 04:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
this is a group of people who haven't
 
04:35:28.609 --> 04:35:28.619 align:start position:0%
traditionally been included in safety
 
04:35:32.029 --> 04:35:32.039 align:start position:0%
nets in 2010 the Affordable Care Act
 
04:35:34.429 --> 04:35:34.439 align:start position:0%
shifted the HealthCare Marketplace such
 
04:35:36.650 --> 04:35:36.660 align:start position:0%
that we can hardly today recognize what
 
04:35:39.590 --> 04:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
we had only a decade and a half ago
 
04:35:41.631 --> 04:35:41.641 align:start position:0%
we see most doctors moving into Hospital
 
04:35:43.490 --> 04:35:43.500 align:start position:0%
Systems to survive the complexity
 
04:35:45.529 --> 04:35:45.539 align:start position:0%
introduced into the system
 
04:35:47.570 --> 04:35:47.580 align:start position:0%
the unaffordable Care Act created
 
04:35:49.609 --> 04:35:49.619 align:start position:0%
Medicaid expansion as a way to address
 
04:35:52.490 --> 04:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
the problems it created and the group of
 
04:35:54.109 --> 04:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
granite Staters served by this program
 
04:35:58.010 --> 04:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
really have no other Solutions today
 
04:36:00.289 --> 04:36:00.299 align:start position:0%
our state took a half step to move
 
04:36:03.230 --> 04:36:03.240 align:start position:0%
towards this program in 2014 and fully
 
04:36:06.109 --> 04:36:06.119 align:start position:0%
engage with Medicaid expansion in 2018.
 
04:36:09.529 --> 04:36:09.539 align:start position:0%
this program is still relatively new and
 
04:36:12.051 --> 04:36:12.061 align:start position:0%
that's why I support a six-year Sunset
 
04:36:14.510 --> 04:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
so that this program can continue with
 
04:36:17.449 --> 04:36:17.459 align:start position:0%
appropriate legislative attention
 
04:36:19.670 --> 04:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
now you all may have heard some
 
04:36:21.051 --> 04:36:21.061 align:start position:0%
arguments that we've already had an
 
04:36:23.390 --> 04:36:23.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to review this program
 
04:36:25.789 --> 04:36:25.799 align:start position:0%
in a normal world that might make sense
 
04:36:30.650 --> 04:36:30.660 align:start position:0%
but at the years since 2018 been normal
 
04:36:32.929 --> 04:36:32.939 align:start position:0%
we saw the world shut down in March 2020
 
04:36:35.230 --> 04:36:35.240 align:start position:0%
at the same time the federal government
 
04:36:37.910 --> 04:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
prohibited States from removing anybody
 
04:36:39.949 --> 04:36:39.959 align:start position:0%
from Medicaid and Medicaid expansion
 
04:36:42.709 --> 04:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
until the expiration of the public
 
04:36:45.769 --> 04:36:45.779 align:start position:0%
health emergency which ended seven days
 
04:36:45.779 --> 04:36:47.209 align:start position:0%
health emergency which ended seven days
ago

04:36:47.209 --> 04:36:47.219 align:start position:0%
ago
 
04:36:49.429 --> 04:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
this is still a very shifting landscape
 
04:36:52.010 --> 04:36:52.020 align:start position:0%
and it is far too early to make this
 
04:36:53.810 --> 04:36:53.820 align:start position:0%
program permanent
 
04:36:55.429 --> 04:36:55.439 align:start position:0%
if you look at the language that would
 
04:36:57.170 --> 04:36:57.180 align:start position:0%
be made permanent there are several
 
04:36:59.750 --> 04:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
sections that are outdated some refer to
 
04:37:03.349 --> 04:37:03.359 align:start position:0%
dates in 2019 for a waiver request there
 
04:37:04.970 --> 04:37:04.980 align:start position:0%
are other ones that are not currently in
 
04:37:04.980 --> 04:37:06.349 align:start position:0%
are other ones that are not currently in
effect

04:37:06.349 --> 04:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
effect
 
04:37:08.631 --> 04:37:08.641 align:start position:0%
if we're going to make it permanent
 
04:37:11.449 --> 04:37:11.459 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we make the language of the
 
04:37:13.970 --> 04:37:13.980 align:start position:0%
law in good language in order to make it
 
04:37:13.980 --> 04:37:15.529 align:start position:0%
law in good language in order to make it
permanent

04:37:15.529 --> 04:37:15.539 align:start position:0%
permanent
 
04:37:17.510 --> 04:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
with a six-year Sunset and a
 
04:37:19.730 --> 04:37:19.740 align:start position:0%
re-establishment of the committee that
 
04:37:21.890 --> 04:37:21.900 align:start position:0%
addresses Medicaid expansion we have a
 
04:37:23.990 --> 04:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
good reason to do the hard work required
 
04:37:26.330 --> 04:37:26.340 align:start position:0%
in order to make this program the best
 
04:37:28.789 --> 04:37:28.799 align:start position:0%
Granite solution we can
 
04:37:30.949 --> 04:37:30.959 align:start position:0%
without a sunset there'll be a much
 
04:37:33.170 --> 04:37:33.180 align:start position:0%
higher hurdle to make this program the
 
04:37:34.670 --> 04:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
best that it can be
 
04:37:36.709 --> 04:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
I asked for your support for this
 
04:37:38.990 --> 04:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
amendment to create a six-year Sunset
 
04:37:40.910 --> 04:37:40.920 align:start position:0%
and otherwise match the language that is
 
04:37:41.990 --> 04:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
in the budget
 
04:37:43.970 --> 04:37:43.980 align:start position:0%
we are our careful attention to this
 
04:37:45.590 --> 04:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
matter to the tens of thousands of
 
04:37:47.929 --> 04:37:47.939 align:start position:0%
granite Staters who participate in the
 
04:37:50.209 --> 04:37:50.219 align:start position:0%
granite Advantage program and we can do
 
04:37:53.869 --> 04:37:53.879 align:start position:0%
that best by passing the six-year sunset
 
04:37:55.970 --> 04:37:55.980 align:start position:0%
so this time frame is actually a sweet
 
04:37:57.949 --> 04:37:57.959 align:start position:0%
spot for the Managed Care Organization
 
04:38:01.730 --> 04:38:01.740 align:start position:0%
contracts five years gives you the best
 
04:38:04.070 --> 04:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
cost while still having the flexibility
 
04:38:06.470 --> 04:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
to renegotiate future contracts to look
 
04:38:07.789 --> 04:38:07.799 align:start position:0%
at the landscape
 
04:38:10.429 --> 04:38:10.439 align:start position:0%
five years ago nobody had heard of covid
 
04:38:13.429 --> 04:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
now nobody hasn't heard of it the world
 
04:38:15.650 --> 04:38:15.660 align:start position:0%
changes and we don't want to make things
 
04:38:17.869 --> 04:38:17.879 align:start position:0%
permanent I think a five-year contract
 
04:38:19.670 --> 04:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
would be the best way to serve the
 
04:38:21.109 --> 04:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
people of the state
 
04:38:23.570 --> 04:38:23.580 align:start position:0%
so we can best serve our constituents by
 
04:38:26.090 --> 04:38:26.100 align:start position:0%
passing the six-year sunset
 
04:38:28.429 --> 04:38:28.439 align:start position:0%
and I urge you to support this amendment
 
04:38:30.709 --> 04:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
and Mr Speaker I asked for a roll call
 
04:38:30.719 --> 04:38:36.230 align:start position:0%

04:40:14.510 --> 04:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
this is a roll call vote care recognizes
 
04:40:16.250 --> 04:40:16.260 align:start position:0%
representative Weber for a parliamentary

04:40:30.170 --> 04:40:30.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:40:34.788 --> 04:40:34.798 align:start position:0%
if I know that Senate Bill 263 unamended
 
04:40:37.310 --> 04:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
is supported by a large Coalition of
 
04:40:39.350 --> 04:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
organizations with direct interests in
 
04:40:41.208 --> 04:40:41.218 align:start position:0%
promoting the health of granite Staters
 
04:40:43.788 --> 04:40:43.798 align:start position:0%
and by countless individual Granite
 
04:40:43.798 --> 04:40:45.470 align:start position:0%
and by countless individual Granite
Staters

04:40:45.470 --> 04:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
Staters
 
04:40:48.288 --> 04:40:48.298 align:start position:0%
and if I know that Senate Bill 263
 
04:40:48.298 --> 04:40:50.448 align:start position:0%
and if I know that Senate Bill 263
unamended

04:40:50.448 --> 04:40:50.458 align:start position:0%
unamended
 
04:40:53.630 --> 04:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
promotes Access to Health Care a healthy
 
04:40:56.630 --> 04:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
Workforce and reduces uncompensated care
 
04:40:58.490 --> 04:40:58.500 align:start position:0%
and cost shifting
 
04:41:02.810 --> 04:41:02.820 align:start position:0%
and finally if I know that
 
04:41:05.208 --> 04:41:05.218 align:start position:0%
the granite Advantage program has
 
04:41:07.550 --> 04:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
already been in existence for longer
 
04:41:10.670 --> 04:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
than the six-year Amendment proposed
 
04:41:14.448 --> 04:41:14.458 align:start position:0%
and that a six-year Amendment
 
04:41:17.448 --> 04:41:17.458 align:start position:0%
still does not provide the kind of
 
04:41:20.690 --> 04:41:20.700 align:start position:0%
permanence that allows for long-term
 
04:41:23.868 --> 04:41:23.878 align:start position:0%
investment in health care infrastructure
 
04:41:26.990 --> 04:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
would I now press the red button to
 
04:41:29.930 --> 04:41:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:31.310 --> 04:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
do you recognize the representative
 
04:41:45.350 --> 04:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:47.868 --> 04:41:47.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:41:50.090 --> 04:41:50.100 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that tens of
 
04:41:52.490 --> 04:41:52.500 align:start position:0%
thousands of our fellow citizens rely on
 
04:41:54.948 --> 04:41:54.958 align:start position:0%
this important Health Care Program
 
04:41:58.010 --> 04:41:58.020 align:start position:0%
and Mr Speaker if I also know that there
 
04:41:59.868 --> 04:41:59.878 align:start position:0%
was an understandable concern about a
 
04:42:02.330 --> 04:42:02.340 align:start position:0%
two-year Sunset being proposed earlier
 
04:42:04.490 --> 04:42:04.500 align:start position:0%
because of the cost of such a short-term
 
04:42:07.190 --> 04:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
contract and the likely unwillingness of
 
04:42:09.350 --> 04:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
Managed Care organizations to bid on it
 
04:42:11.810 --> 04:42:11.820 align:start position:0%
and that was why a six-year Sunset is
 
04:42:13.670 --> 04:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
now being proposed because a five-year
 
04:42:17.030 --> 04:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
contract or longer is more desirable
 
04:42:18.708 --> 04:42:18.718 align:start position:0%
and Mr Speaker
 
04:42:20.510 --> 04:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
if I know that the health care industry
 
04:42:22.910 --> 04:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
is a very Dynamic one which is
 
04:42:25.550 --> 04:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
constantly changing and that the needs
 
04:42:27.170 --> 04:42:27.180 align:start position:0%
of the people it serves are always
 
04:42:29.330 --> 04:42:29.340 align:start position:0%
changing also
 
04:42:32.330 --> 04:42:32.340 align:start position:0%
and finally Mr Speaker if I know that
 
04:42:34.368 --> 04:42:34.378 align:start position:0%
many hundreds of bills are considered by
 
04:42:37.250 --> 04:42:37.260 align:start position:0%
this legislature every single year and
 
04:42:39.350 --> 04:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
that a sunset for this program ensures
 
04:42:41.750 --> 04:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
that we will give this very important
 
04:42:44.030 --> 04:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
program the review and attention it very
 
04:42:46.430 --> 04:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
much deserves and makes certain it
 
04:42:48.470 --> 04:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't get buried by all of the other
 
04:42:51.050 --> 04:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation then Mr Speaker
 
04:42:53.208 --> 04:42:53.218 align:start position:0%
when I press the green button and pass
 
04:42:55.670 --> 04:42:55.680 align:start position:0%

which I recognize representative Cushman
 
04:44:32.510 --> 04:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:44:35.090 --> 04:44:35.100 align:start position:0%
I Rise before you to speak in support of
 
04:44:38.030 --> 04:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
amendment one eight six four-h to Senate
 
04:44:40.970 --> 04:44:40.980 align:start position:0%
Bill 263 a vital amendment that aligns
 
04:44:42.530 --> 04:44:42.540 align:start position:0%
the commission to evaluate the
 
04:44:44.030 --> 04:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
effectiveness and future of the New
 
04:44:45.530 --> 04:44:45.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Granite Advantage Health Care
 
04:44:50.270 --> 04:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
Program with RSA 14 colon 49
 
04:44:53.448 --> 04:44:53.458 align:start position:0%
which relates to legislative committees
 
04:44:54.948 --> 04:44:54.958 align:start position:0%
and commissions
 
04:44:56.448 --> 04:44:56.458 align:start position:0%
this amendment ensures that the
 
04:44:58.430 --> 04:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
commission adheres to the legislative
 
04:45:00.830 --> 04:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
intent by limiting its membership to no
 
04:45:03.410 --> 04:45:03.420 align:start position:0%
more than 15 members with a majority of
 
04:45:06.110 --> 04:45:06.120 align:start position:0%
those members being legislators
 
04:45:08.750 --> 04:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
under this amendment the three senators
 
04:45:10.970 --> 04:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
and three House Representatives will be
 
04:45:12.650 --> 04:45:12.660 align:start position:0%
the only voting members while
 
04:45:15.050 --> 04:45:15.060 align:start position:0%
non-legislative members will serve in an
 
04:45:17.390 --> 04:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
advisory role providing valuable input
 
04:45:19.610 --> 04:45:19.620 align:start position:0%
without voting privileges
 
04:45:21.170 --> 04:45:21.180 align:start position:0%
the proposed amendment reflects the
 
04:45:22.670 --> 04:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
original structure of the commission
 
04:45:25.250 --> 04:45:25.260 align:start position:0%
where all members were part of the
 
04:45:27.230 --> 04:45:27.240 align:start position:0%
decision-making process
 
04:45:29.930 --> 04:45:29.940 align:start position:0%
but only legislators possess the ability
 
04:45:31.788 --> 04:45:31.798 align:start position:0%
to cast votes
 
04:45:34.250 --> 04:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
by returning to this model we uphold the
 
04:45:36.770 --> 04:45:36.780 align:start position:0%
principle of legislative oversight and
 
04:45:38.570 --> 04:45:38.580 align:start position:0%
ensure that elected official officials
 
04:45:40.610 --> 04:45:40.620 align:start position:0%
who are accountable to their
 
04:45:42.708 --> 04:45:42.718 align:start position:0%
constituents have the final say in
 
04:45:44.150 --> 04:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
shaping the granite Advantage Health
 
04:45:45.590 --> 04:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
Care Program
 
04:45:47.990 --> 04:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
one of the significant considerations in
 
04:45:50.030 --> 04:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
making this change is the potential
 
04:45:52.368 --> 04:45:52.378 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest that may arise when
 
04:45:54.470 --> 04:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
non-legislative members particularly
 
04:45:56.810 --> 04:45:56.820 align:start position:0%
those with a direct State stake in
 
04:45:58.970 --> 04:45:58.980 align:start position:0%
Medicaid funding hold voting power
 
04:46:01.190 --> 04:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
within the commission
 
04:46:03.590 --> 04:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
for example we have representatives of
 
04:46:06.050 --> 04:46:06.060 align:start position:0%
Managed Care organizations mcos
 
04:46:08.270 --> 04:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
appointed to the commission
 
04:46:10.368 --> 04:46:10.378 align:start position:0%
these or currently these organizations
 
04:46:12.948 --> 04:46:12.958 align:start position:0%
are awarded contracts as vendors under
 
04:46:15.170 --> 04:46:15.180 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid Managed Care Program
 
04:46:16.910 --> 04:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
granting voting rights to MCO
 
04:46:19.128 --> 04:46:19.138 align:start position:0%
Representatives who depend on Medicaid
 
04:46:19.138 --> 04:46:20.270 align:start position:0%
Representatives who depend on Medicaid
funding

04:46:20.270 --> 04:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
funding
 
04:46:22.670 --> 04:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
for their operations raises concerns
 
04:46:24.470 --> 04:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
about a possible conflict of interests
 
04:46:26.570 --> 04:46:26.580 align:start position:0%
it is essential to maintain the
 
04:46:29.208 --> 04:46:29.218 align:start position:0%
integrity and object objectivity of the
 
04:46:30.770 --> 04:46:30.780 align:start position:0%
commission's decision-making process
 
04:46:32.868 --> 04:46:32.878 align:start position:0%
ensuring that the interests of the
 
04:46:34.850 --> 04:46:34.860 align:start position:0%
program's beneficiaries in the overall

overall well-being
 
04:55:25.910 --> 04:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
furthermore work requirements align with
 
04:55:28.010 --> 04:55:28.020 align:start position:0%
the principles of fairness and
 
04:55:28.020 --> 04:55:29.930 align:start position:0%
the principles of fairness and
accountability

04:55:29.930 --> 04:55:29.940 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
04:55:35.390 --> 04:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
our hard-working taxpayers fund Medicaid
 
04:55:38.288 --> 04:55:38.298 align:start position:0%
and it is our
 
04:55:41.090 --> 04:55:41.100 align:start position:0%
responsibility to ensure that these
 
04:55:44.570 --> 04:55:44.580 align:start position:0%
resources are utilized appropriately and
 
04:55:44.580 --> 04:55:46.190 align:start position:0%
resources are utilized appropriately and
efficiently

04:55:46.190 --> 04:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
efficiently
 
04:55:49.190 --> 04:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
by incorporating work requirements we
 
04:55:51.350 --> 04:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
are promoting a sense of responsibility
 
04:55:54.788 --> 04:55:54.798 align:start position:0%
and reciprocity among recipients
 
04:55:57.890 --> 04:55:57.900 align:start position:0%
ensuring that taxpayer dollars are
 
04:56:00.350 --> 04:56:00.360 align:start position:0%
utilized to support those who genuinely
 
04:56:03.288 --> 04:56:03.298 align:start position:0%
need assistance
 
04:56:05.750 --> 04:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
critics argue
 
04:56:08.690 --> 04:56:08.700 align:start position:0%
that work requirements may lead to loss
 
04:56:11.570 --> 04:56:11.580 align:start position:0%
of coverage and hinder access to health
 
04:56:15.770 --> 04:56:15.780 align:start position:0%
care for some individuals however
 
04:56:18.410 --> 04:56:18.420 align:start position:0%
it's important to note that vulnerable
 
04:56:20.810 --> 04:56:20.820 align:start position:0%
populations such as those with
 
04:56:20.820 --> 04:56:22.070 align:start position:0%
populations such as those with
disabilities

04:56:22.070 --> 04:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
04:56:24.110 --> 04:56:24.120 align:start position:0%
elderly individuals
 
04:56:26.930 --> 04:56:26.940 align:start position:0%
pregnant women and caretakers of young
 
04:56:29.208 --> 04:56:29.218 align:start position:0%
children are covered by traditional
 
04:56:33.590 --> 04:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and not Medicaid expansion
 
04:56:36.050 --> 04:56:36.060 align:start position:0%
work requirements have already
 
04:56:38.090 --> 04:56:38.100 align:start position:0%
demonstrated their effectiveness in
 
04:56:40.788 --> 04:56:40.798 align:start position:0%
other social programs such as snap
 
04:56:43.190 --> 04:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
Studies have shown
 
04:56:45.230 --> 04:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
that individuals subject to work
 
04:56:47.628 --> 04:56:47.638 align:start position:0%
requirements experience improved
 
04:56:50.830 --> 04:56:50.840 align:start position:0%
employment outcomes increased earnings
 
04:56:53.750 --> 04:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
and reduced dependence on public
 
04:56:53.760 --> 04:56:55.190 align:start position:0%
and reduced dependence on public
assistance

04:56:55.190 --> 04:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
04:56:58.070 --> 04:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
it is only logical to extend these
 
04:56:59.868 --> 04:56:59.878 align:start position:0%
successful principles to the Medicaid
 
04:57:02.708 --> 04:57:02.718 align:start position:0%
Program where similar positive results
 
04:57:06.288 --> 04:57:06.298 align:start position:0%
can be expected
 
04:57:08.570 --> 04:57:08.580 align:start position:0%
to address concerns about access to
 
04:57:11.270 --> 04:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
health care we must also focus on
 
04:57:13.670 --> 04:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
creating an environment that facilitates
 
04:57:15.350 --> 04:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
job growth
 
04:57:17.448 --> 04:57:17.458 align:start position:0%

04:57:20.750 --> 04:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
and Workforce Development by investing
 
04:57:23.390 --> 04:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
in job creation initiatives vocational
 
04:57:26.350 --> 04:57:26.360 align:start position:0%
programs and educational opportunities
 
04:57:30.948 --> 04:57:30.958 align:start position:0%
we can Empower Medicaid recipients to
 
04:57:32.990 --> 04:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
transition from Reliance on public
 
04:57:36.470 --> 04:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
assistance to meaningful employment
 
04:57:39.410 --> 04:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
all while maintaining access to
 
04:57:42.410 --> 04:57:42.420 align:start position:0%
necessary Health Care Services
 
04:57:44.628 --> 04:57:44.638 align:start position:0%
in conclusion
 
04:57:46.850 --> 04:57:46.860 align:start position:0%
implementing work requirements for
 
04:57:49.190 --> 04:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
Medicaid recipients
 
04:57:52.910 --> 04:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
is not about punishing or abandoning
 
04:57:54.708 --> 04:57:54.718 align:start position:0%
those in need
 
04:57:57.948 --> 04:57:57.958 align:start position:0%
it's about promoting personal growth
 
04:58:00.350 --> 04:58:00.360 align:start position:0%
promoting and fostering self-sufficiency
 
04:58:03.288 --> 04:58:03.298 align:start position:0%
and ensuring the sustainability of our
 
04:58:05.390 --> 04:58:05.400 align:start position:0%
health care System
 
04:58:08.270 --> 04:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
by encouraging able-bodied individuals
 
04:58:11.690 --> 04:58:11.700 align:start position:0%
to actively participate in the workforce
 
04:58:14.810 --> 04:58:14.820 align:start position:0%
we are empowering them to reach their
 
04:58:17.690 --> 04:58:17.700 align:start position:0%
full potential reducing dependency on
 
04:58:20.270 --> 04:58:20.280 align:start position:0%
public assistance and creating a

previously but they've been overturned
 
04:59:38.690 --> 04:59:38.700 align:start position:0%

Washington DC they are talking about
 
04:59:44.810 --> 04:59:44.820 align:start position:0%
this issue right now and possibly
 
04:59:46.570 --> 04:59:46.580 align:start position:0%
most likely
 
04:59:50.150 --> 04:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
implementing work requirements so we
 
04:59:54.230 --> 04:59:54.240 align:start position:0%

speaker if I know that SB 263 is meant
 
05:00:52.010 --> 05:00:52.020 align:start position:0%
unamended is supported by a large

individual Granite Staters
 
05:01:04.670 --> 05:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
if I know that Senate Bill 263 unamended
 
05:01:07.310 --> 05:01:07.320 align:start position:0%
promotes Access to Health Care a healthy

Workforce and reduces uncompensated care
 
05:01:12.650 --> 05:01:12.660 align:start position:0%
costs and cost shifting
 
05:01:15.590 --> 05:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
if I further know that the experience of
 
05:01:19.910 --> 05:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
the program is that 70 of the recipients

are already working
 
05:01:25.190 --> 05:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
and that many of the other recipients
 
05:01:28.550 --> 05:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
use this program as a short-term
 
05:01:33.770 --> 05:01:33.780 align:start position:0%
transition between one job or another or
 
05:01:36.590 --> 05:01:36.600 align:start position:0%
as a way to cover recovery from an

05:09:00.770 --> 05:09:00.780 align:start position:0%
the problem we have is the road race
 
05:09:02.690 --> 05:09:02.700 align:start position:0%
actually starts at six
 
05:09:04.430 --> 05:09:04.440 align:start position:0%

05:09:35.990 --> 05:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
it depends on
 
05:09:39.230 --> 05:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
where where you're parked and what time
 
05:09:43.670 --> 05:09:43.680 align:start position:0%

I mean everybody in store Street will
 
05:09:47.810 --> 05:09:47.820 align:start position:0%
certainly be able to get out the people

for those who haven't found it in their
 
05:10:17.150 --> 05:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
cluster of amendments I'm going to read
 
05:10:18.948 --> 05:10:18.958 align:start position:0%
the entire thing because it's only one
 
05:10:20.628 --> 05:10:20.638 align:start position:0%
line long
 
05:10:22.128 --> 05:10:22.138 align:start position:0%
amend the bill by inserting after
 
05:10:24.110 --> 05:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
section 7 the following and renumbering
 
05:10:26.050 --> 05:10:26.060 align:start position:0%
the original Section 8 to read as nine
 
05:10:30.610 --> 05:10:30.620 align:start position:0%
repeal 2018 if this is chapter law
 
05:10:33.170 --> 05:10:33.180 align:start position:0%
342-20 relative to the severability of
 
05:10:34.610 --> 05:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Medicaid and premium
 
05:10:38.448 --> 05:10:38.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:41.030 --> 05:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
what is a severability clause quite
 
05:10:43.368 --> 05:10:43.378 align:start position:0%
simply when laws are put together if a
 
05:10:46.190 --> 05:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
court strikes down a section of it
 
05:10:48.650 --> 05:10:48.660 align:start position:0%
unless there's a severability clause in
 
05:10:48.660 --> 05:10:49.868 align:start position:0%
unless there's a severability clause in
place

05:10:49.868 --> 05:10:49.878 align:start position:0%
place
 
05:10:53.270 --> 05:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
potentially the whole thing is at risk
 
05:10:54.948 --> 05:10:54.958 align:start position:0%
at the time that this bill was put
 
05:10:58.550 --> 05:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
forward there was an open window for
 
05:11:01.310 --> 05:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
work requirements that window closed
 
05:11:04.788 --> 05:11:04.798 align:start position:0%
after our former president was no longer
 
05:11:06.670 --> 05:11:06.680 align:start position:0%
in office
 
05:11:10.430 --> 05:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
that work requirements is front page
 
05:11:13.910 --> 05:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
news in DC right now what we are seeing
 
05:11:16.190 --> 05:11:16.200 align:start position:0%
going going on is the house under
 
05:11:18.110 --> 05:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
speaker McCarthy
 
05:11:20.510 --> 05:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
I think I'm allowed to the the U.S
 
05:11:20.520 --> 05:11:21.948 align:start position:0%
I think I'm allowed to the the U.S
speaker

05:11:21.948 --> 05:11:21.958 align:start position:0%
speaker
 
05:11:24.650 --> 05:11:24.660 align:start position:0%
um has pushed very hard to re-establish
 
05:11:27.708 --> 05:11:27.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:29.990 --> 05:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
our president is pushed back we don't
 
05:11:32.330 --> 05:11:32.340 align:start position:0%
know the outcome of that but we do know
 
05:11:34.250 --> 05:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
that it would be valuable to put back
 
05:11:37.670 --> 05:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
into law that Clause such that the
 
05:11:39.470 --> 05:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
program is contingent upon having work
 
05:11:39.480 --> 05:11:42.050 align:start position:0%
program is contingent upon having work
requirements

05:11:42.050 --> 05:11:42.060 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
05:11:44.930 --> 05:11:44.940 align:start position:0%
as the former speaker talked about work
 
05:11:47.448 --> 05:11:47.458 align:start position:0%
requirements and the benefits and I want
 
05:11:50.208 --> 05:11:50.218 align:start position:0%
to concur with her remarks
 
05:11:52.310 --> 05:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
this is not to be a handout this is to
 
05:11:54.050 --> 05:11:54.060 align:start position:0%
be a hand up this program this is
 
05:11:55.730 --> 05:11:55.740 align:start position:0%
supposed to be temporary
 
05:11:58.250 --> 05:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
two weeks ago I sat on as a as a
 
05:12:00.650 --> 05:12:00.660 align:start position:0%
substitute on HHS
 
05:12:02.628 --> 05:12:02.638 align:start position:0%
to talk about this bill
 
05:12:05.030 --> 05:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
and we agreed at the time that those who
 
05:12:06.708 --> 05:12:06.718 align:start position:0%
are participating in the program this is
 
05:12:08.330 --> 05:12:08.340 align:start position:0%
not a lifestyle choice this is not a
 
05:12:10.670 --> 05:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
permanent decision this is to be a
 
05:12:12.830 --> 05:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
transitory event
 
05:12:14.690 --> 05:12:14.700 align:start position:0%
I personally experienced one of those I
 
05:12:17.570 --> 05:12:17.580 align:start position:0%
lost my job at one point four kids at
 
05:12:17.580 --> 05:12:18.350 align:start position:0%
lost my job at one point four kids at
home

05:12:18.350 --> 05:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
home
 
05:12:20.628 --> 05:12:20.638 align:start position:0%
no work
 
05:12:22.850 --> 05:12:22.860 align:start position:0%
I understand firsthand that you need
 
05:12:24.650 --> 05:12:24.660 align:start position:0%
medical insurance you need food you need
 
05:12:26.090 --> 05:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
to make mortgage payments I've seen that
 
05:12:28.730 --> 05:12:28.740 align:start position:0%
I've lived that heck one year we our
 
05:12:30.350 --> 05:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
family lived below the federal poverty
 
05:12:30.360 --> 05:12:31.610 align:start position:0%
family lived below the federal poverty
limit

05:12:31.610 --> 05:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
limit
 
05:12:33.948 --> 05:12:33.958 align:start position:0%
I understand what families have to go
 
05:12:33.958 --> 05:12:35.628 align:start position:0%
I understand what families have to go
through

05:12:35.628 --> 05:12:35.638 align:start position:0%
through
 
05:12:37.910 --> 05:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
but with that said the goal was not to
 
05:12:40.730 --> 05:12:40.740 align:start position:0%
live there that wasn't the destination
 
05:12:42.948 --> 05:12:42.958 align:start position:0%
the destination was to get out of that
 
05:12:45.170 --> 05:12:45.180 align:start position:0%
situation and to get ahead
 
05:12:48.110 --> 05:12:48.120 align:start position:0%
what we want is we want to make sure
 
05:12:49.910 --> 05:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
that the program is established and set
 
05:12:52.730 --> 05:12:52.740 align:start position:0%
up such that those who are trying to
 
05:12:55.250 --> 05:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
live off of this and take advantage of
 
05:12:57.948 --> 05:12:57.958 align:start position:0%

05:23:53.170 --> 05:23:53.180 align:start position:0%
unpaid medical bills and that's why
 
05:23:58.750 --> 05:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
both parties support it and for example
 
05:24:03.530 --> 05:24:03.540 align:start position:0%
uh we put a amendment that if individual
 
05:24:05.270 --> 05:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
made all reasonable
 
05:24:07.970 --> 05:24:07.980 align:start position:0%
steps to schedule an appointment but was
 
05:24:11.750 --> 05:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
not able it excuses it from this
 
05:24:15.410 --> 05:24:15.420 align:start position:0%
amendment and I ask you to put a green
 
05:24:19.070 --> 05:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
button to support this amendment is the
 
05:24:20.868 --> 05:24:20.878 align:start position:0%
member yield the questions yeah yes
 
05:24:23.810 --> 05:24:23.820 align:start position:0%
memory yields
 
05:24:25.610 --> 05:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr speaker thank you thank you
 
05:24:27.170 --> 05:24:27.180 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question uh
 
05:24:28.250 --> 05:24:28.260 align:start position:0%
why is it hard to get an appointment
 
05:24:30.170 --> 05:24:30.180 align:start position:0%
does the federal pandemic response have
 
05:24:34.990 --> 05:24:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:38.708 --> 05:24:38.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
05:24:43.788 --> 05:24:43.798 align:start position:0%
yes last two years it's a crisis in
 
05:24:47.448 --> 05:24:47.458 align:start position:0%
healthcare with a Workforce and uh
 
05:24:50.270 --> 05:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
we are getting uh plenty of federal
 
05:24:53.750 --> 05:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
funds but those federal funds come with
 
05:24:57.050 --> 05:24:57.060 align:start position:0%
mandates that destroy our health care
 
05:25:01.190 --> 05:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
Force those vaccine mandates first some
 
05:25:04.368 --> 05:25:04.378 align:start position:0%
health care workers to live because they
 
05:25:07.430 --> 05:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
don't want to inject themselves with
 
05:25:10.850 --> 05:25:10.860 align:start position:0%
this ineffective and unsafe medication
 
05:25:14.270 --> 05:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
and some medical healthcare workers were
 
05:25:18.730 --> 05:25:18.740 align:start position:0%
actually injured by this medications
 
05:25:23.830 --> 05:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
some people contracted covet but Federal
 
05:25:27.368 --> 05:25:27.378 align:start position:0%
requirements to treat covet were also
 
05:25:30.550 --> 05:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
extremely harmful to those medical
 
05:25:33.470 --> 05:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
professionals who got infected was
 
05:25:36.050 --> 05:25:36.060 align:start position:0%
covered from their patients for example
 
05:25:38.690 --> 05:25:38.700 align:start position:0%
you all know that first recommendation
 
05:25:42.890 --> 05:25:42.900 align:start position:0%
was to put on oxygen intubation as early
 
05:25:46.730 --> 05:25:46.740 align:start position:0%
as possible now we know that yes if we
 
05:25:49.670 --> 05:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
need oxygen to breathe but too much
 
05:25:53.990 --> 05:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
oxygen too early in this illness causes
 
05:25:56.208 --> 05:25:56.218 align:start position:0%
more harm than good
 
05:25:59.208 --> 05:25:59.218 align:start position:0%
the same as the representative I think
 
05:26:01.070 --> 05:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
has answered the question
 
05:26:05.150 --> 05:26:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:12.650 --> 05:26:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:14.090 --> 05:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:26:16.010 --> 05:26:16.020 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker honorable members of the
 
05:26:19.490 --> 05:26:19.500 align:start position:0%
house I rise in support of 1841.
 
05:26:21.110 --> 05:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
this amendment requires a minimum
 
05:26:22.610 --> 05:26:22.620 align:start position:0%
utilization of benefits to remain
 
05:26:23.990 --> 05:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
eligible for the granted Advantage
 
05:26:25.670 --> 05:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
Health Care Program
 
05:26:27.410 --> 05:26:27.420 align:start position:0%
it defies the minimum utilization
 
05:26:29.208 --> 05:26:29.218 align:start position:0%
benefits as an annual physical
 
05:26:31.368 --> 05:26:31.378 align:start position:0%
requirement we will licensed primary
 
05:26:33.948 --> 05:26:33.958 align:start position:0%
care physician
 
05:26:35.628 --> 05:26:35.638 align:start position:0%
the amendment allows for flexibility
 
05:26:37.070 --> 05:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
including cases
 
05:26:38.990 --> 05:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
that the existing plan does not require
 
05:26:39.000 --> 05:26:40.430 align:start position:0%
that the existing plan does not require
one

05:26:40.430 --> 05:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:26:42.050 --> 05:26:42.060 align:start position:0%
Managed Care organizations are
 
05:26:44.330 --> 05:26:44.340 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for enrolled members whether
 
05:26:46.730 --> 05:26:46.740 align:start position:0%
they utilize the program or not
 
05:26:48.230 --> 05:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
the primary goal of Managed Care
 
05:26:49.910 --> 05:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
organizations is to encourage people to
 
05:26:51.708 --> 05:26:51.718 align:start position:0%
schedule and attend their primary
 
05:26:51.718 --> 05:26:53.390 align:start position:0%
schedule and attend their primary
physical

05:26:53.390 --> 05:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
physical
 
05:26:55.550 --> 05:26:55.560 align:start position:0%
the primary care visit is needed to
 
05:26:57.110 --> 05:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
reduce the overall cost of the health
 
05:27:01.070 --> 05:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
care and reduce the uncompensated care
 
05:27:02.868 --> 05:27:02.878 align:start position:0%
this is why this amendment is necessary
 
05:27:05.270 --> 05:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
the amendment ensures that we have
 
05:27:07.550 --> 05:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
this leverage to ensure Primary Care
 
05:27:09.410 --> 05:27:09.420 align:start position:0%
visits this amendment adds
 
05:27:09.420 --> 05:27:10.970 align:start position:0%
visits this amendment adds
responsibility

05:27:10.970 --> 05:27:10.980 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
05:27:14.150 --> 05:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
and adds protection for the taxpayer
 
05:27:16.910 --> 05:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
in conclusion it is important that the
 
05:27:19.430 --> 05:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
resources are not Unlimited even when
 
05:27:21.470 --> 05:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
subsidized by federal funds
 
05:27:23.750 --> 05:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
when we waste Federal resources we take
 
05:27:26.208 --> 05:27:26.218 align:start position:0%
it away from the people who need it
 
05:27:28.250 --> 05:27:28.260 align:start position:0%
just imagine how we could spend on
 
05:27:31.730 --> 05:27:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:33.708 --> 05:27:33.718 align:start position:0%
this amendment encourages Primary Care
 
05:27:35.690 --> 05:27:35.700 align:start position:0%
visits reduces catastrophic Health
 
05:27:37.850 --> 05:27:37.860 align:start position:0%
outcomes overall cost of Health Care and
 
05:27:40.190 --> 05:27:40.200 align:start position:0%
uncompensated costs for these reasons
 
05:27:42.110 --> 05:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
please press the green button and adopt
 
05:27:45.650 --> 05:27:45.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:47.750 --> 05:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney has asked for a
 
05:27:51.470 --> 05:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:53.510 --> 05:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
it is sufficiently seconded this will be
 
05:28:47.270 --> 05:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:57.410 --> 05:28:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:59.690 --> 05:28:59.700 align:start position:0%
members take your seats and also be in
 
05:28:59.700 --> 05:29:09.670 align:start position:0%
members take your seats and also be in
order

05:29:09.670 --> 05:29:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:12.830 --> 05:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
for what reason did member rise
 
05:29:20.628 --> 05:29:20.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:22.670 --> 05:29:22.680 align:start position:0%
we're in we're in we're in the voting
 
05:29:25.010 --> 05:29:25.020 align:start position:0%
mode right now
 
05:29:37.010 --> 05:29:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:37.020 --> 05:29:38.330 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:29:38.330 --> 05:29:38.340 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:29:40.128 --> 05:29:40.138 align:start position:0%
State your question
 
05:29:42.590 --> 05:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
to the chair thank you for taking it
 
05:29:45.350 --> 05:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
is it diliatory for a member to get up
 
05:29:46.970 --> 05:29:46.980 align:start position:0%
and say the same thing over and over
 
05:29:49.610 --> 05:29:49.620 align:start position:0%
again we've already heard it
 
05:29:56.990 --> 05:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:59.510 --> 05:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
it's up to the member
 
05:30:02.510 --> 05:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
for what they give for a pi if I feel
 
05:30:03.890 --> 05:30:03.900 align:start position:0%
it's out of
 
05:30:06.890 --> 05:30:06.900 align:start position:0%
bounds I will call them on it but right
 
05:30:10.430 --> 05:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
now they haven't said anything
 
05:30:14.628 --> 05:30:14.638 align:start position:0%
that I would write out of bounds so I
 
05:30:16.710 --> 05:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
think that's your answer
 
05:30:16.720 --> 05:30:20.510 align:start position:0%
think that's your answer
[Music]

05:30:20.510 --> 05:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:22.970 --> 05:30:22.980 align:start position:0%
right now in front of us is floor
 
05:30:26.990 --> 05:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:29.448 --> 05:30:29.458 align:start position:0%
this is a roll call vote chair recognize
 
05:30:31.190 --> 05:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
representative Weber for a parliamentary
 
05:30:31.200 --> 05:30:37.250 align:start position:0%
representative Weber for a parliamentary
inquiry

05:30:37.250 --> 05:30:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:38.780 --> 05:30:38.790 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:30:38.790 --> 05:30:40.128 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
[Music]

05:30:40.128 --> 05:30:40.138 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:30:42.590 --> 05:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that Senate Bill
 
05:30:46.010 --> 05:30:46.020 align:start position:0%
263 unamended promotes Access to Health
 
05:30:49.670 --> 05:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
Care a healthy Workforce and reduces
 
05:30:51.948 --> 05:30:51.958 align:start position:0%
uncompensated carrier costs and cost
 
05:30:51.958 --> 05:30:53.510 align:start position:0%
uncompensated carrier costs and cost
shifting

05:30:53.510 --> 05:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
shifting
 
05:30:57.110 --> 05:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
if I also know that we are proceeding
 
05:30:59.448 --> 05:30:59.458 align:start position:0%
only on parliamentary inquiries and not
 
05:31:02.448 --> 05:31:02.458 align:start position:0%
with debate so couldn't possibly be seen
 
05:31:04.070 --> 05:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
to be dilatory
 
05:31:06.830 --> 05:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
but if I know
 
05:31:11.390 --> 05:31:11.400 align:start position:0%
that to require a specific medical
 
05:31:14.150 --> 05:31:14.160 align:start position:0%
procedure of a person without their
 
05:31:17.810 --> 05:31:17.820 align:start position:0%
consent is unconstitutional
 
05:31:21.890 --> 05:31:21.900 align:start position:0%
and finally if I know that for anybody
 
05:31:24.770 --> 05:31:24.780 align:start position:0%
who has had to reschedule an appointment
 
05:31:28.310 --> 05:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
for anything as for example when the
 
05:31:30.110 --> 05:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
house meets when your appointment was
 
05:31:31.910 --> 05:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
set for
 
05:31:35.410 --> 05:31:35.420 align:start position:0%
and I know how long it takes to
 
05:31:37.730 --> 05:31:37.740 align:start position:0%
reschedule appointments
 
05:31:40.788 --> 05:31:40.798 align:start position:0%
would I now see the lack of wisdom of
 
05:31:46.430 --> 05:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:48.288 --> 05:31:48.298 align:start position:0%
jerich and I was representative Carol
 
05:31:54.948 --> 05:31:54.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:56.990 --> 05:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:31:59.390 --> 05:31:59.400 align:start position:0%
if I know I promise to say this only one
 
05:31:59.400 --> 05:32:01.490 align:start position:0%
if I know I promise to say this only one
time

05:32:01.490 --> 05:32:01.500 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:32:03.350 --> 05:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
and if I know that it's completely
 
05:32:06.288 --> 05:32:06.298 align:start position:0%
reasonable to require accountability
 
05:32:09.530 --> 05:32:09.540 align:start position:0%
from individuals receiving benefits paid
 
05:32:13.128 --> 05:32:13.138 align:start position:0%
for by the hard-working taxpayer
 
05:32:14.868 --> 05:32:14.878 align:start position:0%
and if I know that when an individual
 
05:32:17.090 --> 05:32:17.100 align:start position:0%
has not used their benefits
 
05:32:20.510 --> 05:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
it's completely reasonable
 
05:32:23.510 --> 05:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
to assume the benefit may not be needed
 
05:32:25.368 --> 05:32:25.378 align:start position:0%
by that person
 
05:32:27.230 --> 05:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
and if I know this amendment addresses
 
05:32:27.240 --> 05:32:28.550 align:start position:0%
and if I know this amendment addresses
concerns

05:32:28.550 --> 05:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
05:32:30.830 --> 05:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
that individuals might have difficulty
 
05:32:32.690 --> 05:32:32.700 align:start position:0%
scheduling an appointment with their
 
05:32:35.270 --> 05:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
primary care physician annually
 
05:32:38.448 --> 05:32:38.458 align:start position:0%
and to address the previous Pi if I know
 
05:32:40.910 --> 05:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
that this amendment also addresses
 
05:32:44.208 --> 05:32:44.218 align:start position:0%
concerns that there are individuals who
 
05:32:46.430 --> 05:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
may not need an appointment
 
05:32:49.250 --> 05:32:49.260 align:start position:0%
with their PCP annually
 
05:32:51.830 --> 05:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
and finally Mr Speaker

promoting the health of all grain of

263 unamended creates a potential
 
05:37:39.110 --> 05:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
long-term financial obligation for the

the circumstances around revenues and Mr

the budget Bill were a compromise which
 
05:37:51.410 --> 05:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
we should honor and that many of us here
 
05:37:53.750 --> 05:37:53.760 align:start position:0%

floor Amendment 1898.
which

05:40:54.708 --> 05:40:54.718 align:start position:0%
which
 
05:40:58.190 --> 05:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
adds a few lines
 
05:41:00.288 --> 05:41:00.298 align:start position:0%
recognizing that
 
05:41:03.050 --> 05:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
addiction is an Insidious disease and I
 
05:41:04.910 --> 05:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
think that probably not a single member
 
05:41:08.570 --> 05:41:08.580 align:start position:0%
in this chamber has escaped the last 10
 
05:41:10.730 --> 05:41:10.740 align:start position:0%
years without knowing somebody or having
 
05:41:12.470 --> 05:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
someone in their family who's had to
 
05:41:14.330 --> 05:41:14.340 align:start position:0%
struggle with addiction
 
05:41:18.110 --> 05:41:18.120 align:start position:0%
under our current state of things I
 
05:41:19.368 --> 05:41:19.378 align:start position:0%
think that it's only fair that we
 
05:41:20.750 --> 05:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
address that
 
05:41:22.730 --> 05:41:22.740 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
05:41:25.930 --> 05:41:25.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:27.890 --> 05:41:27.900 align:start position:0%
acknowledges the fact that addiction
 
05:41:27.900 --> 05:41:29.390 align:start position:0%
acknowledges the fact that addiction
recovery

05:41:29.390 --> 05:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
recovery
 
05:41:39.650 --> 05:41:39.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:42.650 --> 05:41:42.660 align:start position:0%
it's not quiet enough
 
05:41:45.050 --> 05:41:45.060 align:start position:0%
addiction recovery is not just freeing
 
05:41:47.150 --> 05:41:47.160 align:start position:0%
oneself from the addiction but it's also
 
05:41:49.208 --> 05:41:49.218 align:start position:0%
building your self-esteem and job
 
05:41:51.830 --> 05:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
qualifications back up again so that you
 
05:41:54.650 --> 05:41:54.660 align:start position:0%
can feel valued and stay free of
 
05:41:54.660 --> 05:41:56.090 align:start position:0%
can feel valued and stay free of
addiction

05:41:56.090 --> 05:41:56.100 align:start position:0%
addiction
 
05:41:58.490 --> 05:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
and so this amendment will add lines
 
05:42:00.470 --> 05:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
that say that the substance use disorder
 
05:42:02.930 --> 05:42:02.940 align:start position:0%
treatment or recovery activities and or
 
05:42:04.670 --> 05:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
mental health treatment under the
 
05:42:07.010 --> 05:42:07.020 align:start position:0%
subparagraph shall be credited against
 
05:42:09.410 --> 05:42:09.420 align:start position:0%
the requirement for work
 
05:42:11.150 --> 05:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
for the first three months on an hour
 
05:42:13.190 --> 05:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
for hour basis but on the subsequent
 
05:42:15.110 --> 05:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
months every two hours she'll be
 
05:42:16.490 --> 05:42:16.500 align:start position:0%
credited as one hour of community
 
05:42:19.610 --> 05:42:19.620 align:start position:0%
engagement and this is an incentive to
 
05:42:21.470 --> 05:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
after those first three months of
 
05:42:24.288 --> 05:42:24.298 align:start position:0%
intensive drug rehabilitation or mental
 
05:42:26.208 --> 05:42:26.218 align:start position:0%
health rehabilitation
 
05:42:29.570 --> 05:42:29.580 align:start position:0%
to have the person start working on
 
05:42:31.610 --> 05:42:31.620 align:start position:0%
their career
 
05:42:34.788 --> 05:42:34.798 align:start position:0%
their work opportunities and to start
 
05:42:37.310 --> 05:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
building back that self-esteem that is
 
05:42:39.708 --> 05:42:39.718 align:start position:0%
going to be so critical to being able to
 
05:42:43.190 --> 05:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
maintain a a free of addiction lifestyle
 
05:42:45.530 --> 05:42:45.540 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
05:42:48.530 --> 05:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
so I would urge you all to support this
 
05:42:51.110 --> 05:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
amendment and push green thank you
 
05:42:53.750 --> 05:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
remember yield the questions
 
05:42:55.430 --> 05:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
I'll take one
 
05:42:59.330 --> 05:42:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:01.190 --> 05:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:43:03.050 --> 05:43:03.060 align:start position:0%
several weeks ago in this chamber we
 
05:43:05.570 --> 05:43:05.580 align:start position:0%
heard someone testify at the end on a
 
05:43:07.730 --> 05:43:07.740 align:start position:0%
matter of personal privilege
 
05:43:10.550 --> 05:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
how getting help from a program was
 
05:43:12.650 --> 05:43:12.660 align:start position:0%
instrumental in their life
 
05:43:14.330 --> 05:43:14.340 align:start position:0%
is the amendment that you have before
 
05:43:15.590 --> 05:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
something that's going to help more
 
05:43:20.270 --> 05:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:22.190 --> 05:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question because
 
05:43:25.970 --> 05:43:25.980 align:start position:0%
yes it does it has been proven by facts
 
05:43:28.850 --> 05:43:28.860 align:start position:0%
that somebody who goes successfully
 
05:43:30.650 --> 05:43:30.660 align:start position:0%
through a treatment program but then
 
05:43:35.410 --> 05:43:35.420 align:start position:0%
faces no work prospects and or a
 
05:43:38.030 --> 05:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
devalued self-worth when they come out
 
05:43:39.470 --> 05:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
of the program
 
05:43:42.650 --> 05:43:42.660 align:start position:0%
then tends to fall back into those same
 
05:43:44.990 --> 05:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
patterns of addiction whereas if they
 
05:43:46.910 --> 05:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
have built back that self-esteem and
 
05:43:50.510 --> 05:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
they have worked towards work prospects
 
05:43:55.548 --> 05:43:55.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:58.490 --> 05:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
before I call Representative love up
 
05:44:01.368 --> 05:44:01.378 align:start position:0%
I want to let everybody know that you're
 
05:44:04.070 --> 05:44:04.080 align:start position:0%

05:44:06.410 --> 05:44:06.420 align:start position:0%
we will get you out when we're done with
 
05:44:08.448 --> 05:44:08.458 align:start position:0%
session whether that be an hour from now
 
05:44:10.850 --> 05:44:10.860 align:start position:0%
or six hours from now I don't know
 
05:44:12.830 --> 05:44:12.840 align:start position:0%
but we will get you out
 
05:44:16.310 --> 05:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
and is also we have a lot of snacks in
 
05:44:18.350 --> 05:44:18.360 align:start position:0%

05:47:21.170 --> 05:47:21.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker if I know that
 
05:47:23.510 --> 05:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
addiction and mental health problems are
 
05:47:26.208 --> 05:47:26.218 align:start position:0%
an Insidious problem within our culture
 
05:47:28.128 --> 05:47:28.138 align:start position:0%
right now and that
 
05:47:30.530 --> 05:47:30.540 align:start position:0%
recovery is not successful unless the
 
05:47:33.410 --> 05:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
person has built back their self-esteem
 
05:47:36.708 --> 05:47:36.718 align:start position:0%
if I know that tapering off after three
 
05:47:39.948 --> 05:47:39.958 align:start position:0%
months to allow the work requirement to
 
05:47:43.430 --> 05:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
only be partially implemented so that
 
05:47:45.288 --> 05:47:45.298 align:start position:0%
they can start working on self-esteem
 
05:47:50.030 --> 05:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
building and job prospects is is a way
 
05:47:52.610 --> 05:47:52.620 align:start position:0%
towards success would I then push the
 
05:47:56.570 --> 05:47:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:58.128 --> 05:47:58.138 align:start position:0%
do you recognize representative Weber
 
05:48:01.010 --> 05:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
for a parliamentary inquiry
 
05:48:03.230 --> 05:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
05:48:07.128 --> 05:48:07.138 align:start position:0%
if I firmly support both work
 
05:48:09.708 --> 05:48:09.718 align:start position:0%
and substance abuse treatment
 
05:48:11.628 --> 05:48:11.638 align:start position:0%
and agree with much that's been said
 
05:48:13.610 --> 05:48:13.620 align:start position:0%
about the value of both treatment and
 
05:48:13.620 --> 05:48:14.810 align:start position:0%
about the value of both treatment and
work

05:48:14.810 --> 05:48:14.820 align:start position:0%
work
 
05:48:18.530 --> 05:48:18.540 align:start position:0%
but if I know and bemused because the
 
05:48:20.628 --> 05:48:20.638 align:start position:0%
work requirement
 
05:48:23.330 --> 05:48:23.340 align:start position:0%
contained in the statute has been held
 
05:48:27.430 --> 05:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:29.448 --> 05:48:29.458 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional or at least
 
05:48:31.610 --> 05:48:31.620 align:start position:0%
inappropriate I that's I used the wrong
 
05:48:34.730 --> 05:48:34.740 align:start position:0%
word but I'm getting tired
 
05:48:40.030 --> 05:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:46.368 --> 05:48:46.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:48.410 --> 05:48:48.420 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:48:50.810 --> 05:48:50.820 align:start position:0%
there is no work requirement to credit
 
05:48:50.820 --> 05:48:52.010 align:start position:0%
there is no work requirement to credit
against

05:48:52.010 --> 05:48:52.020 align:start position:0%
against
 
05:48:53.868 --> 05:48:53.878 align:start position:0%
and I hope people will remember that
 
05:48:56.030 --> 05:48:56.040 align:start position:0%
with the further amendments on the work
 
05:48:57.770 --> 05:48:57.780 align:start position:0%

for those who think that
 
05:52:58.850 --> 05:52:58.860 align:start position:0%
it's not fair that those floor
 
05:53:01.070 --> 05:53:01.080 align:start position:0%
amendments brought up I sat in this
 
05:53:03.650 --> 05:53:03.660 align:start position:0%
committee I had these amendments drafted
 
05:53:06.410 --> 05:53:06.420 align:start position:0%
prior to the executive session we talked
 
05:53:08.390 --> 05:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
about some of these but the day that I
 
05:53:09.708 --> 05:53:09.718 align:start position:0%
was there as a sub
 
05:53:11.868 --> 05:53:11.878 align:start position:0%
we were not able to vote on these
 
05:53:13.670 --> 05:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
these were submitted to the clerk prior
 
05:53:15.170 --> 05:53:15.180 align:start position:0%
to the calendar and I did that for a
 
05:53:16.910 --> 05:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
reason I wanted everybody who was here
 
05:53:18.590 --> 05:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
as a member to have a chance to read the
 
05:53:21.170 --> 05:53:21.180 align:start position:0%
Amendments before we got to the floor
 
05:53:23.090 --> 05:53:23.100 align:start position:0%
I think that's valuable that's playing
 
05:53:23.100 --> 05:53:25.430 align:start position:0%
I think that's valuable that's playing
Fair

05:53:25.430 --> 05:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
Fair
 
05:53:28.548 --> 05:53:28.558 align:start position:0%
while I may not agree with the views of
 
05:53:30.708 --> 05:53:30.718 align:start position:0%
my colleagues on the other side I at
 
05:53:32.510 --> 05:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
least wanted to have a discussion about
 
05:53:34.788 --> 05:53:34.798 align:start position:0%
some of the fundamental flaws that are
 
05:53:37.970 --> 05:53:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:44.690 --> 05:53:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:47.150 --> 05:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
we would be wise
 
05:53:50.750 --> 05:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
to not set up not establish a program
 
05:53:54.590 --> 05:53:54.600 align:start position:0%
that goes on for infant for whatever
 
05:53:54.600 --> 05:53:56.270 align:start position:0%
that goes on for infant for whatever
infini

05:53:56.270 --> 05:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
infini
 
05:53:58.190 --> 05:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have the appropriate
 
05:53:58.200 --> 05:54:00.470 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have the appropriate
safeguards

05:54:00.470 --> 05:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
safeguards
 
05:54:03.350 --> 05:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
this is one of those things
 
05:54:06.350 --> 05:54:06.360 align:start position:0%
that's a safeguard that's necessary
 
05:54:07.788 --> 05:54:07.798 align:start position:0%
I don't know if any of you have had to
 
05:54:10.250 --> 05:54:10.260 align:start position:0%
go to the doctor recently
 
05:54:11.930 --> 05:54:11.940 align:start position:0%
going to the doctor right now is hard
 
05:54:15.048 --> 05:54:15.058 align:start position:0%
going to the doctor is months worth of
 
05:54:15.058 --> 05:54:17.150 align:start position:0%
going to the doctor is months worth of
waiting

05:54:17.150 --> 05:54:17.160 align:start position:0%
waiting
 
05:54:20.030 --> 05:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
that is fundamentally created by several
 
05:54:20.040 --> 05:54:22.310 align:start position:0%
that is fundamentally created by several
issues

05:54:22.310 --> 05:54:22.320 align:start position:0%
issues
 
05:54:24.430 --> 05:54:24.440 align:start position:0%
the first of which is we have it in
 
05:54:27.110 --> 05:54:27.120 align:start position:0%
inadequate staff in the state in the
 
05:54:28.310 --> 05:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
medical field
 
05:54:31.190 --> 05:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we can't fix that
 
05:54:34.250 --> 05:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
we also happen to have inadequate access
 
05:54:36.470 --> 05:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
to hospitals meaning there's not enough
 
05:54:38.270 --> 05:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
hospital rooms
 
05:54:40.368 --> 05:54:40.378 align:start position:0%
this program this amendment can do
 
05:54:41.750 --> 05:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
something about it
 
05:54:43.910 --> 05:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
and lastly
 
05:54:46.670 --> 05:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
we are crushing our private Health Care
 
05:54:46.680 --> 05:54:48.650 align:start position:0%
we are crushing our private Health Care
industry

05:54:48.650 --> 05:54:48.660 align:start position:0%
industry
 
05:54:50.628 --> 05:54:50.638 align:start position:0%
and I'll say that again we are crushing
 
05:54:52.850 --> 05:54:52.860 align:start position:0%
the Private health care industry the
 
05:54:55.128 --> 05:54:55.138 align:start position:0%
small mom and pop shops
 
05:54:58.250 --> 05:54:58.260 align:start position:0%
that do the services that help people
 
05:55:01.070 --> 05:55:01.080 align:start position:0%
get the medications they need to solve
 
05:55:02.390 --> 05:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
the problems
 
05:55:04.788 --> 05:55:04.798 align:start position:0%
are getting pushed out of business
 
05:55:08.090 --> 05:55:08.100 align:start position:0%
this amendment solves that
 
05:55:10.070 --> 05:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
I would ask that you would support this
 
05:55:12.170 --> 05:55:12.180 align:start position:0%
amendment and I'm going to ask for a
 
05:55:13.730 --> 05:55:13.740 align:start position:0%
roll call vote because it's it's
 
05:55:13.740 --> 05:55:14.868 align:start position:0%
roll call vote because it's it's
important

05:55:14.868 --> 05:55:14.878 align:start position:0%
important
 
05:55:17.570 --> 05:55:17.580 align:start position:0%
that we Preserve
 
05:55:20.150 --> 05:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
access to Private health care it's
 
05:55:22.788 --> 05:55:22.798 align:start position:0%
important that we start
 
05:55:25.010 --> 05:55:25.020 align:start position:0%
or sorry that we end the protectionism
 
05:55:27.110 --> 05:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
that we do for the hospitals around the
 
05:55:29.090 --> 05:55:29.100 align:start position:0%
state that gives them this 15-mile
 
05:55:32.270 --> 05:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
buffer that no other hospitals can be
 
05:55:32.280 --> 05:55:33.288 align:start position:0%
buffer that no other hospitals can be
built

05:55:33.288 --> 05:55:33.298 align:start position:0%
built
 
05:55:35.570 --> 05:55:35.580 align:start position:0%
and we start allowing a better free
 
05:55:38.208 --> 05:55:38.218 align:start position:0%
market Health Care system I asked for a
 
05:55:39.770 --> 05:55:39.780 align:start position:0%
roll call vote they ask that you support
 
05:55:44.868 --> 05:55:44.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:48.530 --> 05:55:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:48.540 --> 05:55:50.330 align:start position:0%
 
sure

05:55:50.330 --> 05:55:50.340 align:start position:0%
sure
 
05:55:52.070 --> 05:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
remember yields
 
05:55:54.590 --> 05:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I'm
 
05:55:55.970 --> 05:55:55.980 align:start position:0%
aware that we have a shortage of
 
05:55:58.368 --> 05:55:58.378 align:start position:0%
hospital beds here in New Hampshire and
 
05:55:59.930 --> 05:55:59.940 align:start position:0%
I believe these critical access
 
05:56:03.110 --> 05:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
hospitals only have 25 beds is
 
05:56:04.910 --> 05:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
preserving them helping us to meet the
 
05:56:06.650 --> 05:56:06.660 align:start position:0%
health care needs of granite Staters or
 
05:56:08.150 --> 05:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
is this artificially eliminating the
 
05:56:14.030 --> 05:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:17.150 --> 05:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
by enabling this what's known as the
 
05:56:18.650 --> 05:56:18.660 align:start position:0%
critical Access Health Care Hospital
 
05:56:20.868 --> 05:56:20.878 align:start position:0%
provision right we've artificially
 
05:56:24.070 --> 05:56:24.080 align:start position:0%
created locations that can't have
 
05:56:26.208 --> 05:56:26.218 align:start position:0%
additional beds
 
05:56:28.430 --> 05:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
that shuts down the ability for people
 
05:56:30.830 --> 05:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
to get the health care they need
 
05:56:33.590 --> 05:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
as I said we would be wise to protect
 
05:56:35.868 --> 05:56:35.878 align:start position:0%
the two things that are crucial to
 
05:56:38.150 --> 05:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
making sure Granite Staters have the
 
05:56:40.010 --> 05:56:40.020 align:start position:0%
health care access they need one is
 
05:56:42.530 --> 05:56:42.540 align:start position:0%
expanding Hospital access and two is
 
05:56:44.390 --> 05:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
making sure we don't crush our private
 
05:56:49.128 --> 05:56:49.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:58.850 --> 05:56:58.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:02.930 --> 05:57:02.940 align:start position:0%
thank you speaker members of the House
 
05:57:04.910 --> 05:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
so I was talking to Jr about this
 
05:57:08.330 --> 05:57:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:11.810 --> 05:57:11.820 align:start position:0%
representative Howell sorry
 
05:57:13.788 --> 05:57:13.798 align:start position:0%
and I related my own personal story of
 
05:57:15.470 --> 05:57:15.480 align:start position:0%
when I cut my hand down to the bone
 
05:57:18.410 --> 05:57:18.420 align:start position:0%
doing some construction work
 
05:57:20.628 --> 05:57:20.638 align:start position:0%
and how ended up costing eighteen
 
05:57:23.810 --> 05:57:23.820 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars for nine stitches
 
05:57:25.128 --> 05:57:25.138 align:start position:0%
they gave me a break because I don't
 
05:57:26.868 --> 05:57:26.878 align:start position:0%
have insurance so it was twelve hundred
 
05:57:29.690 --> 05:57:29.700 align:start position:0%
dollars but the the fact that there's no
 
05:57:31.610 --> 05:57:31.620 align:start position:0%
competition in the marketplace for
 
05:57:34.310 --> 05:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
medical care is just so detrimental and
 
05:57:36.708 --> 05:57:36.718 align:start position:0%
we have this idea that we have to
 
05:57:38.868 --> 05:57:38.878 align:start position:0%
we have to farm out our decision making
 
05:57:40.610 --> 05:57:40.620 align:start position:0%
to the federal government on this this
 
05:57:42.590 --> 05:57:42.600 align:start position:0%
topic is so detrimental to what we're
 
05:57:44.750 --> 05:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
doing we need to focus on keeping it
 
05:57:47.570 --> 05:57:47.580 align:start position:0%
here within the state and not
 
05:57:49.490 --> 05:57:49.500 align:start position:0%
relying on the federal government to
 
05:57:51.230 --> 05:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
take care of our needs nothing good
 
05:57:53.930 --> 05:57:53.940 align:start position:0%
comes out of the federal government
 
05:57:56.208 --> 05:57:56.218 align:start position:0%
nothing really let's be honest here we
 
05:57:58.010 --> 05:57:58.020 align:start position:0%
have no control over them at least like
 
05:57:58.020 --> 05:57:58.910 align:start position:0%
have no control over them at least like
today

05:57:58.910 --> 05:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
today
 
05:58:01.310 --> 05:58:01.320 align:start position:0%
when we have protests also be in order
 
05:58:02.750 --> 05:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
people can at least come here
 
05:58:02.760 --> 05:58:05.030 align:start position:0%
people can at least come here
representative

05:58:05.030 --> 05:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:58:06.530 --> 05:58:06.540 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
05:58:08.930 --> 05:58:08.940 align:start position:0%
make accusations of that nature on this
 
05:58:08.940 --> 05:58:10.128 align:start position:0%
make accusations of that nature on this
floor

05:58:10.128 --> 05:58:10.138 align:start position:0%
floor
 
05:58:12.548 --> 05:58:12.558 align:start position:0%
of what nature speaker
 
05:58:15.048 --> 05:58:15.058 align:start position:0%
the accusations you just made that
 
05:58:16.310 --> 05:58:16.320 align:start position:0%
nothing good comes out of the federal
 
05:58:18.110 --> 05:58:18.120 align:start position:0%
government that might be your personal
 
05:58:20.150 --> 05:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
opinion but that's not an accusation I
 
05:58:23.150 --> 05:58:23.160 align:start position:0%
I'm going to allow on the floor
 
05:58:25.070 --> 05:58:25.080 align:start position:0%
very few good things come out of the
 
05:58:26.330 --> 05:58:26.340 align:start position:0%
federal government and I'm concerned
 
05:58:28.368 --> 05:58:28.378 align:start position:0%
about that and I would like to have more
 
05:58:29.810 --> 05:58:29.820 align:start position:0%
control at the local level so point
 
05:58:29.820 --> 05:58:30.770 align:start position:0%
control at the local level so point
being

05:58:30.770 --> 05:58:30.780 align:start position:0%
being
 
05:58:32.390 --> 05:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
the more competition we have in the
 
05:58:34.010 --> 05:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
medical field the better off we are and
 
05:58:35.448 --> 05:58:35.458 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't cost over a hundred dollars
 
05:58:37.250 --> 05:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
per Stitch
 
05:58:39.830 --> 05:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
it's just common sense
 
05:58:41.750 --> 05:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
so yes anyway I'm in support of this
 
05:58:43.970 --> 05:58:43.980 align:start position:0%
amendment and I hope that we can start
 
05:58:45.470 --> 05:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
really focusing on what needs to be done
 
05:58:46.970 --> 05:58:46.980 align:start position:0%
and that's keeping decision making local
 
05:58:49.190 --> 05:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
and not relying on some federal
 
05:58:50.690 --> 05:58:50.700 align:start position:0%
bureaucrats to solve our problems which
 
05:58:53.810 --> 05:58:53.820 align:start position:0%
they will never do never have done

Mr Speaker
 
06:02:28.610 --> 06:02:28.620 align:start position:0%
if I know that expanding Health Care

critical access hospitals have over free
 
06:02:41.990 --> 06:02:42.000 align:start position:0%

expansion of Health Care opportunities

that allowing clients opportunities to

critical care hospitals
 
06:03:43.090 --> 06:03:43.100 align:start position:0%
would I now press the red button because
 
06:03:47.390 --> 06:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
this does not increase access to health

be a roll call vote
 
06:06:41.690 --> 06:06:41.700 align:start position:0%

program
 
06:19:07.430 --> 06:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
if I know that resources are finite and
 
06:19:10.670 --> 06:19:10.680 align:start position:0%
drug screens can help contain cost and
 
06:19:13.548 --> 06:19:13.558 align:start position:0%
if I know that substance misuse disorder
 
06:19:16.670 --> 06:19:16.680 align:start position:0%
leads to underemployment drug screens
 
06:19:18.708 --> 06:19:18.718 align:start position:0%
can put people on the path to recovery

and success
 
06:19:23.510 --> 06:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
also if I know that drug screens are
 
06:19:26.448 --> 06:19:26.458 align:start position:0%
parts of millions of workers employment
 
06:19:29.708 --> 06:19:29.718 align:start position:0%
contracts it is certainly
 
06:19:32.690 --> 06:19:32.700 align:start position:0%
reasonable to expect participants to
 
06:19:35.930 --> 06:19:35.940 align:start position:0%
participate in drug screens and lastly
 
06:19:38.208 --> 06:19:38.218 align:start position:0%
if I know that the people of New
 
06:19:40.250 --> 06:19:40.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire deserve better than National
 
06:19:42.410 --> 06:19:42.420 align:start position:0%

the addiction addiction to treatment
 
06:20:01.070 --> 06:20:01.080 align:start position:0%

Advantage Program
 
06:20:05.750 --> 06:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
and if I know that while people are
 
06:20:08.150 --> 06:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
receiving treatment they often slip and
 
06:20:11.270 --> 06:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
fall and they need to get up and go back
 
06:20:12.970 --> 06:20:12.980 align:start position:0%
to treatment
 
06:20:18.410 --> 06:20:18.420 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
06:23:41.690 --> 06:23:41.700 align:start position:0%
if I know current administrative rules
 
06:23:43.970 --> 06:23:43.980 align:start position:0%
contained in several of the rules
 
06:23:47.170 --> 06:23:47.180 align:start position:0%
describe the opportunity to cure a
 
06:23:50.570 --> 06:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
deficit in the number of hours worked
 
06:23:53.330 --> 06:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
and Community engagement hours
 
06:23:55.490 --> 06:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
and if I also know that if an individual
 
06:23:57.708 --> 06:23:57.718 align:start position:0%
fails to complete the required number of
 
06:23:59.570 --> 06:23:59.580 align:start position:0%
hours in one month they have the ability
 
06:24:02.090 --> 06:24:02.100 align:start position:0%
to make those hours up in the following
 
06:24:02.100 --> 06:24:03.770 align:start position:0%
to make those hours up in the following
month

06:24:03.770 --> 06:24:03.780 align:start position:0%
month
 
06:24:06.590 --> 06:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
and if I also know that a problem exists
 
06:24:08.270 --> 06:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
with that
 
06:24:10.788 --> 06:24:10.798 align:start position:0%
the administrative rules as they are
 
06:24:13.250 --> 06:24:13.260 align:start position:0%
written would promote permit that
 
06:24:15.830 --> 06:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
individual to actually reach a rolling
 
06:24:17.868 --> 06:24:17.878 align:start position:0%
level of deficit
 
06:24:21.110 --> 06:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
of 100 hours while still being eligible
 
06:24:24.350 --> 06:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid expansion
 
06:24:26.208 --> 06:24:26.218 align:start position:0%
and finally Mr Speaker if I know that
 
06:24:28.010 --> 06:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
the change in this amendment would allow
 
06:24:31.070 --> 06:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
the recipient recipient of Medicaid to
 
06:24:34.070 --> 06:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
work in community engagement activities
 
06:24:37.128 --> 06:24:37.138 align:start position:0%
up to 160 hours a month rather than the
 
06:24:39.770 --> 06:24:39.780 align:start position:0%
current 100 hour limitation contained in
 
06:24:43.730 --> 06:24:43.740 align:start position:0%
the rules would I then vote green to
 
06:24:46.610 --> 06:24:46.620 align:start position:0%

06:32:39.490 --> 06:32:39.500 align:start position:0%
the question is on floor Amendment
 
06:32:42.830 --> 06:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
1a32h and this is a roll call vote
 
06:32:44.810 --> 06:32:44.820 align:start position:0%
representative Drago is recognized for
 
06:32:51.048 --> 06:32:51.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:53.090 --> 06:32:53.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
06:32:54.830 --> 06:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
if I know that I had a great speech
 
06:32:57.048 --> 06:32:57.058 align:start position:0%
planned that I am no longer allowed to
 
06:32:57.058 --> 06:32:58.368 align:start position:0%
planned that I am no longer allowed to
share

06:32:58.368 --> 06:32:58.378 align:start position:0%
share
 
06:33:00.230 --> 06:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
and if I know that the rule-making
 
06:33:02.208 --> 06:33:02.218 align:start position:0%
authority belongs with the legislator
 
06:33:04.490 --> 06:33:04.500 align:start position:0%
because we were elected to represent our
 
06:33:07.788 --> 06:33:07.798 align:start position:0%
constituents and our state and if I know
 
06:33:09.708 --> 06:33:09.718 align:start position:0%
that we are a volunteer legislator and
 
06:33:12.830 --> 06:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
many of us still hold full-time jobs
 
06:33:14.930 --> 06:33:14.940 align:start position:0%
and if I know a volunteering or
 
06:33:16.610 --> 06:33:16.620 align:start position:0%
community service can be done around
 
06:33:19.010 --> 06:33:19.020 align:start position:0%
work hours and there shall therefore
 
06:33:21.170 --> 06:33:21.180 align:start position:0%
should not be a qualifying factor for an
 
06:33:24.170 --> 06:33:24.180 align:start position:0%
entitlement program instead of working
 
06:33:26.390 --> 06:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
and finally if I know that our economy
 
06:33:29.150 --> 06:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
depends on a strong Workforce and that
 
06:33:31.910 --> 06:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
this body should be doing all it can to
 
06:33:33.890 --> 06:33:33.900 align:start position:0%
keep people working
 
06:33:36.048 --> 06:33:36.058 align:start position:0%
then would I press a green button in
 
06:33:40.190 --> 06:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:41.690 --> 06:33:41.700 align:start position:0%
and a shocking turn of events
 
06:33:43.548 --> 06:33:43.558 align:start position:0%
representative Weber is recognized for a
 
06:33:46.670 --> 06:33:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:49.788 --> 06:33:49.798 align:start position:0%

Mr Speaker
 
06:33:55.910 --> 06:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
if I know that the work requirement is
 
06:33:57.530 --> 06:33:57.540 align:start position:0%
not being enforced
 
06:34:00.470 --> 06:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
so that this amendment is both
 
06:34:03.470 --> 06:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
unnecessary and irrelevant but if I also
 
06:34:06.110 --> 06:34:06.120 align:start position:0%

that the amendment

let's quiet a little I'm trying to help
 
07:00:53.208 --> 07:00:53.218 align:start position:0%
you out by keeping the pace going but I
 
07:00:55.730 --> 07:00:55.740 align:start position:0%
mean we can go slower while people have
 
07:00:58.368 --> 07:00:58.378 align:start position:0%
chats behind the seats walk around so
 
07:01:01.010 --> 07:01:01.020 align:start position:0%
let's just get this done okay
 
07:01:03.410 --> 07:01:03.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
07:01:06.110 --> 07:01:06.120 align:start position:0%
if I know that this amendment does two
 
07:01:06.120 --> 07:01:07.968 align:start position:0%
if I know that this amendment does two
things

07:01:07.968 --> 07:01:07.978 align:start position:0%
things
 
07:01:10.368 --> 07:01:10.378 align:start position:0%
it has a simple copay for standard
 
07:01:12.230 --> 07:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
member was recognized for parliamentary
 
07:01:14.330 --> 07:01:14.340 align:start position:0%
inquiry yeah I'm asking about the
 
07:01:16.430 --> 07:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
amendment if I know what it does I want
 
07:01:17.570 --> 07:01:17.580 align:start position:0%
to make sure I explain what it does
 
07:01:19.968 --> 07:01:19.978 align:start position:0%
since we haven't had the debate on it
 
07:01:19.978 --> 07:01:22.670 align:start position:0%
since we haven't had the debate on it
nope

07:01:22.670 --> 07:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
nope
 
07:01:25.548 --> 07:01:25.558 align:start position:0%
if I know that the amendment requires a
 
07:01:28.250 --> 07:01:28.260 align:start position:0%
25 copay love it
 
07:01:30.230 --> 07:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
okay if I know that the amendment
 
07:01:33.890 --> 07:01:33.900 align:start position:0%
further would require a small co-pay to
 
07:01:36.048 --> 07:01:36.058 align:start position:0%
go to an emergency room
 
07:01:38.510 --> 07:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
if I know that most of the people who
 
07:01:40.310 --> 07:01:40.320 align:start position:0%
have Private health care insurance have
 
07:01:42.048 --> 07:01:42.058 align:start position:0%
similar things required of their health
 
07:01:43.368 --> 07:01:43.378 align:start position:0%
care programs
 
07:01:48.310 --> 07:01:48.320 align:start position:0%
what I now support amendment 1872-h
 
07:01:51.468 --> 07:01:51.478 align:start position:0%
to put on parity those that are part of
 
07:01:53.390 --> 07:01:53.400 align:start position:0%
this program with those that are funding
 
07:01:54.948 --> 07:01:54.958 align:start position:0%
this program through the private
 
07:01:57.190 --> 07:01:57.200 align:start position:0%

07:02:10.430 --> 07:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
that folks who use the granite Advantage
 
07:02:14.150 --> 07:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
Program have fewer resources than those
 
07:02:16.548 --> 07:02:16.558 align:start position:0%
who are employed in the kind of jobs
 
07:02:19.128 --> 07:02:19.138 align:start position:0%
that come with health care
 
07:02:23.030 --> 07:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
and if I know that this bill is to
 
07:02:25.850 --> 07:02:25.860 align:start position:0%
promote Access to Health Care
 
07:02:29.448 --> 07:02:29.458 align:start position:0%
and further if I know that a co-pay of
 
07:02:32.810 --> 07:02:32.820 align:start position:0%
25 for a medical visit or a hundred
 
07:02:35.930 --> 07:02:35.940 align:start position:0%
dollars for an emergency room visit is
 
07:02:39.770 --> 07:02:39.780 align:start position:0%
going to put a roadblock in the way of
 
07:02:42.890 --> 07:02:42.900 align:start position:0%
these people receiving care would I now
 
07:02:46.250 --> 07:02:46.260 align:start position:0%

up here right now doing the pi but
 
07:05:28.070 --> 07:05:28.080 align:start position:0%

with taxpayer Monies
 
07:05:32.330 --> 07:05:32.340 align:start position:0%

recipients in this bill should meet

07:05:44.270 --> 07:05:44.280 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr thank you Mr Speaker
 
07:09:20.030 --> 07:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that Amendment 1897
 
07:09:24.110 --> 07:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
H takes a federal no surprises act and
 
07:09:26.330 --> 07:09:26.340 align:start position:0%
adds to it for those providers that
 
07:09:28.190 --> 07:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
participate in the grand Advantage
 
07:09:28.200 --> 07:09:29.628 align:start position:0%
participate in the grand Advantage
Program

07:09:29.628 --> 07:09:29.638 align:start position:0%
Program
 
07:09:31.788 --> 07:09:31.798 align:start position:0%
and if I know that Medicaid expansion
 
07:09:34.670 --> 07:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
was only intended to be a portion of the
 
07:09:36.770 --> 07:09:36.780 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act and that if we make
 
07:09:38.330 --> 07:09:38.340 align:start position:0%
it permanent without addressing the
 
07:09:40.788 --> 07:09:40.798 align:start position:0%
weaknesses in the exchanges and pricing
 
07:09:43.490 --> 07:09:43.500 align:start position:0%
transparency it won't be sustainable in
 
07:09:44.690 --> 07:09:44.700 align:start position:0%
the long term
 
07:09:47.150 --> 07:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
and if I know that the federal no
 
07:09:49.968 --> 07:09:49.978 align:start position:0%
surprises act co-sponsored by one of our
 
07:09:52.850 --> 07:09:52.860 align:start position:0%
current U.S senators recognizes and
 
07:09:54.530 --> 07:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
tries to address some of these
 
07:09:56.930 --> 07:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
deficiencies and if I know that this
 
07:09:58.968 --> 07:09:58.978 align:start position:0%
amendment Builds on the infrastructure
 
07:10:01.430 --> 07:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
created while implementing no surprises
 
07:10:03.830 --> 07:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
to create even greater pricing
 
07:10:06.410 --> 07:10:06.420 align:start position:0%
transparency would I now press the green
 
07:10:08.750 --> 07:10:08.760 align:start position:0%

Speaker Mr Speaker if I'm all for Price
 
07:10:19.670 --> 07:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
transparency but as written this
 
07:10:23.208 --> 07:10:23.218 align:start position:0%
amendment would absolutely add
 
07:10:26.208 --> 07:10:26.218 align:start position:0%
incomparable amounts of administrative
 
07:10:29.510 --> 07:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
cost to any institution that accepts
 
07:10:32.448 --> 07:10:32.458 align:start position:0%
Granite Advantage patients and does not
 
07:10:35.810 --> 07:10:35.820 align:start position:0%
add that transparency to any institution
 
07:10:39.650 --> 07:10:39.660 align:start position:0%
that does not accept Granite Advantage
 
07:10:43.788 --> 07:10:43.798 align:start position:0%
patients would I worry that this
 
07:10:45.730 --> 07:10:45.740 align:start position:0%
amendment might have a chilling effect
 
07:10:49.368 --> 07:10:49.378 align:start position:0%
on institutions accepting Granite
 
07:10:53.208 --> 07:10:53.218 align:start position:0%
Advantage patients and so would I push
 
07:10:57.468 --> 07:10:57.478 align:start position:0%

money
 
07:13:25.128 --> 07:13:25.138 align:start position:0%

possibility of saving lives
 
07:13:31.070 --> 07:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
if I know that this bill

poly Pharmacy drugs
 
07:13:45.110 --> 07:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
if I know that the polypharmacy drug is
 
07:13:49.430 --> 07:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
the use of multiple drugs by one person
 
07:13:52.850 --> 07:13:52.860 align:start position:0%
with also it could be supplements for
 
07:13:56.150 --> 07:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
many many different types of illness
 
07:13:59.510 --> 07:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
and if I knew that adverse reactions
 
07:14:02.990 --> 07:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
were a huge medical problem and
 
07:14:06.170 --> 07:14:06.180 align:start position:0%
interactions between drugs was a huge
 
07:14:07.910 --> 07:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
medical problem
 
07:14:10.968 --> 07:14:10.978 align:start position:0%
and if I knew that 66 percent of the
 
07:14:13.390 --> 07:14:13.400 align:start position:0%
people in the United States take
 
07:14:17.090 --> 07:14:17.100 align:start position:0%
prescription medications and if I know
 
07:14:21.048 --> 07:14:21.058 align:start position:0%
that interactions cause about 1.9
 
07:14:25.788 --> 07:14:25.798 align:start position:0%
million emergency visits a year
 
07:14:29.150 --> 07:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
and if I know finally that New Hampshire
 
07:14:31.750 --> 07:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
Medicaid paid
 
07:14:34.030 --> 07:14:34.040 align:start position:0%

912 dollars in prescription drugs
 
07:14:44.208 --> 07:14:44.218 align:start position:0%
doesn't it make sense
 
07:14:46.670 --> 07:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
that we tighten up
 
07:14:49.490 --> 07:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
the looking at them
 
07:14:52.610 --> 07:14:52.620 align:start position:0%

therefore

07:14:54.468 --> 07:14:54.478 align:start position:0%

checking drug interactions is a very
 
07:15:12.948 --> 07:15:12.958 align:start position:0%
important part of health care but I do
 
07:15:15.530 --> 07:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
not want to mandate
 
07:15:19.548 --> 07:15:19.558 align:start position:0%
a particular procedure preferring not to
 
07:15:21.830 --> 07:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
intrude on a provider and patient
 
07:15:21.840 --> 07:15:23.690 align:start position:0%
intrude on a provider and patient

Primary Care Providers but also
 
07:15:33.230 --> 07:15:33.240 align:start position:0%
pharmacists look very carefully at the
 
07:15:35.868 --> 07:15:35.878 align:start position:0%
issue of multiple drug uses and their
 
07:15:39.770 --> 07:15:39.780 align:start position:0%

Mr Speaker
 
07:18:36.590 --> 07:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
if I know that when folks work for
 
07:18:39.830 --> 07:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
something it means a lot more to them
 
07:18:43.250 --> 07:18:43.260 align:start position:0%
and if I know that we should be helping

priority

07:18:47.208 --> 07:18:47.218 align:start position:0%
priority
 
07:18:49.610 --> 07:18:49.620 align:start position:0%

of helping people and if I know
 
07:19:27.410 --> 07:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
that government programs should be

too early
 
07:31:29.150 --> 07:31:29.160 align:start position:0%
um Mr Speaker if I know that this
 
07:31:30.770 --> 07:31:30.780 align:start position:0%
amendment removes language that would
 
07:31:32.930 --> 07:31:32.940 align:start position:0%
allow funds from the Liquor Commission
 
07:31:34.968 --> 07:31:34.978 align:start position:0%

and if I also know that the Liquor
 
07:31:42.830 --> 07:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
Commission fund serves as the financial
 
07:31:45.410 --> 07:31:45.420 align:start position:0%

07:31:59.030 --> 07:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
and Mr Speaker if I know that it that
 
07:32:01.250 --> 07:32:01.260 align:start position:0%
this fund acts as a reserve fund for
 
07:32:03.708 --> 07:32:03.718 align:start position:0%
employee salaries providing a safety net
 
07:32:05.750 --> 07:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
should salary payment needs exceed the

allocated budget
 
07:32:10.368 --> 07:32:10.378 align:start position:0%
and lastly Mr Speaker
 
07:32:13.430 --> 07:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
if I know that voting yes on this
 
07:32:15.468 --> 07:32:15.478 align:start position:0%
amendment would demonstrate our
 
07:32:17.150 --> 07:32:17.160 align:start position:0%

Bill 639 to this bill
 
07:35:18.410 --> 07:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
the the version of the cannabis bill
 
07:35:20.208 --> 07:35:20.218 align:start position:0%
sponsored by both of our party leaders
 
07:35:21.230 --> 07:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
in this house
 
07:35:22.730 --> 07:35:22.740 align:start position:0%
and if I know this house has already
 
07:35:24.288 --> 07:35:24.298 align:start position:0%
passed the exact language of this
 
07:35:24.298 --> 07:35:25.548 align:start position:0%
passed the exact language of this
amendment

07:35:25.548 --> 07:35:25.558 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
07:35:28.010 --> 07:35:28.020 align:start position:0%
and if I know this house has passed many
 
07:35:29.868 --> 07:35:29.878 align:start position:0%
versions of cannabis legalization only
 
07:35:33.350 --> 07:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
to see them fail to be enacted into law
 
07:35:35.150 --> 07:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
but if I know what this house has not
 
07:35:37.788 --> 07:35:37.798 align:start position:0%
done is attach it to something important
 
07:35:39.770 --> 07:35:39.780 align:start position:0%
something that cannot fail
 
07:35:41.750 --> 07:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
and that is what I'm asking you to do
 
07:35:41.760 --> 07:35:43.128 align:start position:0%
and that is what I'm asking you to do
now

07:35:43.128 --> 07:35:43.138 align:start position:0%
now
 
07:35:45.468 --> 07:35:45.478 align:start position:0%
and if I know some may be worried that
 
07:35:47.150 --> 07:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
this will cause Medicaid expansion to
 
07:35:47.160 --> 07:35:48.048 align:start position:0%
this will cause Medicaid expansion to
fail

07:35:48.048 --> 07:35:48.058 align:start position:0%
fail
 
07:35:48.058 --> 07:35:49.250 align:start position:0%
fail
don't

07:35:49.250 --> 07:35:49.260 align:start position:0%
don't
 
07:35:50.690 --> 07:35:50.700 align:start position:0%
we all know that it'll be extended
 
07:35:52.190 --> 07:35:52.200 align:start position:0%
regardless of the vote on this amendment
 
07:35:54.410 --> 07:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
it will not be allowed to expire
 
07:35:56.150 --> 07:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
and if I believe the question before us
 
07:35:56.160 --> 07:35:57.350 align:start position:0%
and if I believe the question before us
is

07:35:57.350 --> 07:35:57.360 align:start position:0%
is
 
07:35:59.628 --> 07:35:59.638 align:start position:0%
do you want to get legalized cannabis as
 
07:36:02.090 --> 07:36:02.100 align:start position:0%
a potential bonus on the deal
 
07:36:04.430 --> 07:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
and if I know I do would I now press the
 
07:36:07.070 --> 07:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:10.070 --> 07:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
I also be in order representative Weber
 
07:36:16.730 --> 07:36:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
07:36:20.150 --> 07:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
here if I am delighted to hear my friend
 
07:36:23.090 --> 07:36:23.100 align:start position:0%
and colleague say that this bill is an
 
07:36:26.330 --> 07:36:26.340 align:start position:0%
important bill which cannot fail
 
07:36:29.570 --> 07:36:29.580 align:start position:0%
and if I also believe that the cannabis
 
07:36:31.788 --> 07:36:31.798 align:start position:0%
bill that we worked on and passed was a
 
07:36:33.048 --> 07:36:33.058 align:start position:0%
good bill
 
07:36:36.110 --> 07:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
but I know that the Senate has already
 
07:36:38.208 --> 07:36:38.218 align:start position:0%
defeated it
 
07:36:38.218 --> 07:36:40.070 align:start position:0%
defeated it

already defeated it
 
07:36:48.350 --> 07:36:48.360 align:start position:0%
and I know that the governor has
 
07:36:51.250 --> 07:36:51.260 align:start position:0%
outlined the exact
 
07:36:54.590 --> 07:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
parameters that he needs before he will
 
07:36:57.708 --> 07:36:57.718 align:start position:0%
sign a cannabis bill and this bill is
 
07:36:59.448 --> 07:36:59.458 align:start position:0%
not it
 
07:37:04.070 --> 07:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
would I now press the red button so we
 
07:37:08.030 --> 07:37:08.040 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
07:40:40.190 --> 07:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that this body has
 
07:40:43.190 --> 07:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
already passed Medicaid expansion with a
 
07:40:45.948 --> 07:40:45.958 align:start position:0%
sunset provision
 
07:40:48.350 --> 07:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
and if I know that Medicaid spending has
 
07:40:51.890 --> 07:40:51.900 align:start position:0%
grown to over one-third of our state's
 
07:40:55.190 --> 07:40:55.200 align:start position:0%

and if I know that a program this big
 
07:41:04.670 --> 07:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
this complex and this expensive deserves
 
07:41:06.830 --> 07:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
a periodic review and reauthorization by
 
07:41:10.010 --> 07:41:10.020 align:start position:0%
the people's elected representatives
 
07:41:11.930 --> 07:41:11.940 align:start position:0%

07:41:13.730 --> 07:41:13.740 align:start position:0%
debate on this bill
 
07:41:15.410 --> 07:41:15.420 align:start position:0%

07:41:17.570 --> 07:41:17.580 align:start position:0%

07:41:25.190 --> 07:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
then press the red button so that we can
 
07:41:26.750 --> 07:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
