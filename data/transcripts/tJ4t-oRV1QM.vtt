how to resource a given line item
 
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
we don't we we're past the philosophy
 
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
stage because we're not a policy board
 
00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:10.479 align:start position:0%
we're a resource board so um
 
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 align:start position:0%

thank you so much for the opportunity to

share with you um
 
00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
information about what's been happening
 
00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:58.479 align:start position:0%
at dcyf and
 
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
um the ways that that impacts the
 
00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
decisions that you all have to make
 
00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:05.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:07.919 align:start position:0%
basic identifying information around our
 
00:07:09.749 --> 00:07:09.759 align:start position:0%
budget budget lines here in the
 
00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:11.919 align:start position:0%
department unique identifier my contact
 
00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
information is here in case you have any
 
00:07:16.309 --> 00:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
follow-up questions
 
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
and then a bit about dcyf so the mission
 
00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800 align:start position:0%
dcyf is to partner with families and
 
00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:22.319 align:start position:0%
communities to provide resources and
 
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
supports that lead to the safety and
 
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
healthy development
 
00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
of children youth and the communities in
 
00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:31.039 align:start position:0%
which they live
 
00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:33.919 align:start position:0%
this is our current structure which um
 
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
if you're looking closely you'll notice
 
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:36.560 align:start position:0%
is actually slightly different than what
 
00:07:38.309 --> 00:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
you see in the budget because we had a
 
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
we restructured things just about a
 
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
month ago and we're still in the process
 
00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:42.390 align:start position:0%
month ago and we're still in the process
of

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
pushing all that through on paper but
 
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.120 align:start position:0%
the basic structure of the division
 
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
myself is the director my general
 
00:07:51.749 --> 00:07:51.759 align:start position:0%
counsel legislative liaison who many of
 
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
you know and there's a chart layer that
 
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
identifies all these individuals and
 
00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:55.430 align:start position:0%
identifies all these individuals and
their

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:07:57.589 --> 00:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
their time with the agency field
 
00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
services which is by far the biggest
 
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
of our operations that's what people
 
00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
really think of when they think of dcyf
 
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
that is all of the field staff and
 
00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
district offices that do
 
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
child protection and juvenile justice
 
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.350 align:start position:0%
child protection and juvenile justice
work

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
our chief of operations who oversees
 
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
three of our bureaus
 
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
our relatively new bureau of
 
00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
professional strategic development
 
00:08:19.589 --> 00:08:19.599 align:start position:0%
relatively new um bureau of evaluation
 
00:08:21.189 --> 00:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
analytics and reporting
 
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:23.360 align:start position:0%
these two bureaus were split out of a
 
00:08:25.029 --> 00:08:25.039 align:start position:0%
larger bureau that was called the bureau
 
00:08:25.039 --> 00:08:25.270 align:start position:0%
larger bureau that was called the bureau
of

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
organizational learning and quality
 
00:08:27.599 --> 00:08:29.189 align:start position:0%
organizational learning and quality
improvement

00:08:29.189 --> 00:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
improvement
 
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
in last year's budget or last biennium's
 
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
budget there was an
 
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
additional position allocated to us for
 
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
the purpose of
 
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
bringing on another high level
 
00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
administrator with expertise in
 
00:08:39.279 --> 00:08:40.149 align:start position:0%
administrator with expertise in
analytics

00:08:40.149 --> 00:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
analytics
 
00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:43.039 align:start position:0%
and evaluation and we just hired that
 
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
person about a month ago which is
 
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
why we've now broken this former bureau
 
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
known as bureau of organizational
 
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
learning and quality improvement
 
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
into two because we now have one person
 
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
who's focused really on
 
00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
our um professional development our
 
00:08:59.269 --> 00:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
training and things like that as well as
 
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
our strategic priorities and
 
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
implementation thereof and another
 
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
person who's really focused on the
 
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.110 align:start position:0%
person who's really focused on the
evaluation

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
evaluation
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
analytics and those types of things
 
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
which are key for us
 
00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:10.959 align:start position:0%
as we move into a more sophisticated
 
00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
service array
 
00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
aligned with the federal family first
 
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
preventative services act legislation
 
00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:18.959 align:start position:0%
and we'll talk more about that later
 
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
also reporting to our chief of
 
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
operations is our business information
 
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
systems those are the folks that oversee
 
00:09:28.949 --> 00:09:28.959 align:start position:0%
our electronic case record and there is
 
00:09:28.959 --> 00:09:30.150 align:start position:0%
our electronic case record and there is
uh

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:09:31.829 --> 00:09:31.839 align:start position:0%
recommended funding in the capital
 
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
budget for updating that
 
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
antiquated electronic case record which
 
00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
is 20 plus years old
 
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
work on that has begun but there's
 
00:09:41.509 --> 00:09:41.519 align:start position:0%
additional resources needed to complete
 
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
that work
 
00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:47.829 --> 00:09:47.839 align:start position:0%
our bureau of community family and
 
00:09:49.910 --> 00:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
program support these are the folks who
 
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.030 align:start position:0%
program support these are the folks who
basically

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
are responsible for managing all of the
 
00:09:54.389 --> 00:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
services and all the providers that we
 
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
work with
 
00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
i'm also responsible for some of our
 
00:09:59.910 --> 00:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
discrete supports to the field so things
 
00:10:01.509 --> 00:10:01.519 align:start position:0%
around foster care
 
00:10:03.590 --> 00:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
around adoption around permanency
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
supports for children and youth
 
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
our adolescent program for young adults
 
00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
who are
 
00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
of transition age leaving dcyf those
 
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
types of supports are handled out of
 
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
this bureau
 
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
and then the sununu youth services
 
00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
program which is the state's
 
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
only secure facility for detained and
 
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:27.839 align:start position:0%
a bit of an overview and i think i
 
00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:29.519 align:start position:0%
captured this really in the last slide
 
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
so i won't belabor it but really we have
 
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
three primary focuses child protection
 
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
which is um to investigate and assess
 
00:10:38.389 --> 00:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
allegations of abuse or neglect
 
00:10:40.069 --> 00:10:40.079 align:start position:0%
and then to work with those families
 
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
where elegant where abuse neglect is
 
00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:42.870 align:start position:0%
where elegant where abuse neglect is
found

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
found
 
00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:45.519 align:start position:0%
to ensure safety to ensure children end
 
00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:47.839 align:start position:0%
up in a forever family whether that's by
 
00:10:49.590 --> 00:10:49.600 align:start position:0%
safely keeping those children at home or
 
00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:51.519 align:start position:0%
reunifying those families at home after
 
00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
providing services
 
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
or whether that's through adoption and
 
00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
trying to have children um
 
00:10:58.389 --> 00:10:58.399 align:start position:0%
find their forever families in another
 
00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
home where necessary
 
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice which is focused as i'm
 
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
sure folks
 
00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
recognize primarily on delinquency
 
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
but we also have uh services through
 
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice for what we call chins
 
00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:11.519 align:start position:0%
in the state children in need of
 
00:11:11.519 --> 00:11:12.150 align:start position:0%
in the state children in need of
services

00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:12.160 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
some of those chins cases are court
 
00:11:15.509 --> 00:11:15.519 align:start position:0%
involved some of them are not
 
00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
and some of the data i'll share later
 
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
makes that distinction and we can go
 
00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:19.839 align:start position:0%
further into that
 
00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
and then sysc this new youth services
 
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
center which like i said is the state's
 
00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:24.630 align:start position:0%
center which like i said is the state's
only

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:24.640 align:start position:0%
only
 
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
um secured setting for detained and
 
00:11:28.949 --> 00:11:28.959 align:start position:0%
committed youth
 
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
mr ripson yes in my am i right to think
 
00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:32.870 align:start position:0%
mr ripson yes in my am i right to think
that

00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:36.160 align:start position:0%
the sununu center is uh
 
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
100 in eu
 
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
code 7916 rehabilitative programs
 
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
i believe that's right karen could you
 
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
there are actually several accounting
 
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
units associated with sysc
 
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:01.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:03.200 align:start position:0%
so a little bit deeper into child
 
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
protection um this includes
 
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
uh child abuse neglect hotline right so
 
00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:08.959 align:start position:0%
people call
 
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
24 7 365 to make reports of abuse
 
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
neglect that's actually relatively new
 
00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:15.839 align:start position:0%
new hampshire was one of the last states
 
00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
a few years ago to implement a 24 7
 
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:18.949 align:start position:0%
a few years ago to implement a 24 7
hotline

00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
hotline
 
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
which it now has child abuse and neglect
 
00:12:23.829 --> 00:12:23.839 align:start position:0%
assessments which are also now 24 7.
 
00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
again new hampshire was one of the last
 
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
states in the union to implement a 24 7
 
00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
response on child protection which we
 
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
now have
 
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:32.720 align:start position:0%
um prior to that what would typically
 
00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:34.240 align:start position:0%
happen if something came in after hours
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
law enforcement
 
00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
would remove would get involved to
 
00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
potentially remove a child from their
 
00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:38.790 align:start position:0%
potentially remove a child from their
home

00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
and then monday morning our staff would
 
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
get involved that's really not ideal you
 
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
really want the folks who
 
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
who understand family dynamics and those
 
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
social workers making those decisions
 
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
and making those placements
 
00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:51.839 align:start position:0%
in home and in community services which
 
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
are being
 
00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
really redone and we'll talk more about
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
that a little bit later
 
00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:58.720 align:start position:0%
out of home residential services
 
00:13:00.949 --> 00:13:00.959 align:start position:0%
including relative care and foster care
 
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
residential care is included here and
 
00:13:04.389 --> 00:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
it's largely paid for out of dcyf's
 
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
budget but management of those programs
 
00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
is primarily actually through the bureau
 
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
of children's behavioral health because
 
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
those programs serve
 
00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
populations that include dcyf but also
 
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
could include non-dcyf
 
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:17.200 align:start position:0%
and we can talk more about that a little
 
00:13:19.509 --> 00:13:19.519 align:start position:0%
bit later reunification services so
 
00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:21.519 align:start position:0%
those are services to try to help
 
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
um bring families back together when
 
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
children have had to be removed and to
 
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
keep those families stable
 
00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
and then adoption and adoption services
 
00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
which would include
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
not only um securing adoptions for young
 
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
people where we can't reunify them with
 
00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
also post-adoption where families who
 
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
have already adopted are having a
 
00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:43.670 align:start position:0%
have already adopted are having a
challenge

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
the related statutes to all of this are
 
00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:46.959 align:start position:0%
listed in here for
 
00:13:50.069 --> 00:13:50.079 align:start position:0%
your future reference yes
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
so are you going to have another slide
 
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
to talk about the
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
hotline or or or is this
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
okay yeah i have some data slides ahead
 
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
which go into
 
00:14:01.509 --> 00:14:01.519 align:start position:0%
some details about these different
 
00:14:01.519 --> 00:14:05.670 align:start position:0%
some details about these different
components

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
so this is that slide this is the calls
 
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
to intake the hotline
 
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
as you referred to it the data that
 
00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
you're seeing here is primarily coming
 
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
out of our data book
 
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
so there is the 2020 dcyf data book last
 
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
year was the first year we released a
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
data book we're doing this annually to
 
00:14:22.949 --> 00:14:22.959 align:start position:0%
try to improve transparency and
 
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
understanding of the system
 
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
um let me explain how to read this chart
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
and then explain some of what we're
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
seeing in this chart
 
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
so the green line across the top that's
 
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
the total call volume to our hotline
 
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
you do see that we've had growth in that
 
00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:37.829 align:start position:0%
you do see that we've had growth in that
number

00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:37.839 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
up through state fiscal year 20 where we
 
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
did see some decline in call volume
 
00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
i do think the majority of that decline
 
00:14:45.189 --> 00:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
is covered related
 
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
folks will recall that in the springtime
 
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of news
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
reports about um about
 
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
seriously decreased calls to the hotline
 
00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
as a result of kids not being in the
 
00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:57.839 align:start position:0%
community where they typically are
 
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
school callers in particular falling off
 
00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
in call volume but other providers too
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
we actually saw
 
00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
decreases in calls for medical providers
 
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
calls from community programs calls from
 
00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
social workers really almost every
 
00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:13.839 align:start position:0%
category with the exception of law
 
00:15:13.839 --> 00:15:14.550 align:start position:0%
category with the exception of law
enforcement

00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
who is calling at a typical rate and
 
00:15:18.389 --> 00:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
families themselves right
 
00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:19.839 align:start position:0%
a grandparent may be calling on
 
00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
something happening in their their grand
 
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
in their child's home or you know or you
 
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.509 align:start position:0%
in their child's home or you know or you
know

00:15:25.509 --> 00:15:25.519 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
one one parent calling about something
 
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
happening in another parent's home or
 
00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
something like that um but other than
 
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
those two categories we did see
 
00:15:34.629 --> 00:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
decreased call volume starting in march
 
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of that has picked up since i
 
00:15:37.749 --> 00:15:37.759 align:start position:0%
don't have slides on that in here but we
 
00:15:39.509 --> 00:15:39.519 align:start position:0%
do have slides on the web that go into
 
00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
all of that
 
00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
and it's something i can go into deeper
 
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
if folks want to
 
00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
um the other thing you see in here which
 
00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go into more
 
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
on the next slide is changes in the
 
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
number of what gets screened in
 
00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
for an assessment that's this dark blue
 
00:15:57.509 --> 00:15:57.519 align:start position:0%
the light blue what gets screened out
 
00:16:00.069 --> 00:16:00.079 align:start position:0%
and then the number of additional um
 
00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:01.519 align:start position:0%
information calls
 
00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
so what you're seeing here part of this
 
00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:04.720 align:start position:0%
reduction in what's getting screened in
 
00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
is a covet impact but most of what
 
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
you're seeing there is actually a change
 
00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
in practice
 
00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
and what we've been doing for the past
 
00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:13.839 align:start position:0%
few years trying to perfect and where i
 
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
think we're finally seeing it play out
 
00:16:16.629 --> 00:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
in our data
 
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
is really improving our hotline
 
00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.310 align:start position:0%
is really improving our hotline
operations

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
operations
 
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
and changing it from a system where
 
00:16:24.069 --> 00:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
historically all we did when we received
 
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
a call was say yes you're screened in
 
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
and know you're screened out um to a
 
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
system where now we have a third option
 
00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:16:32.629 --> 00:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
yes you're screened in know you're
 
00:16:34.629 --> 00:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
screened out but this family could use
 
00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
some additional help and you as say the
 
00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
teacher we're going to help you connect
 
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
with the family resource center to get
 
00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
that family the additional help that
 
00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
they need
 
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
this is important for a couple reasons
 
00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.629 align:start position:0%
this is important for a couple reasons
one

00:16:46.629 --> 00:16:46.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:48.389 --> 00:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
we were conducting investigations on
 
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
families that really were never going to
 
00:16:51.749 --> 00:16:51.759 align:start position:0%
end up being substantiated
 
00:16:54.389 --> 00:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
so you end up putting a family through a
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
potentially traumatic situation of
 
00:16:57.829 --> 00:16:57.839 align:start position:0%
investigation unnecessarily
 
00:16:59.509 --> 00:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
and not connecting them necessarily with
 
00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
the resources that they need
 
00:17:03.509 --> 00:17:03.519 align:start position:0%
if we're able to do that work at intake
 
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
we're able to save
 
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
some of the um some of our bandwidth of
 
00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
staff to investigate those higher risk
 
00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919 align:start position:0%
situations that really require our
 
00:17:09.919 --> 00:17:10.789 align:start position:0%
situations that really require our
attention

00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
attention
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
but we're also able to support
 
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
communities in supporting their own
 
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
families without getting child
 
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
protection involved which is a scary
 
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
thing for a lot of families and we don't
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
want to over utilize that
 
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
that lever when we don't need to so that
 
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
work has been
 
00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:26.720 align:start position:0%
going on really for the past the
 
00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
development work that's been going on
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
for a couple years but the actual
 
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
practice change has been going on for
 
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
about a year
 
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
so part of what you're seeing here in
 
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
this shift in screening and screen out
 
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
is that exact dynamic it's the dynamic
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
of a practice shift
 
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
um but it's also somewhat impacted by
 
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
the reduced call volume
 
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
all right i'll move on to the next slide
 
00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:52.400 align:start position:0%
which goes a little bit deeper into that
 
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
so this is child protective services new
 
00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.909 align:start position:0%
so this is child protective services new
assessments

00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
assessments
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
you see the assessment volume just to
 
00:17:59.669 --> 00:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
orient you to the slide the green line
 
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
is oriented to the far
 
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:03.280 align:start position:0%
right axis right so the green line is
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
total new assessments in the year to the
 
00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
far right
 
00:18:08.549 --> 00:18:08.559 align:start position:0%
these bars are oriented to the left axis
 
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
that's assessment by priority response
 
00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:10.789 align:start position:0%
that's assessment by priority response
level

00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:10.799 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
i'll explain a little bit about what's
 
00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
happening in both of those too so you do
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
see for the first time in years a
 
00:18:17.909 --> 00:18:17.919 align:start position:0%
substantial drop in the number of new
 
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
assessments which is
 
00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
in my view good news mostly some of this
 
00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:23.039 align:start position:0%
is probably covered related
 
00:18:24.789 --> 00:18:24.799 align:start position:0%
as i said on the last slide this
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
corresponds to what you saw on the last
 
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.350 align:start position:0%
corresponds to what you saw on the last
slide

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
slide
 
00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
but some of this is because of that
 
00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:33.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
the other thing that you see happening
 
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
here which which i think is reflective
 
00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:36.710 align:start position:0%
here which which i think is reflective
of

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:18:38.549 --> 00:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
really great improvements happening at
 
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
our intake system
 
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
is the numbers of level one level two
 
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
and level three assessments
 
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
level one means a 24-hour response that
 
00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
means an emergency response level two is
 
00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:48.549 align:start position:0%
means an emergency response level two is
a

00:18:48.549 --> 00:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
48-hour response level three is a
 
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
72-hour response
 
00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:54.160 align:start position:0%
you see the number of level ones drop
 
00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
the number of level twos remain
 
00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:55.990 align:start position:0%
the number of level twos remain
relatively

00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
relatively
 
00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
constant and the number of level threes
 
00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
drop what was happening in prior years
 
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
was because
 
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
intake was understaffed under resourced
 
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
and didn't have the
 
00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
um the appropriate computer equipment
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
that they needed to do the appropriate
 
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
telephone lines that they needed to do
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
the appropriate analytical structure in
 
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
order to understand
 
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
their decision making processes all of
 
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
those things were yielding slow response
 
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
times from intake and making a decision
 
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
about whether to screen things in or out
 
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
and as a result of that things that they
 
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
would have screened into say a level two
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
would get screened in as a level one
 
00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
because it took them a day to make the
 
00:19:27.679 --> 00:19:28.870 align:start position:0%
because it took them a day to make the
decision

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
well now that we've been able to improve
 
00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
operations at intake to eliminate those
 
00:19:35.909 --> 00:19:35.919 align:start position:0%
challenges we're actually seeing what is
 
00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
i think a more appropriate distribution
 
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
between our emergency responses and our
 
00:19:42.390 --> 00:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
48-hour and 72-hour responses
 
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
um and you've seen that play out here in
 
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
the data with the number of level ones
 
00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:46.549 align:start position:0%
the data with the number of level ones
drop

00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
drop
 
00:19:48.549 --> 00:19:48.559 align:start position:0%
more significantly than even the number
 
00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
of um of total call
 
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
i have a question for you a couple
 
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
actually uh
 
00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
this these questions are related to just
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
getting a sense of scale
 
00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
00:20:04.789 --> 00:20:04.799 align:start position:0%
what first question what what is the
 
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
definition of a child in this case
 
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
a child is somebody between the age of 0
 
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
do you happen to have any statistics to
 
00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:16.870 align:start position:0%
do you happen to have any statistics to
show

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
show
 
00:20:19.669 --> 00:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
overall what is happening to that
 
00:20:20.789 --> 00:20:20.799 align:start position:0%
demographic i
 
00:20:23.669 --> 00:20:23.679 align:start position:0%
i think i've seen in ways and means uh
 
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
coming out of their
 
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
graphics that shows the democrat
 
00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:27.990 align:start position:0%
graphics that shows the democrat
demographic

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
demographic
 
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
of uh zero to 18 is in decline in new
 
00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:32.230 align:start position:0%
of uh zero to 18 is in decline in new
hampshire

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
is that right in our data book and i can
 
00:20:36.149 --> 00:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
pull that up if you would like me to
 
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
no no it's a conversation yep i do have
 
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
in our data book
 
00:20:42.789 --> 00:20:42.799 align:start position:0%
um data that does show some interesting
 
00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
shifts within our demographics for
 
00:20:46.149 --> 00:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
children you do see some modest decrease
 
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
the number of people under the age of 18
 
00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
in recent years i think when the new
 
00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
census data comes out it'll be
 
00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
interesting because a lot of that's
 
00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
based on assumptions
 
00:20:54.789 --> 00:20:54.799 align:start position:0%
instead of an actual count for the most
 
00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:56.799 align:start position:0%
recent years the other thing you see
 
00:20:59.430 --> 00:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
is shift in demographics in terms of uh
 
00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
racial and ethnicity
 
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
where we are seeing more um more people
 
00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
of color in the state than we have
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
particularly children of color in this
 
00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
state than we have in recent years
 
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
um and we're seeing uh you know growth
 
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
in different parts of the state
 
00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
particularly in the southern part of the
 
00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.630 align:start position:0%
particularly in the southern part of the
state

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like your data book has a
 
00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:17.669 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like your data book has a
breakdown

00:21:17.669 --> 00:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
breakdown
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
of region and by various demographics
 
00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
who your clientele are and maybe also
 
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
the total population in that uh zero to
 
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
18 group
 
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
in that same region yes i think the data
 
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
book actually only has it by statewide i
 
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
don't think it breaks it down by
 
00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:36.310 align:start position:0%
don't think it breaks it down by
regional

00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
regional
 
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
but i think we might have that i think
 
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
we have that data it's just not in the
 
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
data book
 
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
okay so with all the emphasis on on on
 
00:21:45.909 --> 00:21:45.919 align:start position:0%
health equity and equal access to our
 
00:21:45.919 --> 00:21:46.870 align:start position:0%
health equity and equal access to our
systems

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
systems
 
00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm sure you're tracking that data
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
at that level
 
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that uh we know if
 
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
we're doing the right thing
 
00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
yes yeah right yeah and it's one of
 
00:21:59.350 --> 00:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
these areas right where
 
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
nationally we see disproportionality in
 
00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
child protection and juvenile justice
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
um and we see it here in new hampshire
 
00:22:08.549 --> 00:22:08.559 align:start position:0%
as well both again national scale and in
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
this state
 
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
representative walner has a question for
 
00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:13.750 align:start position:0%
representative walner has a question for
you

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
yes i um i've heard
 
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
and you know these are just individuals
 
00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.350 align:start position:0%
and you know these are just individuals
who

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
bring forth a specific case
 
00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
but i've heard that there have been
 
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
increases in the number of children
 
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
who have been referred to dcyf
 
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
because they've not been attending
 
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:36.080 align:start position:0%
school and i'm wondering if
 
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
if you have seen an increase in um
 
00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:43.039 align:start position:0%
referrals around children not coming not
 
00:22:44.549 --> 00:22:44.559 align:start position:0%
attending school
 
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
and if so what kinds of resources
 
00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
or um things can we do for those
 
00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
families i mean i think there's probably
 
00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:54.310 align:start position:0%
families i mean i think there's probably
a

00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:22:57.029 --> 00:22:57.039 align:start position:0%
wide variety of reasons why children
 
00:22:59.909 --> 00:22:59.919 align:start position:0%
haven't attended school during covid
 
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
i wondered if you could say something
 
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
about that absolutely thank you for the
 
00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:04.070 align:start position:0%
about that absolutely thank you for the
question

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
yes that is correct i actually have
 
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
another entire presentation
 
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
on that topic that i could share with
 
00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
folks if they're interested but we um
 
00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
we did know this starting in the fall
 
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
it's interesting we did not notice this
 
00:23:18.149 --> 00:23:18.159 align:start position:0%
at all in the spring when schools first
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
closed but starting in the fall
 
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
really dramatic increases both on
 
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice and child protection
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
around in child protection what's called
 
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
educational neglect
 
00:23:29.909 --> 00:23:29.919 align:start position:0%
um referrals in the juvenile justice
 
00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
what we call truancy referrals
 
00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
um really two sides of the same coin
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
typically educational neglect
 
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
involves younger children truancy
 
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
involves older children although
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
that you know either population could
 
00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
end up in either bucket depending on the
 
00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.430 align:start position:0%
end up in either bucket depending on the
circumstances

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
we saw really really dramatic growth in
 
00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:48.470 align:start position:0%
we saw really really dramatic growth in
both

00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
both
 
00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
starting in october
 
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
we did a little bit of a qualitative
 
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
analysis based on that and pulled
 
00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
together some focus groups of the staff
 
00:23:59.510 --> 00:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
who were handling these cases to try to
 
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
understand what the dynamics were there
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
and what we were really hearing back was
 
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:24:06.789 --> 00:24:06.799 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly these were not situations
 
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
where kids were really being abused or
 
00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:08.950 align:start position:0%
where kids were really being abused or
neglected

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
neglected
 
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
um you know prevented from accessing
 
00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
education because of any parental
 
00:24:15.669 --> 00:24:15.679 align:start position:0%
um problems but rather families who were
 
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
just really stressed with trying to
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
balance the
 
00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
requirements of um you know being
 
00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:21.510 align:start position:0%
requirements of um you know being
parents

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
parents
 
00:24:23.909 --> 00:24:23.919 align:start position:0%
working remotely or not one of the cases
 
00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
that was brought forward was a woman who
 
00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:25.750 align:start position:0%
that was brought forward was a woman who
was

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
a waitress and had to bring her
 
00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
six-year-old to the diner every day to
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
do the remote school and
 
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
you know that's not a parent who's
 
00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
abusing or neglecting their kids that
 
00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
that's a parent who's really a hero
 
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out a really tough
 
00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.190 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out a really tough
situation

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
um so some of the other things that we
 
00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
heard were some challenges with
 
00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:41.990 align:start position:0%
heard were some challenges with
technology

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
technology
 
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
um that wasn't overwhelming it was
 
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
really the balancing of priorities for
 
00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.310 align:start position:0%
really the balancing of priorities for
parents

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
parents
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
we did hear some challenges around
 
00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
certain schools having some pretty
 
00:24:51.269 --> 00:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
draconian policies around what counts as
 
00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:52.640 align:start position:0%
absent or not
 
00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
um for example one district that would
 
00:24:57.669 --> 00:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
if a student didn't want to turn their
 
00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
camera on they would count them as
 
00:25:00.149 --> 00:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
absent for the day
 
00:25:01.750 --> 00:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
i might i understand why the school
 
00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
would want the camera on at the same
 
00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
time that in that instance the student
 
00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
was really ashamed of
 
00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
their household conditions and just was
 
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
not going to be convinced to turn on
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
that camera
 
00:25:12.549 --> 00:25:12.559 align:start position:0%
um in front of their peers which i can
 
00:25:14.149 --> 00:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
understand and that's not a student who
 
00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
i think needs to be punished for that
 
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
right that's a
 
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
that's a different type of situation to
 
00:25:20.549 --> 00:25:20.559 align:start position:0%
manage so
 
00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
um you know we've seen a lot but i think
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day it really comes
 
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
down to families
 
00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
struggling with these different um
 
00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:27.990 align:start position:0%
struggling with these different um
challenges

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
challenges
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
i do think you know given the huge
 
00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:33.760 align:start position:0%
rise that we've seen in this remote
 
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
learning environment
 
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
i do think the remote and hybrid
 
00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
learning is is probably the driving
 
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
factor in this we did give some advice
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
to the school
 
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
districts we had a uh forum boe helped
 
00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
us pull together the school districts
 
00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
where we saw this shift occurring most
 
00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:48.630 align:start position:0%
where we saw this shift occurring most
frequently

00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
frequently
 
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
two weeks ago um and we hosted a forum
 
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
for those school districts where we
 
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
shared all this data shared these
 
00:25:56.710 --> 00:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
stories and gave them some advice
 
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of that advice was around just
 
00:25:59.510 --> 00:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
really making sure they're utilizing
 
00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:00.799 align:start position:0%
their guidance counselors and social
 
00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
workers to troubleshoot before they're
 
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
making referrals to us
 
00:26:06.149 --> 00:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
because as i said before when we go out
 
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
that can be a scary experience and while
 
00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:08.470 align:start position:0%
that can be a scary experience and while
we

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:26:09.909 --> 00:26:09.919 align:start position:0%
i think are pretty good at problem
 
00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
solving with families it would be nice
 
00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:12.149 align:start position:0%
solving with families it would be nice
to

00:26:12.149 --> 00:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
have these families and others be able
 
00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
to solve these problems directly
 
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
one of the other pieces of advice we
 
00:26:18.549 --> 00:26:18.559 align:start position:0%
gave was contacting their local family
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
resource centers many of them were
 
00:26:21.269 --> 00:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
willing to assist
 
00:26:23.669 --> 00:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
with families in these positions we
 
00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
shared again with them something that we
 
00:26:26.789 --> 00:26:26.799 align:start position:0%
developed last spring and updated in
 
00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:28.400 align:start position:0%
december called the child and family
 
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
well-being guide that was a tool that we
 
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
created at the start of covid
 
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
that on the front of it basically
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
acknowledged that all families were
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
struggling now
 
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
that and provided a host of questions
 
00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
that people could ask to kind of talk to
 
00:26:41.669 --> 00:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
families about what their needs are and
 
00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:43.039 align:start position:0%
then on the back give them a list of
 
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
resources that they can connect those
 
00:26:45.669 --> 00:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
families to
 
00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
with the idea being that we wanted our
 
00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
teachers but not just our teachers our
 
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
communities as a whole
 
00:26:51.269 --> 00:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
to be able to connect with families and
 
00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
help families meet their needs
 
00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping that that would prevent some
 
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
of the deeper end stuff that we see when
 
00:26:57.909 --> 00:26:57.919 align:start position:0%
families are neglected for a long period
 
00:27:00.149 --> 00:27:00.159 align:start position:0%
of time
 
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
the last recommendation on that sheet
 
00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
was though that that i would hope
 
00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
schools would try to find ways to get
 
00:27:06.789 --> 00:27:06.799 align:start position:0%
those kids in school
 
00:27:08.549 --> 00:27:08.559 align:start position:0%
right even if they weren't ready to open
 
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
up entirely
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
that kids that are that they're so
 
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
worried about that they're referring for
 
00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.149 align:start position:0%
worried about that they're referring for
truancy

00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
truancy
 
00:27:17.669 --> 00:27:17.679 align:start position:0%
and and educational neglect based on
 
00:27:17.679 --> 00:27:19.750 align:start position:0%
and and educational neglect based on
absenteeism

00:27:19.750 --> 00:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
absenteeism
 
00:27:21.269 --> 00:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
it's a relatively small population
 
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
compared to the entire school population
 
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
and probably is a population that they
 
00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
need to think about prioritizing as an
 
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
at-risk population to be in person
 
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
and i you know i think largely the
 
00:27:32.789 --> 00:27:32.799 align:start position:0%
districts who were present were
 
00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039 align:start position:0%
receptive to all of those ideas and
 
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
i would say um all of them seemed like
 
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
they were really
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
working hard to try to problem solve
 
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
these things i didn't get the sense from
 
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
anybody that they were indifferent to
 
00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:46.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:48.789 --> 00:27:48.799 align:start position:0%
thank you i wondered if i could have
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
just one follow-up
 
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
can you um give me just a ballpark
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
figure of how many
 
00:27:59.510 --> 00:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
um calls you did have about educational
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
um neglect um if the chair wouldn't mind
 
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
if i pull down this presentation and
 
00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
pull up another one i can give you the
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
exact figure
 
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
i i'll cut my head i don't remember it
 
00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
can you can you wait for that uh
 
00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.190 align:start position:0%
can you can you wait for that uh
representative

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
oh yes anytime that's fine thank you
 
00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
okay i i think i think we're clear
 
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
um i one just to foreshadow
 
00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
my questions when we get to the
 
00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.029 align:start position:0%
my questions when we get to the
spreadsheets

00:28:27.029 --> 00:28:27.039 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets
 
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
it looks like with your workload going
 
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:30.470 align:start position:0%
it looks like with your workload going
down

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
general funds are going up quite a lot
 
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
in the governor's budget
 
00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
but it looks like most of that's
 
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
offsetting declines in
 
00:28:40.870 --> 00:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
federal budget so um so
 
00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
it'll be after lunch before we talk
 
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
about that and i just didn't want to
 
00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:45.190 align:start position:0%
about that and i just didn't want to
forget

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
forget
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
that i wanted to have that conversation
 
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
with you
 
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
yeah and one other thing i would add on
 
00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
that point when we get to it is that
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
the system still isn't right size right
 
00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
the system was
 
00:29:00.149 --> 00:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
way under um under resourced a few years
 
00:29:00.159 --> 00:29:01.190 align:start position:0%
way under um under resourced a few years
ago

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
and the right resources were put in
 
00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
place to help us build that out but as
 
00:29:06.789 --> 00:29:06.799 align:start position:0%
you'll see as we go further into this
 
00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
you know hiring retention has been a
 
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
challenge and we still have more work to
 
00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.190 align:start position:0%
challenge and we still have more work to
do

00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:29:12.389 --> 00:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
and one of the ways we measure that and
 
00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
it's also in here is through looking at
 
00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559 align:start position:0%
case loads of staff
 
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
so even though there are fewer
 
00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
assessments today than there were then
 
00:29:22.389 --> 00:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
um i don't think we're in a position
 
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
where we have um
 
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
where we have you know too many staff to
 
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
meet the demand and
 
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
you can see that when we get into
 
00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
actually this chart right here
 
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
the uh the assessment case loads
 
00:29:36.549 --> 00:29:36.559 align:start position:0%
so national standards around the the
 
00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
case load that a caseworker should have
 
00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
in a child and protection in a child
 
00:29:41.110 --> 00:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
protection work
 
00:29:42.389 --> 00:29:42.399 align:start position:0%
when they're doing assessments or
 
00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:44.559 align:start position:0%
investigations is 12.
 
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
and that is that is a national standard
 
00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
it is not you this has not been tested
 
00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
specifically for new hampshire
 
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago when this
 
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
conversation started happening we didn't
 
00:29:58.630 --> 00:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
talk about having a workload study done
 
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
to to develop a specific one for new
 
00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:02.149 align:start position:0%
to to develop a specific one for new
hampshire

00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
ultimately at that point the
 
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
in that piece of legislation that was
 
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
stripped out and not funded so we didn't
 
00:30:08.789 --> 00:30:08.799 align:start position:0%
do that
 
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
with the recognition in that committee
 
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
hearing that people thought the national
 
00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
standard of 12
 
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
sounded like an appropriate caseload and
 
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
i'm i am comfortable with that but i
 
00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
would say that
 
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire you know we expect our
 
00:30:23.669 --> 00:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
case workers to do things that we didn't
 
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
that we don't in other jurisdictions
 
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
you know and for example in new jersey
 
00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
where i came from our caseworkers didn't
 
00:30:30.549 --> 00:30:30.559 align:start position:0%
have to do much work on
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
um complaints and pleadings because
 
00:30:33.669 --> 00:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
there were paralegals employed to do all
 
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
that work we're here
 
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
um our caseworkers have to do a lot of
 
00:30:38.549 --> 00:30:38.559 align:start position:0%
have to carry a lot of that work because
 
00:30:40.149 --> 00:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
we don't have those uh paralegals in
 
00:30:40.159 --> 00:30:40.789 align:start position:0%
we don't have those uh paralegals in
place

00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
but at any rate what i think you're
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
saying is that
 
00:30:48.149 --> 00:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
uh the the definition of what's in a
 
00:30:48.159 --> 00:30:48.950 align:start position:0%
uh the the definition of what's in a
case

00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:30:52.549 --> 00:30:52.559 align:start position:0%
to create case loads it varies by state
 
00:30:55.750 --> 00:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
and that in that anecdotally you just
 
00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:56.389 align:start position:0%
and that in that anecdotally you just
said

00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:30:59.509 --> 00:30:59.519 align:start position:0%
our cases are heavier because we're
 
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
asking them to do more work
 
00:31:03.909 --> 00:31:03.919 align:start position:0%
than the states you're familiar with
 
00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
exactly right okay and so you probably
 
00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:08.630 align:start position:0%
exactly right okay and so you probably
thought

00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
thought
 
00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
about how how our definition of a case
 
00:31:15.269 --> 00:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
really does compare nationally so that
 
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
we're not just you know naively looking
 
00:31:18.070 --> 00:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
at the number
 
00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
12 but we're actually understanding what
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
that means
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
yes yeah and i and as i said we did um
 
00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
when we first started having this
 
00:31:28.149 --> 00:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
conversation about three years ago when
 
00:31:28.159 --> 00:31:28.470 align:start position:0%
conversation about three years ago when
i

00:31:28.470 --> 00:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:31:30.310 --> 00:31:30.320 align:start position:0%
moved to new hampshire and took on this
 
00:31:32.389 --> 00:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
job that was one of the things that we
 
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
sought to do
 
00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
but ultimately we decided not to not to
 
00:31:38.789 --> 00:31:38.799 align:start position:0%
invest in that type of workload study
 
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
all right all right thank you i don't
 
00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
know if you want to take that before i
 
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
move oh
 
00:31:46.149 --> 00:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
representative weiler has his hand up
 
00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman director
 
00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
this is a huge reduction in case laws
 
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
will we see further on what this has
 
00:31:57.269 --> 00:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
accomplished will there be
 
00:31:59.590 --> 00:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
quote more cases closed more cases dealt
 
00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:01.919 align:start position:0%
with will there be an improvement in the
 
00:32:01.919 --> 00:32:02.549 align:start position:0%
with will there be an improvement in the
overall

00:32:02.549 --> 00:32:02.559 align:start position:0%
overall
 
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
health of our children yes this
 
00:32:07.669 --> 00:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
reduction is that going to be something
 
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
we see
 
00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
yes yes for all the above um thank you
 
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
the the case loads um you know really
 
00:32:18.389 --> 00:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
in january 2016 at being over 90 is
 
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
something that is
 
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely unheard of nationally right
 
00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
with the target being 12 to have
 
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
somebody carrying 90 cases on average
 
00:32:25.990 --> 00:32:26.000 align:start position:0%
around the state is
 
00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
unfathomable what you really want to get
 
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
to with the caseload of 12 or whatever
 
00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
that lower number is
 
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:34.720 align:start position:0%
is the opportunity for our assessment
 
00:32:36.549 --> 00:32:36.559 align:start position:0%
workers for investigation workers to be
 
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
able to do more than simply
 
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
say yes abuse occurred or no it didn't
 
00:32:43.029 --> 00:32:43.039 align:start position:0%
but to actually start to problem solve
 
00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
with the family
 
00:32:45.509 --> 00:32:45.519 align:start position:0%
identify what their needs are meet their
 
00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
needs and actually within the context of
 
00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
these educational neglect cases that
 
00:32:51.509 --> 00:32:51.519 align:start position:0%
that representative wallner just raised
 
00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
um i'm getting great feedback from folks
 
00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:54.640 align:start position:0%
about what they're seeing there
 
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
those are those are complex cases not
 
00:32:58.950 --> 00:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
because they're abuse or neglect
 
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
but because the social workers have to
 
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
do a lot of work to problem solve and
 
00:33:03.509 --> 00:33:03.519 align:start position:0%
connect with different
 
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
different folks in the community to wrap
 
00:33:06.789 --> 00:33:06.799 align:start position:0%
around that family to make sure that
 
00:33:08.789 --> 00:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
that issue gets resolved
 
00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
but ideal child protection practice
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
allows for that
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
allows for caseworkers to do that and if
 
00:33:15.909 --> 00:33:15.919 align:start position:0%
they have a case load of 12 they can do
 
00:33:15.919 --> 00:33:16.230 align:start position:0%
they have a case load of 12 they can do
that

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
if they have a caseload of 40 which is
 
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
where we've been for most of my time
 
00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:20.070 align:start position:0%
where we've been for most of my time
here

00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:33:22.789 --> 00:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
it's impossible to do that so you do see
 
00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
this rapid reduction
 
00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
um certainly the reduced call volume
 
00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:27.919 align:start position:0%
from covert was part of this
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
but part of this is also that change
 
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
that we talked about at intake part of
 
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
this is the new positions that we've
 
00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
that we received in the last biennium
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
that we've hired that we've trained
 
00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
it takes a number of months to train
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
someone once they're hired before they
 
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
carry a case of this delay
 
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
but you do see this decrease really
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
starting you know back here
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
in 2019 um in the fall of 2019 right
 
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
after those first
 
00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
people were hired in july of 2019 um
 
00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
and then that decrease really continuing
 
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:55.919 align:start position:0%
to sustain and really speed up through
 
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
the springtime as folks were hired
 
00:33:59.590 --> 00:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
and now really has been sustained over
 
00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
the past couple months
 
00:34:03.190 --> 00:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
i do expect it's going to continue to
 
00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
improve i actually think
 
00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
that um if we maintain the current the
 
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
current staffing positions that
 
00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
eventually we will get to that target of
 
00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:12.310 align:start position:0%
eventually we will get to that target of
12

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
12
 
00:34:13.990 --> 00:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
we've got gotten to the point now where
 
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
the reductions are harder to come by
 
00:34:18.149 --> 00:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
in case load and when i say that that's
 
00:34:18.159 --> 00:34:19.109 align:start position:0%
in case load and when i say that that's
because

00:34:19.109 --> 00:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:34:20.869 --> 00:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
when we were up here there was this huge
 
00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
backlog right staff were triaging
 
00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
their who were they going to pay
 
00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
attention to on a given day and then
 
00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
things that were less risky by
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
definition were kind of being back
 
00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:30.069 align:start position:0%
definition were kind of being back
burned

00:34:30.069 --> 00:34:30.079 align:start position:0%
burned
 
00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
and weren't closing so a lot of this big
 
00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:33.919 align:start position:0%
number here is because of things that
 
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
are left open that really could have
 
00:34:36.629 --> 00:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
closed if people had the bandwidth to
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
close them
 
00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
we've now gotten through that problem
 
00:34:40.869 --> 00:34:40.879 align:start position:0%
which is where we are today
 
00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
this kind of status this kind of a
 
00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:44.149 align:start position:0%
this kind of status this kind of a
17-ish

00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
17-ish
 
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
number um and really pushing further
 
00:34:48.869 --> 00:34:48.879 align:start position:0%
down is going to require us to get the
 
00:34:50.069 --> 00:34:50.079 align:start position:0%
rest of these positions
 
00:34:53.349 --> 00:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
filled trained and carrying cases um
 
00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be as simple as kind
 
00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
of cleaning up the backlog which is what
 
00:34:57.430 --> 00:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of this
 
00:35:00.829 --> 00:35:00.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
representative waller so
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
um i mean i like that we
 
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
the caseload is declining um we seem to
 
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
be accomplishing what we set out to do
 
00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
but what bothers me is it it it's low
 
00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:17.190 align:start position:0%
but what bothers me is it it it's low
during

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
during
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
covid and you're anticipating that
 
00:35:23.349 --> 00:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
when children go back to school and
 
00:35:25.829 --> 00:35:25.839 align:start position:0%
they're out more into the community
 
00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
and um that those caseloads
 
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
will go back up does the budget account
 
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
for higher case loads but
 
00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
a 12 case load load for a worker
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
yeah so when we calculated the number of
 
00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
staff that we needed to
 
00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
to do both child protection assessments
 
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
which this is and then the next
 
00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
thing we're going to talk about is child
 
00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:55.040 align:start position:0%
protection family services
 
00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
that was based on data um at the start
 
00:36:00.069 --> 00:36:00.079 align:start position:0%
of the last biennium
 
00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
which was a lot higher than what we
 
00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
actually see right now during covet in
 
00:36:03.359 --> 00:36:03.750 align:start position:0%
actually see right now during covet in
which

00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
given the changes in practice that
 
00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
intake i would expect
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
to be able to absorb kind of any
 
00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:11.200 align:start position:0%
post-covet bump that we see i'm actually
 
00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
not sure that we're going to see a big
 
00:36:13.349 --> 00:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
post-covet bump
 
00:36:15.430 --> 00:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
because we've seen our call volume
 
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
really resumed to pretty close to
 
00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
typical levels in the past few months
 
00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
now the kids are even though they're not
 
00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
meeting in person they are back in
 
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
school a little bit more they're
 
00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
interacting with communities a little
 
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
bit more
 
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
so we've seen our call volume get pretty
 
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
close to normal even though not entirely
 
00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
there in the past couple months
 
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
so i do think that the that the
 
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
positions that are
 
00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
identified in the budget will allow us
 
00:36:40.310 --> 00:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
to get to the caseload standards of 12
 
00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:41.599 align:start position:0%
and 10 for family service that we're
 
00:36:43.349 --> 00:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
going to talk about next
 
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
there were some that were unfunded in
 
00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
the in the initial budget that i do
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
think are going to be necessary for us
 
00:36:49.589 --> 00:36:49.599 align:start position:0%
to achieve that goal
 
00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
i also believe that the governor sent a
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
letter yesterday within which he
 
00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
articulated uh support for funding those
 
00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:57.670 align:start position:0%
articulated uh support for funding those
positions

00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:36:59.349 --> 00:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
um going forward even though they
 
00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
weren't in the original
 
00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
proposal so you know i'm hopeful that we
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
see that resolved through the budget
 
00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:05.910 align:start position:0%
see that resolved through the budget
process

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:37:07.589 --> 00:37:07.599 align:start position:0%
and i do believe that if all those
 
00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
positions are funded and if we just keep
 
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
the hard work of trying to hire and
 
00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
train and keep people
 
00:37:14.069 --> 00:37:14.079 align:start position:0%
we will have the resources we need to
 
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
get there
 
00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
um just a follow-up um
 
00:37:23.349 --> 00:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
is that the 22 positions um are those 2
 
00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
is it 22 positions that are unfunded
 
00:37:26.950 --> 00:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
so all right are you anticipating
 
00:37:43.430 --> 00:37:43.440 align:start position:0%
good morning mr ribson um are you
 
00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:45.109 align:start position:0%
good morning mr ribson um are you
anticipating

00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
anticipating
 
00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
much change after we get past this comet
 
00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
i mean i think
 
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
the issue is probably that the cases are
 
00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
maybe more complicated
 
00:37:57.829 --> 00:37:57.839 align:start position:0%
um but are you anticipating more of a
 
00:37:58.790 --> 00:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
flat line
 
00:38:02.829 --> 00:38:02.839 align:start position:0%
for um like the end of the summer
 
00:38:06.069 --> 00:38:06.079 align:start position:0%
or the other comment i guess i would
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
make is
 
00:38:09.190 --> 00:38:09.200 align:start position:0%
one of the issues we had when we first
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
came into this with the last budget
 
00:38:13.430 --> 00:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
was that we you were having trouble with
 
00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
retention of staff
 
00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
because everyone was just so overwhelmed
 
00:38:19.109 --> 00:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
has that
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
gotten better and are you more able to
 
00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:23.200 align:start position:0%
keep the staff you have
 
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
thanks thank you yes um
 
00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
so i do i think what's what's a little
 
00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
unique about new hampshire compared to
 
00:38:33.109 --> 00:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
some of the other jurisdictions
 
00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
and this last chart kind of shows that i
 
00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
have other data that shows it better
 
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
but compared to other jurisdictions our
 
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
our number of calls coming to the
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
hotline and the number of new
 
00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:43.910 align:start position:0%
hotline and the number of new
assessments

00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
assessments
 
00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
we're on a huge upward swing prior to
 
00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:48.320 align:start position:0%
covid not based on anything related to
 
00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:49.109 align:start position:0%
covid not based on anything related to
covid

00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
covid
 
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
but based on what you see in many
 
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions when you get into a point
 
00:38:54.790 --> 00:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
um where you have a lot of a lot of
 
00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:55.430 align:start position:0%
um where you have a lot of a lot of
attention

00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
attention
 
00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
around high profile fatalities and a lot
 
00:38:59.750 --> 00:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
of risk-averse behavior
 
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
which leads to a lot of assessments and
 
00:39:03.750 --> 00:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes unnecessary assessments which
 
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
is why we
 
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
made that shifted intake that i spoke
 
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
about earlier
 
00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
so what i would anticipate is i
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
certainly would not anticipate a post
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
proven state getting any higher than our
 
00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
say state fiscal year 2019 which was a
 
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
record-setting year historically for us
 
00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of new assessments and when we
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
when we created the number of positions
 
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
that we needed
 
00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:26.560 align:start position:0%
in the last biennium that's the data we
 
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
were looking at so i do think
 
00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
again that the current number of
 
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
positions within the within the budget
 
00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
assuming the funding of those 22
 
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
um is appropriate and adequate to get us
 
00:39:37.910 --> 00:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
to the caseload standards that we all
 
00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:38.550 align:start position:0%
to the caseload standards that we all
want

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
want
 
00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
the other issue that you touch on i'm
 
00:39:41.829 --> 00:39:41.839 align:start position:0%
representative norgren and i'll talk
 
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
about a little bit more later
 
00:39:45.190 --> 00:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
around turnover we have seen improvement
 
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
there's data in the data book that does
 
00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:47.510 align:start position:0%
there's data in the data book that does
show

00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
show
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
um you know the turnover rate um
 
00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
shifting from about 20
 
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
to about 17 in terms of people leaving
 
00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
the agency
 
00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
that's still not a number i'm satisfied
 
00:39:58.470 --> 00:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
healthy organization of our size you
 
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
anticipate something like a 10
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
turnover rate i would anticipate seeing
 
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
that in the coming years i think the
 
00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
driving factors
 
00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
for turnover are a few um one of them is
 
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
um is case loads and people not feeling
 
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
that they can be successful in their
 
00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:16.950 align:start position:0%
that they can be successful in their
work

00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
um with caseloads going down i think
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
there's some more satisfaction around
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
that i think the other component of that
 
00:40:23.109 --> 00:40:23.119 align:start position:0%
that we're actively working on is
 
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
redesigning our services for families
 
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
that's an integral component to make
 
00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
sure that folks can be successful in
 
00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
their work which is why they stay
 
00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
right people who come into this work do
 
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
it because they want to help families
 
00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
and if they don't feel successful it's
 
00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
just too hard to bear
 
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
day in and day out when we have those
 
00:40:40.230 --> 00:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
services that we're redesigning totally
 
00:40:41.109 --> 00:40:41.119 align:start position:0%
in place
 
00:40:42.309 --> 00:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
i think people are going to feel even
 
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
better satisfaction from the job the
 
00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
other big thing is what we kind of call
 
00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:46.950 align:start position:0%
other big thing is what we kind of call
our

00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:40:48.309 --> 00:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
our safety culture work that we're
 
00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
actively engaged in and that's around
 
00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
creating an environment where folks feel
 
00:40:53.349 --> 00:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
safe and i don't just mean physical
 
00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
safety which is one component of it but
 
00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
i need psychological safety
 
00:40:59.670 --> 00:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
and support one big component that was
 
00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
funded in the last biennium which has
 
00:41:01.119 --> 00:41:01.990 align:start position:0%
funded in the last biennium which has
been

00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:04.880 align:start position:0%
amazing was the hiring of a clinical
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
person whose job it is to look for the
 
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
secondary trauma needs of staff and
 
00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:09.680 align:start position:0%
support staff
 
00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
around those issues right our staff see
 
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of really scary horrible things
 
00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
that can really you know haunt the
 
00:41:18.069 --> 00:41:18.079 align:start position:0%
person on any normal person
 
00:41:19.349 --> 00:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
and it's hard for them to stick it out
 
00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
without that type of support so
 
00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
that has been invaluable i'm really
 
00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
grateful that was provided in the last
 
00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:25.589 align:start position:0%
grateful that was provided in the last
biennium

00:41:25.589 --> 00:41:25.599 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
it's it's funded in the next biennium in
 
00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
the proposed budget i
 
00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
you know i i hope that it remains
 
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
through the legislative process
 
00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
it's been um it's been fabulous the
 
00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
other piece of that is really working
 
00:41:37.349 --> 00:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
around the culture to create what's kind
 
00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
of called psychological safety or an
 
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
environment where people can speak
 
00:41:42.309 --> 00:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
freely and openly about what their needs
 
00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
are what their fears are what their
 
00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
risks are
 
00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
not just about themselves and their work
 
00:41:47.829 --> 00:41:47.839 align:start position:0%
but about the families that they work
 
00:41:47.839 --> 00:41:48.470 align:start position:0%
but about the families that they work
with

00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
um and that's something that when you
 
00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
have a system like ours was a few years
 
00:41:53.829 --> 00:41:53.839 align:start position:0%
ago where it's
 
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
constantly under scrutiny people get
 
00:41:57.750 --> 00:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
very risk averse and get afraid to talk
 
00:41:58.790 --> 00:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
because they're afraid they're gonna get
 
00:41:59.670 --> 00:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
in trouble
 
00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
and changing that dynamic is is really
 
00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:03.109 align:start position:0%
and changing that dynamic is is really
imperative

00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
imperative
 
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
not just to satisfaction but also to
 
00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
making sure we get the right information
 
00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
to make the best
 
00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
decisions for kids and families so we've
 
00:42:12.069 --> 00:42:12.079 align:start position:0%
been actively working in that space as
 
00:42:12.079 --> 00:42:12.630 align:start position:0%
been actively working in that space as
well

00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
the new clinical person is a big part of
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
that team we have another role called a
 
00:42:17.349 --> 00:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
safety culture specialist who's part of
 
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
that team
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
and they're part of a national
 
00:42:20.309 --> 00:42:20.319 align:start position:0%
collaborative actually called the
 
00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:21.839 align:start position:0%
partnership on child safety which
 
00:42:21.839 --> 00:42:23.109 align:start position:0%
partnership on child safety which
includes

00:42:23.109 --> 00:42:23.119 align:start position:0%
includes
 
00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions from across the country
 
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
that really are focused on these issues
 
00:42:27.349 --> 00:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
and how do you make sure that you
 
00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
support your workforce appropriately
 
00:42:32.230 --> 00:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
to enable healthy decision making and
 
00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
good decision making for families
 
00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
so all that's to say is i do think it's
 
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
going to get better but it has
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
but we're not there yet so this is just
 
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
a yes or no question and maybe a
 
00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:43.990 align:start position:0%
a yes or no question and maybe a
conversation

00:42:43.990 --> 00:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
offline someday but you have a clinical
 
00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
psychologist who's providing
 
00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
you know sort of front line support to
 
00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
the employees
 
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
it's it sounds like that's very much of
 
00:42:57.589 --> 00:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
a eap
 
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
function and are you convinced
 
00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
that you need that to augment the
 
00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:05.190 align:start position:0%
that you need that to augment the
state's

00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
state's
 
00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
existing eap program
 
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
i am convinced that it's absolutely
 
00:43:13.349 --> 00:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
necessary yeah
 
00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
sounds a little redundant but you're
 
00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
able to justify the redundancy
 
00:43:21.270 --> 00:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
yeah i think it's i i think that there's
 
00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
a unique
 
00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
set of challenges that our staff face
 
00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
that are discrete
 
00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
from what most folks face now is it
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
possible to structure some of that
 
00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:29.829 align:start position:0%
possible to structure some of that
within

00:43:29.829 --> 00:43:29.839 align:start position:0%
within
 
00:43:31.829 --> 00:43:31.839 align:start position:0%
within the eap that eap is it's
 
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
currently structured
 
00:43:35.589 --> 00:43:35.599 align:start position:0%
and currently resource doesn't have the
 
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
bandwidth to meet that need for us where
 
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:40.079 align:start position:0%
this individual does
 
00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:49.200 align:start position:0%
okay so as the case moves on so as you
 
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
move beyond the assessment phase a
 
00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
number of situations
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
will be found where abuser neglect has
 
00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
occurred or where children and families
 
00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
are deemed to be at very high risk
 
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
and a higher the next level will open up
 
00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
a family service case is what we call
 
00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:03.510 align:start position:0%
a family service case is what we call
that

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly these are cases that go
 
00:44:07.349 --> 00:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
to court so where you saw the big
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
numbers on the prior slide about
 
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
assessments um that's you know obviously
 
00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
a much bigger number because
 
00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
few of those cases will reach this point
 
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
where they actually go to court
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
and where there's an open ongoing case
 
00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
the numbers that you see here on the
 
00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
green line
 
00:44:25.589 --> 00:44:25.599 align:start position:0%
um are the total number of family
 
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
service cases in the given year you do
 
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
see the growth
 
00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
and then kind of the the stability over
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
the past
 
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal year um what you also see here is
 
00:44:37.030 --> 00:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
the number of children
 
00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
served right there are more children in
 
00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
a case than one typically
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
right so you'll have the number of cases
 
00:44:43.270 --> 00:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
might be
 
00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
1500 but the number of children served
 
00:44:47.829 --> 00:44:47.839 align:start position:0%
you know is close to 3 000
 
00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
because you often have two or more
 
00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
children in a case
 
00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
so the other thing that this slide shows
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
in addition to the number of family
 
00:44:56.230 --> 00:44:56.240 align:start position:0%
service cases
 
00:44:57.910 --> 00:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
is the number of children who are being
 
00:44:59.910 --> 00:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
served in those cases the number of
 
00:45:01.109 --> 00:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
children who are being served in out of
 
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
home care
 
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
the number of children being served in
 
00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
in-home care and this has been a
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
priority for us in the past few years i
 
00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
think new hampshire had a practice
 
00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
of over-relying on family separation
 
00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
over relying on removing children from
 
00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:14.950 align:start position:0%
over relying on removing children from
homes

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
homes
 
00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
where it wasn't necessary to provide
 
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
supports and strength
 
00:45:19.829 --> 00:45:19.839 align:start position:0%
to those supports for those families to
 
00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
strengthen them and keep those kids safe
 
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
in their own homes
 
00:45:24.309 --> 00:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
so i'm happy to see the number of
 
00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
in-home um
 
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
cases you know higher than it was in
 
00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
those prior years
 
00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
and the number of kids who were out of
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
home care you know starting to tick down
 
00:45:35.270 --> 00:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
after you know growth year after year
 
00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
after year
 
00:45:39.829 --> 00:45:39.839 align:start position:0%
so what do you think um your your best
 
00:45:42.630 --> 00:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
case scenario is for this distribution
 
00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:45.850 align:start position:0%
of kids staying in their homes
 
00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:47.109 align:start position:0%
of kids staying in their homes
[Music]

00:45:47.109 --> 00:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
you know um i would like to see these
 
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
numbers flipped
 
00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
right i'd like to see more in home than
 
00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
out of home um
 
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
depending a lot of this depends on how
 
00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
you count it right so
 
00:45:59.349 --> 00:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
the way that we counted this work in new
 
00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
jersey we'd say 85 percent of our kids
 
00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
are at home
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
but that would be misleading because it
 
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
was also counting things like kids who
 
00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:07.520 align:start position:0%
were engaged in assessments
 
00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
who were being worked in their own homes
 
00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
or kids being engaged in something like
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
what we would call community-based
 
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
voluntary services here that i can talk
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
a little bit more about later
 
00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
so i don't think we'll get to something
 
00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
like that the way that we count this
 
00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
distribution in new hampshire
 
00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
um but i do think we can get to a point
 
00:46:23.670 --> 00:46:23.680 align:start position:0%
where we see these two bars flipped and
 
00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
that's what i would hope to see in the
 
00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
coming years
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
as our new services come on the line to
 
00:46:29.829 --> 00:46:29.839 align:start position:0%
better support kids at home
 
00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:37.829 --> 00:46:37.839 align:start position:0%
so this is the family service case loads
 
00:46:39.589 --> 00:46:39.599 align:start position:0%
our goal here is 10 the reason why the
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
goal here is 10 rather than 12 as it is
 
00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
for assessment is that
 
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
these are family service cases are
 
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
almost always in court
 
00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
these are the families that we have
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
identified are at high risk
 
00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
kids are either removed from home or
 
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
there's really really intensive work
 
00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
happening with those families in their
 
00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
own homes
 
00:46:58.710 --> 00:46:58.720 align:start position:0%
and just frankly the work is heavier on
 
00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
the family service caseload
 
00:47:01.829 --> 00:47:01.839 align:start position:0%
on an individual case than it would be
 
00:47:03.829 --> 00:47:03.839 align:start position:0%
on an assessment case load
 
00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:06.720 align:start position:0%
so the target here is 10. you do see
 
00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
that number you know as the number of
 
00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
kids in out of home care grew really was
 
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
popping around close to 20 and still
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
today is kind of bouncing around in this
 
00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
you know 13-14 range
 
00:47:20.069 --> 00:47:20.079 align:start position:0%
part of the reason why you've seen less
 
00:47:22.150 --> 00:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
decline here than you see on the other
 
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
chart is as i said before that other
 
00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:24.309 align:start position:0%
chart is as i said before that other
chart

00:47:24.309 --> 00:47:24.319 align:start position:0%
chart
 
00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
has had a lot of noise in it from
 
00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:27.200 align:start position:0%
overdue things and things that were just
 
00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
kind of on the back burner where
 
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
none of this work can be back burner
 
00:47:31.750 --> 00:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
because by definition all of these
 
00:47:33.349 --> 00:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
families are at high risk aren't deeply
 
00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
involved into the system
 
00:47:39.349 --> 00:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
so i think there's i do think that
 
00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
the as we continue to hire we do have
 
00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:44.240 align:start position:0%
the right staff load the right staffing
 
00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
to get down to
 
00:47:48.069 --> 00:47:48.079 align:start position:0%
the target of 10 um but we still see
 
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
that this is you know something that we
 
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
have to keep working at to get down to
 
00:47:52.309 --> 00:47:52.319 align:start position:0%
that number
 
00:47:53.910 --> 00:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
the red line on above is just the number
 
00:47:55.589 --> 00:47:55.599 align:start position:0%
of children
 
00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
your department is competent as in
 
00:48:05.589 --> 00:48:05.599 align:start position:0%
everyone might be
 
00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
you can't control the number of
 
00:48:11.589 --> 00:48:11.599 align:start position:0%
cases that go to the course because
 
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
that's driven by
 
00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
family dysfunction correct
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
so so you're reacting to something you
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
can't control i would think but it made
 
00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
it you made it sound like
 
00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
you can positively influence a reduction
 
00:48:26.069 --> 00:48:26.079 align:start position:0%
in that
 
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
number yes i don't get that
 
00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
yes but i think it is true that we can
 
00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
positively influence a reduction in that
 
00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:33.750 align:start position:0%
positively influence a reduction in that
number

00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:48:35.990 --> 00:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
and that is through being able to
 
00:48:38.069 --> 00:48:38.079 align:start position:0%
provide more preventative services up
 
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
front which we'll talk a little bit
 
00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
about later
 
00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:42.559 align:start position:0%
but if we're able to do things like the
 
00:48:44.069 --> 00:48:44.079 align:start position:0%
things that are currently underway for
 
00:48:44.079 --> 00:48:45.030 align:start position:0%
things that are currently underway for
example

00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:46.640 align:start position:0%
the system of care work in children's
 
00:48:48.069 --> 00:48:48.079 align:start position:0%
behavioral health
 
00:48:50.549 --> 00:48:50.559 align:start position:0%
the um the work that's expanding through
 
00:48:52.549 --> 00:48:52.559 align:start position:0%
family resource centers and family
 
00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
and the facilitating organization the
 
00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
work that's expanding through public
 
00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
health and community collaboration
 
00:48:59.910 --> 00:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
grants all of those things and and that
 
00:49:01.349 --> 00:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
work that we're doing at intake to try
 
00:49:03.190 --> 00:49:03.200 align:start position:0%
to direct families who are
 
00:49:05.030 --> 00:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
lower risk to a community resource
 
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
before they become high risk
 
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
all of those things will drive these
 
00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
numbers down over time and i've
 
00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
experienced that through my work in new
 
00:49:13.829 --> 00:49:13.839 align:start position:0%
jersey for the decade prior to coming
 
00:49:13.839 --> 00:49:14.470 align:start position:0%
jersey for the decade prior to coming
here

00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
but as we um as we built out those
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
supports for families
 
00:49:20.069 --> 00:49:20.079 align:start position:0%
the number of kids going into out of
 
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
home care plummeted
 
00:49:24.549 --> 00:49:24.559 align:start position:0%
from thousands a year to from you know
 
00:49:24.559 --> 00:49:25.030 align:start position:0%
from thousands a year to from you know
10

00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
10
 
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
over 10 000 a year to i think around 4
 
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
000 a year today
 
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
so i do think that you actually can
 
00:49:32.790 --> 00:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
positively impact these challenges
 
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
around family dysfunction but to do so
 
00:49:38.069 --> 00:49:38.079 align:start position:0%
you really need to think um much more
 
00:49:38.079 --> 00:49:38.950 align:start position:0%
you really need to think um much more
proactively

00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
proactively
 
00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
than the way a child protection system
 
00:49:42.309 --> 00:49:42.319 align:start position:0%
is typically designed right child
 
00:49:43.829 --> 00:49:43.839 align:start position:0%
protection is typically designed to be
 
00:49:43.839 --> 00:49:45.430 align:start position:0%
protection is typically designed to be
reactive

00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
reactive
 
00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:46.640 align:start position:0%
and you really need to work with our
 
00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
partners to be more proactive in order
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
so are you are you basing
 
00:50:01.109 --> 00:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
that projection on your anecdotal
 
00:50:01.119 --> 00:50:01.910 align:start position:0%
that projection on your anecdotal
experience

00:50:01.910 --> 00:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:04.079 align:start position:0%
or do you think there's peer-reviewed
 
00:50:04.079 --> 00:50:05.190 align:start position:0%
or do you think there's peer-reviewed
research

00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
research
 
00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
to indicate that systems of care in this
 
00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:09.030 align:start position:0%
to indicate that systems of care in this
area

00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
can be accountable for
 
00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
a reduction in cases in in court
 
00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not trying to get the difference
 
00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
between good
 
00:50:23.829 --> 00:50:23.839 align:start position:0%
theory good experience and good data
 
00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm not sure i'm not sure what the
 
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
where what the research is specifically
 
00:50:31.109 --> 00:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
on it what i can tell you
 
00:50:34.069 --> 00:50:34.079 align:start position:0%
is i worked in a system that built all
 
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
of these things around the time that i
 
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
started there 15 years ago
 
00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
and through the period of building all
 
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
those things we saw a rapid
 
00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
and sustained and still happening today
 
00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
decline of children entering out of home
 
00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:47.270 align:start position:0%
decline of children entering out of home
care

00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
care
 
00:50:49.829 --> 00:50:49.839 align:start position:0%
um and when i say rapid and sustained i
 
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
don't just mean
 
00:50:53.829 --> 00:50:53.839 align:start position:0%
you know a 10 reduction i mean from 12
 
00:50:53.839 --> 00:50:54.230 align:start position:0%
you know a 10 reduction i mean from 12
000

00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
000
 
00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
kids um to about 4
 
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
500 kids today in new jersey and the
 
00:51:03.190 --> 00:51:03.200 align:start position:0%
the change that happened was the
 
00:51:05.109 --> 00:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
investments in the system of care
 
00:51:06.549 --> 00:51:06.559 align:start position:0%
and the investments and other
 
00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
preventative supports in new jersey we
 
00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
call them family success centers here we
 
00:51:11.589 --> 00:51:11.599 align:start position:0%
call them family resource centers
 
00:51:13.109 --> 00:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
but those were really the two main
 
00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
things that we did to drive these
 
00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
numbers down
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
in addition to in addition to the work
 
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
around improving the services that are
 
00:51:20.549 --> 00:51:20.559 align:start position:0%
offered within
 
00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
the child protection agency itself that
 
00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
we're currently engaged in
 
00:51:31.109 --> 00:51:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
so this is the number this is just a
 
00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
different way to look at that same data
 
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
the number of children point in time the
 
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
last chart showed you kind of
 
00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
cumulatively over the year but at point
 
00:51:42.309 --> 00:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
in time so you can imagine on any given
 
00:51:42.319 --> 00:51:43.030 align:start position:0%
in time so you can imagine on any given
day

00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
day
 
00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
this is what you see um you know this
 
00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
can be it's helpful
 
00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
to think about it's also a little bit
 
00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
misleading because on one given day a
 
00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
number could be a little bit off this is
 
00:51:52.549 --> 00:51:52.559 align:start position:0%
just looking on the first day of the
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
reporting period
 
00:51:55.349 --> 00:51:55.359 align:start position:0%
but it does give you a sense of kind of
 
00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
on any given day you would expect
 
00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
you know about a thousand a thousand
 
00:52:02.230 --> 00:52:02.240 align:start position:0%
seventy kids who are out of home care
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
and child protection
 
00:52:05.829 --> 00:52:05.839 align:start position:0%
and about 500 or so kids who are in
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
in-home care and child protection
 
00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
we do see that rapid growth that
 
00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
occurred in out-of-home care that i
 
00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
talked about that really coincides with
 
00:52:17.109 --> 00:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
um what i think was was a lot of risk
 
00:52:17.119 --> 00:52:18.150 align:start position:0%
um what i think was was a lot of risk
aversion

00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
aversion
 
00:52:20.069 --> 00:52:20.079 align:start position:0%
being driven by the attention through
 
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
those high profile fatalities
 
00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:23.359 align:start position:0%
and then us finally being able to come
 
00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
over that hump and starting to stabilize
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
i'm not satisfied with this number this
 
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
1067 i think this can be a lot lower
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
than it is
 
00:52:31.589 --> 00:52:31.599 align:start position:0%
i think what's going to help us get a
 
00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
lot lower what it is is the work that
 
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
we're currently engaged in
 
00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
and redesigning the services that we
 
00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
provide to families um
 
00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
who are in the deep end of the system we
 
00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
can talk more about that a little bit
 
00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
so i have a quick anecdote to share with
 
00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
you and i
 
00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to figure out if this
 
00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
would uh if this kind of thing
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
affects your data um
 
00:52:57.270 --> 00:52:57.280 align:start position:0%
a friend of mine left his five-year-old
 
00:52:59.349 --> 00:52:59.359 align:start position:0%
son in the car for a few minutes
 
00:53:01.829 --> 00:53:01.839 align:start position:0%
he was sure assured of the guy the kid's
 
00:53:01.839 --> 00:53:03.190 align:start position:0%
he was sure assured of the guy the kid's
safety

00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
safety
 
00:53:05.829 --> 00:53:05.839 align:start position:0%
ran in ran out he says he was away from
 
00:53:07.829 --> 00:53:07.839 align:start position:0%
the car for five minutes
 
00:53:10.710 --> 00:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
somebody uh called the police department
 
00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
the police department went to his house
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
and and ask him some questions
 
00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
so so based on that scenario
 
00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
do you open a case for that it would be
 
00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
incredibly unlikely that if that's the
 
00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
only factor that we
 
00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
definitely wouldn't open a case right a
 
00:53:32.069 --> 00:53:32.079 align:start position:0%
family service case
 
00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
maybe an investigation could be open
 
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
based on you know based on that
 
00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:36.390 align:start position:0%
based on you know based on that
information

00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:53:38.309 --> 00:53:38.319 align:start position:0%
but the idea that that would then if
 
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
those are the only factors
 
00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
that that would move beyond the
 
00:53:42.790 --> 00:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
investigatory phase into a case
 
00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely not that doesn't reach
 
00:53:46.069 --> 00:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
that threshold
 
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
okay so mirror investigation doesn't
 
00:53:49.589 --> 00:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
constitute a case
 
00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
that's right yeah and if you look at the
 
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
distinction between right the numbers on
 
00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:53.030 align:start position:0%
distinction between right the numbers on
this

00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
page again right where you're talking
 
00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
about you know 1500 cases a year
 
00:53:59.910 --> 00:53:59.920 align:start position:0%
compared to the assessments where we're
 
00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:00.640 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
10 000 in the last year right that's the
 
00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
gap there that's what we're talking
 
00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:05.109 align:start position:0%
gap there that's what we're talking
about

00:54:05.109 --> 00:54:05.119 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:54:09.190 --> 00:54:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:11.829 --> 00:54:11.839 align:start position:0%
and i think there was another question
 
00:54:12.549 --> 00:54:12.559 align:start position:0%
uh there is
 
00:54:16.069 --> 00:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
uh representative weiler i was a little
 
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
confused between
 
00:54:19.829 --> 00:54:19.839 align:start position:0%
this chart on page 12 and then later on
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
the chart
 
00:54:24.390 --> 00:54:24.400 align:start position:0%
18. uh look very similar but
 
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
showing different numbers i think 18 is
 
00:54:28.630 --> 00:54:28.640 align:start position:0%
referring to juvenile justice so when we
 
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
get into that
 
00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
that place so these are more serious
 
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:33.670 align:start position:0%
that place so these are more serious
cases

00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
so this is talking about child
 
00:54:37.109 --> 00:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
protection cases this is where a child
 
00:54:37.119 --> 00:54:37.589 align:start position:0%
protection cases this is where a child
is

00:54:37.589 --> 00:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
potentially removed from their home
 
00:54:41.349 --> 00:54:41.359 align:start position:0%
because the parent
 
00:54:42.789 --> 00:54:42.799 align:start position:0%
because there's some concern about the
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
parent and the safety in the home
 
00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:46.400 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice cases are typically
 
00:54:49.829 --> 00:54:49.839 align:start position:0%
related to delinquency and or chins
 
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
which is you know child being a danger
 
00:54:53.109 --> 00:54:53.119 align:start position:0%
or risk
 
00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:56.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
i don't see any other questions okay
 
00:55:02.230 --> 00:55:02.240 align:start position:0%
so this is getting a little bit into the
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
questions that folks were asking around
 
00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
hiring retention and things like that um
 
00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
basically what you're seeing in this
 
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
chart is the net change in cpsw
 
00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
positions in a given month
 
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
um what we're doing here just so you
 
00:55:17.589 --> 00:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
understand is looking at this data in
 
00:55:19.109 --> 00:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
the next chart right so the
 
00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
this column the new higher column that's
 
00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
how many new new people were hired
 
00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
during that
 
00:55:27.430 --> 00:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
that month or that year how many people
 
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
left the agency during that year or that
 
00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:29.750 align:start position:0%
left the agency during that year or that
month

00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
month
 
00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
and how many promotions and the reason
 
00:55:33.349 --> 00:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
we include the promotions is because
 
00:55:35.109 --> 00:55:35.119 align:start position:0%
that does have an impact on the number
 
00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
of people providing services
 
00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
the positions that were added in the
 
00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:40.720 align:start position:0%
last biennium which we needed in order
 
00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:41.030 align:start position:0%
last biennium which we needed in order
to

00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
have more supervisors to supervise these
 
00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:44.870 align:start position:0%
have more supervisors to supervise these
staff

00:55:44.870 --> 00:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
staff
 
00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:46.720 align:start position:0%
those were typically hired from within
 
00:55:48.390 --> 00:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
right so that then creates a vacancy of
 
00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
the front line position
 
00:55:51.990 --> 00:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
that that needs to be filled but what
 
00:55:52.870 --> 00:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
this does show
 
00:55:55.589 --> 00:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
is that i think we are making progress
 
00:55:55.599 --> 00:55:55.910 align:start position:0%
is that i think we are making progress
um

00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:57.990 --> 00:55:58.000 align:start position:0%
every single month and getting closer to
 
00:55:59.510 --> 00:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
our goal of having uh
 
00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
full staffing we still do have you know
 
00:56:03.190 --> 00:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
last year was almost
 
00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
100 new hires which is you know a
 
00:56:07.349 --> 00:56:07.359 align:start position:0%
record-breaking year for us i
 
00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
i think i'm pretty proud of the work
 
00:56:11.030 --> 00:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
that was done to hire
 
00:56:13.349 --> 00:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
almost 100 new people last year we had
 
00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
40 people who left the agency outright
 
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
and 15 who were promoted to other spots
 
00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
so your net there would be
 
00:56:23.349 --> 00:56:23.359 align:start position:0%
you know a 55 out of 97. so you only
 
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
even though you hired 97 people your net
 
00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
gain was only you know 30 whatever that
 
00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
turns into when you do the math
 
00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
um but all that's to say is i
 
00:56:33.990 --> 00:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
i do think we are continuing to make
 
00:56:35.589 --> 00:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
progress and that we will be able to
 
00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
continue to fill all the positions
 
00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
so i look at this and i have about two
 
00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:41.200 align:start position:0%
or three questions for you
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
they're they're all kind of related so
 
00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:45.040 align:start position:0%
so to what extent
 
00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
are is your age force graying out and
 
00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
getting really close to retirement which
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
would then trigger
 
00:56:55.109 --> 00:56:55.119 align:start position:0%
yet more need to hire and to what extent
 
00:56:58.390 --> 00:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
is um the the skill set that you're
 
00:56:59.750 --> 00:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
looking to hire
 
00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
actually available in new hampshire
 
00:57:03.589 --> 00:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
already because we found in some other
 
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
areas in healthcare
 
00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh we need higher people that just don't
 
00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:08.549 align:start position:0%
uh we need higher people that just don't
exist

00:57:08.549 --> 00:57:08.559 align:start position:0%
exist
 
00:57:11.670 --> 00:57:11.680 align:start position:0%
so so yeah yeah i think two things i
 
00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
think the child protection workforce is
 
00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
actually relatively
 
00:57:16.549 --> 00:57:16.559 align:start position:0%
young at this point because there's been
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
so much turnover and so much new hiring
 
00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
um our real challenge around the child
 
00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
protection workforce is having enough
 
00:57:24.309 --> 00:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
seasoned staff to be mentors
 
00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
at this point the juvenile justice
 
00:57:29.109 --> 00:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
workforce is a different dynamic
 
00:57:30.549 --> 00:57:30.559 align:start position:0%
they're a much more seasoned workforce
 
00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
than our child protection workforce
 
00:57:35.109 --> 00:57:35.119 align:start position:0%
the other question around having the
 
00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:36.640 align:start position:0%
right folks in the state to hire i do
 
00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
think that's a challenge
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
i think not only are we looking to hire
 
00:57:41.349 --> 00:57:41.359 align:start position:0%
folks with social work
 
00:57:44.069 --> 00:57:44.079 align:start position:0%
either social workers or with skills
 
00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:45.839 align:start position:0%
comparable to social workers
 
00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
but there are a lot of other folks who
 
00:57:48.789 --> 00:57:48.799 align:start position:0%
are looking for those same type of skill
 
00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
sets right now
 
00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
so i think there is some scarcity in
 
00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
terms of folks
 
00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
i would say though with the fact that
 
00:57:57.030 --> 00:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
we've been able to hire 97 in the last
 
00:57:57.750 --> 00:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
year and
 
00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
probably received a thousand
 
00:58:00.950 --> 00:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
applications um
 
00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
that that i think we'll get there it's
 
00:58:05.510 --> 00:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
just gonna keep taking us time
 
00:58:10.069 --> 00:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
um yeah yeah that's it
 
00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
so to what extent um is are you having
 
00:58:15.829 --> 00:58:15.839 align:start position:0%
success or are you having challenges
 
00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
related to
 
00:58:20.789 --> 00:58:20.799 align:start position:0%
hiring a workforce that reflects the
 
00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
community they're serving
 
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
i you know i think that is a challenge
 
00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:26.069 align:start position:0%
i you know i think that is a challenge
um

00:58:26.069 --> 00:58:26.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:27.839 align:start position:0%
you know i don't have i don't have the
 
00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
demographic data on our workforce but
 
00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
our workforce
 
00:58:32.309 --> 00:58:32.319 align:start position:0%
probably particularly in certain parts
 
00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
of the state where we have
 
00:58:35.589 --> 00:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
uh greater latinx populations and
 
00:58:37.589 --> 00:58:37.599 align:start position:0%
greater african-american populations
 
00:58:38.870 --> 00:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
i don't think our workforce is
 
00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
particularly reflective of of those
 
00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:41.430 align:start position:0%
particularly reflective of of those
demographics

00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
demographics
 
00:58:43.349 --> 00:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
that's something that i'd like to like
 
00:58:44.549 --> 00:58:44.559 align:start position:0%
to see changed
 
00:58:47.910 --> 00:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
um i think it's really critical
 
00:58:49.990 --> 00:58:50.000 align:start position:0%
in all of these roles to hire people
 
00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
from their home communities though
 
00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
um and that also includes you know other
 
00:58:56.069 --> 00:58:56.079 align:start position:0%
than racial and ethnic
 
00:58:57.990 --> 00:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
um but you know having folks from the
 
00:58:59.190 --> 00:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
north country working in the north
 
00:59:00.710 --> 00:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
country makes a difference right
 
00:59:03.030 --> 00:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
it's uh having people who are reflective
 
00:59:04.230 --> 00:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
of their community and community
 
00:59:05.589 --> 00:59:05.599 align:start position:0%
values i think really helps in that
 
00:59:09.030 --> 00:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
community relation aspect of the work
 
00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
so representative walner has a question
 
00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
i just i just wondered
 
00:59:15.349 --> 00:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
what is your vacancy rate at this time
 
00:59:16.950 --> 00:59:16.960 align:start position:0%
and how many vacancies
 
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
do you have i think at this moment there
 
00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:20.390 align:start position:0%
do you have i think at this moment there
are

00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:22.799 align:start position:0%
30 i i'd have to double check it
 
00:59:24.870 --> 00:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the high 30s i believe of
 
00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
vacant cpsw positions
 
00:59:30.069 --> 00:59:30.079 align:start position:0%
okay and just to do a time check we've
 
00:59:31.349 --> 00:59:31.359 align:start position:0%
been talking for
 
00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
about an hour uh you're probably behind
 
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
where you thought you'd be at this point
 
00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:40.720 align:start position:0%
but um so if so just
 
00:59:43.109 --> 00:59:43.119 align:start position:0%
mentally if you could plan on on
 
00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
shutting down for
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
in about 25 minutes so that we can take
 
00:59:48.549 --> 00:59:48.559 align:start position:0%
a graceful break
 
00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh for lunch absolutely all right
 
00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
all right so now we're moving out of
 
00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:54.640 align:start position:0%
child protection and juvenile justice
 
00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
assuming no other
 
00:59:58.630 --> 00:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
representative your hand is still up do
 
01:00:00.309 --> 01:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up
 
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
no i'm sorry i just need to lower it
 
01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead i'm sorry
 
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
great so moving into juvenile justice
 
01:00:07.829 --> 01:00:07.839 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice
 
01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
works um around delinquency right so
 
01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
children commit acts
 
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
um are found to have committed acts that
 
01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:15.839 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
children in need of services chins they
 
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
can be both voluntary and involuntary
 
01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
the distinction here an involuntary
 
01:00:27.829 --> 01:00:27.839 align:start position:0%
chin's case typically involves
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
always involves court if the chin's case
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
is going to require a placement under
 
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire statute it must involve
 
01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:34.390 align:start position:0%
new hampshire statute it must involve
court

01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:00:35.829 --> 01:00:35.839 align:start position:0%
and there are standards that have to be
 
01:00:38.309 --> 01:00:38.319 align:start position:0%
met to um to qualify for what's called
 
01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
an involuntary chance largely around
 
01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
um the child's behaviors you know being
 
01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:45.430 align:start position:0%
um the child's behaviors you know being
dangerous

01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
dangerous
 
01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
to themselves to others to their
 
01:00:50.309 --> 01:00:50.319 align:start position:0%
families voluntary chins cases are often
 
01:00:52.789 --> 01:00:52.799 align:start position:0%
what we see in say a truancy matter so
 
01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
we talked earlier about the truancy
 
01:00:55.510 --> 01:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
cases that are coming in
 
01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
the way that that actually often plays
 
01:00:59.109 --> 01:00:59.119 align:start position:0%
out is rather than a court case
 
01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
involving truancy
 
01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
is we receive a call from a school
 
01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
saying this young person is
 
01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
truant we need to get services in place
 
01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
to try to get them reengaged
 
01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
in their community and in their school
 
01:01:11.109 --> 01:01:11.119 align:start position:0%
and we open up what's called a voluntary
 
01:01:12.630 --> 01:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
chins case to work with that family
 
01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
without taking them to court
 
01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes truancy cases do end up in
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
court but the vast majority of them end
 
01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
up in this voluntary chin space
 
01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
in home and in community services
 
01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
includes you know some youth and
 
01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
residential care often times when
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of times if the youth
 
01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
in juvenile justice ends up in out of
 
01:01:32.549 --> 01:01:32.559 align:start position:0%
home care
 
01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
they're going to a residential program
 
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
rather than a foster home
 
01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
support for permanency of youth that's
 
01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
really around if kids do get placed out
 
01:01:41.349 --> 01:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
of home trying to make sure that they
 
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
can return to their home communities or
 
01:01:44.069 --> 01:01:44.079 align:start position:0%
for some reason
 
01:01:45.430 --> 01:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
they can't return to their parents that
 
01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
we work with other family members that
 
01:01:48.470 --> 01:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
they can return to
 
01:01:51.829 --> 01:01:51.839 align:start position:0%
representative has a question yes
 
01:01:55.510 --> 01:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um do you keep statistics
 
01:01:58.950 --> 01:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
on the number of children who show up in
 
01:02:00.230 --> 01:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
the juvenile justice
 
01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
system who were at one point
 
01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
or another in the child protection
 
01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.750 align:start position:0%
or another in the child protection
system

01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:02:10.069 --> 01:02:10.079 align:start position:0%
i don't have that handy but we but we
 
01:02:11.910 --> 01:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
but we can pull that data and there is
 
01:02:14.549 --> 01:02:14.559 align:start position:0%
quite a bit of a crossover population
 
01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
okay i i would at some point like to see
 
01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:17.910 align:start position:0%
okay i i would at some point like to see
that

01:02:17.910 --> 01:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:19.510 --> 01:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
not not now but that would be
 
01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
interesting to see
 
01:02:23.029 --> 01:02:23.039 align:start position:0%
how many children have been involved who
 
01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
are moving from one system to the other
 
01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
yep and it sometimes moves either way
 
01:02:29.430 --> 01:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
you know something yes
 
01:02:31.029 --> 01:02:31.039 align:start position:0%
from one to the other and you know but
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:40.480 align:start position:0%
so here's juvenile justice services open
 
01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
cases by state fiscal year
 
01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
you do see some decline in new juvenile
 
01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
justice cases over the past couple years
 
01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
i do think state fiscal year 20
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
is anomalous because there was a huge
 
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
drop in juvenile justice cases when
 
01:02:55.190 --> 01:02:55.200 align:start position:0%
schools closed in march
 
01:02:57.670 --> 01:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
um more even more pronounced than we saw
 
01:03:00.069 --> 01:03:00.079 align:start position:0%
on the child protection side
 
01:03:01.589 --> 01:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
and i think that just speaks to an awful
 
01:03:03.270 --> 01:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
lot of the juvenile justice delinquency
 
01:03:04.549 --> 01:03:04.559 align:start position:0%
concerns really stem
 
01:03:06.789 --> 01:03:06.799 align:start position:0%
and originate out of issues happening
 
01:03:08.230 --> 01:03:08.240 align:start position:0%
within schools
 
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
um but we have seen some decline in the
 
01:03:13.109 --> 01:03:13.119 align:start position:0%
number of uh
 
01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
of um juvenile justice cases across the
 
01:03:17.829 --> 01:03:17.839 align:start position:0%
board over the past couple years
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
you do see here the dark blue you've
 
01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
served in placement out of their homes
 
01:03:23.109 --> 01:03:23.119 align:start position:0%
typically in residential programming and
 
01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
you've served in their homes
 
01:03:26.230 --> 01:03:26.240 align:start position:0%
i am glad to see that the number of
 
01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
youth served in their homes
 
01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
is a lot higher than the number of youth
 
01:03:31.109 --> 01:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
served out of their homes and
 
01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
actually if you look at the placement
 
01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559 align:start position:0%
numbers um some pretty good progress in
 
01:03:36.309 --> 01:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
the past couple years of trying to serve
 
01:03:38.069 --> 01:03:38.079 align:start position:0%
more kids in their own homes rather than
 
01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
serving them within
 
01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
a residential placement
 
01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
this is just breaking down that data by
 
01:03:48.069 --> 01:03:48.079 align:start position:0%
the case types
 
01:03:50.069 --> 01:03:50.079 align:start position:0%
um so we talked about delinquency right
 
01:03:53.109 --> 01:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
that's child commits an act that um
 
01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh you know would would be considered a
 
01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
criminal act whether in adult
 
01:03:59.910 --> 01:03:59.920 align:start position:0%
chins cases which are those cases that i
 
01:04:00.789 --> 01:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
was talking about child
 
01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
need of services the green are the
 
01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
chance pieces with court involvement
 
01:04:06.549 --> 01:04:06.559 align:start position:0%
so they often do incorporate some kind
 
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
of out of home
 
01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
residential placement chins without
 
01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
court which are those voluntary chins
 
01:04:12.870 --> 01:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
that i was talking about
 
01:04:14.390 --> 01:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
and you do see the number of delinquency
 
01:04:16.789 --> 01:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
cases dropping you do see your chins
 
01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:18.480 align:start position:0%
kind of you know growing or staying
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
steady um during this period
 
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
again i think state fiscal year 20 is
 
01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:24.880 align:start position:0%
anomalous and hard to really look at as
 
01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:25.510 align:start position:0%
anomalous and hard to really look at as
a

01:04:25.510 --> 01:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
as part of a trend because so much of
 
01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
that was impacted by the uh
 
01:04:31.029 --> 01:04:31.039 align:start position:0%
by the onset of covid um but even
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
through that you do see that the
 
01:04:36.069 --> 01:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
court chins cases uh maintained and
 
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
actually have had some slight growth
 
01:04:38.390 --> 01:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
over the past few
 
01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:47.349 --> 01:04:47.359 align:start position:0%
so these are juvenile justice case loads
 
01:04:48.870 --> 01:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
you know we're looking for about 15 here
 
01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
there's i don't put a target on this one
 
01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
because i
 
01:04:53.349 --> 01:04:53.359 align:start position:0%
i don't know of a good national standard
 
01:04:55.109 --> 01:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
for this so i just have
 
01:04:56.549 --> 01:04:56.559 align:start position:0%
i haven't identified the target but what
 
01:04:58.870 --> 01:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
we try to work towards is a case load of
 
01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:00.230 align:start position:0%
we try to work towards is a case load of
15.

01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
15.
 
01:05:02.069 --> 01:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
and you do see you know largely in jj
 
01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
they've been able to maintain around
 
01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
that number you just see it a little bit
 
01:05:04.480 --> 01:05:05.990 align:start position:0%
that number you just see it a little bit
lower

01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
lower
 
01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
over the past uh you know year or so
 
01:05:10.789 --> 01:05:10.799 align:start position:0%
you know in this coding period where the
 
01:05:16.309 --> 01:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:19.109 --> 01:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
this is a the chart that um that
 
01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
representative weiler was was raising
 
01:05:23.029 --> 01:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
talking about youth juvenile justice
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
services youth and open cases so on
 
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice
 
01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
the number of youth point in time so at
 
01:05:30.069 --> 01:05:30.079 align:start position:0%
the start of the reporting period so
 
01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
january 1st with an in-home juvenile
 
01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
justice case we actually see some growth
 
01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:35.109 align:start position:0%
justice case we actually see some growth
there

01:05:35.109 --> 01:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:05:37.109 --> 01:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
and really what's driving that growth is
 
01:05:38.950 --> 01:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
those truancy cases that we were talking
 
01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:39.510 align:start position:0%
those truancy cases that we were talking
about

01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
the voluntary shins truancy cases which
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
you don't see in this chart yet
 
01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
because this is state fiscal year data
 
01:05:48.630 --> 01:05:48.640 align:start position:0%
this only goes through july
 
01:05:50.789 --> 01:05:50.799 align:start position:0%
but you do see it in here where we went
 
01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
through january
 
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
um and you do see the the steady decline
 
01:05:57.029 --> 01:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
of use of residential care right 116 jj
 
01:05:57.990 --> 01:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
kids you know
 
01:05:59.910 --> 01:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
and out of home care which is which is
 
01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
good news that might be overstated as a
 
01:06:04.230 --> 01:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
trend a little bit right now because
 
01:06:05.910 --> 01:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
there are also restrictions through the
 
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
covet on getting children who
 
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
need higher levels of care into those
 
01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:11.670 align:start position:0%
need higher levels of care into those
programs

01:06:11.670 --> 01:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:06:13.029 --> 01:06:13.039 align:start position:0%
so some of that might be a little
 
01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
exaggerated in the data we'd have to see
 
01:06:18.549 --> 01:06:18.559 align:start position:0%
you know where that plays out as as we
 
01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
and then this is you know something that
 
01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
i'm really excited about i'm hopeful
 
01:06:30.309 --> 01:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
we're able to move forward with this
 
01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
some juvenile justice transformation
 
01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
work there is a senate bill which hasn't
 
01:06:35.029 --> 01:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
yet had a hearing
 
01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
senate bill 94 i put the plus there
 
01:06:37.750 --> 01:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
because there's some other things that
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
aren't related to that bill
 
01:06:41.349 --> 01:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
involved in this work but some folks
 
01:06:43.029 --> 01:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
might recall that
 
01:06:44.470 --> 01:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
you know maybe six months prior to
 
01:06:45.829 --> 01:06:45.839 align:start position:0%
clover that seems to be the way that we
 
01:06:48.309 --> 01:06:48.319 align:start position:0%
identify the world now
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
a group of us were awarded an
 
01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go down to georgetown
 
01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:53.190 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go down to georgetown
university

01:06:53.190 --> 01:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
university
 
01:06:54.630 --> 01:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
work with national experts around
 
01:06:56.549 --> 01:06:56.559 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice and
 
01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
think about how do we how do we
 
01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
re-envision our juvenile justice system
 
01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
to better meet the needs of youth the
 
01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
folks who went
 
01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
on that trip it was a multi-disciplinary
 
01:07:07.990 --> 01:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
group they're all identified here
 
01:07:09.910 --> 01:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
did include somebody from the public
 
01:07:11.589 --> 01:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
defender's office included our child
 
01:07:11.599 --> 01:07:12.309 align:start position:0%
defender's office included our child
advocate

01:07:12.309 --> 01:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
advocate
 
01:07:14.309 --> 01:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
some the diversion coordinator for the
 
01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
state judge ashley from the
 
01:07:19.029 --> 01:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
circuit courts as well as a prosecutor
 
01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
from manchester
 
01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
and through that work we've really
 
01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
identified two big broad goals that
 
01:07:26.309 --> 01:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
we're trying to achieve in the coming
 
01:07:26.319 --> 01:07:26.710 align:start position:0%
we're trying to achieve in the coming
years

01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
senate bill 14 helps with one of those
 
01:07:30.870 --> 01:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
big goals number one
 
01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
is offering the opportunity to have law
 
01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:34.390 align:start position:0%
is offering the opportunity to have law
enforcement

01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
refer youth to us for an assessment
 
01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
that's not going to be like a
 
01:07:39.270 --> 01:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
big child protection assessment but
 
01:07:40.829 --> 01:07:40.839 align:start position:0%
rather an assessment of the youth's
 
01:07:40.839 --> 01:07:42.150 align:start position:0%
rather an assessment of the youth's
needs

01:07:42.150 --> 01:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
needs
 
01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
and then being able to allow us to
 
01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
use that opportunity to connect those
 
01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
youth with the appropriate services in
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
the community before
 
01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
the petition ever has to be filed the
 
01:07:53.589 --> 01:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
idea being that if we divert kids at
 
01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
that point catch them earlier
 
01:07:57.190 --> 01:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
at that point we can divert them from
 
01:07:59.029 --> 01:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
the formal court systems drive down the
 
01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
number of formal court cases that are
 
01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:01.430 align:start position:0%
number of formal court cases that are
involved

01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
involved
 
01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
and get kids the help they need sooner
 
01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
which in the long run
 
01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
should both reduce the number of
 
01:08:09.109 --> 01:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
delinquency cases but also should reduce
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
the utilization of more intensive
 
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
services like residential programming
 
01:08:17.910 --> 01:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:19.590 --> 01:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
the other big piece of this is to look
 
01:08:21.189 --> 01:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
at the rules of probation they haven't
 
01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:22.640 align:start position:0%
really been updated in about 20 years
 
01:08:24.309 --> 01:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
this is not a statutory thing so that's
 
01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
where i put the plus up there it has to
 
01:08:25.679 --> 01:08:26.309 align:start position:0%
where i put the plus up there it has to
be

01:08:26.309 --> 01:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
94 plus that's not really a legislative
 
01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
thing but rather it's a court rule
 
01:08:33.189 --> 01:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
and looking at those rules in a way that
 
01:08:34.709 --> 01:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
we can think about how do we get from a
 
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
place where we have a
 
01:08:37.349 --> 01:08:37.359 align:start position:0%
cookie cutter approach which we
 
01:08:39.030 --> 01:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
currently do in our probation rules that
 
01:08:41.189 --> 01:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
every youth follows the same 20 rules
 
01:08:42.789 --> 01:08:42.799 align:start position:0%
to where we actually look at the needs
 
01:08:44.789 --> 01:08:44.799 align:start position:0%
of youth and identify what those needs
 
01:08:46.789 --> 01:08:46.799 align:start position:0%
are and tailor the rules to what the
 
01:08:50.149 --> 01:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
focus of their case plan is
 
01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
i'm really excited about this we do not
 
01:08:53.669 --> 01:08:53.679 align:start position:0%
anticipate needing additional staff for
 
01:08:53.679 --> 01:08:54.070 align:start position:0%
anticipate needing additional staff for
this

01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
what we're kind of counting on is the
 
01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
idea that if we
 
01:09:00.070 --> 01:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
um are able to slowly implement which
 
01:09:01.110 --> 01:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
senate bill 14
 
01:09:03.829 --> 01:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
is designed to do this process we can
 
01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
get some staff doing these assessments
 
01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
on the front end
 
01:09:08.229 --> 01:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
reducing the back-end delinquency
 
01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
caseload and basically use the existing
 
01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
workforce just in a different way to
 
01:09:15.269 --> 01:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
help reduce these case loads over time
 
01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
so that's something i'm really excited
 
01:09:19.030 --> 01:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
about i wanted to share here
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
can i throw a thought at you sure what
 
01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
what would
 
01:09:24.709 --> 01:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
what would be nice for future budgeting
 
01:09:24.719 --> 01:09:25.829 align:start position:0%
what would be nice for future budgeting
drills

01:09:25.829 --> 01:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
drills
 
01:09:29.269 --> 01:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
is to be able to um describe
 
01:09:32.550 --> 01:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
uh what what the manpower and support
 
01:09:35.110 --> 01:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
structure would look like to create this
 
01:09:37.269 --> 01:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
this new way of working with our
 
01:09:39.030 --> 01:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
juvenile cases
 
01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:41.759 align:start position:0%
and be able to articulate you know what
 
01:09:43.349 --> 01:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
the workload metrics are
 
01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
that drive the manpower analysis
 
01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
and then how you're going to measure
 
01:09:50.690 --> 01:09:50.700 align:start position:0%
effectiveness and quality
 
01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:52.070 align:start position:0%
effectiveness and quality
[Music]

01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
and and it's probably way early for you
 
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
to have any of that but
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
but i think any time we introduce a new
 
01:10:02.070 --> 01:10:02.080 align:start position:0%
program like this
 
01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
we it you know we we all want it to be a
 
01:10:09.590 --> 01:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
a huge success and want to buy into the
 
01:10:12.229 --> 01:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
the vision but i but we also need to
 
01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
come back and just do the math
 
01:10:18.229 --> 01:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
yep understood yeah we are still in the
 
01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
development phase on this
 
01:10:28.229 --> 01:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
so now we're moving into sysc and i
 
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
don't know whether you want me to
 
01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
continue you want to you wanted to go
 
01:10:36.630 --> 01:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
till noon so i can go through this now
 
01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
how many slides well this is a huge
 
01:10:38.560 --> 01:10:39.990 align:start position:0%
how many slides well this is a huge
topic

01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
topic
 
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
um so but breaking before noon i don't
 
01:10:45.669 --> 01:10:45.679 align:start position:0%
think helps the person that needed to
 
01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
leave at noon so
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
um let's go ahead and
 
01:10:54.310 --> 01:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
get started sure so sununu youth
 
01:10:55.189 --> 01:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
services center
 
01:10:57.510 --> 01:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
the last area that um was planning on
 
01:10:59.590 --> 01:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
talking about around dcyf
 
01:11:01.750 --> 01:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
services syc include you know creation
 
01:11:02.950 --> 01:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
of treatment plans clinical and
 
01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
psychiatric assessments educational and
 
01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
vocational planning and services
 
01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
medical dental nutritional services
 
01:11:11.910 --> 01:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
family engagement
 
01:11:14.950 --> 01:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
safety community reentry work
 
01:11:16.709 --> 01:11:16.719 align:start position:0%
recreational and experiential
 
01:11:18.550 --> 01:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
opportunities for youth
 
01:11:20.229 --> 01:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
and then reunification and permanency
 
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
planning for use essentially
 
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
sysc is as i said before the only
 
01:11:27.430 --> 01:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
facility in the state uh for detained
 
01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
and committed youth
 
01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
and um the services that have to go into
 
01:11:31.990 --> 01:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
that are
 
01:11:35.110 --> 01:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
are are pretty robust and comprehensive
 
01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
so mr ribson i'm gonna i'm gonna cheat a
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
and kind of just tell you you and i were
 
01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
trying to talk before
 
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
the session really got busy and i'll
 
01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:46.149 align:start position:0%
the session really got busy and i'll
just

01:11:46.149 --> 01:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
i'll just frame frame this now
 
01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
to kind of give you a sense of where i
 
01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
think a few of us are at
 
01:11:59.110 --> 01:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
and and that is that the sununu center
 
01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
was was built in a time with a different
 
01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:02.870 align:start position:0%
was was built in a time with a different
vision

01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
vision
 
01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
built with a different capacity and
 
01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
role in mind and since then
 
01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
the population has dwindled
 
01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
to small numbers 10 12 maybe 15 i don't
 
01:12:18.229 --> 01:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
know small numbers
 
01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
but because of the overhead associated
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
with having to provide
 
01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
services in a broad way
 
01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
it's become unbearably expensive on a
 
01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:30.950 align:start position:0%
it's become unbearably expensive on a
per

01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
per
 
01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
resident basis and and
 
01:12:36.149 --> 01:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
and i and i hate to just jump to the
 
01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
kind of almost the conclusion
 
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
but but where i think we would probably
 
01:12:43.910 --> 01:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
get the most
 
01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
bang for our buck and talking to you is
 
01:12:49.590 --> 01:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
if you just spoke uh more directly to
 
01:12:50.790 --> 01:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
the idea
 
01:12:52.950 --> 01:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
of what you think needs to happen to
 
01:12:55.030 --> 01:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
fundamentally transform
 
01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
the role and purpose of the sununu
 
01:12:59.270 --> 01:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
center and how that's reflected
 
01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
in your in the governor's budget request
 
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
and maybe those are two different things
 
01:13:05.350 --> 01:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
maybe the governor's budget request
 
01:13:07.189 --> 01:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
didn't anticipate
 
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
radical transformation but but
 
01:13:12.229 --> 01:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
that would just be great to have i think
 
01:13:14.149 --> 01:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
that conversation here
 
01:13:16.229 --> 01:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
instead of maybe the kind of the
 
01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
prepared this is the way things are
 
01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
story sure sure maybe i can give
 
01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
just a little bit of a view at the at
 
01:13:25.270 --> 01:13:25.280 align:start position:0%
some of the data because i think it
 
01:13:27.030 --> 01:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
informs that conversation but i think
 
01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's the right conversation to have
 
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
um so as you were saying right this data
 
01:13:32.630 --> 01:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
shows what the census of the facility is
 
01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
for the past few years and what we've
 
01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:34.950 align:start position:0%
for the past few years and what we've
seen

01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
seen
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
the dark line at the bottom is the
 
01:13:37.990 --> 01:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
average daily
 
01:13:40.229 --> 01:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
population for that state fiscal year
 
01:13:42.070 --> 01:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
last state fiscal year the average daily
 
01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
population was 16.9
 
01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
i haven't checked today yesterday we
 
01:13:47.669 --> 01:13:47.679 align:start position:0%
have 13 youth in the facility but
 
01:13:49.030 --> 01:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
there's some data that'll shoot that
 
01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
i'll show you in a minute that
 
01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
those numbers change pretty drastically
 
01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
um this also shows the number of total
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
youth committed youth you do see
 
01:14:00.630 --> 01:14:00.640 align:start position:0%
78 total youth throughout that period
 
01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
but 108 commit
 
01:14:04.310 --> 01:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
commitments or admissions rather which
 
01:14:06.390 --> 01:14:06.400 align:start position:0%
speaks to kind of the
 
01:14:08.149 --> 01:14:08.159 align:start position:0%
the revolving door that we unfortunately
 
01:14:10.630 --> 01:14:10.640 align:start position:0%
do see at sysc sometimes of youth
 
01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
being discharged and then coming right
 
01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:18.630 --> 01:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
this is the daily census across that
 
01:14:20.149 --> 01:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
period and the reason i wanted to share
 
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
this is that
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
the average daily census can be a little
 
01:14:24.870 --> 01:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
bit misleading
 
01:14:26.709 --> 01:14:26.719 align:start position:0%
sometimes i see folks cherry pick a
 
01:14:28.149 --> 01:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
certain date and say oh there were six
 
01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
there's only eight kids there
 
01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
those numbers do change pretty
 
01:14:33.350 --> 01:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
dramatically um
 
01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
certainly nowhere near the 144 that was
 
01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
built for
 
01:14:38.790 --> 01:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
but you know last july we were up into
 
01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
the high 20s
 
01:14:41.750 --> 01:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
i think we've kind of stabilized into
 
01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
what typically is more in this 15 or
 
01:14:44.950 --> 01:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
lower range
 
01:14:46.550 --> 01:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
you do have dates that it gets down even
 
01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
lower but then it can very rapidly jump
 
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
back up which all present some
 
01:14:51.669 --> 01:14:51.679 align:start position:0%
challenges around trying to
 
01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
operationalize and staff now getting to
 
01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:55.990 align:start position:0%
operationalize and staff now getting to
your

01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
a couple other points i just want to
 
01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
make sorry the um
 
01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we've seen with
 
01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
the ships at sysc is kind of what i
 
01:15:03.910 --> 01:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
would call an
 
01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
increase in acuity of the youth that
 
01:15:07.430 --> 01:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
were there so i think the changes that
 
01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
were made around admissions to sysc has
 
01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
led to far
 
01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
fewer youth but the youth that get there
 
01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
are youth that have um you know more
 
01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:16.149 align:start position:0%
are youth that have um you know more
challenges

01:15:16.149 --> 01:15:16.159 align:start position:0%
challenges
 
01:15:17.350 --> 01:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
you can see that play out in some of
 
01:15:18.630 --> 01:15:18.640 align:start position:0%
this right the average number of
 
01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:19.910 align:start position:0%
this right the average number of
petitions

01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
petitions
 
01:15:22.470 --> 01:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
that's delinquency petitions for a youth
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
in state fiscal year 16 was
 
01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
about you know a little less than 10.
 
01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
today it's a little closer to 15
 
01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
average petitions per youth um
 
01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
on the committed population the detained
 
01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
population relatively
 
01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
you know stable we did see some growth
 
01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
there from from about eight to about 11
 
01:15:40.070 --> 01:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
not quite as drastic as you see in the
 
01:15:43.590 --> 01:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:47.030 --> 01:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
um sorry one too far so i think to get
 
01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:47.430 align:start position:0%
um sorry one too far so i think to get
to

01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:15:49.430 --> 01:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh the points that you're making though
 
01:15:51.990 --> 01:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
there's a couple things i think
 
01:15:54.229 --> 01:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
reducing the census that sysc hasn't
 
01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
done as much to reduce the cost of the
 
01:15:57.270 --> 01:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
facility that people would have thought
 
01:15:58.229 --> 01:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
that it would
 
01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
and there's a couple reasons for that
 
01:16:01.350 --> 01:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
and it's not
 
01:16:03.910 --> 01:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
i don't think as much based on the
 
01:16:05.590 --> 01:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
overhead of the facility
 
01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
that is part of the contributing factor
 
01:16:09.669 --> 01:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
it's much more based on the needs of
 
01:16:12.149 --> 01:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
programming for that facility
 
01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
when we made these changes of the number
 
01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
of youth essentially we've reduced the
 
01:16:16.870 --> 01:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
economies of scale
 
01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:20.480 align:start position:0%
to such a point that that the individual
 
01:16:22.470 --> 01:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
youth there still require
 
01:16:25.030 --> 01:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
really high levels of care even though
 
01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
there are fewer of them
 
01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
um and it gets really complex um
 
01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
and some of this it's unfortunate we're
 
01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
having this meeting before the i think
 
01:16:35.189 --> 01:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
the next joint fiscal meeting the
 
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
legislative budget assistant is putting
 
01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:37.270 align:start position:0%
legislative budget assistant is putting
out

01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
an audit of syse which starts to talk
 
01:16:41.030 --> 01:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
through some of this stuff
 
01:16:44.149 --> 01:16:44.159 align:start position:0%
um from somebody other than myself um
 
01:16:45.669 --> 01:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
so it'd be helpful for you all to have
 
01:16:48.229 --> 01:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
that but in a few weeks you will
 
01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:50.640 align:start position:0%
um but part of what we see there that's
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
really challenging
 
01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
is a lot of the youth um have different
 
01:16:56.630 --> 01:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
programming needs and have to be kind of
 
01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:57.110 align:start position:0%
programming needs and have to be kind of
set

01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
set
 
01:16:59.030 --> 01:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
on separate units and things like that
 
01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
that requires additional staffing
 
01:17:04.310 --> 01:17:04.320 align:start position:0%
so for example if we have a female in
 
01:17:06.470 --> 01:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
the facility which we often do
 
01:17:08.229 --> 01:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
often it's just one sometimes it's two
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
or three that
 
01:17:11.189 --> 01:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
female requires a separate unit that
 
01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
unit requires separate staff
 
01:17:17.350 --> 01:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
we generally maintain two male units
 
01:17:19.030 --> 01:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
um we really can't get less than two
 
01:17:20.709 --> 01:17:20.719 align:start position:0%
male units regardless of how many youth
 
01:17:22.310 --> 01:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
are in the building because it's very
 
01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:23.189 align:start position:0%
are in the building because it's very
common

01:17:23.189 --> 01:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
common
 
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
that the males in the facility have a
 
01:17:26.390 --> 01:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
court order that they have to be kept
 
01:17:28.149 --> 01:17:28.159 align:start position:0%
separately because they either have some
 
01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
challenges outside with each other you
 
01:17:32.229 --> 01:17:32.239 align:start position:0%
know um you know what what some folks
 
01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
might say is gang involvement viable
 
01:17:35.590 --> 01:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
gang involvement or some other type of
 
01:17:37.590 --> 01:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
maybe they were involved in a common
 
01:17:39.669 --> 01:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
um act of delinquency and the
 
01:17:41.110 --> 01:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
prosecutors in the court order that
 
01:17:42.390 --> 01:17:42.400 align:start position:0%
they'd be kept separate
 
01:17:44.229 --> 01:17:44.239 align:start position:0%
while they're within the facility that
 
01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
requires additional staffing
 
01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
during the period of covid we've had to
 
01:17:49.990 --> 01:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
maintain quarantine and isolation units
 
01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
which require additional staffing um we
 
01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:53.430 align:start position:0%
which require additional staffing um we
will

01:17:53.430 --> 01:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
it's not uncommon to have a youth who's
 
01:17:56.950 --> 01:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
sick has to be in the infirmary
 
01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
we need staffing with them 24 7.
 
01:18:02.070 --> 01:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
lots of the youth that we're serving
 
01:18:04.229 --> 01:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
today have really intense needs
 
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
and require one-to-one support so all of
 
01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
that has added up to a situation that
 
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
when you had
 
01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
50 kids there it kind of came out in the
 
01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
wash but now that the majority of kids
 
01:18:16.229 --> 01:18:16.239 align:start position:0%
there have these unique needs that
 
01:18:18.149 --> 01:18:18.159 align:start position:0%
require additional support
 
01:18:22.709 --> 01:18:22.719 align:start position:0%
it gets the cost per child increases
 
01:18:24.709 --> 01:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
the other things i think are really
 
01:18:25.990 --> 01:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
substantial there is
 
01:18:29.350 --> 01:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
the programming right the um we offer a
 
01:18:31.030 --> 01:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
full service school there which i think
 
01:18:32.470 --> 01:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
is imperative for these youth many of
 
01:18:34.229 --> 01:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
the youth who go there catch up on their
 
01:18:37.590 --> 01:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
education are able to return back to
 
01:18:39.030 --> 01:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
school with more credits than they
 
01:18:43.350 --> 01:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
had ever had to get towards graduation
 
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
but operating a full-scale school for
 
01:18:47.430 --> 01:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:18:50.070 --> 01:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
15 youth is you know much less efficient
 
01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:52.560 align:start position:0%
than operating a full-scale school for
 
01:18:54.870 --> 01:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
60 youth the education program has been
 
01:18:56.550 --> 01:18:56.560 align:start position:0%
cut back in recent years but
 
01:18:58.709 --> 01:18:58.719 align:start position:0%
without compromising the subject matter
 
01:19:00.310 --> 01:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
that's taught it's hard to cut it back
 
01:19:01.830 --> 01:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
much further
 
01:19:03.750 --> 01:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
nursing that's available 24 7 within the
 
01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
facility you know when you're talking
 
01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
about serving 60 youth that cost
 
01:19:07.990 --> 01:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem so high but when you're
 
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
talking about serving 10 to 15
 
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
those costs add up i think all this is
 
01:19:13.990 --> 01:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
to say that the real
 
01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
cost of sysc is the staffing cost
 
01:19:19.590 --> 01:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
um and second cost that would continue
 
01:19:22.229 --> 01:19:22.239 align:start position:0%
even in a smaller building
 
01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
so i think where that leaves us is in a
 
01:19:26.630 --> 01:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
place where
 
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
the state needs to make a couple
 
01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:30.229 align:start position:0%
the state needs to make a couple
decisions

01:19:30.229 --> 01:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
01:19:33.189 --> 01:19:33.199 align:start position:0%
should there be a secured facility in
 
01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:19:36.550 --> 01:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
i think it's hard to say that you would
 
01:19:38.470 --> 01:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
have zero options
 
01:19:40.149 --> 01:19:40.159 align:start position:0%
for secured facility for youth in the
 
01:19:41.669 --> 01:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
um we've had multiple kids who have
 
01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
killed people since i've been in this
 
01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:46.070 align:start position:0%
killed people since i've been in this
state

01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:19:47.830 --> 01:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
um i'm not sure what we would do with
 
01:19:50.070 --> 01:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
those kids in a situation like that
 
01:19:51.189 --> 01:19:51.199 align:start position:0%
kids who have committed some other
 
01:19:54.070 --> 01:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
really um horrific crimes that i
 
01:19:55.510 --> 01:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know what we would do with those
 
01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
kids if we did not have a facility
 
01:19:59.430 --> 01:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
so if that's the decision that's made
 
01:20:01.189 --> 01:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
that we need a different facility
 
01:20:02.550 --> 01:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
then i think the question is to think
 
01:20:04.310 --> 01:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
about when do we decide
 
01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
what that facility is certainly we can
 
01:20:08.629 --> 01:20:08.639 align:start position:0%
make that decision now
 
01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
about how to move into a new facility i
 
01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
do think that there are so many things
 
01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:13.350 align:start position:0%
do think that there are so many things
happening

01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:20:15.270 --> 01:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
external to the facility that the data
 
01:20:17.430 --> 01:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
today is not accurate as to what the
 
01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
future need is going to be
 
01:20:20.629 --> 01:20:20.639 align:start position:0%
and we would run the risk of building
 
01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
something bigger than what the future
 
01:20:23.030 --> 01:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
need is
 
01:20:24.709 --> 01:20:24.719 align:start position:0%
if i was to be asked today how big of a
 
01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
facility to build based on the current
 
01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:27.430 align:start position:0%
facility to build based on the current
data

01:20:27.430 --> 01:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
i'd look at the last year and say at our
 
01:20:30.709 --> 01:20:30.719 align:start position:0%
peak we needed 27 beds so
 
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
we need to build to our p but in a
 
01:20:34.390 --> 01:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
couple years as the system of care is
 
01:20:35.350 --> 01:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
rolled out
 
01:20:38.950 --> 01:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
as the um as the jj transformation work
 
01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:39.510 align:start position:0%
as the um as the jj transformation work
occurs

01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
occurs
 
01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
as the new services are put online like
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
multi-systemic therapy that we're going
 
01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
to talk about in a minute
 
01:20:47.189 --> 01:20:47.199 align:start position:0%
um we might find that that number is way
 
01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
too high
 
01:20:49.750 --> 01:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
and then we once again build a facility
 
01:20:51.510 --> 01:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
that's too big for our needs
 
01:20:54.310 --> 01:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
so i think it's clear that the state
 
01:20:55.990 --> 01:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
needs to think about what is next in
 
01:20:59.270 --> 01:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
terms of a secured facility
 
01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
i think the question of what that
 
01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
facility should be how large that
 
01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
facility should be and when is the right
 
01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
time to make that decision based on the
 
01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:06.870 align:start position:0%
time to make that decision based on the
data

01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:13.990 --> 01:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for that wonderful summary uh
 
01:21:14.709 --> 01:21:14.719 align:start position:0%
we have
 
01:21:16.470 --> 01:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
just a few minutes and there are three
 
01:21:18.070 --> 01:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
reps with their hands up and
 
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
so i'm gonna i'm gonna propose uh
 
01:21:23.750 --> 01:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
to the to the committee members with
 
01:21:25.110 --> 01:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
their hands up
 
01:21:28.149 --> 01:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
um if you if you think the answer may be
 
01:21:28.709 --> 01:21:28.719 align:start position:0%
a long
 
01:21:31.189 --> 01:21:31.199 align:start position:0%
involved one would would you just simply
 
01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
state the question
 
01:21:35.110 --> 01:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
and and we'll get the answer after lunch
 
01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
that way
 
01:21:37.990 --> 01:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
mr ribson can think about the answer a
 
01:21:38.629 --> 01:21:38.639 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
01:21:42.070 --> 01:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh if it's a short data question uh
 
01:21:43.910 --> 01:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
you know let's we can just close it out
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
right here but
 
01:21:47.669 --> 01:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
if it if it's going to take much time
 
01:21:49.669 --> 01:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
let's postpone it so that we can
 
01:21:52.390 --> 01:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
break for lunch on time so
 
01:21:53.990 --> 01:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative weiler you had your hand
 
01:21:55.030 --> 01:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
up first i believe
 
01:21:56.709 --> 01:21:56.719 align:start position:0%
followed by representative nordgren and
 
01:21:59.669 --> 01:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:02.229 --> 01:22:02.239 align:start position:0%
mr chair i have one with short answer
 
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
difference between committed and
 
01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:05.910 align:start position:0%
difference between committed and
detained

01:22:05.910 --> 01:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
detained
 
01:22:07.750 --> 01:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
committed youth are they have gone
 
01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:08.950 align:start position:0%
committed youth are they have gone
through

01:22:08.950 --> 01:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:22:10.870 --> 01:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
the process in the court has found true
 
01:22:12.629 --> 01:22:12.639 align:start position:0%
that they have committed the act
 
01:22:14.229 --> 01:22:14.239 align:start position:0%
it might be through a trial or maybe
 
01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
through a plea agreement but the court
 
01:22:17.270 --> 01:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
has found true that whatever act they're
 
01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
alleged to have committed
 
01:22:21.669 --> 01:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
had indeed occurred detained is when a
 
01:22:23.430 --> 01:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
youth is immediately
 
01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
picked up after some type of event and
 
01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
they're put there oftentimes
 
01:22:29.990 --> 01:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
short term pending court decision about
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
whether to keep them in detention
 
01:22:32.950 --> 01:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
or whether to return them to the
 
01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
community pending you know further court
 
01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:37.189 align:start position:0%
community pending you know further court
activity

01:22:37.189 --> 01:22:37.199 align:start position:0%
activity
 
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
and the question to think of a little
 
01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
longer um
 
01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
if we could get economies of scale and
 
01:22:45.030 --> 01:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
we can't get economies of scale either
 
01:22:46.149 --> 01:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
we would
 
01:22:48.149 --> 01:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
send these youth out of state to
 
01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
someplace else even if it were a couple
 
01:22:51.189 --> 01:22:51.199 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand per
 
01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
youth it would still be cheaper than
 
01:22:54.229 --> 01:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
what we're spending or
 
01:22:56.709 --> 01:22:56.719 align:start position:0%
we bring some in from other states so we
 
01:22:58.310 --> 01:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
have a little more economy of scale
 
01:22:58.320 --> 01:22:59.110 align:start position:0%
have a little more economy of scale
that's

01:22:59.110 --> 01:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:23:00.629 --> 01:23:00.639 align:start position:0%
and that's the long question we'll talk
 
01:23:02.709 --> 01:23:02.719 align:start position:0%
to that later thank you
 
01:23:04.149 --> 01:23:04.159 align:start position:0%
thank you representative weiler for
 
01:23:05.830 --> 01:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
framing it that way
 
01:23:09.430 --> 01:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
representative norgren yes thank you
 
01:23:12.310 --> 01:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
representative weiler part of my
 
01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:13.270 align:start position:0%
representative weiler part of my
question

01:23:13.270 --> 01:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
is how many uh children do we have
 
01:23:19.510 --> 01:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
out of state now i know we've sometimes
 
01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
said them in vermont
 
01:23:23.910 --> 01:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
we've had them way over in ohio um so
 
01:23:25.350 --> 01:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
maybe you could just give us a little
 
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
background on that
 
01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
when you have a chance sure i mean
 
01:23:31.189 --> 01:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
that's that could be a quick one
 
01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
um i i don't have the exact date in
 
01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
front of me but last time i looked it
 
01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
was about 70 kids
 
01:23:38.470 --> 01:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
across all of dcyf who were placed out
 
01:23:39.590 --> 01:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
of state somewhere
 
01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of those kids are right over the
 
01:23:42.709 --> 01:23:42.719 align:start position:0%
border though um the number of kids that
 
01:23:44.149 --> 01:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
are far away is typically somewhere
 
01:23:44.159 --> 01:23:44.550 align:start position:0%
are far away is typically somewhere
around

01:23:44.550 --> 01:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
10 or so i can try to circle back during
 
01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
the break and get
 
01:23:51.990 --> 01:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
get exact numbers out of today thank you
 
01:23:55.510 --> 01:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
representative uh my question is
 
01:23:57.830 --> 01:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
sort of the opposite of there is how
 
01:23:59.350 --> 01:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
many children
 
01:24:02.550 --> 01:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
do we have in these numbers who are from
 
01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
out of state
 
01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
if any yeah right now there are no
 
01:24:07.830 --> 01:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
out-of-state kids at
 
01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
or there's no vermont kids there were a
 
01:24:10.790 --> 01:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
couple i have to double back there were
 
01:24:11.990 --> 01:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
a couple
 
01:24:13.510 --> 01:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
kids from another state who committed an
 
01:24:15.990 --> 01:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
act in new hampshire who were at syse
 
01:24:17.270 --> 01:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure if they're still there
 
01:24:18.629 --> 01:24:18.639 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to have to double check on
 
01:24:19.669 --> 01:24:19.679 align:start position:0%
those but there are
 
01:24:20.950 --> 01:24:20.960 align:start position:0%
i think part of your question is around
 
01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
the vermont contract and right now there
 
01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
are no kids
 
01:24:25.030 --> 01:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
placed based on acts that have occurred
 
01:24:26.629 --> 01:24:26.639 align:start position:0%
out of state okay
 
01:24:28.629 --> 01:24:28.639 align:start position:0%
thank you and my other question this one
 
01:24:32.709 --> 01:24:32.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:35.910 --> 01:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
when children come into the facility
 
01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
or into the into the juvenile justice
 
01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:39.189 align:start position:0%
or into the into the juvenile justice
system

01:24:39.189 --> 01:24:39.199 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:24:43.030 --> 01:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
are you doing an assessment to
 
01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
be sure that they are in the appropriate
 
01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
the appropriate setting i i particularly
 
01:24:51.030 --> 01:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
was thinking about
 
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
the girls and you were saying that um
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
you have to have a whole
 
01:24:57.510 --> 01:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
unit set aside for the girls and i think
 
01:24:58.790 --> 01:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
in previous years
 
01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
we have talked about trying to contract
 
01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:02.870 align:start position:0%
we have talked about trying to contract
um

01:25:02.870 --> 01:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
with um existing other programs
 
01:25:09.830 --> 01:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
to take the gir to have the girls in
 
01:25:13.030 --> 01:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
other programs and not not at the uh
 
01:25:15.430 --> 01:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
at the sununu center which would mean
 
01:25:17.110 --> 01:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
that you would have one unit that you
 
01:25:18.709 --> 01:25:18.719 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to run have we looked at
 
01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff
 
01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
yeah there let's uh let's defer the
 
01:25:25.350 --> 01:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
answer and then you can think about it
 
01:25:28.950 --> 01:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
thank you and that that brings us to
 
01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
11 55 are there any other questions to
 
01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:32.390 align:start position:0%
11 55 are there any other questions to
be

01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:25:37.270 --> 01:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
erased before uh lunch break
 
01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not seeing any so
 
01:25:43.830 --> 01:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
so i uh i want to put us into recess
 
01:25:50.629 --> 01:25:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:54.149 --> 01:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
that'd be great finish at 3
 
01:25:57.270 --> 01:25:57.280 align:start position:0%
15. so if if
 
01:25:59.430 --> 01:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
we quit interrupting you and you just
 
01:26:01.830 --> 01:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
said what you wanted to say
 
01:26:05.350 --> 01:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
how how long do you need um
 
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
my presentation is only a handful of
 
01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
additional slides probably
 
01:26:11.510 --> 01:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
you know 30 minutes but then there's the
 
01:26:13.270 --> 01:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
budget stuff that that karen will take
 
01:26:14.709 --> 01:26:14.719 align:start position:0%
the lead on and i'm not sure how to
 
01:26:20.629 --> 01:26:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:23.669 --> 01:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
we're gonna we're gonna be shut down by
 
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
3 15.
 
01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
okay so we're now out of recess are we
 
01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:33.350 align:start position:0%
okay so we're now out of recess are we
recording

01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:36.390 --> 01:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
yes you are okay
 
01:26:39.430 --> 01:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
so so uh division three finance has
 
01:26:42.550 --> 01:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
come back from its recess for lunch
 
01:26:44.790 --> 01:26:44.800 align:start position:0%
before lunch mr ripson was asked some
 
01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
questions he's had a little bit of time
 
01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:47.679 align:start position:0%
to think about him
 
01:26:51.350 --> 01:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna turn the floor over to him to
 
01:26:54.950 --> 01:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:56.790 --> 01:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
great thank you again for the record joe
 
01:26:59.750 --> 01:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
ripsom director dcyf in my office alone
 
01:27:02.790 --> 01:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
a one of the i'll take one of the easier
 
01:27:06.149 --> 01:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
questions first it's just uh
 
01:27:08.550 --> 01:27:08.560 align:start position:0%
some data representative nordgren asked
 
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
for the specific number of youth who are
 
01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
currently out of state
 
01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
um there are currently 74 youth place
 
01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
out of state
 
01:27:19.030 --> 01:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
of those 67 are in neighboring states
 
01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up representative
 
01:27:28.229 --> 01:27:28.239 align:start position:0%
now that you know the data
 
01:27:31.510 --> 01:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
yeah could you thank you
 
01:27:36.149 --> 01:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
could you clarify that number of 70
 
01:27:39.030 --> 01:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
um it's 74 total out of state 70 was my
 
01:27:40.950 --> 01:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
guess earlier but the actual number
 
01:27:44.709 --> 01:27:44.719 align:start position:0%
is 74 out of state of those 67 are in
 
01:27:46.229 --> 01:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
our neighboring states
 
01:27:47.830 --> 01:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
which you know we have a lot of kids
 
01:27:49.189 --> 01:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
right over the border in vermont
 
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and maine
 
01:27:53.030 --> 01:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
and seven are placed further away than
 
01:27:54.950 --> 01:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
our neighboring states
 
01:27:58.629 --> 01:27:58.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:01.990 --> 01:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
all right great way to start and then we
 
01:28:03.669 --> 01:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
had a question
 
01:28:07.990 --> 01:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
um we had a question regarding
 
01:28:11.430 --> 01:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh you know whether whether an option is
 
01:28:13.030 --> 01:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
to think about sending kids
 
01:28:15.910 --> 01:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
out of new hampshire who are at sysc or
 
01:28:17.910 --> 01:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
bringing youth into new hampshire into
 
01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:19.270 align:start position:0%
bringing youth into new hampshire into
sysc

01:28:19.270 --> 01:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
sysc
 
01:28:20.950 --> 01:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
um i think those are things that could
 
01:28:22.870 --> 01:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
be explored i think there's a
 
01:28:24.550 --> 01:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
there would be a significant challenge
 
01:28:26.629 --> 01:28:26.639 align:start position:0%
around sending kids out
 
01:28:29.669 --> 01:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
for a couple reasons um one
 
01:28:31.350 --> 01:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
personally programmatically i'm not
 
01:28:33.110 --> 01:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
thrilled with the facilities in our
 
01:28:34.070 --> 01:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
neighboring states
 
01:28:36.070 --> 01:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
um i'm i'm much more comfortable with
 
01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:37.510 align:start position:0%
um i'm i'm much more comfortable with
syse

01:28:37.510 --> 01:28:37.520 align:start position:0%
syse
 
01:28:39.110 --> 01:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry my phone just started talking
 
01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
to me um
 
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
second uh for purposes of detention
 
01:28:46.550 --> 01:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
which tends to be an immediate need and
 
01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
an immediate placement need
 
01:28:50.070 --> 01:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
um traveling out of state could pose a
 
01:28:52.149 --> 01:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
significant challenge and hardship
 
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
to law enforcement and folks um
 
01:28:58.629 --> 01:28:58.639 align:start position:0%
the alternative of um
 
01:29:00.550 --> 01:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
serving kids within syse from other
 
01:29:02.149 --> 01:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
states we haven't really robustly
 
01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
explored that
 
01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
as i alluded to earlier in response to
 
01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
one of representative ulner's questions
 
01:29:09.590 --> 01:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
we do currently have a contract with
 
01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
vermont to serve some of their kids
 
01:29:15.030 --> 01:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
um vermont had closed their their sole
 
01:29:17.350 --> 01:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
secured facility last year without
 
01:29:19.350 --> 01:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
a new plan in place and had found
 
01:29:21.510 --> 01:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
themselves in a situation where they
 
01:29:24.470 --> 01:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
didn't have put places to put kids and
 
01:29:26.070 --> 01:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
asked to contract with us
 
01:29:27.669 --> 01:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
while they are currently in the process
 
01:29:30.310 --> 01:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
of building a private facility
 
01:29:32.310 --> 01:29:32.320 align:start position:0%
um for commitment and detention so
 
01:29:34.950 --> 01:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
vermont is building their own facility
 
01:29:36.470 --> 01:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
as of now we do have a contract with
 
01:29:38.149 --> 01:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
them but we do not have any vermont kids
 
01:29:41.430 --> 01:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
we haven't talked to other states as to
 
01:29:44.390 --> 01:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
whether there'd be an interest in
 
01:29:46.390 --> 01:29:46.400 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
01:29:48.310 --> 01:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure whether there would be
 
01:29:49.830 --> 01:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
but certainly that's something that
 
01:29:55.270 --> 01:29:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:57.270 --> 01:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
no follow-up to that i'll move on to the
 
01:29:59.910 --> 01:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
last question
 
01:30:02.950 --> 01:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
which was representative i think there
 
01:30:04.229 --> 01:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
may be a follow-up
 
01:30:05.830 --> 01:30:05.840 align:start position:0%
or at least a related question
 
01:30:07.270 --> 01:30:07.280 align:start position:0%
representative rogers
 
01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
um it's not a related question it's a
 
01:30:10.470 --> 01:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
new question though when he finishes if
 
01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:14.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:17.990 --> 01:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
i guess okay my question is um
 
01:30:19.750 --> 01:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
about the recidivism rate in the
 
01:30:21.750 --> 01:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
facility when we're talking about
 
01:30:23.669 --> 01:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
um the other things that you mentioned
 
01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
earlier um
 
01:30:25.990 --> 01:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious i've heard the
 
01:30:28.709 --> 01:30:28.719 align:start position:0%
recidivism rate is as high as 60 percent
 
01:30:31.030 --> 01:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
and i just wondered if you confirm um
 
01:30:32.149 --> 01:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
you talked about
 
01:30:34.149 --> 01:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
your concern about moving them um
 
01:30:35.510 --> 01:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
because of the programs
 
01:30:37.830 --> 01:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
there and my concern is if the
 
01:30:40.310 --> 01:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
recidivism rate is in fact that high
 
01:30:43.430 --> 01:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
um is the recidivism rate is the prior
 
01:30:45.990 --> 01:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
the program is actually that great
 
01:30:49.430 --> 01:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
yeah so and i think so this is actually
 
01:30:51.910 --> 01:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
an issue that gets delved into
 
01:30:53.590 --> 01:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
pretty robustly in the audit which will
 
01:30:55.669 --> 01:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
be available to folks in a couple weeks
 
01:30:57.750 --> 01:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
um off the top of my head i'm not
 
01:30:59.189 --> 01:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
remembering what the current recidivism
 
01:31:00.709 --> 01:31:00.719 align:start position:0%
rate is but it's certainly
 
01:31:02.550 --> 01:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
high and it's higher than it was in
 
01:31:04.629 --> 01:31:04.639 align:start position:0%
recent years
 
01:31:06.310 --> 01:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
and part of that there's a couple
 
01:31:07.750 --> 01:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
drivers to that
 
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
one is that we've really concentrated
 
01:31:11.430 --> 01:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
the population of youth who are entering
 
01:31:13.270 --> 01:31:13.280 align:start position:0%
to only be youth who are really more
 
01:31:15.430 --> 01:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
acute in their needs
 
01:31:17.270 --> 01:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
so that would obviously impact the
 
01:31:18.470 --> 01:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
recidivism rate
 
01:31:20.149 --> 01:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
the other which i think has been
 
01:31:21.590 --> 01:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
problematic is that
 
01:31:25.189 --> 01:31:25.199 align:start position:0%
the changes in house bill 517
 
01:31:27.110 --> 01:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
that change the way that parole thinks
 
01:31:29.030 --> 01:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
about discharge
 
01:31:31.350 --> 01:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
really removed from their consideration
 
01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
treatment needs
 
01:31:34.390 --> 01:31:34.400 align:start position:0%
and whether the youth are able to have
 
01:31:36.629 --> 01:31:36.639 align:start position:0%
their needs met in the community
 
01:31:37.990 --> 01:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
or whether they're in the midst of
 
01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
treatment at the facility that would be
 
01:31:40.629 --> 01:31:40.639 align:start position:0%
best continued
 
01:31:42.310 --> 01:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
and rather is really limited to an
 
01:31:44.550 --> 01:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
assessment of the length of time that
 
01:31:45.990 --> 01:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
they've been there and whether they
 
01:31:48.229 --> 01:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
whether they pose an immediate need
 
01:31:48.239 --> 01:31:49.430 align:start position:0%
whether they pose an immediate need
danger

01:31:49.430 --> 01:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
danger
 
01:31:52.950 --> 01:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
to themselves or others that i think has
 
01:31:55.030 --> 01:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
led to some real programmatic challenges
 
01:31:56.709 --> 01:31:56.719 align:start position:0%
around being able to complete courses of
 
01:31:58.149 --> 01:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
treatment with youth
 
01:31:59.590 --> 01:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that you'll see in
 
01:32:00.629 --> 01:32:00.639 align:start position:0%
the forthcoming audit is a
 
01:32:02.310 --> 01:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation that
 
01:32:03.990 --> 01:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
evidence-based modalities be used with
 
01:32:05.350 --> 01:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
these youth which certainly would be
 
01:32:06.790 --> 01:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
hard if you're trying to do it
 
01:32:08.629 --> 01:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
out of the context of a place where
 
01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
people could consider
 
01:32:11.430 --> 01:32:11.440 align:start position:0%
the continuation of treatment needs
 
01:32:12.870 --> 01:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
because most of those evidence-based
 
01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:13.669 align:start position:0%
because most of those evidence-based
models

01:32:13.669 --> 01:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
models
 
01:32:15.990 --> 01:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
require certain dosage in order to be
 
01:32:17.830 --> 01:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
practiced with fidelity
 
01:32:19.189 --> 01:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
so i do think those are both
 
01:32:20.790 --> 01:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
contributing factors to what has been a
 
01:32:23.189 --> 01:32:23.199 align:start position:0%
growing recidivism
 
01:32:25.910 --> 01:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
i from what i've seen i don't think that
 
01:32:27.669 --> 01:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
our youth would get better care
 
01:32:30.070 --> 01:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
at any of the other facilities what i
 
01:32:31.590 --> 01:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
think is
 
01:32:33.189 --> 01:32:33.199 align:start position:0%
also unique about new hampshire is the
 
01:32:35.110 --> 01:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
way that we limit the amount of time
 
01:32:36.470 --> 01:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
that youth stay there is
 
01:32:37.830 --> 01:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
is completely different than how any
 
01:32:39.669 --> 01:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
other state operates
 
01:32:41.110 --> 01:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
so that would be another challenge
 
01:32:43.350 --> 01:32:43.360 align:start position:0%
around what would happen in those
 
01:32:45.189 --> 01:32:45.199 align:start position:0%
programs i'd fear that if we put
 
01:32:47.910 --> 01:32:47.920 align:start position:0%
youth into some programs out of state um
 
01:32:48.790 --> 01:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:32:50.149 --> 01:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
detention facilities out of state
 
01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
commitment facilities out of state
 
01:32:53.510 --> 01:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
their programming wouldn't at all align
 
01:32:55.189 --> 01:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
to our three what's typically a three
 
01:32:57.030 --> 01:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
month or six month length of stay based
 
01:32:57.750 --> 01:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:32:59.669 --> 01:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
severity of the of the underlying
 
01:33:01.270 --> 01:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
incident um
 
01:33:03.430 --> 01:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
and they actually would not receive the
 
01:33:04.790 --> 01:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
type of treatment that they need as a
 
01:33:08.229 --> 01:33:08.239 align:start position:0%
result of that
 
01:33:10.229 --> 01:33:10.239 align:start position:0%
did you have a follow-up because if you
 
01:33:12.470 --> 01:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
don't i do
 
01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
so 60 recidivism rate seems uh
 
01:33:18.709 --> 01:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
pretty high i don't i don't i don't know
 
01:33:20.550 --> 01:33:20.560 align:start position:0%
your stats but
 
01:33:23.110 --> 01:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
how does that feel based on what you
 
01:33:25.189 --> 01:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
know nationally
 
01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
i am sure that our recidivism rate is
 
01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
quite high i've just you know again off
 
01:33:30.709 --> 01:33:30.719 align:start position:0%
the top my head i don't have that data
 
01:33:30.719 --> 01:33:31.750 align:start position:0%
the top my head i don't have that data
handy

01:33:31.750 --> 01:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
handy
 
01:33:33.750 --> 01:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
but i do know it's cited specifically in
 
01:33:36.390 --> 01:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
the in the audit report um
 
01:33:37.990 --> 01:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
i think our recidivism i don't know how
 
01:33:39.030 --> 01:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
it compares nationally but it's
 
01:33:42.070 --> 01:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:45.189 --> 01:33:45.199 align:start position:0%
so in this community uh
 
01:33:47.430 --> 01:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
which is i'm sure a sub-specialty of
 
01:33:50.229 --> 01:33:50.239 align:start position:0%
dcyf people around the nation
 
01:33:53.350 --> 01:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
um is there is there sort of like
 
01:33:57.270 --> 01:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
um as one state that just seems to have
 
01:33:59.910 --> 01:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
come up with an a different approach
 
01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:00.310 align:start position:0%
come up with an a different approach
that

01:34:00.310 --> 01:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:34:02.229 --> 01:34:02.239 align:start position:0%
everyone is going oh that's the right
 
01:34:07.510 --> 01:34:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:08.709 --> 01:34:08.719 align:start position:0%
yeah there's there's a couple
 
01:34:10.310 --> 01:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions that do this work quite
 
01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:10.709 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions that do this work quite
well

01:34:10.709 --> 01:34:10.719 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:34:13.110 --> 01:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
i think actually the the plans that we
 
01:34:13.990 --> 01:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
have in place
 
01:34:17.430 --> 01:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
are are on that path and and actually
 
01:34:18.790 --> 01:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
are on the path of getting us beyond
 
01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:19.430 align:start position:0%
are on the path of getting us beyond
where

01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:34:23.189 --> 01:34:23.199 align:start position:0%
this is his tires um
 
01:34:25.510 --> 01:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
representative are you oh there you go
 
01:34:26.550 --> 01:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:34:30.149 --> 01:34:30.159 align:start position:0%
thank you the um part of what you have
 
01:34:31.350 --> 01:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
to think about is the number of youth
 
01:34:32.629 --> 01:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
that are placed in this setting right
 
01:34:33.750 --> 01:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
now which
 
01:34:35.750 --> 01:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
comparatively nationally is very very
 
01:34:37.510 --> 01:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
low compared to the number of youth in
 
01:34:39.110 --> 01:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
the state as a whole right we have
 
01:34:42.149 --> 01:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
on average 17 at a given time um most
 
01:34:43.350 --> 01:34:43.360 align:start position:0%
and that's between detained and
 
01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:44.070 align:start position:0%
and that's between detained and
committed

01:34:44.070 --> 01:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
committed
 
01:34:46.709 --> 01:34:46.719 align:start position:0%
most states have far more per capita
 
01:34:48.709 --> 01:34:48.719 align:start position:0%
youth in their secured facilities around
 
01:34:49.830 --> 01:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
the country
 
01:34:53.590 --> 01:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
um the the states that i've seen that do
 
01:34:54.149 --> 01:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
this work
 
01:34:56.870 --> 01:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
quite well new jersey was one of them
 
01:34:58.830 --> 01:34:58.840 align:start position:0%
and new jersey relied largely on a
 
01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:00.149 align:start position:0%
and new jersey relied largely on a
robust

01:35:00.149 --> 01:35:00.159 align:start position:0%
robust
 
01:35:03.430 --> 01:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
behavioral health system for kids
 
01:35:06.229 --> 01:35:06.239 align:start position:0%
with really specialized residential
 
01:35:08.070 --> 01:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
programs to meet those kids needs to get
 
01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:08.790 align:start position:0%
programs to meet those kids needs to get
them

01:35:08.790 --> 01:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:35:10.149 --> 01:35:10.159 align:start position:0%
the services they need the treatment
 
01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
they need to get them back into the
 
01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:12.070 align:start position:0%
they need to get them back into the
community

01:35:12.070 --> 01:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:35:13.430 --> 01:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
that didn't eliminate the need for
 
01:35:14.950 --> 01:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
detention and commitment but it drove
 
01:35:16.229 --> 01:35:16.239 align:start position:0%
down the numbers of detention and
 
01:35:17.750 --> 01:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
commitment drastically
 
01:35:18.950 --> 01:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
and it meant that when kids were
 
01:35:21.830 --> 01:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
discharged from a uh detention or
 
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
commitment placement
 
01:35:24.870 --> 01:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
that they had a place to go which was
 
01:35:26.550 --> 01:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
able to meet their needs
 
01:35:28.310 --> 01:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
that's really lacking today in new
 
01:35:30.070 --> 01:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire although the work that's
 
01:35:31.109 --> 01:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
currently underway
 
01:35:33.430 --> 01:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
should remedy that when i talk about the
 
01:35:34.709 --> 01:35:34.719 align:start position:0%
work that's currently underway i'm
 
01:35:36.070 --> 01:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
largely talking about the work that's
 
01:35:37.430 --> 01:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
happening within children's behavioral
 
01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:38.149 align:start position:0%
happening within children's behavioral
health

01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
health
 
01:35:40.070 --> 01:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
to completely redesign our residential
 
01:35:41.910 --> 01:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
care system
 
01:35:44.470 --> 01:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
to have basically different tiers based
 
01:35:46.229 --> 01:35:46.239 align:start position:0%
on clinical needs different requirements
 
01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
of providers that they've never had
 
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
to uh face before inclusive of becoming
 
01:35:52.390 --> 01:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
accredited programs
 
01:35:53.990 --> 01:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
introducing trauma-informed models of
 
01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
care introducing something called six
 
01:35:55.760 --> 01:35:55.990 align:start position:0%
care introducing something called six
core

01:35:55.990 --> 01:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
core
 
01:35:58.629 --> 01:35:58.639 align:start position:0%
strategies to limit or reduce the use of
 
01:36:00.390 --> 01:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
restraint and seclusion
 
01:36:02.950 --> 01:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
um and including and this taps into one
 
01:36:04.470 --> 01:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
of the questions that
 
01:36:06.390 --> 01:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
senator representative wallner just
 
01:36:07.830 --> 01:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
asked around the use of assessment
 
01:36:10.070 --> 01:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
including the use of a comprehensive
 
01:36:12.310 --> 01:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
needs and psychosocial assessment to
 
01:36:13.350 --> 01:36:13.360 align:start position:0%
determine what
 
01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
level of care kids actually need i found
 
01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
it shocking when i got to the state that
 
01:36:19.189 --> 01:36:19.199 align:start position:0%
we actually don't do that
 
01:36:21.030 --> 01:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
when we make placement decisions we make
 
01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:22.229 align:start position:0%
when we make placement decisions we make
placements

01:36:22.229 --> 01:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
placements
 
01:36:24.229 --> 01:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
i want to i want to talk to pause you
 
01:36:25.270 --> 01:36:25.280 align:start position:0%
there uh
 
01:36:27.510 --> 01:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
representative norgren and and walter
 
01:36:29.590 --> 01:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
and and weiler they all have questions
 
01:36:30.390 --> 01:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
for you
 
01:36:33.030 --> 01:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
but but you sort of uh you've kind of
 
01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:33.910 align:start position:0%
but but you sort of uh you've kind of
diverged

01:36:33.910 --> 01:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
diverged
 
01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
from my question which i think may have
 
01:36:38.310 --> 01:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
just simply been new jersey
 
01:36:41.669 --> 01:36:41.679 align:start position:0%
what what state is i think yeah another
 
01:36:43.270 --> 01:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
state that people speak highly of which
 
01:36:45.109 --> 01:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
had a comparable model is missouri
 
01:36:46.629 --> 01:36:46.639 align:start position:0%
missouri's actually backslid a little
 
01:36:48.629 --> 01:36:48.639 align:start position:0%
bit in recent years but they were
 
01:36:49.990 --> 01:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
they were a state that was doing
 
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
something similar they're not identical
 
01:36:53.430 --> 01:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
to what we were doing in new jersey in
 
01:36:55.590 --> 01:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
terms of building out inc
 
01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
increased clinical capacity to meet the
 
01:36:59.430 --> 01:36:59.440 align:start position:0%
needs of these kids
 
01:37:01.669 --> 01:37:01.679 align:start position:0%
and then being able to rely less on
 
01:37:04.470 --> 01:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
things like the tension and commitment
 
01:37:06.390 --> 01:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
the other thing that you were talking
 
01:37:07.830 --> 01:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
about you were talking about
 
01:37:10.709 --> 01:37:10.719 align:start position:0%
i think transforming the way we provide
 
01:37:10.719 --> 01:37:11.270 align:start position:0%
i think transforming the way we provide
juvenile

01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
juvenile
 
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
justice services my first question of
 
01:37:16.950 --> 01:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
the day i think was around
 
01:37:20.629 --> 01:37:20.639 align:start position:0%
um you have transformation
 
01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
plans ready to go and does the
 
01:37:23.830 --> 01:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
governor's budget
 
01:37:26.229 --> 01:37:26.239 align:start position:0%
support the transformation and so i'm
 
01:37:27.910 --> 01:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
getting a mixed message because
 
01:37:29.990 --> 01:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
initially i it didn't sound like you had
 
01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
transformation plans
 
01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
and and now it sort of sounds like maybe
 
01:37:35.189 --> 01:37:35.199 align:start position:0%
you do
 
01:37:38.229 --> 01:37:38.239 align:start position:0%
so why am i confused
 
01:37:40.709 --> 01:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
so i when you ask the ques so there are
 
01:37:40.719 --> 01:37:41.350 align:start position:0%
so i when you ask the ques so there are
transform

01:37:41.350 --> 01:37:41.360 align:start position:0%
transform
 
01:37:43.590 --> 01:37:43.600 align:start position:0%
there are transformative plans underway
 
01:37:45.109 --> 01:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
in terms of how juvenile justice
 
01:37:47.350 --> 01:37:47.360 align:start position:0%
as a whole works in terms of how
 
01:37:49.109 --> 01:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
clinical services for kids
 
01:37:51.189 --> 01:37:51.199 align:start position:0%
are offered both of those things are
 
01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
going to be hugely impactful
 
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
on the number of kids that enter
 
01:37:55.990 --> 01:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
residential care and the number of kids
 
01:37:56.000 --> 01:37:56.229 align:start position:0%
residential care and the number of kids
that

01:37:56.229 --> 01:37:56.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:37:59.189 --> 01:37:59.199 align:start position:0%
end up requiring a detention to stay in
 
01:37:59.830 --> 01:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
a team
 
01:38:02.229 --> 01:38:02.239 align:start position:0%
or commitment setting what i don't have
 
01:38:04.390 --> 01:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
transformational plans are is a
 
01:38:08.149 --> 01:38:08.159 align:start position:0%
redesign of what sysc should be so i
 
01:38:09.830 --> 01:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
those are discrete those are distinct
 
01:38:11.270 --> 01:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
questions in my mind
 
01:38:13.510 --> 01:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
but they are overlapping significantly
 
01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:14.390 align:start position:0%
but they are overlapping significantly
because

01:38:14.390 --> 01:38:14.400 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:38:16.229 --> 01:38:16.239 align:start position:0%
the resolution of those other issues
 
01:38:18.310 --> 01:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
around children's behavioral health
 
01:38:19.990 --> 01:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
and how kids enter the juvenile justice
 
01:38:21.830 --> 01:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
system is going to have an impact on the
 
01:38:23.430 --> 01:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
utilization of sysc and other
 
01:38:25.590 --> 01:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
residential programs
 
01:38:28.709 --> 01:38:28.719 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh clarifying that we'll
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
go with representative nordgren then
 
01:38:32.709 --> 01:38:32.719 align:start position:0%
weiler then walner i think that was the
 
01:38:32.719 --> 01:38:33.990 align:start position:0%
weiler then walner i think that was the
order

01:38:33.990 --> 01:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
order
 
01:38:37.109 --> 01:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um
 
01:38:40.310 --> 01:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
joe could you please dig down into that
 
01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
number of 74
 
01:38:45.430 --> 01:38:45.440 align:start position:0%
children who are out of state with such
 
01:38:48.070 --> 01:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
a low population at sununu
 
01:38:51.189 --> 01:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
it'd be interesting to know if
 
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
some of those kids can come back i think
 
01:38:55.669 --> 01:38:55.679 align:start position:0%
we don't need that information right now
 
01:38:57.750 --> 01:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
but if you could just give us some sense
 
01:38:57.760 --> 01:38:58.629 align:start position:0%
but if you could just give us some sense
of

01:38:58.629 --> 01:38:58.639 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:39:02.470 --> 01:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
why those children are not here
 
01:39:05.510 --> 01:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
and if there are any who could be back
 
01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
in sununu
 
01:39:09.109 --> 01:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
yeah so those are actually there the
 
01:39:10.470 --> 01:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
kids that are out of state are not out
 
01:39:11.109 --> 01:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
of state
 
01:39:12.629 --> 01:39:12.639 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of detention or
 
01:39:14.229 --> 01:39:14.239 align:start position:0%
commitment which is the sole legal
 
01:39:14.239 --> 01:39:15.030 align:start position:0%
commitment which is the sole legal
purpose

01:39:15.030 --> 01:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
01:39:18.390 --> 01:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
of sysa sysc is not allowed to be used
 
01:39:19.990 --> 01:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
for residential placement it's only
 
01:39:21.590 --> 01:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
allowed to be used for kids who have
 
01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
been adjudicated
 
01:39:25.510 --> 01:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
or ordered by the court or who were in a
 
01:39:27.189 --> 01:39:27.199 align:start position:0%
detention status pending
 
01:39:29.430 --> 01:39:29.440 align:start position:0%
that um the kids who were placed out of
 
01:39:30.550 --> 01:39:30.560 align:start position:0%
state are not
 
01:39:33.669 --> 01:39:33.679 align:start position:0%
are would not be eligible for sysc what
 
01:39:36.629 --> 01:39:36.639 align:start position:0%
those kids largely are are youth who
 
01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
potentially could be served by in-state
 
01:39:39.990 --> 01:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
residential providers
 
01:39:42.229 --> 01:39:42.239 align:start position:0%
but a lack of capacity or a lack of
 
01:39:42.239 --> 01:39:43.510 align:start position:0%
but a lack of capacity or a lack of
clinical

01:39:43.510 --> 01:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
clinical
 
01:39:45.910 --> 01:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
you know expertise to meet those needs
 
01:39:46.709 --> 01:39:46.719 align:start position:0%
has pushed
 
01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
those kids out of seat i would say some
 
01:39:50.709 --> 01:39:50.719 align:start position:0%
of those providers
 
01:39:52.870 --> 01:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
the the bordering state providers are
 
01:39:54.310 --> 01:39:54.320 align:start position:0%
you know literally right on the border
 
01:39:56.149 --> 01:39:56.159 align:start position:0%
and are probably providers that
 
01:39:57.750 --> 01:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
would even remain part of the picture in
 
01:39:59.510 --> 01:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
the future state um
 
01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
you know for example there's a lot of
 
01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:02.639 align:start position:0%
kids on in
 
01:40:03.750 --> 01:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
settings that are right along the
 
01:40:05.270 --> 01:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
vermont new hampshire border that are
 
01:40:08.070 --> 01:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
used by both vermont new hampshire
 
01:40:09.350 --> 01:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
you know i don't think that those are
 
01:40:10.550 --> 01:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
things that are necessarily going to
 
01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:11.270 align:start position:0%
things that are necessarily going to
change

01:40:11.270 --> 01:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:40:12.709 --> 01:40:12.719 align:start position:0%
in the future state in terms of who
 
01:40:14.390 --> 01:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
those providers are but what will change
 
01:40:15.990 --> 01:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
is what our expectations are of those
 
01:40:17.350 --> 01:40:17.360 align:start position:0%
providers in terms of the care they
 
01:40:20.149 --> 01:40:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:24.550 --> 01:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you no i i just think i
 
01:40:27.750 --> 01:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
i'd like more information on the the
 
01:40:29.430 --> 01:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
differences maybe
 
01:40:32.950 --> 01:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
of who's aware and why they're where
 
01:40:37.669 --> 01:40:37.679 align:start position:0%
okay thanks
 
01:40:38.870 --> 01:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
do you want that information
 
01:40:40.950 --> 01:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren in this budget
 
01:40:42.070 --> 01:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
cycle or or
 
01:40:46.070 --> 01:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:48.070 --> 01:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
well i think it would be informational
 
01:40:49.990 --> 01:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
to know if
 
01:40:52.390 --> 01:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
there are other categories we could be
 
01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:53.510 align:start position:0%
there are other categories we could be
funding

01:40:53.510 --> 01:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
different ways so you want an answer
 
01:40:58.550 --> 01:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
sooner rather than later
 
01:41:01.830 --> 01:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
yeah i would add to that
 
01:41:03.910 --> 01:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
right the work that's underway folks
 
01:41:05.109 --> 01:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
could take a look there is
 
01:41:07.350 --> 01:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
an rfp posted right now i have to be
 
01:41:09.109 --> 01:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
careful not to speak too much because
 
01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
it's a live
 
01:41:12.310 --> 01:41:12.320 align:start position:0%
rfp but there is an rfp right now to
 
01:41:14.470 --> 01:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
fundamentally transform residential care
 
01:41:15.590 --> 01:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
in this state
 
01:41:17.189 --> 01:41:17.199 align:start position:0%
for the first time ever requiring all
 
01:41:18.790 --> 01:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
those things i provided before and also
 
01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
for the first time ever actually
 
01:41:21.669 --> 01:41:21.679 align:start position:0%
requiring contracts for providers which
 
01:41:23.109 --> 01:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
believe it or not we did not require
 
01:41:23.119 --> 01:41:24.470 align:start position:0%
believe it or not we did not require
before

01:41:24.470 --> 01:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:41:26.310 --> 01:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
and made it really difficult to monitor
 
01:41:29.669 --> 01:41:29.679 align:start position:0%
outcomes and to really set expectations
 
01:41:32.950 --> 01:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
so i think what the hope is the plan is
 
01:41:35.109 --> 01:41:35.119 align:start position:0%
is that through that procurement process
 
01:41:36.950 --> 01:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
we will develop the in-state capacity to
 
01:41:38.229 --> 01:41:38.239 align:start position:0%
bring most of these kids
 
01:41:41.030 --> 01:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
certainly the ones far away home but
 
01:41:42.550 --> 01:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
there may still be some kids and
 
01:41:43.990 --> 01:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
programs that are on the border but we
 
01:41:45.669 --> 01:41:45.679 align:start position:0%
would be contracting with those programs
 
01:41:46.629 --> 01:41:46.639 align:start position:0%
on the border
 
01:41:47.910 --> 01:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
and being able to hold them accountable
 
01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
the same way that new hampshire programs
 
01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:55.590 --> 01:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative weiler thank
 
01:41:57.590 --> 01:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman director
 
01:42:00.629 --> 01:42:00.639 align:start position:0%
speaking of recidivism you said 60
 
01:42:02.709 --> 01:42:02.719 align:start position:0%
recidivism i think we close to what we
 
01:42:04.310 --> 01:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
see from the prison
 
01:42:07.830 --> 01:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
about 50 so i'm wondering
 
01:42:09.910 --> 01:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
your graduates go on to go to the prison
 
01:42:11.910 --> 01:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
and and likely
 
01:42:14.790 --> 01:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
is part of the reason that sony 60 is
 
01:42:15.350 --> 01:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
some of them
 
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
age out and what percentage end up
 
01:42:22.149 --> 01:42:22.159 align:start position:0%
in prison anyway and unfortunately our
 
01:42:23.030 --> 01:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
data doesn't
 
01:42:24.870 --> 01:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't connect with the data at the oc
 
01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
so i can't answer that question
 
01:42:28.870 --> 01:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
but what i can say is anecdotally we do
 
01:42:30.470 --> 01:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately see young people
 
01:42:32.790 --> 01:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
move on from the juvenile justice system
 
01:42:34.709 --> 01:42:34.719 align:start position:0%
particularly from sysc into the adult
 
01:42:34.719 --> 01:42:36.229 align:start position:0%
particularly from sysc into the adult
system

01:42:36.229 --> 01:42:36.239 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:42:38.229 --> 01:42:38.239 align:start position:0%
and that's exactly why this system of
 
01:42:40.870 --> 01:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
care work i think is really so critical
 
01:42:42.390 --> 01:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
because i don't think that we're meeting
 
01:42:43.830 --> 01:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
the needs of these young people the way
 
01:42:45.590 --> 01:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
that the system is currently designed
 
01:42:47.430 --> 01:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
and as we redesign residential programs
 
01:42:48.790 --> 01:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
i was talking about you put in those
 
01:42:50.149 --> 01:42:50.159 align:start position:0%
other system of care components that
 
01:42:51.510 --> 01:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
we've spoken about
 
01:42:54.470 --> 01:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
we'll see those numbers change you know
 
01:42:55.270 --> 01:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
speaking about
 
01:42:56.790 --> 01:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
you know the experience in other states
 
01:42:58.790 --> 01:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
around this um you know i certainly
 
01:43:00.149 --> 01:43:00.159 align:start position:0%
don't have the data to
 
01:43:03.910 --> 01:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
to draw a uh causal relationship
 
01:43:05.910 --> 01:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
but as the system of care in new jersey
 
01:43:07.510 --> 01:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
grew the need for
 
01:43:09.510 --> 01:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
adult corrections in new jersey shrank
 
01:43:10.709 --> 01:43:10.719 align:start position:0%
at a time that the need for adult
 
01:43:12.790 --> 01:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
corrections in new hampshire was growing
 
01:43:16.390 --> 01:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
um so i do believe that the work that we
 
01:43:18.310 --> 01:43:18.320 align:start position:0%
do with young people to meet their needs
 
01:43:20.310 --> 01:43:20.320 align:start position:0%
and set them up to be productive adults
 
01:43:22.629 --> 01:43:22.639 align:start position:0%
helps downstream effects even in terms
 
01:43:22.639 --> 01:43:23.109 align:start position:0%
helps downstream effects even in terms
of

01:43:23.109 --> 01:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:43:24.470 --> 01:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
who ends up in our correctional system
 
01:43:26.310 --> 01:43:26.320 align:start position:0%
in the future
 
01:43:28.550 --> 01:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
i am as hopeful as you that that is the
 
01:43:31.109 --> 01:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
result thank you
 
01:43:33.830 --> 01:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
so uh representative walner then earth
 
01:43:36.470 --> 01:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
and rogers
 
01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:38.639 align:start position:0%
so mr represent i hope that this
 
01:43:40.470 --> 01:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
afternoon during some of our discussion
 
01:43:42.149 --> 01:43:42.159 align:start position:0%
and it might be during the budget part
 
01:43:42.159 --> 01:43:42.790 align:start position:0%
and it might be during the budget part
but

01:43:42.790 --> 01:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:43:44.790 --> 01:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
that you put on that you talked to us a
 
01:43:47.590 --> 01:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
little bit about medicaid reimbursement
 
01:43:50.550 --> 01:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
um i know that we get we do not get any
 
01:43:52.149 --> 01:43:52.159 align:start position:0%
sort of reimbursement from the federal
 
01:43:52.159 --> 01:43:52.709 align:start position:0%
sort of reimbursement from the federal
government

01:43:52.709 --> 01:43:52.719 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:43:56.550 --> 01:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
at the um sununu center at this time
 
01:43:58.709 --> 01:43:58.719 align:start position:0%
and i my understanding is that's because
 
01:43:59.830 --> 01:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
it is a
 
01:44:03.669 --> 01:44:03.679 align:start position:0%
quote corrections um facility
 
01:44:07.109 --> 01:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
if many of these children could be moved
 
01:44:07.119 --> 01:44:07.669 align:start position:0%
if many of these children could be moved
out

01:44:07.669 --> 01:44:07.679 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:44:11.669 --> 01:44:11.679 align:start position:0%
into community residential programs that
 
01:44:12.229 --> 01:44:12.239 align:start position:0%
are more
 
01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
that are therapeutic uh reimbursement
 
01:44:16.310 --> 01:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
would be available
 
01:44:18.709 --> 01:44:18.719 align:start position:0%
a 50 reimbursement would be available
 
01:44:20.870 --> 01:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
from the feds through
 
01:44:23.990 --> 01:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
medicaid is that am i correct in my
 
01:44:25.590 --> 01:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
assumptions here
 
01:44:27.910 --> 01:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
yeah it is correct right when the when
 
01:44:29.590 --> 01:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
there's a correctional setting medicaid
 
01:44:30.550 --> 01:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
is not allowed
 
01:44:33.669 --> 01:44:33.679 align:start position:0%
to support that cost that placement cost
 
01:44:34.870 --> 01:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
so it ends up being
 
01:44:38.149 --> 01:44:38.159 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly general funds although
 
01:44:39.750 --> 01:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
svic's budget does include
 
01:44:41.910 --> 01:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
some like doe education funds for the
 
01:44:43.830 --> 01:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
education program but overwhelmingly
 
01:44:46.950 --> 01:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's general funds and yes
 
01:44:48.790 --> 01:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
community programs typically can receive
 
01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:49.750 align:start position:0%
community programs typically can receive
medicaid

01:44:49.750 --> 01:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
01:44:52.229 --> 01:44:52.239 align:start position:0%
i think what's um from a budgetary
 
01:44:53.910 --> 01:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
perspective what gets difficult
 
01:44:57.030 --> 01:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
is you you exacerbate and it's not a
 
01:44:58.390 --> 01:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
reason not to do it because kids should
 
01:44:59.750 --> 01:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
be in the least restrictive environment
 
01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
that they can
 
01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:02.639 align:start position:0%
that they can be in but you do continue
 
01:45:04.310 --> 01:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
to exacerbate that economies of scale
 
01:45:06.470 --> 01:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
issue that we were talking about before
 
01:45:09.590 --> 01:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
where the the savings yielded may not
 
01:45:11.830 --> 01:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
actually be as much as as folks
 
01:45:14.390 --> 01:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
anticipate they will be
 
01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
but i do think that maximizing medicaid
 
01:45:18.629 --> 01:45:18.639 align:start position:0%
revenue and getting kids in least
 
01:45:19.750 --> 01:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
restrictive environments where
 
01:45:21.109 --> 01:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
clinically appropriate is always the
 
01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
best thing to do
 
01:45:27.109 --> 01:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
thank you your follow-up
 
01:45:32.870 --> 01:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:36.149 --> 01:45:36.159 align:start position:0%
representative two quick questions
 
01:45:39.669 --> 01:45:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:41.830 --> 01:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
yes it's posted on our website right now
 
01:45:43.270 --> 01:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
we can forward that's fine
 
01:45:46.390 --> 01:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
just send me the link sure and second
 
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
question is can you get can we get a
 
01:45:48.950 --> 01:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
written definition of
 
01:45:51.430 --> 01:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
system of care i heard that i hear that
 
01:45:52.629 --> 01:45:52.639 align:start position:0%
term a lot in different
 
01:45:56.070 --> 01:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
contexts yes um
 
01:45:57.590 --> 01:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
yes i'll talk to our behavioral health
 
01:45:58.629 --> 01:45:58.639 align:start position:0%
folks about trying to get a written
 
01:45:59.750 --> 01:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
definition for it
 
01:46:02.709 --> 01:46:02.719 align:start position:0%
but essentially it's the concept of of
 
01:46:02.719 --> 01:46:03.590 align:start position:0%
but essentially it's the concept of of
how

01:46:03.590 --> 01:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:46:05.189 --> 01:46:05.199 align:start position:0%
of how you provide behavioral health
 
01:46:07.350 --> 01:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
services to in this instance
 
01:46:11.350 --> 01:46:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:14.390 --> 01:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:17.590 --> 01:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
okay representative rogers um yes
 
01:46:20.470 --> 01:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
mr ribson if we were to um place
 
01:46:22.229 --> 01:46:22.239 align:start position:0%
language in house bill 2
 
01:46:25.270 --> 01:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
to call for the the um closing of the
 
01:46:26.709 --> 01:46:26.719 align:start position:0%
sununu center
 
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
and for um construction of a smaller
 
01:46:33.030 --> 01:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
um detainee center or smaller secured
 
01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:33.990 align:start position:0%
um detainee center or smaller secured
unit

01:46:33.990 --> 01:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
unit
 
01:46:37.590 --> 01:46:37.600 align:start position:0%
and options um are you prepared to come
 
01:46:39.590 --> 01:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
back to us with your thoughts on
 
01:46:41.430 --> 01:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
what this would take how long it would
 
01:46:44.070 --> 01:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
take what you would want and what
 
01:46:45.510 --> 01:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
kind of transformational in your
 
01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
language um
 
01:46:49.750 --> 01:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
kind of information you would have as a
 
01:46:52.790 --> 01:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
plan i think that that many of us here
 
01:46:54.550 --> 01:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
are looking at that when we look at that
 
01:46:55.990 --> 01:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
some of us have been looking at it for
 
01:46:56.790 --> 01:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
the past
 
01:46:59.990 --> 01:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
10 to 15 years actually um but it's
 
01:47:01.109 --> 01:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
something that's
 
01:47:02.550 --> 01:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
that a number of people are talking
 
01:47:04.790 --> 01:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
about and looking at at this point
 
01:47:06.790 --> 01:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
can you be prepared to come back to us
 
01:47:08.709 --> 01:47:08.719 align:start position:0%
with some of your thoughts on this or i
 
01:47:10.470 --> 01:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
don't know if you already have thoughts
 
01:47:13.590 --> 01:47:13.600 align:start position:0%
but hopefully i can certainly share
 
01:47:16.310 --> 01:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
thoughts i think um you know it's that
 
01:47:17.750 --> 01:47:17.760 align:start position:0%
decision is obviously not just mine so
 
01:47:19.189 --> 01:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
i'd want to i'd want to include other
 
01:47:21.109 --> 01:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
people in that conversation but
 
01:47:22.629 --> 01:47:22.639 align:start position:0%
i think one of the real challenges
 
01:47:24.310 --> 01:47:24.320 align:start position:0%
around downsizing it and i think it is
 
01:47:26.229 --> 01:47:26.239 align:start position:0%
ultimately the right thing to do
 
01:47:28.310 --> 01:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
is that in my opinion we want the
 
01:47:29.990 --> 01:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
programming in the new facility to be
 
01:47:31.350 --> 01:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
comparable to the programming that
 
01:47:33.109 --> 01:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
exists today which means
 
01:47:35.590 --> 01:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be it might not be all
 
01:47:37.910 --> 01:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
that much less expensive
 
01:47:39.510 --> 01:47:39.520 align:start position:0%
and that the amenities that are
 
01:47:41.590 --> 01:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
available to you in sysc
 
01:47:42.870 --> 01:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
should be available to youth in the
 
01:47:45.030 --> 01:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
future state as well could be smaller
 
01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:45.590 align:start position:0%
future state as well could be smaller
bunk

01:47:45.590 --> 01:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
bunk
 
01:47:49.030 --> 01:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
funking areas but sysc offers you
 
01:47:51.910 --> 01:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
comprehensive internal and indoor and
 
01:47:53.430 --> 01:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
outdoor recreational space through an
 
01:47:54.950 --> 01:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
indoor gymnasium
 
01:47:57.189 --> 01:47:57.199 align:start position:0%
and outdoor courtyards basketball courts
 
01:47:58.310 --> 01:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
and all of that
 
01:48:01.270 --> 01:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
it offers you you know a full school a
 
01:48:01.280 --> 01:48:02.709 align:start position:0%
it offers you you know a full school a
library

01:48:02.709 --> 01:48:02.719 align:start position:0%
library
 
01:48:05.270 --> 01:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
a full medical suite where we're able to
 
01:48:06.709 --> 01:48:06.719 align:start position:0%
to meet the needs of youth
 
01:48:08.790 --> 01:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
dental suite where a dentist comes in is
 
01:48:10.550 --> 01:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
able to meet the kids dental needs
 
01:48:11.669 --> 01:48:11.679 align:start position:0%
unfortunately a lot of the young people
 
01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
who get placed there haven't had dental
 
01:48:14.870 --> 01:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
needs cared for
 
01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
in years before getting there and we do
 
01:48:19.510 --> 01:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of rehabilitative work in that
 
01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:21.109 align:start position:0%
a lot of rehabilitative work in that
space

01:48:21.109 --> 01:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
space
 
01:48:22.870 --> 01:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
and that the clinical programming is
 
01:48:25.109 --> 01:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
comprehensive and probably even more so
 
01:48:26.629 --> 01:48:26.639 align:start position:0%
than it is today
 
01:48:28.070 --> 01:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
we recently hired a full-time
 
01:48:29.750 --> 01:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
psychologist down there to redesign our
 
01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
clinical programming and i'm thrilled
 
01:48:32.470 --> 01:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
with the work that she's doing
 
01:48:34.310 --> 01:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunately she joined after covet
 
01:48:35.350 --> 01:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
started and
 
01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of our priorities had to shift
 
01:48:39.109 --> 01:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
during the last nine months just to keep
 
01:48:39.119 --> 01:48:39.910 align:start position:0%
during the last nine months just to keep
people

01:48:39.910 --> 01:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:48:42.229 --> 01:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
you know safe in the context of kovid
 
01:48:43.350 --> 01:48:43.360 align:start position:0%
but i'm thrilled with the work that
 
01:48:44.790 --> 01:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
she's doing and redeveloping our
 
01:48:46.629 --> 01:48:46.639 align:start position:0%
clinical program
 
01:48:48.709 --> 01:48:48.719 align:start position:0%
so i think you know if i was to be asked
 
01:48:51.030 --> 01:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
what the next facility should look like
 
01:48:52.790 --> 01:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
it really should have the same amenities
 
01:48:54.229 --> 01:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
that the current one does but probably
 
01:48:56.149 --> 01:48:56.159 align:start position:0%
would have to be smaller scale to
 
01:48:58.629 --> 01:48:58.639 align:start position:0%
you know to align with what the census
 
01:48:58.639 --> 01:48:59.189 align:start position:0%
you know to align with what the census
is

01:48:59.189 --> 01:48:59.199 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:49:00.950 --> 01:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
i think that also gets complex for the
 
01:49:02.629 --> 01:49:02.639 align:start position:0%
reasons i spoke about before
 
01:49:04.709 --> 01:49:04.719 align:start position:0%
and that if i was asked today how big of
 
01:49:06.229 --> 01:49:06.239 align:start position:0%
a facility to build i would be looking
 
01:49:07.669 --> 01:49:07.679 align:start position:0%
at the last fiscal year and looking at
 
01:49:08.709 --> 01:49:08.719 align:start position:0%
our highest day
 
01:49:10.149 --> 01:49:10.159 align:start position:0%
and say we should build to that because
 
01:49:11.270 --> 01:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
we need to be able to meet the peak
 
01:49:13.510 --> 01:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
which would be about 27.
 
01:49:15.109 --> 01:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
but i also believe that the system of
 
01:49:16.310 --> 01:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
care work that we've been talking about
 
01:49:17.830 --> 01:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
is going to drive down the number over
 
01:49:18.870 --> 01:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
the future years
 
01:49:20.149 --> 01:49:20.159 align:start position:0%
and if you were asking me this question
 
01:49:21.669 --> 01:49:21.679 align:start position:0%
in two years it'd probably be a much
 
01:49:23.750 --> 01:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
lower number than that
 
01:49:25.350 --> 01:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
so i think we're at this point right now
 
01:49:27.350 --> 01:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
where at least for me there's a
 
01:49:28.550 --> 01:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
recognition that there needs to be a
 
01:49:29.510 --> 01:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
next step
 
01:49:31.270 --> 01:49:31.280 align:start position:0%
but for me also the data is a little
 
01:49:33.109 --> 01:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
unclear as to what that next step should
 
01:49:33.119 --> 01:49:34.709 align:start position:0%
unclear as to what that next step should
be

01:49:34.709 --> 01:49:34.719 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:49:37.910 --> 01:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
so i could follow up yes ma'am um we
 
01:49:39.589 --> 01:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
just have a number of studies over the
 
01:49:39.599 --> 01:49:40.149 align:start position:0%
just have a number of studies over the
last

01:49:40.149 --> 01:49:40.159 align:start position:0%
last
 
01:49:42.149 --> 01:49:42.159 align:start position:0%
15 years i think that have all come to
 
01:49:44.149 --> 01:49:44.159 align:start position:0%
the same conclusion that we need to
 
01:49:45.990 --> 01:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
close that facility and do something
 
01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
different and we've never taken that
 
01:49:48.870 --> 01:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
next step
 
01:49:50.709 --> 01:49:50.719 align:start position:0%
i think maybe this year is the time to
 
01:49:51.910 --> 01:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
take the next step
 
01:49:53.430 --> 01:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
and i guess that's what i'm asking you
 
01:49:55.750 --> 01:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
is to come back to us and tell us um
 
01:49:57.270 --> 01:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
instead of waiting two years which is
 
01:49:58.470 --> 01:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
what we always hear
 
01:49:59.990 --> 01:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
let's wait another year let's wait
 
01:50:01.589 --> 01:50:01.599 align:start position:0%
another year let's win another year
 
01:50:03.830 --> 01:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
and it's now 15 years later and we're
 
01:50:05.669 --> 01:50:05.679 align:start position:0%
spending 12.5 million
 
01:50:08.390 --> 01:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
on a facility for um that was built for
 
01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:09.679 align:start position:0%
hundreds and now has
 
01:50:12.229 --> 01:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
you say maybe 26 sometimes as low as
 
01:50:12.239 --> 01:50:12.790 align:start position:0%
you say maybe 26 sometimes as low as
eight

01:50:12.790 --> 01:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
eight
 
01:50:14.310 --> 01:50:14.320 align:start position:0%
i think we need to take the next step
 
01:50:15.910 --> 01:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
now instead of waiting for another two
 
01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:16.550 align:start position:0%
now instead of waiting for another two
years

01:50:16.550 --> 01:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:50:19.430 --> 01:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
so i guess i'm asking you um what would
 
01:50:20.950 --> 01:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
you you know instead of us coming up
 
01:50:22.629 --> 01:50:22.639 align:start position:0%
with something you don't like
 
01:50:24.790 --> 01:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
maybe having you come up to tell us what
 
01:50:26.629 --> 01:50:26.639 align:start position:0%
that next step is instead of waiting two
 
01:50:26.639 --> 01:50:27.189 align:start position:0%
that next step is instead of waiting two
years

01:50:27.189 --> 01:50:27.199 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the question and i
 
01:50:33.669 --> 01:50:33.679 align:start position:0%
appreciate the sentiment i would say to
 
01:50:35.109 --> 01:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
be fair the system of care work should
 
01:50:37.109 --> 01:50:37.119 align:start position:0%
have preceded any of this conversation
 
01:50:38.390 --> 01:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
that should have been happening a decade
 
01:50:41.510 --> 01:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
ago um and the fact that it had it
 
01:50:43.030 --> 01:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
puts us at a disadvantage for making the
 
01:50:45.669 --> 01:50:45.679 align:start position:0%
decisions that we need to make today
 
01:50:47.750 --> 01:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
so you know i think a decision could be
 
01:50:48.870 --> 01:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
made to
 
01:50:50.390 --> 01:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
to move forward with this more
 
01:50:52.390 --> 01:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
expeditiously and if so i'd say you need
 
01:50:53.030 --> 01:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
to build
 
01:50:56.390 --> 01:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
to the cap which is 27. um
 
01:50:59.030 --> 01:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
but in two years if this the data will
 
01:51:00.629 --> 01:51:00.639 align:start position:0%
probably look different it will probably
 
01:51:01.910 --> 01:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
look more favorable
 
01:51:04.070 --> 01:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
to yield us building a facility that's
 
01:51:05.830 --> 01:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
more aligned with what the actual demand
 
01:51:07.350 --> 01:51:07.360 align:start position:0%
is going to be in the future
 
01:51:08.950 --> 01:51:08.960 align:start position:0%
as opposed to what the demand was last
 
01:51:10.790 --> 01:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
01:51:12.790 --> 01:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
and i thank you for your bluntness and
 
01:51:14.870 --> 01:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry to be impatient but
 
01:51:19.189 --> 01:51:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:22.310 --> 01:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
so so i i want to follow up on on on one
 
01:51:25.270 --> 01:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
of the implications there and i i was uh
 
01:51:26.790 --> 01:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
i was kind of brainstorming with
 
01:51:28.870 --> 01:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
somebody the other day are
 
01:51:31.189 --> 01:51:31.199 align:start position:0%
are you familiar with the federal base
 
01:51:35.430 --> 01:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:38.629 --> 01:51:38.639 align:start position:0%
okay so so in the 70s we
 
01:51:40.709 --> 01:51:40.719 align:start position:0%
we had a real big problem in the
 
01:51:42.390 --> 01:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
department of defense
 
01:51:45.109 --> 01:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
we had military installations all over
 
01:51:45.830 --> 01:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
the nation
 
01:51:49.030 --> 01:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
and every single installation uh was
 
01:51:51.350 --> 01:51:51.360 align:start position:0%
feeding money into a small town
 
01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:52.149 align:start position:0%
feeding money into a small town
somewhere

01:51:52.149 --> 01:51:52.159 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
01:51:55.510 --> 01:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
and uh and and and became a huge part of
 
01:51:55.520 --> 01:51:56.229 align:start position:0%
and uh and and and became a huge part of
the

01:51:56.229 --> 01:51:56.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:51:58.790 --> 01:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
business and tax revenues of of of these
 
01:52:00.709 --> 01:52:00.719 align:start position:0%
localities and so when
 
01:52:04.790 --> 01:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:08.470 --> 01:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
reducing the number of bases that we had
 
01:52:11.510 --> 01:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:14.149 --> 01:52:14.159 align:start position:0%
it was all political fighting there
 
01:52:15.990 --> 01:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
weren't any solutions so
 
01:52:17.910 --> 01:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
so they set up this independent base
 
01:52:20.070 --> 01:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
realignment and closure commission
 
01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
to kind of get out of the local politics
 
01:52:24.870 --> 01:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
and get an independent group
 
01:52:26.870 --> 01:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
to set up recommendations and their
 
01:52:28.709 --> 01:52:28.719 align:start position:0%
recommendations would be
 
01:52:30.790 --> 01:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
take all of it or none of it there
 
01:52:32.629 --> 01:52:32.639 align:start position:0%
wasn't any split and
 
01:52:34.550 --> 01:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
split in the baby it was just take all
 
01:52:35.910 --> 01:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
of it or none of it
 
01:52:39.350 --> 01:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
and i just wonder if if what your
 
01:52:40.149 --> 01:52:40.159 align:start position:0%
thoughts are
 
01:52:43.510 --> 01:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
are are we are we at a point where we
 
01:52:45.430 --> 01:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
maybe need to realize that we need
 
01:52:47.350 --> 01:52:47.360 align:start position:0%
something like a base realignment and
 
01:52:48.709 --> 01:52:48.719 align:start position:0%
closure commission
 
01:52:50.490 --> 01:52:50.500 align:start position:0%
to take a look at
 
01:52:50.500 --> 01:52:52.149 align:start position:0%
to take a look at
[Music]

01:52:52.149 --> 01:52:52.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:52:56.070 --> 01:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
establishing a sure path
 
01:52:57.750 --> 01:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
to doing what we know we need to do
 
01:52:59.109 --> 01:52:59.119 align:start position:0%
which is to
 
01:53:03.109 --> 01:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:05.270 --> 01:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
so that that's a very leading and hard
 
01:53:07.189 --> 01:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
question and i'm sorry for that
 
01:53:09.510 --> 01:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
now i mean i think i think it is
 
01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely time to take a hard look at
 
01:53:12.870 --> 01:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
that i do think as i said before the
 
01:53:14.310 --> 01:53:14.320 align:start position:0%
data is going to change in the next
 
01:53:15.589 --> 01:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
couple years based on the work that's
 
01:53:17.109 --> 01:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
currently happening so it's hard to make
 
01:53:18.470 --> 01:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
a decision today
 
01:53:20.870 --> 01:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
um to representative rogers point before
 
01:53:22.310 --> 01:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
right there have been multiple study
 
01:53:24.390 --> 01:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
commissions over the years that have
 
01:53:26.550 --> 01:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
that have not really yielded a
 
01:53:28.470 --> 01:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
comprehensive answer to this question
 
01:53:30.550 --> 01:53:30.560 align:start position:0%
um so one of the things i would be
 
01:53:31.910 --> 01:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
concerned about is
 
01:53:34.709 --> 01:53:34.719 align:start position:0%
is repeating something like that um to
 
01:53:36.310 --> 01:53:36.320 align:start position:0%
not actually yield a result
 
01:53:39.189 --> 01:53:39.199 align:start position:0%
but i do think it's time to to figure
 
01:53:39.199 --> 01:53:39.669 align:start position:0%
but i do think it's time to to figure
out

01:53:39.669 --> 01:53:39.679 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:53:42.390 --> 01:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
you know what that is and to um so you
 
01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:42.870 align:start position:0%
you know what that is and to um so you
know

01:53:42.870 --> 01:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:53:44.790 --> 01:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
something like that could be could be
 
01:53:46.310 --> 01:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
worthwhile i guess i just wanted to make
 
01:53:49.510 --> 01:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:52.790 --> 01:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
okay so we're we have 19 days to finish
 
01:53:52.800 --> 01:53:53.189 align:start position:0%
okay so we're we have 19 days to finish
our

01:53:53.189 --> 01:53:53.199 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:53:55.910 --> 01:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
our division three work and i would like
 
01:53:56.550 --> 01:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
to know
 
01:53:58.550 --> 01:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
if we should be doing anything different
 
01:53:59.830 --> 01:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
with year two
 
01:54:04.070 --> 01:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
of this budget um to either anticipate a
 
01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:05.189 align:start position:0%
of this budget um to either anticipate a
realignment

01:54:05.189 --> 01:54:05.199 align:start position:0%
realignment
 
01:54:09.030 --> 01:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
or to drive a realignment plan so
 
01:54:11.350 --> 01:54:11.360 align:start position:0%
if you could maybe think through it a
 
01:54:13.430 --> 01:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
little bit and try to give us
 
01:54:15.350 --> 01:54:15.360 align:start position:0%
sort of your your best projection of
 
01:54:17.149 --> 01:54:17.159 align:start position:0%
what we should be thinking about for
 
01:54:17.159 --> 01:54:18.950 align:start position:0%
what we should be thinking about for
fy23

01:54:18.950 --> 01:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
fy23
 
01:54:22.390 --> 01:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
um that would be great and
 
01:54:23.910 --> 01:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
and if that's not enough time to
 
01:54:25.910 --> 01:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
coordinate with the governor's office
 
01:54:27.750 --> 01:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
let us know and and tell us what you
 
01:54:27.760 --> 01:54:30.229 align:start position:0%
let us know and and tell us what you
need

01:54:30.229 --> 01:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:33.750 --> 01:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
please okay
 
01:54:37.589 --> 01:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
um all right so
 
01:54:39.830 --> 01:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
i don't see any questions did you answer
 
01:54:40.709 --> 01:54:40.719 align:start position:0%
all the
 
01:54:43.589 --> 01:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
pre-launch questions i had one more that
 
01:54:45.030 --> 01:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
i touched on a little bit but didn't
 
01:54:46.550 --> 01:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
answer comprehensively
 
01:54:48.070 --> 01:54:48.080 align:start position:0%
from representative walner about the
 
01:54:49.669 --> 01:54:49.679 align:start position:0%
assessments for youth entering
 
01:54:51.270 --> 01:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
residential care
 
01:54:53.030 --> 01:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
that is something that was recently
 
01:54:55.189 --> 01:54:55.199 align:start position:0%
procured i can't go into detail about it
 
01:54:57.109 --> 01:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
because it's not yet
 
01:54:59.350 --> 01:54:59.360 align:start position:0%
in final phase with governor and council
 
01:55:01.030 --> 01:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
but i can talk about the concept
 
01:55:04.390 --> 01:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
which is that under senate bill 14 and
 
01:55:05.589 --> 01:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
under this
 
01:55:08.550 --> 01:55:08.560 align:start position:0%
newly procured system all youth who are
 
01:55:11.030 --> 01:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
going to enter residential care
 
01:55:14.390 --> 01:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
um will have a comprehensive clinical
 
01:55:15.589 --> 01:55:15.599 align:start position:0%
assessment which will include
 
01:55:17.189 --> 01:55:17.199 align:start position:0%
something called the cans the child and
 
01:55:19.430 --> 01:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
adolescent needs and strengths tool
 
01:55:21.270 --> 01:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
as well as a psychosocial which can
 
01:55:23.270 --> 01:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
advise as to whether that
 
01:55:25.750 --> 01:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
clinically requires residential care and
 
01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
if they do what level of residential
 
01:55:28.870 --> 01:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
care they do require
 
01:55:30.629 --> 01:55:30.639 align:start position:0%
for youth who are placed emergently
 
01:55:32.149 --> 01:55:32.159 align:start position:0%
that's going to have to happen after the
 
01:55:33.430 --> 01:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
emergent placement
 
01:55:35.669 --> 01:55:35.679 align:start position:0%
but the plan the idea is that in most
 
01:55:37.189 --> 01:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
instances that can be done before a
 
01:55:38.950 --> 01:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
placement is made
 
01:55:40.629 --> 01:55:40.639 align:start position:0%
while you try to temporarily stabilize
 
01:55:42.149 --> 01:55:42.159 align:start position:0%
the youth in the community before making
 
01:55:43.910 --> 01:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
that decision
 
01:55:46.709 --> 01:55:46.719 align:start position:0%
that will impact sysc the other key
 
01:55:48.229 --> 01:55:48.239 align:start position:0%
component of the system of care that's
 
01:55:49.750 --> 01:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
impactful here is the use of a care
 
01:55:51.990 --> 01:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
management entity
 
01:55:53.990 --> 01:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
right now there are two nfi and i can't
 
01:55:55.030 --> 01:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
remember the name of the other one that
 
01:55:58.310 --> 01:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:59.830 --> 01:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
but what they do is they use a high
 
01:56:01.430 --> 01:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
fidelity wraparound model
 
01:56:03.350 --> 01:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
to pull together the folks who are
 
01:56:05.270 --> 01:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
important in that youth's life
 
01:56:08.709 --> 01:56:08.719 align:start position:0%
to oversee what's happening not only
 
01:56:10.229 --> 01:56:10.239 align:start position:0%
while the residential episode is
 
01:56:12.390 --> 01:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
occurring that includes sysc in this
 
01:56:13.589 --> 01:56:13.599 align:start position:0%
future state
 
01:56:15.750 --> 01:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
but also more importantly to support the
 
01:56:17.350 --> 01:56:17.360 align:start position:0%
discharge planning and to ensure that
 
01:56:18.870 --> 01:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
when youth return home
 
01:56:20.950 --> 01:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
that they have the care that they need
 
01:56:22.470 --> 01:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
to remain at home
 
01:56:24.149 --> 01:56:24.159 align:start position:0%
and not recidivate back into the
 
01:56:26.550 --> 01:56:26.560 align:start position:0%
residential system or sysc
 
01:56:29.350 --> 01:56:29.360 align:start position:0%
those key components are are identical
 
01:56:31.030 --> 01:56:31.040 align:start position:0%
to the models that we used in new jersey
 
01:56:32.470 --> 01:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
which were successful
 
01:56:34.870 --> 01:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
in driving down the utilization of
 
01:56:35.910 --> 01:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
congregate care
 
01:56:38.629 --> 01:56:38.639 align:start position:0%
and recidivism within those programs so
 
01:56:40.070 --> 01:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
those are components i'm really excited
 
01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:40.550 align:start position:0%
those are components i'm really excited
about

01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:40.560 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:56:42.550 --> 01:56:42.560 align:start position:0%
i think they will be impactful both on
 
01:56:44.149 --> 01:56:44.159 align:start position:0%
the broader residential system but also
 
01:56:45.990 --> 01:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
on sysc because both of them will be
 
01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:47.030 align:start position:0%
on sysc because both of them will be
used

01:56:47.030 --> 01:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
used
 
01:56:51.430 --> 01:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
across the spectrum inclusive of sysc
 
01:56:53.589 --> 01:56:53.599 align:start position:0%
and i think that was all the questions i
 
01:56:55.109 --> 01:56:55.119 align:start position:0%
received before but if i missed any
 
01:56:55.119 --> 01:56:56.550 align:start position:0%
received before but if i missed any
please

01:56:56.550 --> 01:56:56.560 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:56:59.830 --> 01:56:59.840 align:start position:0%
remind me representative
 
01:57:03.510 --> 01:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
do you have a question i i do um
 
01:57:06.870 --> 01:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
when you do the assessment is done on
 
01:57:10.070 --> 01:57:10.080 align:start position:0%
children who are detained as
 
01:57:11.589 --> 01:57:11.599 align:start position:0%
well as those who have already been
 
01:57:11.599 --> 01:57:13.589 align:start position:0%
well as those who have already been
adjudicated

01:57:13.589 --> 01:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
adjudicated
 
01:57:15.589 --> 01:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
yeah and it's actually broader than that
 
01:57:16.709 --> 01:57:16.719 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
01:57:19.510 --> 01:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
it is the the idea is that we want to we
 
01:57:20.950 --> 01:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
want to understand the clinical needs of
 
01:57:22.149 --> 01:57:22.159 align:start position:0%
youth when they're entering these
 
01:57:23.270 --> 01:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
restrictive settings
 
01:57:24.790 --> 01:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
regardless of where they appear within
 
01:57:27.189 --> 01:57:27.199 align:start position:0%
the system right so it could be
 
01:57:29.189 --> 01:57:29.199 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice that are going to
 
01:57:30.790 --> 01:57:30.800 align:start position:0%
residential care without a detention or
 
01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:31.350 align:start position:0%
residential care without a detention or
commitment

01:57:31.350 --> 01:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
commitment
 
01:57:32.629 --> 01:57:32.639 align:start position:0%
it could be youth who are being retained
 
01:57:34.310 --> 01:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
committed it could be used in child
 
01:57:35.589 --> 01:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
protection system
 
01:57:37.270 --> 01:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
it could even be youth who don't touch
 
01:57:38.629 --> 01:57:38.639 align:start position:0%
either of those systems and through
 
01:57:39.830 --> 01:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
children's behavioral health are
 
01:57:41.189 --> 01:57:41.199 align:start position:0%
accessing that care
 
01:57:43.990 --> 01:57:44.000 align:start position:0%
but the idea is that frankly these kids
 
01:57:45.189 --> 01:57:45.199 align:start position:0%
no matter where they're appearing within
 
01:57:46.149 --> 01:57:46.159 align:start position:0%
the system
 
01:57:49.510 --> 01:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
have comparable challenges and we need
 
01:57:51.030 --> 01:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
to have a uniform way to understand
 
01:57:51.990 --> 01:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
those challenges
 
01:57:54.470 --> 01:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
and to meet their needs one of the
 
01:57:56.149 --> 01:57:56.159 align:start position:0%
really beautiful things about using a
 
01:57:57.669 --> 01:57:57.679 align:start position:0%
tool like the cans which we actually
 
01:57:59.589 --> 01:57:59.599 align:start position:0%
have future plans of using it in other
 
01:58:00.950 --> 01:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
aspects of the system
 
01:58:02.709 --> 01:58:02.719 align:start position:0%
is it creates a common language among
 
01:58:04.790 --> 01:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
service providers to understand
 
01:58:06.629 --> 01:58:06.639 align:start position:0%
what needs are and how to develop
 
01:58:08.629 --> 01:58:08.639 align:start position:0%
treatment plans and then continuity of
 
01:58:08.639 --> 01:58:09.030 align:start position:0%
treatment plans and then continuity of
care

01:58:09.030 --> 01:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:58:11.189 --> 01:58:11.199 align:start position:0%
across different aspects of the system
 
01:58:12.709 --> 01:58:12.719 align:start position:0%
the other really important thing about
 
01:58:13.589 --> 01:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
all of this is that
 
01:58:15.270 --> 01:58:15.280 align:start position:0%
housing it within children's behavioral
 
01:58:18.470 --> 01:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
health rather than housing it with dcyf
 
01:58:20.629 --> 01:58:20.639 align:start position:0%
child protection or juvenile justice
 
01:58:22.310 --> 01:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
allows for child protection juvenile
 
01:58:23.910 --> 01:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
justice to walk away
 
01:58:26.070 --> 01:58:26.080 align:start position:0%
when our delinquency issues or our abuse
 
01:58:27.669 --> 01:58:27.679 align:start position:0%
and neglect issues are resolved but it
 
01:58:29.189 --> 01:58:29.199 align:start position:0%
allows that family to continue to get
 
01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
care through the children's behavioral
 
01:58:31.510 --> 01:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
health care system
 
01:58:33.669 --> 01:58:33.679 align:start position:0%
if that child still has a clinical need
 
01:58:34.550 --> 01:58:34.560 align:start position:0%
to be met
 
01:58:36.149 --> 01:58:36.159 align:start position:0%
what we see a lot of today and this is
 
01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
going to help drive down caseloads in
 
01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:38.629 align:start position:0%
going to help drive down caseloads in
dcyf

01:58:38.629 --> 01:58:38.639 align:start position:0%
dcyf
 
01:58:40.229 --> 01:58:40.239 align:start position:0%
is kids that get stuck in our system
 
01:58:41.750 --> 01:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
because they have a service need even
 
01:58:43.350 --> 01:58:43.360 align:start position:0%
though the underlying abuse and neglect
 
01:58:44.709 --> 01:58:44.719 align:start position:0%
issue is resolved or the underlying
 
01:58:46.950 --> 01:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
delinquency issue was resolved
 
01:58:48.950 --> 01:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
so a lot of this is about trying to get
 
01:58:50.310 --> 01:58:50.320 align:start position:0%
kids and families
 
01:58:52.149 --> 01:58:52.159 align:start position:0%
in the most supportive setting the least
 
01:58:53.750 --> 01:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
restrictive setting the same way that we
 
01:58:54.950 --> 01:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
think about kids in the enter
 
01:58:56.310 --> 01:58:56.320 align:start position:0%
residential settings being in the least
 
01:58:58.310 --> 01:58:58.320 align:start position:0%
restrictive setting
 
01:59:01.430 --> 01:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm not seeing any more
 
01:59:02.629 --> 01:59:02.639 align:start position:0%
questions if you want to
 
01:59:05.910 --> 01:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
get get us back uh on the path with your
 
01:59:05.920 --> 01:59:07.109 align:start position:0%
get get us back uh on the path with your
slideshow

01:59:07.109 --> 01:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
slideshow
 
01:59:09.109 --> 01:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
i'll pull up the screen shot give me one
 
01:59:09.119 --> 01:59:15.589 align:start position:0%
i'll pull up the screen shot give me one
second

01:59:15.589 --> 01:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:19.430 --> 01:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:27.589 --> 01:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:35.350 --> 01:59:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:37.030 --> 01:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
all right so we touched on a lot of this
 
01:59:38.709 --> 01:59:38.719 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to just go pretty quickly
 
01:59:41.350 --> 01:59:41.360 align:start position:0%
but people may have questions
 
01:59:42.790 --> 01:59:42.800 align:start position:0%
we've done a lot in the last two years
 
01:59:44.390 --> 01:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
we've been incredibly busy
 
01:59:46.629 --> 01:59:46.639 align:start position:0%
um thankful for the support that we've
 
01:59:47.990 --> 01:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
received in the past really three years
 
01:59:49.109 --> 01:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
since i've been here
 
01:59:50.629 --> 01:59:50.639 align:start position:0%
to do all of this work from the
 
01:59:52.149 --> 01:59:52.159 align:start position:0%
legislature from both parties in the
 
01:59:53.910 --> 01:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
legislature from the governor from hosts
 
01:59:54.870 --> 01:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
of people
 
01:59:57.189 --> 01:59:57.199 align:start position:0%
interested in this work so it's hard to
 
01:59:58.950 --> 01:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
fit all this onto a slide
 
02:00:01.030 --> 02:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
but just really quickly some of the key
 
02:00:01.040 --> 02:00:02.470 align:start position:0%
but just really quickly some of the key
accomplishments

02:00:02.470 --> 02:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
accomplishments
 
02:00:05.430 --> 02:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
um restoring kind of core functionality
 
02:00:05.440 --> 02:00:05.830 align:start position:0%
um restoring kind of core functionality
of

02:00:05.830 --> 02:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:00:07.910 --> 02:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
the child protection system and further
 
02:00:09.510 --> 02:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
progressing within that we talked about
 
02:00:11.350 --> 02:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
the changes that are happening in intake
 
02:00:12.790 --> 02:00:12.800 align:start position:0%
and how we're seeing that play out in
 
02:00:15.910 --> 02:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
our data another key accomplishment was
 
02:00:17.750 --> 02:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
redesigning our actuarial tools that we
 
02:00:20.950 --> 02:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
use to assess risk and need in families
 
02:00:22.790 --> 02:00:22.800 align:start position:0%
both at intake but actually throughout
 
02:00:24.550 --> 02:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
the life of a child protection case you
 
02:00:25.990 --> 02:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
use these
 
02:00:27.589 --> 02:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
these actuarial tools to make key
 
02:00:30.070 --> 02:00:30.080 align:start position:0%
decisions those have been redesigned
 
02:00:32.870 --> 02:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
validated they need to be built into our
 
02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:33.589 align:start position:0%
validated they need to be built into our
new

02:00:33.589 --> 02:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
new
 
02:00:35.189 --> 02:00:35.199 align:start position:0%
case management system which is you know
 
02:00:37.589 --> 02:00:37.599 align:start position:0%
currently under development
 
02:00:40.390 --> 02:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
reducing case improving processes and
 
02:00:41.669 --> 02:00:41.679 align:start position:0%
timeliness for child protection
 
02:00:41.679 --> 02:00:42.790 align:start position:0%
timeliness for child protection
assessments

02:00:42.790 --> 02:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
assessments
 
02:00:44.390 --> 02:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
and the safety culture work and the
 
02:00:45.990 --> 02:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
clinical support staff that we spoke
 
02:00:46.870 --> 02:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
about before
 
02:00:48.470 --> 02:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
which appears to be helping reduce
 
02:00:48.480 --> 02:00:50.310 align:start position:0%
which appears to be helping reduce
turnover

02:00:50.310 --> 02:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
turnover
 
02:00:51.750 --> 02:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
other key things that are underway that
 
02:00:53.990 --> 02:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
i'm really excited about a service array
 
02:00:55.589 --> 02:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
redesigned to introduce evidence-based
 
02:00:55.599 --> 02:00:56.629 align:start position:0%
redesigned to introduce evidence-based
practices

02:00:56.629 --> 02:00:56.639 align:start position:0%
practices
 
02:00:58.149 --> 02:00:58.159 align:start position:0%
this started on the date that the
 
02:00:59.910 --> 02:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
continuing resolution ended
 
02:01:02.950 --> 02:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
we issued a request for information to
 
02:01:05.189 --> 02:01:05.199 align:start position:0%
the public to ask for information around
 
02:01:06.550 --> 02:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
how should we be redesigning the
 
02:01:08.149 --> 02:01:08.159 align:start position:0%
services that we offer to families we
 
02:01:10.709 --> 02:01:10.719 align:start position:0%
received a record 40 responses to that
 
02:01:12.390 --> 02:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
we then took that information and used
 
02:01:13.910 --> 02:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
that to make decisions about what type
 
02:01:15.430 --> 02:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
of evidence-based models we want to
 
02:01:17.669 --> 02:01:17.679 align:start position:0%
bring into our system
 
02:01:18.950 --> 02:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
and to start phasing out some of the
 
02:01:20.470 --> 02:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
non-evidence-based practices that we've
 
02:01:21.510 --> 02:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
been using for
 
02:01:24.470 --> 02:01:24.480 align:start position:0%
decades the first of those things what
 
02:01:25.990 --> 02:01:26.000 align:start position:0%
we call community-based voluntary
 
02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:27.030 align:start position:0%
we call community-based voluntary
services

02:01:27.030 --> 02:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:01:28.229 --> 02:01:28.239 align:start position:0%
this was something that was funded in
 
02:01:29.669 --> 02:01:29.679 align:start position:0%
the last biennium and is funded
 
02:01:30.790 --> 02:01:30.800 align:start position:0%
continued in the
 
02:01:33.830 --> 02:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
in the proposed budget this is i think
 
02:01:35.270 --> 02:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
one of the most impactful things we're
 
02:01:36.550 --> 02:01:36.560 align:start position:0%
going to do on the child protection side
 
02:01:37.669 --> 02:01:37.679 align:start position:0%
of the house
 
02:01:40.790 --> 02:01:40.800 align:start position:0%
and what it does is it will allow us to
 
02:01:40.800 --> 02:01:41.430 align:start position:0%
and what it does is it will allow us to
refer

02:01:41.430 --> 02:01:41.440 align:start position:0%
refer
 
02:01:43.189 --> 02:01:43.199 align:start position:0%
a high-risk family to a community
 
02:01:45.589 --> 02:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
provider for that community provider to
 
02:01:46.870 --> 02:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
work with that family to try to
 
02:01:48.470 --> 02:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
stabilize them to prevent them from
 
02:01:49.990 --> 02:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
coming back to dcyf
 
02:01:51.589 --> 02:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
so let me pause on that because it's
 
02:01:53.270 --> 02:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
it's complex and it's really really
 
02:01:54.790 --> 02:01:54.800 align:start position:0%
important to our system
 
02:01:56.709 --> 02:01:56.719 align:start position:0%
i spoke a moment ago about the actuarial
 
02:01:58.310 --> 02:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
tools that we use one of them is a risk
 
02:01:58.320 --> 02:01:59.430 align:start position:0%
tools that we use one of them is a risk
assessment

02:01:59.430 --> 02:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
02:02:01.589 --> 02:02:01.599 align:start position:0%
when we conduct these risk assessments
 
02:02:03.270 --> 02:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
about a third
 
02:02:05.030 --> 02:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
of our families come back as being high
 
02:02:06.629 --> 02:02:06.639 align:start position:0%
or very high risk meaning that there's a
 
02:02:08.229 --> 02:02:08.239 align:start position:0%
high likelihood according to that tool
 
02:02:09.270 --> 02:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
that they're going to come back into the
 
02:02:10.709 --> 02:02:10.719 align:start position:0%
child protection system
 
02:02:14.550 --> 02:02:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:16.149 --> 02:02:16.159 align:start position:0%
however when we make a finding of abuse
 
02:02:17.589 --> 02:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
or neglect only about 10
 
02:02:19.030 --> 02:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
of those families are actually found to
 
02:02:20.629 --> 02:02:20.639 align:start position:0%
have already committed an act of abuse
 
02:02:21.430 --> 02:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
or neglect
 
02:02:23.589 --> 02:02:23.599 align:start position:0%
a finding of abuse or neglect is really
 
02:02:26.070 --> 02:02:26.080 align:start position:0%
a reactive way to respond to it whereas
 
02:02:27.830 --> 02:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
assessing risk and trying to
 
02:02:29.830 --> 02:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
treat risk is a more proactive way to do
 
02:02:31.510 --> 02:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
it so about 23
 
02:02:33.430 --> 02:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
of the families we see in a given year
 
02:02:35.270 --> 02:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
are high risk but historically we would
 
02:02:36.629 --> 02:02:36.639 align:start position:0%
not have been allowed to do anything for
 
02:02:37.910 --> 02:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
them and we wouldn't have had a service
 
02:02:38.790 --> 02:02:38.800 align:start position:0%
for them
 
02:02:40.390 --> 02:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
what this community-based voluntary
 
02:02:42.149 --> 02:02:42.159 align:start position:0%
services will do is we use that risk
 
02:02:42.159 --> 02:02:43.109 align:start position:0%
services will do is we use that risk
assessment

02:02:43.109 --> 02:02:43.119 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
02:02:44.790 --> 02:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
we identify these are the families that
 
02:02:46.470 --> 02:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
are high and very high risk
 
02:02:48.870 --> 02:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
we refer those families to our provider
 
02:02:51.109 --> 02:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
we contracted it was approved by gnc in
 
02:02:53.030 --> 02:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
november with two providers waypoint for
 
02:02:54.390 --> 02:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
most of the state
 
02:02:56.149 --> 02:02:56.159 align:start position:0%
and the family resource center in gorham
 
02:02:57.589 --> 02:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
for the north country
 
02:03:00.950 --> 02:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
those providers then open up open up a
 
02:03:02.390 --> 02:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
case to work with those families using
 
02:03:03.750 --> 02:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
two evidence-based modalities
 
02:03:04.790 --> 02:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
motivational interviewing and
 
02:03:06.149 --> 02:03:06.159 align:start position:0%
solution-based case work
 
02:03:07.830 --> 02:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
to try to understand and address those
 
02:03:10.070 --> 02:03:10.080 align:start position:0%
families needs try to ensure that those
 
02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:10.709 align:start position:0%
families needs try to ensure that those
families

02:03:10.709 --> 02:03:10.719 align:start position:0%
families
 
02:03:12.629 --> 02:03:12.639 align:start position:0%
are stable and that we don't get another
 
02:03:14.790 --> 02:03:14.800 align:start position:0%
call back to dcyf
 
02:03:17.030 --> 02:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
we get a lot of clients and families
 
02:03:18.310 --> 02:03:18.320 align:start position:0%
that come through our doors over and
 
02:03:19.830 --> 02:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
over again this is a key way to break
 
02:03:20.790 --> 02:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
that cycle
 
02:03:22.470 --> 02:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
and when i spoke earlier representative
 
02:03:24.229 --> 02:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
edwards about our ability to drive down
 
02:03:25.669 --> 02:03:25.679 align:start position:0%
the number of family crises
 
02:03:27.109 --> 02:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
that have kids coming into out-of-home
 
02:03:29.189 --> 02:03:29.199 align:start position:0%
care this is one of the key tools to do
 
02:03:29.199 --> 02:03:30.149 align:start position:0%
care this is one of the key tools to do
that

02:03:30.149 --> 02:03:30.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:03:32.390 --> 02:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
um another key accomplishment the link
 
02:03:33.750 --> 02:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
is here i would suggest can you
 
02:03:35.910 --> 02:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
focus if you take a breath can you take
 
02:03:37.830 --> 02:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
a breath there i i
 
02:03:40.070 --> 02:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
as you were as you're talking i was
 
02:03:40.080 --> 02:03:42.470 align:start position:0%
as you were as you're talking i was
thinking

02:03:42.470 --> 02:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
02:03:45.669 --> 02:03:45.679 align:start position:0%
about any sort of control
 
02:03:47.830 --> 02:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
systems that would need to be put into
 
02:03:49.669 --> 02:03:49.679 align:start position:0%
place in advance
 
02:03:53.189 --> 02:03:53.199 align:start position:0%
to avoid fraud waste and abuse
 
02:03:57.430 --> 02:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
so once you once you get a risk-based
 
02:04:00.950 --> 02:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
actuarial risk assessment
 
02:04:04.069 --> 02:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
uh you you document
 
02:04:07.350 --> 02:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
what questions and answers result
 
02:04:11.030 --> 02:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
to the most risk and the more risk that
 
02:04:11.750 --> 02:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
you have
 
02:04:13.270 --> 02:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
the more likely you are to get
 
02:04:15.669 --> 02:04:15.679 align:start position:0%
additional government benefits
 
02:04:19.350 --> 02:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
and so just thinking like
 
02:04:21.350 --> 02:04:21.360 align:start position:0%
you know somebody who might want to take
 
02:04:23.669 --> 02:04:23.679 align:start position:0%
advantage of the system
 
02:04:26.229 --> 02:04:26.239 align:start position:0%
i might want to learn how to gain this
 
02:04:26.239 --> 02:04:26.950 align:start position:0%
i might want to learn how to gain this
risk

02:04:26.950 --> 02:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
risk
 
02:04:29.750 --> 02:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
assessment so that my risk score goes
 
02:04:32.149 --> 02:04:32.159 align:start position:0%
way up and so you start paying for my
 
02:04:32.159 --> 02:04:33.669 align:start position:0%
way up and so you start paying for my
apartment

02:04:33.669 --> 02:04:33.679 align:start position:0%
apartment
 
02:04:37.030 --> 02:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
um i i think that's highly unlikely for
 
02:04:38.790 --> 02:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
this service line this is a service line
 
02:04:39.750 --> 02:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
where what you have
 
02:04:42.149 --> 02:04:42.159 align:start position:0%
offered to you is a social worker who's
 
02:04:44.229 --> 02:04:44.239 align:start position:0%
working with you on parenting skills
 
02:04:46.149 --> 02:04:46.159 align:start position:0%
working with you on navigating you know
 
02:04:47.510 --> 02:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
other systems
 
02:04:50.310 --> 02:04:50.320 align:start position:0%
it's not to pay for your rent or to
 
02:04:50.320 --> 02:04:50.790 align:start position:0%
it's not to pay for your rent or to
provide

02:04:50.790 --> 02:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
provide
 
02:04:52.470 --> 02:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
you know some type of concrete service
 
02:04:54.310 --> 02:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
like that it's a this is a tool to try
 
02:04:54.320 --> 02:04:54.870 align:start position:0%
like that it's a this is a tool to try
to

02:04:54.870 --> 02:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:04:57.750 --> 02:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
understand families who are lacking the
 
02:04:59.350 --> 02:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
parental skills to keep kids safe at
 
02:04:59.360 --> 02:05:00.069 align:start position:0%
parental skills to keep kids safe at
home

02:05:00.069 --> 02:05:00.079 align:start position:0%
home
 
02:05:01.669 --> 02:05:01.679 align:start position:0%
and then providing the services that
 
02:05:05.589 --> 02:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
help remedy those situations
 
02:05:08.390 --> 02:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
when you say services i i'm thinking at
 
02:05:09.990 --> 02:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
some point those services are
 
02:05:12.149 --> 02:05:12.159 align:start position:0%
considered valuable or beneficial to the
 
02:05:12.159 --> 02:05:13.430 align:start position:0%
considered valuable or beneficial to the
recipient

02:05:13.430 --> 02:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
recipient
 
02:05:15.830 --> 02:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
and and therefore it has an equivalent
 
02:05:17.830 --> 02:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
of a monetary value
 
02:05:20.870 --> 02:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
and so therefore you know thinking of
 
02:05:23.030 --> 02:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
gaming the system
 
02:05:25.109 --> 02:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
what why why isn't there an incentive
 
02:05:27.270 --> 02:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
there to gain the system unless
 
02:05:29.350 --> 02:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
the only service you think i'm going to
 
02:05:31.830 --> 02:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
get is additional counseling
 
02:05:33.430 --> 02:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
i don't think there is an incentive to
 
02:05:35.830 --> 02:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
gain the system here
 
02:05:37.350 --> 02:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
i don't think this type of service is
 
02:05:39.030 --> 02:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
the type that would that would attract
 
02:05:40.310 --> 02:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
that type of
 
02:05:42.310 --> 02:05:42.320 align:start position:0%
that type of response from from a client
 
02:05:43.910 --> 02:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
i don't think someone is going to
 
02:05:45.910 --> 02:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
present as having issues of domestic
 
02:05:47.350 --> 02:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
violence and substance use when they
 
02:05:48.950 --> 02:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
don't for the purpose of having an extra
 
02:05:51.750 --> 02:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
counselor in their house
 
02:05:54.310 --> 02:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
all right no you answered my question
 
02:05:55.270 --> 02:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
because i'm i'm
 
02:05:58.390 --> 02:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
i i every time you hear services
 
02:06:00.709 --> 02:06:00.719 align:start position:0%
i hear services i'm just wondering
 
02:06:02.069 --> 02:06:02.079 align:start position:0%
exactly what the nature of those
 
02:06:03.430 --> 02:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
services are
 
02:06:06.470 --> 02:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
and whether they would be worth lying on
 
02:06:07.830 --> 02:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
an assessment
 
02:06:11.270 --> 02:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
to get them understand thank you
 
02:06:14.550 --> 02:06:14.560 align:start position:0%
all right um the i put a link here for
 
02:06:15.669 --> 02:06:15.679 align:start position:0%
this i think this is something worth
 
02:06:15.679 --> 02:06:15.990 align:start position:0%
this i think this is something worth
looking

02:06:15.990 --> 02:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
looking
 
02:06:18.550 --> 02:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
at this is the um we put forward a
 
02:06:20.310 --> 02:06:20.320 align:start position:0%
procurement forecast on a host of
 
02:06:21.910 --> 02:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
evidence-based programs that we intend
 
02:06:23.669 --> 02:06:23.679 align:start position:0%
to procure within the next year
 
02:06:26.390 --> 02:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
one of them is currently currently out
 
02:06:28.870 --> 02:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
for a bit called multisystemic therapy
 
02:06:30.550 --> 02:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
there's a few more on that list i would
 
02:06:32.149 --> 02:06:32.159 align:start position:0%
i do think anybody that's interested
 
02:06:34.390 --> 02:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
would benefit from taking a look at that
 
02:06:36.629 --> 02:06:36.639 align:start position:0%
but basically what we're doing is we're
 
02:06:38.390 --> 02:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
shifting from a model that we currently
 
02:06:39.750 --> 02:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
have in this state
 
02:06:41.109 --> 02:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
which is that we kind of have a
 
02:06:42.790 --> 02:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
one-size-fits-all approach
 
02:06:45.189 --> 02:06:45.199 align:start position:0%
to clinical services to our families
 
02:06:46.790 --> 02:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
recognizing that those
 
02:06:48.390 --> 02:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
services are not evidence-based there's
 
02:06:50.550 --> 02:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
not evidence to show that they actually
 
02:06:50.560 --> 02:06:52.069 align:start position:0%
not evidence to show that they actually
work

02:06:52.069 --> 02:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:06:53.669 --> 02:06:53.679 align:start position:0%
and that there are models out there that
 
02:06:55.109 --> 02:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
are evidence-based and actually are
 
02:06:57.189 --> 02:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
proven to work
 
02:06:59.270 --> 02:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
so that funding forecast lists forward
 
02:07:00.470 --> 02:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
five different models that we're looking
 
02:07:02.229 --> 02:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
to expand into the next year
 
02:07:05.109 --> 02:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
this is going to be largely um replacing
 
02:07:07.109 --> 02:07:07.119 align:start position:0%
the other services that that are offered
 
02:07:08.470 --> 02:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
to families
 
02:07:10.310 --> 02:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
so it's there is funding in the
 
02:07:11.669 --> 02:07:11.679 align:start position:0%
governor's budget
 
02:07:14.310 --> 02:07:14.320 align:start position:0%
proposed budget to cover those costs but
 
02:07:15.589 --> 02:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
it's not like we're building a new
 
02:07:16.950 --> 02:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
service that's going to be added on top
 
02:07:18.390 --> 02:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
of the old service it's a new service
 
02:07:19.589 --> 02:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
that's going to be offered instead of
 
02:07:21.350 --> 02:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
the old service so it's not a
 
02:07:23.350 --> 02:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
it's not a fully new program or a new
 
02:07:27.510 --> 02:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
new funding program in that way um
 
02:07:30.629 --> 02:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
other major uh accomplishments
 
02:07:33.669 --> 02:07:33.679 align:start position:0%
um we did expand foster care for youth
 
02:07:35.510 --> 02:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
who choose to remain in foster care up
 
02:07:38.950 --> 02:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
to age 21 in the last biennium
 
02:07:41.109 --> 02:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
that our youth named that program the
 
02:07:42.069 --> 02:07:42.079 align:start position:0%
hope program
 
02:07:44.790 --> 02:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
as is identified in here this allows
 
02:07:46.709 --> 02:07:46.719 align:start position:0%
young people who would otherwise age out
 
02:07:48.149 --> 02:07:48.159 align:start position:0%
of care at age 18
 
02:07:50.310 --> 02:07:50.320 align:start position:0%
to stay in foster care up to 21 if they
 
02:07:51.430 --> 02:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
choose to
 
02:07:53.830 --> 02:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
um recognizing that a lot of young
 
02:07:55.510 --> 02:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
people who enter the foster care system
 
02:07:58.870 --> 02:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
would age out are not ready for full
 
02:08:01.589 --> 02:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
full independence into adulthood without
 
02:08:04.229 --> 02:08:04.239 align:start position:0%
some additional support in place
 
02:08:05.750 --> 02:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
we implemented another evidence-based
 
02:08:07.589 --> 02:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
model called yv life set why these
 
02:08:09.430 --> 02:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
stands for youth villages which is the
 
02:08:11.750 --> 02:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
entity that that developed the model
 
02:08:13.430 --> 02:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
this is a model for transition
 
02:08:15.430 --> 02:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
aged youth to try to help them
 
02:08:17.430 --> 02:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
successfully move to adulthood
 
02:08:19.109 --> 02:08:19.119 align:start position:0%
work with them on whatever their
 
02:08:21.189 --> 02:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
identified goals are
 
02:08:22.790 --> 02:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
and in attaining those goals so they can
 
02:08:25.030 --> 02:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
be independent into adulthood
 
02:08:26.950 --> 02:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
um we were awarded a grant to pay for
 
02:08:28.149 --> 02:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
half of the cost of that
 
02:08:29.910 --> 02:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
program and the other half of the cost
 
02:08:33.030 --> 02:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
is contracted with the with the vendor
 
02:08:36.310 --> 02:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
and then lastly in this area we've been
 
02:08:38.870 --> 02:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
very successful in the past couple years
 
02:08:40.069 --> 02:08:40.079 align:start position:0%
in the first time for new hampshire
 
02:08:41.830 --> 02:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
although this is not new nationally
 
02:08:43.350 --> 02:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
being able to partner in with housing
 
02:08:45.030 --> 02:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
authorities to get access to housing
 
02:08:46.629 --> 02:08:46.639 align:start position:0%
vouchers for young people who are aging
 
02:08:48.229 --> 02:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
out of foster care
 
02:08:50.470 --> 02:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
trying to positively impact the the
 
02:08:52.069 --> 02:08:52.079 align:start position:0%
prevalence of youth homelessness
 
02:08:53.669 --> 02:08:53.679 align:start position:0%
particularly for kids who are part of
 
02:08:56.229 --> 02:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
the foster care system
 
02:08:58.390 --> 02:08:58.400 align:start position:0%
beyond that some other programming that
 
02:09:00.069 --> 02:09:00.079 align:start position:0%
we're very excited about
 
02:09:02.069 --> 02:09:02.079 align:start position:0%
um in the past few years we started up
 
02:09:03.669 --> 02:09:03.679 align:start position:0%
something called the strength to succeed
 
02:09:05.990 --> 02:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
program this is pure support for parents
 
02:09:08.709 --> 02:09:08.719 align:start position:0%
with substance use disorder
 
02:09:12.069 --> 02:09:12.079 align:start position:0%
this has been incredibly successful
 
02:09:15.430 --> 02:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
we have what this does is it connects
 
02:09:17.030 --> 02:09:17.040 align:start position:0%
a parent who has a substance use
 
02:09:19.430 --> 02:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
disorder with another parent who has
 
02:09:22.470 --> 02:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
um successfully gone through that
 
02:09:23.750 --> 02:09:23.760 align:start position:0%
challenge and many of whom have
 
02:09:23.760 --> 02:09:24.870 align:start position:0%
challenge and many of whom have
successfully

02:09:24.870 --> 02:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
successfully
 
02:09:27.189 --> 02:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
come through the child protection system
 
02:09:28.790 --> 02:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
and we really find it helpful in getting
 
02:09:29.910 --> 02:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
those parents
 
02:09:31.510 --> 02:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
the care and support that they need so
 
02:09:32.709 --> 02:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
that they can actually successfully
 
02:09:34.390 --> 02:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
reunify with their kids instead of their
 
02:09:36.069 --> 02:09:36.079 align:start position:0%
kids having to be
 
02:09:37.589 --> 02:09:37.599 align:start position:0%
having their rights terminated and
 
02:09:39.750 --> 02:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
having those young people end up in
 
02:09:41.910 --> 02:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
um and you know needing adoption or
 
02:09:44.629 --> 02:09:44.639 align:start position:0%
long-term foster care
 
02:09:46.310 --> 02:09:46.320 align:start position:0%
the m laidac and family violence
 
02:09:47.990 --> 02:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
specialist programs have been expanded
 
02:09:49.350 --> 02:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
over the past couple years
 
02:09:52.629 --> 02:09:52.639 align:start position:0%
the m ladakh program master's license um
 
02:09:54.550 --> 02:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
alcohol and drug counselor program those
 
02:09:56.229 --> 02:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
are emblatax who are
 
02:09:57.910 --> 02:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
in normal times physically co-located
 
02:09:59.270 --> 02:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
with our staff but right now virtually
 
02:10:00.870 --> 02:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
co-located with our staff
 
02:10:04.790 --> 02:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
to assist our staff in identifying
 
02:10:06.310 --> 02:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
when families have substance use
 
02:10:08.709 --> 02:10:08.719 align:start position:0%
challenges and connecting those
 
02:10:09.910 --> 02:10:09.920 align:start position:0%
families to the right supports and
 
02:10:12.390 --> 02:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
services to to address those substance
 
02:10:13.510 --> 02:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
use challenges
 
02:10:14.950 --> 02:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
and the family violence specialists
 
02:10:16.310 --> 02:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
which are co-located in our district
 
02:10:17.830 --> 02:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
offices those are folks who work with
 
02:10:19.430 --> 02:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
the local crisis centers
 
02:10:21.510 --> 02:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
and help our staff in understanding the
 
02:10:23.109 --> 02:10:23.119 align:start position:0%
dynamics of family violence and
 
02:10:25.510 --> 02:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
connecting victims of family violence
 
02:10:27.589 --> 02:10:27.599 align:start position:0%
to those crisis center services to try
 
02:10:28.629 --> 02:10:28.639 align:start position:0%
to stabilize
 
02:10:30.229 --> 02:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
those families so we're able to keep
 
02:10:31.510 --> 02:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
those kids from having to come into
 
02:10:33.270 --> 02:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
foster care
 
02:10:36.229 --> 02:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
roadmap to reunification is an exciting
 
02:10:38.229 --> 02:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
new program we phased out an old program
 
02:10:39.910 --> 02:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
that we called fair and replaced it with
 
02:10:39.920 --> 02:10:41.030 align:start position:0%
that we called fair and replaced it with
this

02:10:41.030 --> 02:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:10:43.030 --> 02:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
this is a model where we have a clinical
 
02:10:44.629 --> 02:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
person who is working with foster
 
02:10:46.629 --> 02:10:46.639 align:start position:0%
parents and birth parents
 
02:10:48.310 --> 02:10:48.320 align:start position:0%
around trying to help parents
 
02:10:50.390 --> 02:10:50.400 align:start position:0%
successfully reunify
 
02:10:52.709 --> 02:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
um it's really important when kids enter
 
02:10:54.149 --> 02:10:54.159 align:start position:0%
foster care that we recognize those
 
02:10:55.510 --> 02:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
foster parents could actually be more
 
02:10:57.109 --> 02:10:57.119 align:start position:0%
than just a temporary home for a child
 
02:10:58.790 --> 02:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
but actually can be a support
 
02:11:00.310 --> 02:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
to the birth parent and making sure that
 
02:11:02.310 --> 02:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
the child can successfully reunify back
 
02:11:04.229 --> 02:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
into the home
 
02:11:06.149 --> 02:11:06.159 align:start position:0%
and a lot of our foster parents are
 
02:11:07.910 --> 02:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
eager to do this work but this extra
 
02:11:07.920 --> 02:11:08.790 align:start position:0%
eager to do this work but this extra
support

02:11:08.790 --> 02:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:11:11.109 --> 02:11:11.119 align:start position:0%
helps bridge those gaps and really helps
 
02:11:13.109 --> 02:11:13.119 align:start position:0%
our parents get ready for this
 
02:11:15.589 --> 02:11:15.599 align:start position:0%
this tough work of of trying to heal
 
02:11:17.030 --> 02:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
their families and bring their families
 
02:11:19.030 --> 02:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
back together again
 
02:11:20.310 --> 02:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
um really excited about some of the
 
02:11:21.589 --> 02:11:21.599 align:start position:0%
partnerships we developed in the past
 
02:11:22.950 --> 02:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
couple years with the housing
 
02:11:24.229 --> 02:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
authorities are always called family
 
02:11:25.910 --> 02:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
unification housing vouchers these are
 
02:11:28.709 --> 02:11:28.719 align:start position:0%
federal housing vouchers
 
02:11:30.470 --> 02:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
available to families who are at risk of
 
02:11:32.629 --> 02:11:32.639 align:start position:0%
having their kids enter foster care
 
02:11:35.990 --> 02:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
or who are are unable to reunify because
 
02:11:37.669 --> 02:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
of housing instability
 
02:11:39.189 --> 02:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
so these are federal vouchers that are
 
02:11:41.750 --> 02:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
specifically provided for the purpose of
 
02:11:43.430 --> 02:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
addressing those issues with our
 
02:11:45.589 --> 02:11:45.599 align:start position:0%
families which might lead kids to enter
 
02:11:45.599 --> 02:11:46.790 align:start position:0%
families which might lead kids to enter
care

02:11:46.790 --> 02:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
care
 
02:11:49.910 --> 02:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
so so i have i have to stop you there
 
02:11:52.149 --> 02:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
so you just you just said there was
 
02:11:53.589 --> 02:11:53.599 align:start position:0%
housing instability
 
02:11:56.550 --> 02:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
potential and therefore grants that i
 
02:11:56.560 --> 02:11:57.669 align:start position:0%
potential and therefore grants that i
presume

02:11:57.669 --> 02:11:57.679 align:start position:0%
presume
 
02:12:01.430 --> 02:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
are intended to make the housing stable
 
02:12:04.069 --> 02:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
which sounds like depending on the
 
02:12:06.310 --> 02:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
evaluation of a family
 
02:12:08.390 --> 02:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
they may end up getting some of their
 
02:12:10.629 --> 02:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
rent paid
 
02:12:12.069 --> 02:12:12.079 align:start position:0%
yes this is an entirely different
 
02:12:13.430 --> 02:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
program than the program we were talking
 
02:12:14.470 --> 02:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
about before
 
02:12:15.910 --> 02:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
this is for what's called a family
 
02:12:18.550 --> 02:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
unification program a family unification
 
02:12:21.430 --> 02:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:24.709 --> 02:12:24.719 align:start position:0%
these are hud vouchers
 
02:12:26.790 --> 02:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
that are available for this purpose and
 
02:12:27.750 --> 02:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
we partnered with the housing
 
02:12:29.189 --> 02:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
authorities to apply for these hud
 
02:12:29.199 --> 02:12:30.149 align:start position:0%
authorities to apply for these hud
vouchers

02:12:30.149 --> 02:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
vouchers
 
02:12:32.550 --> 02:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
to be able to provide families who are
 
02:12:33.990 --> 02:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
at risk of entering foster
 
02:12:36.390 --> 02:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
care as a result of housing instability
 
02:12:38.709 --> 02:12:38.719 align:start position:0%
or families who cannot reunify
 
02:12:40.870 --> 02:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
because the parents do not have housing
 
02:12:43.990 --> 02:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
adequate to serve their kids
 
02:12:47.189 --> 02:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
and i'll let you go but i just i
 
02:12:50.310 --> 02:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
i just want to believe that there are
 
02:12:51.910 --> 02:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
internal controls in place
 
02:12:54.870 --> 02:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
to uh anticipate the potential for fraud
 
02:12:56.870 --> 02:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
waste and abuse and that
 
02:12:58.950 --> 02:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
there's there's active measures in place
 
02:13:00.950 --> 02:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
to make sure that these benefits aren't
 
02:13:00.960 --> 02:13:02.629 align:start position:0%
to make sure that these benefits aren't
abused

02:13:02.629 --> 02:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
abused
 
02:13:05.750 --> 02:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
yes and the there's these are these are
 
02:13:07.030 --> 02:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
hud vouchers there's a host of
 
02:13:07.040 --> 02:13:08.069 align:start position:0%
hud vouchers there's a host of
requirements

02:13:08.069 --> 02:13:08.079 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
02:13:10.069 --> 02:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
that come in place with all of that in
 
02:13:11.510 --> 02:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
addition to the requirements
 
02:13:14.950 --> 02:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
around our deeming eligibility based on
 
02:13:16.149 --> 02:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
their children you know
 
02:13:18.550 --> 02:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
either at risk of entering care or
 
02:13:20.709 --> 02:13:20.719 align:start position:0%
unable to reunify as a result of care
 
02:13:23.750 --> 02:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
but the underlying um criteria in terms
 
02:13:25.510 --> 02:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
of who qualifies for a voucher are the
 
02:13:26.550 --> 02:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
same as the other
 
02:13:28.709 --> 02:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
the other uh federally funded housing
 
02:13:30.149 --> 02:13:30.159 align:start position:0%
voucher programs
 
02:13:33.830 --> 02:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you we spoke a lot about this so i
 
02:13:35.109 --> 02:13:35.119 align:start position:0%
won't talk a whole lot but the
 
02:13:36.149 --> 02:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
partnership with our children's
 
02:13:37.270 --> 02:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
behavioral health system around the
 
02:13:38.870 --> 02:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
system of care transformation has been
 
02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:40.310 align:start position:0%
system of care transformation has been
huge

02:13:40.310 --> 02:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
huge
 
02:13:42.550 --> 02:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
and also partnerships with public health
 
02:13:44.310 --> 02:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
in our division of employment and
 
02:13:46.229 --> 02:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
housing security
 
02:13:48.149 --> 02:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
to expand support to strengthen families
 
02:13:50.470 --> 02:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
to try to prevent dcyf involvement
 
02:13:52.550 --> 02:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
through their work with family resource
 
02:13:54.310 --> 02:13:54.320 align:start position:0%
centers and the new kinship navigator
 
02:13:55.350 --> 02:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
programs which i'm
 
02:13:58.550 --> 02:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
i'm very excited about so unless there's
 
02:14:00.790 --> 02:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
questions i'll move on
 
02:14:04.229 --> 02:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:06.229 --> 02:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
so key challenges ahead i do mention
 
02:14:07.430 --> 02:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
here housing instability is something
 
02:14:09.270 --> 02:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
that keeps coming up within our cases as
 
02:14:11.109 --> 02:14:11.119 align:start position:0%
a challenge for our families
 
02:14:13.350 --> 02:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
um you know i think you hear about this
 
02:14:14.709 --> 02:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
in some of the other presentations as
 
02:14:15.270 --> 02:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
well but
 
02:14:17.669 --> 02:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
work that can be done to to address this
 
02:14:19.030 --> 02:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
issue broadly is going to have a
 
02:14:20.709 --> 02:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
positive impact on families involved
 
02:14:22.390 --> 02:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
with child protection
 
02:14:23.750 --> 02:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
we spoke about this earlier too so i
 
02:14:25.510 --> 02:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
don't belabor it but recruitment and
 
02:14:26.950 --> 02:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
retention of staff
 
02:14:29.189 --> 02:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
um i do think that we've made some great
 
02:14:30.629 --> 02:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
progress i think we have a great plan
 
02:14:32.229 --> 02:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
but we still are seeing a turnover that
 
02:14:33.510 --> 02:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not satisfied with
 
02:14:36.709 --> 02:14:36.719 align:start position:0%
and it remains a continuing challenge
 
02:14:39.030 --> 02:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
and then lastly family strengthening
 
02:14:41.510 --> 02:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
programs for families prior to dcyf
 
02:14:41.520 --> 02:14:42.470 align:start position:0%
programs for families prior to dcyf
involvement

02:14:42.470 --> 02:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
involvement
 
02:14:44.310 --> 02:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
um i spoke earlier about the changes we
 
02:14:45.830 --> 02:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
made at intake to reform
 
02:14:47.510 --> 02:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
refer more families to family resource
 
02:14:48.709 --> 02:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
centers and other resources in the
 
02:14:48.719 --> 02:14:49.669 align:start position:0%
centers and other resources in the
community

02:14:49.669 --> 02:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:14:51.910 --> 02:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
that has a great effect of keeping these
 
02:14:54.149 --> 02:14:54.159 align:start position:0%
families from getting into dcyf but what
 
02:14:55.589 --> 02:14:55.599 align:start position:0%
we're finding unfortunately is that some
 
02:14:57.189 --> 02:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
of those programs aren't
 
02:14:59.430 --> 02:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
aren't ready to handle the the flow of
 
02:15:00.470 --> 02:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
families that we're sending them they
 
02:15:01.350 --> 02:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
don't have the supports
 
02:15:02.870 --> 02:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
they need to handle the increased volume
 
02:15:04.069 --> 02:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
of referrals that they're getting from
 
02:15:04.079 --> 02:15:04.870 align:start position:0%
of referrals that they're getting from
us

02:15:04.870 --> 02:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:15:06.550 --> 02:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
um so i think that's another challenge
 
02:15:08.709 --> 02:15:08.719 align:start position:0%
that would be useful to think about
 
02:15:13.910 --> 02:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:15.830 --> 02:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
identity and tenure of the key division
 
02:15:15.840 --> 02:15:17.350 align:start position:0%
identity and tenure of the key division

she's been
 
02:16:09.030 --> 02:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
with that role for three years
 
02:16:10.870 --> 02:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
previously the bureau of organizational

learning and quality improvement
 
02:16:15.990 --> 02:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
um 14 years of the agency evaluation

analytics and reporting
 
02:16:19.189 --> 02:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
by the robux she's been in that role for
 
02:16:21.030 --> 02:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
just under a month it's brand new
 
02:16:23.030 --> 02:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
and business information systems is
 
02:16:24.629 --> 02:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
steve deguiso who's been in that role
 
02:16:26.790 --> 02:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
for 14 years
 
02:16:29.830 --> 02:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
what's his relationship to doit
 
02:16:32.709 --> 02:16:32.719 align:start position:0%
what what what are what he what's he
 
02:16:33.669 --> 02:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
doing that's
 
02:16:36.950 --> 02:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
um needs to be specific for
 
02:16:39.750 --> 02:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
your department as opposed to being
 
02:16:41.509 --> 02:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
provided by doit
 
02:16:45.349 --> 02:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
so he manages the um largely manages our
 
02:16:47.110 --> 02:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
case our case management system is
 
02:16:48.709 --> 02:16:48.719 align:start position:0%
called a the current one's called a
 
02:16:50.070 --> 02:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
sackvist system we call it bridges
 
02:16:51.589 --> 02:16:51.599 align:start position:0%
cyclist stands for
 
02:16:54.790 --> 02:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
statewide automated child
 
02:16:56.790 --> 02:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
information some systems something like
 
02:16:58.709 --> 02:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
that anyway um
 
02:17:00.790 --> 02:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
our current system is 20 plus years old
 
02:17:01.910 --> 02:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
he's the person who
 
02:17:03.990 --> 02:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
works for the department overseeing that
 
02:17:06.150 --> 02:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
system with a couple of staff
 
02:17:11.349 --> 02:17:11.359 align:start position:0%
um previously he reported to the dhhs
 
02:17:13.110 --> 02:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
corresponding bureau that dave leaders
 
02:17:14.870 --> 02:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
overseas um
 
02:17:16.309 --> 02:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago that was changed to
 
02:17:18.309 --> 02:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
have him again sit within dcyf although
 
02:17:19.669 --> 02:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
the function is essentially the same
 
02:17:20.870 --> 02:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
it's just his
 
02:17:22.790 --> 02:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
his uh his reporting line is a little
 
02:17:25.270 --> 02:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
bit different um but he's he and his
 
02:17:26.389 --> 02:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
staff are the ones who are
 
02:17:28.549 --> 02:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
responsible for managing and maintaining
 
02:17:30.709 --> 02:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
that system in partnership with
 
02:17:33.750 --> 02:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
the department and the oit there is a
 
02:17:35.349 --> 02:17:35.359 align:start position:0%
project underway that i referred to
 
02:17:35.359 --> 02:17:36.309 align:start position:0%
project underway that i referred to
earlier

02:17:36.309 --> 02:17:36.319 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
02:17:39.070 --> 02:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
to update this really really antiquated
 
02:17:39.080 --> 02:17:40.230 align:start position:0%
to update this really really antiquated
23

02:17:40.230 --> 02:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
23
 
02:17:42.150 --> 02:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
or more year old system that we're
 
02:17:44.150 --> 02:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
currently using
 
02:17:45.750 --> 02:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
which i think we're all very excited
 
02:17:47.589 --> 02:17:47.599 align:start position:0%
about getting that done but that's a
 
02:17:48.629 --> 02:17:48.639 align:start position:0%
couple years from
 
02:17:57.030 --> 02:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
from realization thank you
 
02:17:58.870 --> 02:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
um you know the the requests around if
 
02:18:00.629 --> 02:18:00.639 align:start position:0%
there was five percent increase or
 
02:18:02.150 --> 02:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
decrease what would we do with those
 
02:18:04.309 --> 02:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
funds um if we did have additional
 
02:18:05.589 --> 02:18:05.599 align:start position:0%
funding where i would recommend that
 
02:18:07.910 --> 02:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
that money go is in two different places
 
02:18:09.910 --> 02:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
um one as i referenced a little while
 
02:18:11.110 --> 02:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
ago we are
 
02:18:13.190 --> 02:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
um having some challenges around when we
 
02:18:14.469 --> 02:18:14.479 align:start position:0%
need to make referrals out to community
 
02:18:16.709 --> 02:18:16.719 align:start position:0%
services particularly to frcs
 
02:18:18.629 --> 02:18:18.639 align:start position:0%
and uh i think that that network can
 
02:18:20.389 --> 02:18:20.399 align:start position:0%
utilize could use some more support
 
02:18:21.830 --> 02:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
which would allow us to
 
02:18:23.270 --> 02:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
to feel better about those referrals
 
02:18:25.750 --> 02:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
that we need to make to those services
 
02:18:29.190 --> 02:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
similarly in the juvenile justice world
 
02:18:30.389 --> 02:18:30.399 align:start position:0%
you know a lot of work is happening
 
02:18:31.750 --> 02:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
through that system of care but there
 
02:18:33.270 --> 02:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
are what's called diversion programs
 
02:18:34.709 --> 02:18:34.719 align:start position:0%
around the state that aren't currently
 
02:18:36.389 --> 02:18:36.399 align:start position:0%
state funded
 
02:18:38.469 --> 02:18:38.479 align:start position:0%
and there's not currently really a state
 
02:18:39.509 --> 02:18:39.519 align:start position:0%
endorsed model
 
02:18:41.669 --> 02:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
for that and i think that is a place
 
02:18:42.790 --> 02:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
where um
 
02:18:44.150 --> 02:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
where if we had additional funds it
 
02:18:45.509 --> 02:18:45.519 align:start position:0%
would be helpful to to put some
 
02:18:46.950 --> 02:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
additional funds there
 
02:18:49.110 --> 02:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
to be able to better serve kids before
 
02:18:50.709 --> 02:18:50.719 align:start position:0%
they get into the deep ends of both of
 
02:18:52.870 --> 02:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
these systems
 
02:18:54.629 --> 02:18:54.639 align:start position:0%
decreased funding i think unfortunately
 
02:18:56.309 --> 02:18:56.319 align:start position:0%
would lead to a lot of negative outcomes
 
02:18:57.830 --> 02:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
along the lines of
 
02:18:59.669 --> 02:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
what we saw when the budgets were
 
02:19:01.990 --> 02:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
slashed 10 years ago and dcyf ended up
 
02:19:03.270 --> 02:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
in the crisis position that it was
 
02:19:05.509 --> 02:19:05.519 align:start position:0%
shortly before i got here
 
02:19:07.750 --> 02:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
i think we would see case loads grow
 
02:19:09.589 --> 02:19:09.599 align:start position:0%
quality of assessments decline
 
02:19:11.589 --> 02:19:11.599 align:start position:0%
recidivism increase increased children
 
02:19:13.270 --> 02:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
and out of home care decreased family
 
02:19:15.270 --> 02:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
preservation and reunification
 
02:19:16.790 --> 02:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
and in the long term we probably see
 
02:19:18.629 --> 02:19:18.639 align:start position:0%
more families meeting the deep end of
 
02:19:19.270 --> 02:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
the system
 
02:19:21.429 --> 02:19:21.439 align:start position:0%
which ends up being more costly in the
 
02:19:22.469 --> 02:19:22.479 align:start position:0%
long run
 
02:19:25.030 --> 02:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
i think we're largely living with we're
 
02:19:27.110 --> 02:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
largely living with the repercussions of
 
02:19:30.709 --> 02:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
what was done 10 years ago in terms of
 
02:19:32.469 --> 02:19:32.479 align:start position:0%
defunding the child protection and child
 
02:19:33.750 --> 02:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
welfare system
 
02:19:35.589 --> 02:19:35.599 align:start position:0%
and are just now starting to see the
 
02:19:37.509 --> 02:19:37.519 align:start position:0%
data shift around
 
02:19:39.030 --> 02:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
these kids and care and everything else
 
02:19:40.870 --> 02:19:40.880 align:start position:0%
so i just would hate to see us go back
 
02:19:43.910 --> 02:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:46.389 --> 02:19:46.399 align:start position:0%
so just to respond to the increased
 
02:19:46.399 --> 02:19:47.429 align:start position:0%
so just to respond to the increased
recidivism

02:19:47.429 --> 02:19:47.439 align:start position:0%
recidivism
 
02:19:51.830 --> 02:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
as a cost of decrements and
 
02:19:53.910 --> 02:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
that one is just hard for me to wrap my
 
02:19:55.190 --> 02:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
head around given we have
 
02:19:57.670 --> 02:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
such a high recidivism rate right now
 
02:19:58.710 --> 02:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
and it seems like
 
02:20:01.349 --> 02:20:01.359 align:start position:0%
we've spent a lot of money at the sununu
 
02:20:01.359 --> 02:20:03.030 align:start position:0%
we've spent a lot of money at the sununu
center

02:20:03.030 --> 02:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
center
 
02:20:04.550 --> 02:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
when i was using the word recidivism
 
02:20:07.110 --> 02:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
there i wasn't thinking just sysc
 
02:20:09.349 --> 02:20:09.359 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking recidivism in terms of
 
02:20:11.510 --> 02:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
recurring juvenile justice and child
 
02:20:13.590 --> 02:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
and also child abuse and neglect
 
02:20:13.600 --> 02:20:15.270 align:start position:0%
and also child abuse and neglect
recurring

02:20:15.270 --> 02:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
recurring
 
02:20:16.870 --> 02:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
so i'm not thinking specifically of
 
02:20:18.469 --> 02:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
that's why i'm thinking about recurring
 
02:20:20.230 --> 02:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
families coming through the system
 
02:20:21.590 --> 02:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
that could have their needs met and
 
02:20:23.510 --> 02:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
stopped from coming through the system
 
02:20:24.790 --> 02:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
all right thank you for the
 
02:20:27.590 --> 02:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
clarification do you do you have any
 
02:20:29.910 --> 02:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
way to put a little bit more analytical
 
02:20:31.190 --> 02:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
precision into
 
02:20:34.630 --> 02:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
these impacts
 
02:20:36.070 --> 02:20:36.080 align:start position:0%
well i mean i think a lot of these are
 
02:20:37.510 --> 02:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
actually things that we report on
 
02:20:38.710 --> 02:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
currently within our
 
02:20:39.990 --> 02:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
our annual data book and we actually
 
02:20:41.270 --> 02:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
have a new monthly dashboard that we're
 
02:20:42.550 --> 02:20:42.560 align:start position:0%
posting as well
 
02:20:44.790 --> 02:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
in terms of caseloads in terms of
 
02:20:46.780 --> 02:20:46.790 align:start position:0%
children and out of home care
 
02:20:46.790 --> 02:20:48.150 align:start position:0%
children and out of home care
[Music]

02:20:48.150 --> 02:20:48.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:20:49.590 --> 02:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
those things are already reported on
 
02:20:49.600 --> 02:20:51.510 align:start position:0%
those things are already reported on
regularly

02:20:51.510 --> 02:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
regularly
 
02:20:53.110 --> 02:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
repeats is something that we're trying
 
02:20:54.630 --> 02:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
to figure out you know particularly the
 
02:20:57.270 --> 02:20:57.280 align:start position:0%
repeat families who come into our
 
02:20:59.030 --> 02:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
community-based voluntary services is
 
02:21:01.190 --> 02:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
one that we're developing a metric for
 
02:21:02.710 --> 02:21:02.720 align:start position:0%
so that we can actually track that going
 
02:21:02.720 --> 02:21:04.070 align:start position:0%
so that we can actually track that going
forward

02:21:04.070 --> 02:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:21:06.070 --> 02:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
so yes i think that you know these are
 
02:21:07.190 --> 02:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
things that were
 
02:21:08.790 --> 02:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
some of them were currently reporting on
 
02:21:10.389 --> 02:21:10.399 align:start position:0%
and others that we're developing reports
 
02:21:10.399 --> 02:21:11.030 align:start position:0%
and others that we're developing reports
on

02:21:11.030 --> 02:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:21:12.790 --> 02:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
increased long-term demand you know
 
02:21:14.070 --> 02:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
that's something that i think you would
 
02:21:14.790 --> 02:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
have to
 
02:21:18.150 --> 02:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
you would look at you know comparable um
 
02:21:19.510 --> 02:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
things that to what we're actually
 
02:21:21.190 --> 02:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
already reporting on in terms of
 
02:21:23.030 --> 02:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
new assessments call volume to the
 
02:21:25.349 --> 02:21:25.359 align:start position:0%
hotline number of new child protection
 
02:21:27.030 --> 02:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
cases opening up which are metrics that
 
02:21:27.670 --> 02:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
we do
 
02:21:30.790 --> 02:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
that we do report on regularly yeah so
 
02:21:33.110 --> 02:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that and i i think
 
02:21:34.950 --> 02:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
we're getting close to ms rounds
 
02:21:37.110 --> 02:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
talking and so the segue that she may
 
02:21:38.630 --> 02:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
want to pick up is
 
02:21:41.190 --> 02:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
i saw an email conversation on trying to
 
02:21:41.200 --> 02:21:41.910 align:start position:0%
i saw an email conversation on trying to
find

02:21:41.910 --> 02:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
find
 
02:21:45.429 --> 02:21:45.439 align:start position:0%
the uh right line items to put the
 
02:21:47.750 --> 02:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
funding into the family resource centers
 
02:21:50.230 --> 02:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
if if we were to follow the governor's
 
02:21:50.240 --> 02:21:51.590 align:start position:0%
if if we were to follow the governor's
request

02:21:51.590 --> 02:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
request
 
02:21:54.150 --> 02:21:54.160 align:start position:0%
so so we've we've heard the governor's
 
02:21:55.670 --> 02:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
request mr ribson
 
02:21:58.389 --> 02:21:58.399 align:start position:0%
and i i think we're trying to figure out
 
02:21:59.750 --> 02:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
which lines need
 
02:22:02.150 --> 02:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
how much money and and then we have to
 
02:22:03.429 --> 02:22:03.439 align:start position:0%
run it through
 
02:22:06.389 --> 02:22:06.399 align:start position:0%
our process of you know figuring out
 
02:22:06.399 --> 02:22:06.790 align:start position:0%
our process of you know figuring out
what

02:22:06.790 --> 02:22:06.800 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:22:08.870 --> 02:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
what we can spend and what we need to
 
02:22:10.150 --> 02:22:10.160 align:start position:0%
cut so
 
02:22:13.190 --> 02:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
so so we're working that uh on
 
02:22:18.309 --> 02:22:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:21.510 --> 02:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
great and yes i'm completed by section i
 
02:22:23.429 --> 02:22:23.439 align:start position:0%
think miss rounds is stepping up unless
 
02:22:24.870 --> 02:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
there's other questions
 
02:22:26.870 --> 02:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from mr ribson
 
02:22:28.150 --> 02:22:28.160 align:start position:0%
before uh
 
02:22:31.110 --> 02:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
he steps away are you going to stay with
 
02:22:32.950 --> 02:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
us or are you going to go back to work
 
02:22:34.950 --> 02:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
but i'll still be here just won't be
 
02:22:37.030 --> 02:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
talking as much
 
02:22:40.230 --> 02:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:42.070 --> 02:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh you can go ahead and stop or if you
 
02:22:44.070 --> 02:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
want to cover this one then i can
 
02:22:46.870 --> 02:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh share sure the only prioritized needs
 
02:22:49.830 --> 02:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
that were identified within the um
 
02:22:50.950 --> 02:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
within the budget
 
02:22:54.389 --> 02:22:54.399 align:start position:0%
um we're around sysc there's a um
 
02:22:57.110 --> 02:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
the barn roof boiler that that need to
 
02:22:58.870 --> 02:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
be repaired and replaced
 
02:23:02.389 --> 02:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
um the utilities i think are are funded
 
02:23:03.590 --> 02:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
somewhere else they're not they're not
 
02:23:05.349 --> 02:23:05.359 align:start position:0%
currently spending the sysc budget they
 
02:23:07.510 --> 02:23:07.520 align:start position:0%
really belong there
 
02:23:11.270 --> 02:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
so that's what these are so am i
 
02:23:13.510 --> 02:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
say seeing that right that you you need
 
02:23:16.150 --> 02:23:16.160 align:start position:0%
another million dollars a year
 
02:23:18.150 --> 02:23:18.160 align:start position:0%
well this is a one-time cost i think one
 
02:23:20.389 --> 02:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
of the challenges with sysc
 
02:23:22.230 --> 02:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
is it's not just the relatively new
 
02:23:23.670 --> 02:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
building that people think of but it's
 
02:23:25.110 --> 02:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
this campus of
 
02:23:28.630 --> 02:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
of ages and oftentimes
 
02:23:30.950 --> 02:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
you know buildings that need a lot of
 
02:23:32.870 --> 02:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
care to
 
02:23:36.150 --> 02:23:36.160 align:start position:0%
to be maintained and this is one of
 
02:23:37.270 --> 02:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
those things that
 
02:23:39.190 --> 02:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
that needs to be done to maintain that
 
02:23:41.510 --> 02:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
building if in fact we want to maintain
 
02:23:44.230 --> 02:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:45.990 --> 02:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
i would also mention that the barn roof
 
02:23:47.590 --> 02:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
and boiler were also submitted as
 
02:23:48.870 --> 02:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
capital items
 
02:23:50.150 --> 02:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
and they were not approved in the
 
02:23:52.230 --> 02:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
capital budget or are not i should say
 
02:23:55.510 --> 02:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
are not currently in house bill 25.
 
02:23:57.110 --> 02:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
that's how i should say so
 
02:23:58.950 --> 02:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
representative walner has a question i
 
02:23:58.960 --> 02:23:59.429 align:start position:0%
representative walner has a question i
think

02:23:59.429 --> 02:23:59.439 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:24:02.550 --> 02:24:02.560 align:start position:0%
maybe as we transition here what my
 
02:24:03.590 --> 02:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
question is about
 
02:24:06.790 --> 02:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
utilities for 583 000
 
02:24:10.870 --> 02:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
each year at the million dollars um
 
02:24:12.790 --> 02:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
do we have enough is there when we come
 
02:24:14.870 --> 02:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
to the utility line do we have enough in
 
02:24:17.429 --> 02:24:17.439 align:start position:0%
utilities to
 
02:24:19.349 --> 02:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
pay our utility bills over the next two
 
02:24:19.359 --> 02:24:21.590 align:start position:0%
pay our utility bills over the next two
years

02:24:21.590 --> 02:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:24:23.590 --> 02:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
so we've been regularly paying the
 
02:24:24.630 --> 02:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
utility bill
 
02:24:27.190 --> 02:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
out of the facilities budget for the
 
02:24:28.309 --> 02:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
entire department
 
02:24:30.230 --> 02:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
because we've not been able to increase
 
02:24:32.070 --> 02:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
the budget at sysc
 
02:24:33.990 --> 02:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
to pay the utilities out of the sysc
 
02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:38.150 align:start position:0%
to pay the utilities out of the sysc
budget

02:24:38.150 --> 02:24:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:42.070 --> 02:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
okay so if we
 
02:24:44.150 --> 02:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
were to put money in this line then we
 
02:24:45.670 --> 02:24:45.680 align:start position:0%
should be able to decrease it from
 
02:24:47.110 --> 02:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
another line
 
02:24:48.630 --> 02:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
potentially i would have to double check
 
02:24:51.030 --> 02:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they budgeted it in
 
02:24:53.190 --> 02:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
that bureau but that's where we've been
 
02:24:54.950 --> 02:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
paying that
 
02:24:57.990 --> 02:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
because we should only need to budget an
 
02:25:01.110 --> 02:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
additional increment for increased costs
 
02:25:01.120 --> 02:25:01.429 align:start position:0%
additional increment for increased costs
but

02:25:01.429 --> 02:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:25:03.590 --> 02:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
if the base is being paid for somewhere
 
02:25:07.030 --> 02:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
else we just need to transfer the base
 
02:25:09.990 --> 02:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
i will um i will confirm that and um
 
02:25:11.429 --> 02:25:11.439 align:start position:0%
we'll submit change requests
 
02:25:15.270 --> 02:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
for that so the part of that is just how
 
02:25:15.990 --> 02:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
much is that
 
02:25:19.670 --> 02:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
of that 583 is like inflation versus
 
02:25:23.190 --> 02:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
the the base from previous years but
 
02:25:24.790 --> 02:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
representative wallner you have another
 
02:25:27.990 --> 02:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
question yes my question is so
 
02:25:31.270 --> 02:25:31.280 align:start position:0%
basically what we're saying here is that
 
02:25:33.190 --> 02:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
the sununu center actually cost us a
 
02:25:35.190 --> 02:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
million dollars more over the biennium
 
02:25:37.429 --> 02:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
than what we see in the budget
 
02:25:41.510 --> 02:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
and are there any other expenses
 
02:25:44.870 --> 02:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
of the sununu center that are not shown
 
02:25:47.110 --> 02:25:47.120 align:start position:0%
in the budget that are being born from
 
02:25:48.230 --> 02:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
by other
 
02:25:52.790 --> 02:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
part other areas of the department
 
02:25:54.469 --> 02:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
so i would say i don't know that it's a
 
02:25:56.150 --> 02:25:56.160 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year because the
 
02:25:58.150 --> 02:25:58.160 align:start position:0%
it's just the utilities that are
 
02:25:59.349 --> 02:25:59.359 align:start position:0%
reoccurring the
 
02:26:02.710 --> 02:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
barn roof and boiler room at one time no
 
02:26:05.349 --> 02:26:05.359 align:start position:0%
the biennium yes yes for the biennium
 
02:26:05.359 --> 02:26:06.150 align:start position:0%
the biennium yes yes for the biennium
correct

02:26:06.150 --> 02:26:06.160 align:start position:0%
correct
 
02:26:09.349 --> 02:26:09.359 align:start position:0%
um i can get you the information on
 
02:26:12.469 --> 02:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
when there are times that um other parts
 
02:26:13.670 --> 02:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
of the budget are paying for
 
02:26:15.510 --> 02:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
expenditures at sysc
 
02:26:17.270 --> 02:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
i think for the most part the only other
 
02:26:18.950 --> 02:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
time that it happens is when
 
02:26:21.510 --> 02:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
um there are employees from elsewhere in
 
02:26:23.349 --> 02:26:23.359 align:start position:0%
the department that have to cover shifts
 
02:26:24.950 --> 02:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
at sysc because there
 
02:26:27.990 --> 02:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
are not enough um
 
02:26:29.590 --> 02:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
they're not enough staff on a shift and
 
02:26:32.230 --> 02:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
we need to pay for the overtime
 
02:26:33.910 --> 02:26:33.920 align:start position:0%
so we tend to leave the overtime where
 
02:26:36.070 --> 02:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
that employee lives
 
02:26:39.030 --> 02:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
regularly so if i could just have one
 
02:26:39.040 --> 02:26:40.150 align:start position:0%
regularly so if i could just have one
follow-up

02:26:40.150 --> 02:26:40.160 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:26:43.190 --> 02:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
yes so what that indicates to me
 
02:26:46.309 --> 02:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
is that the cost it at the sununu center
 
02:26:46.950 --> 02:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
is even
 
02:26:50.630 --> 02:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
higher than what we see in the budget
 
02:26:53.429 --> 02:26:53.439 align:start position:0%
yes because there are other places it's
 
02:26:55.190 --> 02:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
being born okay thank you
 
02:26:57.429 --> 02:26:57.439 align:start position:0%
i think i think for the utilities line
 
02:26:59.030 --> 02:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
that's true the
 
02:27:01.190 --> 02:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
the increased overtime is because of the
 
02:27:02.870 --> 02:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
inability to actually fill vacant
 
02:27:04.950 --> 02:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
positions for ycs if we had
 
02:27:06.469 --> 02:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
if we had all of our positions filled
 
02:27:08.309 --> 02:27:08.319 align:start position:0%
that are funded we probably wouldn't
 
02:27:10.150 --> 02:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
need to rely on overtime from juvenile
 
02:27:12.630 --> 02:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
justice probation officers
 
02:27:15.349 --> 02:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
but the vacancies at sysc sometimes puts
 
02:27:15.990 --> 02:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
us in a position
 
02:27:17.910 --> 02:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
where we need to bring in other folks to
 
02:27:19.830 --> 02:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
cover ships
 
02:27:21.990 --> 02:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
filling those positions will actually
 
02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:23.270 align:start position:0%
filling those positions will actually
probably

02:27:23.270 --> 02:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
probably
 
02:27:25.429 --> 02:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
cost less in the net because a full-time
 
02:27:26.790 --> 02:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
yc costs less
 
02:27:28.469 --> 02:27:28.479 align:start position:0%
than the overtime for a juvenile
 
02:27:31.750 --> 02:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
probation officer
 
02:27:34.070 --> 02:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
that's a good point joe and and we do i
 
02:27:35.590 --> 02:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
think last year
 
02:27:38.230 --> 02:27:38.240 align:start position:0%
for sure and i think this year as well
 
02:27:40.870 --> 02:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
there are some lapsed salary funds
 
02:27:46.950 --> 02:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:49.270 --> 02:27:49.280 align:start position:0%
so that would mean if we are actually
 
02:27:51.270 --> 02:27:51.280 align:start position:0%
hiring the right people in the right
 
02:27:52.630 --> 02:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
department then the
 
02:27:55.349 --> 02:27:55.359 align:start position:0%
overtime would be reduced in the
 
02:27:57.990 --> 02:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
department that's been carrying it
 
02:27:59.590 --> 02:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's correct a lot of the
 
02:28:01.349 --> 02:28:01.359 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice overtime is
 
02:28:04.309 --> 02:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
is that it's covering this um hiring
 
02:28:05.990 --> 02:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
people for those positions has proven to
 
02:28:07.190 --> 02:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
be very difficult though
 
02:28:09.510 --> 02:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
um you know there's a there's a lot of
 
02:28:09.520 --> 02:28:11.110 align:start position:0%
um you know there's a there's a lot of
reason

02:28:11.110 --> 02:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
reason
 
02:28:12.870 --> 02:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
sure for just wondering if we're talking
 
02:28:15.030 --> 02:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
about a material amount of money
 
02:28:16.710 --> 02:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
are we talking about ten thousand
 
02:28:18.710 --> 02:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
dollars a year of overtime or a hundred
 
02:28:20.150 --> 02:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
thousand or
 
02:28:23.270 --> 02:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
something some crazy number yeah it's i
 
02:28:24.550 --> 02:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know the number but i'm sure
 
02:28:25.990 --> 02:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
it's material because particularly
 
02:28:27.270 --> 02:28:27.280 align:start position:0%
during covid
 
02:28:29.030 --> 02:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
when we had to run quarantined isolation
 
02:28:30.309 --> 02:28:30.319 align:start position:0%
units as well
 
02:28:32.630 --> 02:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
um the the need for overtime had
 
02:28:34.150 --> 02:28:34.160 align:start position:0%
increased even more because we needed to
 
02:28:35.510 --> 02:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
run fewer units
 
02:28:37.990 --> 02:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
or have fewer youth on more units i
 
02:28:39.670 --> 02:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
should say
 
02:28:42.230 --> 02:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
so there's been more overtime needed
 
02:28:43.990 --> 02:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
during that period but even in the year
 
02:28:46.150 --> 02:28:46.160 align:start position:0%
prior there was overtime as a result of
 
02:28:48.150 --> 02:28:48.160 align:start position:0%
not having enough youth counselors to to
 
02:28:50.150 --> 02:28:50.160 align:start position:0%
work the regular needed shifts
 
02:28:52.070 --> 02:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
okay so i think to the point that
 
02:28:53.910 --> 02:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
representative wallner was making so
 
02:28:55.110 --> 02:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
effectively is
 
02:28:58.070 --> 02:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
that that overtime there was probably it
 
02:28:59.990 --> 02:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
probably wasn't worth doing cost
 
02:29:02.790 --> 02:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
transfers between departments but it's
 
02:29:04.710 --> 02:29:04.720 align:start position:0%
it is another source and
 
02:29:07.590 --> 02:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
of expenses if we wanted to know what
 
02:29:10.230 --> 02:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
the true cost of the sununu center was
 
02:29:12.950 --> 02:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
we would have to move some dollars over
 
02:29:13.990 --> 02:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
into a cost
 
02:29:17.190 --> 02:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
management system to figure it out
 
02:29:21.590 --> 02:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
yes yeah okay so representative rogers
 
02:29:24.150 --> 02:29:24.160 align:start position:0%
do you have your question yes how many
 
02:29:26.389 --> 02:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
positions there are funded right now but
 
02:29:26.399 --> 02:29:29.190 align:start position:0%
positions there are funded right now but
unfilled

02:29:29.190 --> 02:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:31.190 --> 02:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
there's quite a few i can find that i
 
02:29:32.630 --> 02:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
think i have that data in an email i
 
02:29:33.830 --> 02:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
just don't know if it's not in my head
 
02:29:36.630 --> 02:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
i can find that for us before we finish
 
02:29:36.640 --> 02:29:36.870 align:start position:0%
i can find that for us before we finish
and

02:29:36.870 --> 02:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:29:39.110 --> 02:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
follow up are there contracted positions
 
02:29:41.030 --> 02:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
there as well
 
02:29:44.230 --> 02:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
the contracted positions there are a
 
02:29:46.150 --> 02:29:46.160 align:start position:0%
full-time psychologist and a part-time
 
02:29:47.750 --> 02:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist through the dartmouth
 
02:29:47.760 --> 02:29:48.790 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist through the dartmouth
contract

02:29:48.790 --> 02:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
contract
 
02:29:50.630 --> 02:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
and right now there are some cleaning
 
02:29:52.469 --> 02:29:52.479 align:start position:0%
staff that are contracted
 
02:29:55.429 --> 02:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
can you get those to us as well is the
 
02:30:05.110 --> 02:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
unfunded been unfilled
 
02:30:07.429 --> 02:30:07.439 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you heard her question
 
02:30:09.349 --> 02:30:09.359 align:start position:0%
representative rogers was asking for
 
02:30:11.830 --> 02:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
data and i don't know if miss rounds or
 
02:30:13.750 --> 02:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
mr ribson would get it but
 
02:30:15.270 --> 02:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
you can get when you get us the unfunded
 
02:30:17.270 --> 02:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
but unfilled if you can also get us the
 
02:30:17.280 --> 02:30:20.630 align:start position:0%
but unfilled if you can also get us the
contracted

02:30:20.630 --> 02:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:23.670 --> 02:30:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:25.670 --> 02:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
follow up are you are you satisfied for
 
02:30:25.680 --> 02:30:27.670 align:start position:0%
follow up are you are you satisfied for
now

02:30:27.670 --> 02:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:30:29.349 --> 02:30:29.359 align:start position:0%
okay because your hand your hands still
 
02:30:31.030 --> 02:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
up oh all right
 
02:30:35.510 --> 02:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:38.389 --> 02:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
so this is the staffing in child
 
02:30:38.399 --> 02:30:39.510 align:start position:0%
so this is the staffing in child
protection

02:30:39.510 --> 02:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
protection
 
02:30:41.510 --> 02:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
um so we're going back to sort of the
 
02:30:43.110 --> 02:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
beginning of the presentation from
 
02:30:44.070 --> 02:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
director ribson
 
02:30:47.670 --> 02:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
talking about child protection staffing
 
02:30:49.670 --> 02:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
so this is representing where that
 
02:30:51.270 --> 02:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
staffing is throughout the accounting
 
02:30:51.280 --> 02:30:52.230 align:start position:0%
staffing is throughout the accounting
units

02:30:52.230 --> 02:30:52.240 align:start position:0%
units
 
02:30:54.790 --> 02:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh as there and as discussed before 22
 
02:30:55.830 --> 02:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
the positions
 
02:30:58.790 --> 02:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
the cpsw positions are unfunded in the
 
02:31:01.349 --> 02:31:01.359 align:start position:0%
current budget in front of you
 
02:31:04.389 --> 02:31:04.399 align:start position:0%
remind me is a foster care health
 
02:31:07.190 --> 02:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
program the same thing as a fro foster
 
02:31:09.910 --> 02:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
care program
 
02:31:11.910 --> 02:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
or is this just like a health care
 
02:31:13.590 --> 02:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
insurance program or something i don't
 
02:31:13.600 --> 02:31:14.389 align:start position:0%
insurance program or something i don't
know

02:31:14.389 --> 02:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:31:17.190 --> 02:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
what the word health has the foster care
 
02:31:18.870 --> 02:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
health program is
 
02:31:21.349 --> 02:31:21.359 align:start position:0%
it was recently expanded in the last
 
02:31:23.590 --> 02:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
biennium it's actually something that
 
02:31:26.469 --> 02:31:26.479 align:start position:0%
the department had in the prior decade
 
02:31:27.750 --> 02:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
that was cut when a bunch of other
 
02:31:29.190 --> 02:31:29.200 align:start position:0%
things were cut in the child protection
 
02:31:30.630 --> 02:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
budget but what this is
 
02:31:33.190 --> 02:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
is nurses co-located in district offices
 
02:31:35.110 --> 02:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
to help manage the physical health care
 
02:31:35.120 --> 02:31:35.750 align:start position:0%
to help manage the physical health care
needs

02:31:35.750 --> 02:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
needs
 
02:31:39.030 --> 02:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
of youth and out of home care there were
 
02:31:39.040 --> 02:31:39.830 align:start position:0%
of youth and out of home care there were
two

02:31:39.830 --> 02:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
two
 
02:31:41.910 --> 02:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
people in those positions and in the
 
02:31:43.590 --> 02:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
last biennium
 
02:31:46.469 --> 02:31:46.479 align:start position:0%
that was increased to have enough nurses
 
02:31:48.469 --> 02:31:48.479 align:start position:0%
to be able to work across the state
 
02:31:50.230 --> 02:31:50.240 align:start position:0%
um with all the youth and out of home
 
02:31:50.240 --> 02:31:52.150 align:start position:0%
um with all the youth and out of home
care

02:31:52.150 --> 02:31:52.160 align:start position:0%
care
 
02:31:54.469 --> 02:31:54.479 align:start position:0%
what's the right ratio for that is that
 
02:31:56.550 --> 02:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
like one nurse for every
 
02:31:59.110 --> 02:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
thousand people in the system or 100
 
02:32:00.550 --> 02:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
people in the system
 
02:32:03.510 --> 02:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
so the the right ratio is actually a lot
 
02:32:05.590 --> 02:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
lower than ours under the current system
 
02:32:08.309 --> 02:32:08.319 align:start position:0%
um we had a program so actually new
 
02:32:09.349 --> 02:32:09.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire had this program before we did
 
02:32:10.630 --> 02:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
in new jersey but when we built it in
 
02:32:11.830 --> 02:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
new jersey
 
02:32:13.510 --> 02:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
it was built around a ratio of one nurse
 
02:32:16.550 --> 02:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
to 50 to 50 youth and out of home care
 
02:32:18.870 --> 02:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
um i think utah has a similar ratio to
 
02:32:20.710 --> 02:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
that the ratio here is closer to one
 
02:32:20.720 --> 02:32:21.190 align:start position:0%
that the ratio here is closer to one
youth

02:32:21.190 --> 02:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
youth
 
02:32:23.030 --> 02:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
i mean one nurse to 100 youth out of
 
02:32:27.110 --> 02:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:30.950 --> 02:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
02:32:32.790 --> 02:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
is going to ask about the vacancy rates
 
02:32:38.469 --> 02:32:38.479 align:start position:0%
on this slide
 
02:32:41.990 --> 02:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
you beat me to it yeah i'm learning
 
02:32:43.510 --> 02:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
so so do you want to tell us your
 
02:32:46.950 --> 02:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:49.270 --> 02:32:49.280 align:start position:0%
um i'll have to off the top of my head
 
02:32:50.230 --> 02:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
as i shared before i think it's
 
02:32:51.510 --> 02:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the
 
02:32:53.830 --> 02:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
number of 30s for child protection
 
02:32:53.840 --> 02:32:55.030 align:start position:0%
number of 30s for child protection
caseworkers

02:32:55.030 --> 02:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
caseworkers
 
02:32:57.270 --> 02:32:57.280 align:start position:0%
i'll have to check on the other roles
 
02:33:10.389 --> 02:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:13.349 --> 02:33:13.359 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna go ahead and steal the screen
 
02:33:14.790 --> 02:33:14.800 align:start position:0%
sharing thing with gel
 
02:33:17.190 --> 02:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
oh sure let me close mine uh i just
 
02:33:20.230 --> 02:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
stole it you're good
 
02:33:23.510 --> 02:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
so the next line here is the uh
 
02:33:25.990 --> 02:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
pie charts which you're um accustomed to
 
02:33:26.000 --> 02:33:26.870 align:start position:0%
pie charts which you're um accustomed to
seeing

02:33:26.870 --> 02:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
02:33:29.830 --> 02:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh you'll know several uh bulleted
 
02:33:32.230 --> 02:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
points at the bottom of this slide
 
02:33:34.389 --> 02:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
as to some of the changes that you're
 
02:33:35.750 --> 02:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
seeing from 1819
 
02:33:39.110 --> 02:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
2021 to 22-23
 
02:33:42.230 --> 02:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
um we moved
 
02:33:45.270 --> 02:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
the dcyf budget
 
02:33:48.550 --> 02:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
um portion of this budget into
 
02:33:51.429 --> 02:33:51.439 align:start position:0%
the medicaid portion of the dcyf budget
 
02:33:52.870 --> 02:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
into the medicaid budget
 
02:33:54.150 --> 02:33:54.160 align:start position:0%
i know that's something we've talked
 
02:33:56.950 --> 02:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
about or may have come up in a question
 
02:33:59.030 --> 02:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
that i've sent to kevin ripple before
 
02:34:01.030 --> 02:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
um so this is not a reduction in the
 
02:34:02.469 --> 02:34:02.479 align:start position:0%
dcyf budget
 
02:34:05.270 --> 02:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
it's just moving those expenditures into
 
02:34:06.630 --> 02:34:06.640 align:start position:0%
the medicaid budget
 
02:34:09.110 --> 02:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
it was the only place left in the dhhs
 
02:34:10.389 --> 02:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
budget where we were
 
02:34:12.950 --> 02:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
putting federal medicaid dollars
 
02:34:15.270 --> 02:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
somewhere other than the medicaid budget
 
02:34:17.270 --> 02:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
every else everywhere else in the budget
 
02:34:18.710 --> 02:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
similar to what you saw at new hampshire
 
02:34:20.710 --> 02:34:20.720 align:start position:0%
hospital where that's now agency income
 
02:34:22.469 --> 02:34:22.479 align:start position:0%
instead of federal income
 
02:34:24.389 --> 02:34:24.399 align:start position:0%
we we're trying to keep the medicaid
 
02:34:26.870 --> 02:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
dollars in the medicaid budget
 
02:34:29.349 --> 02:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
and so that's why you see that reduction
 
02:34:32.309 --> 02:34:32.319 align:start position:0%
here from the 150
 
02:34:36.150 --> 02:34:36.160 align:start position:0%
to the 139 and also
 
02:34:39.910 --> 02:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
the related decrease in federal funds
 
02:34:43.030 --> 02:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
so is this medicaid shift does that
 
02:34:47.030 --> 02:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
account for the 45 million or so
 
02:34:49.910 --> 02:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
completely a vast majority of it the
 
02:34:49.920 --> 02:34:50.389 align:start position:0%
completely a vast majority of it the
other

02:34:50.389 --> 02:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:34:53.910 --> 02:34:53.920 align:start position:0%
things that it um is related to are the
 
02:34:53.920 --> 02:34:54.309 align:start position:0%
things that it um is related to are the
other

02:34:54.309 --> 02:34:54.319 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:34:57.590 --> 02:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
two bullets there which is what um
 
02:34:59.990 --> 02:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
joe had been talking about earlier that
 
02:35:02.389 --> 02:35:02.399 align:start position:0%
ssbgn and the kinship program have been
 
02:35:04.230 --> 02:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
moved to economic and housing stability
 
02:35:05.270 --> 02:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
which is
 
02:35:07.670 --> 02:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
um one of the family resource center
 
02:35:09.910 --> 02:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
programs that we've been talking about
 
02:35:14.550 --> 02:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:16.230 --> 02:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
the rest of the parental assistance
 
02:35:18.550 --> 02:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
programs were moved to the
 
02:35:20.630 --> 02:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
department division of public health
 
02:35:22.070 --> 02:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
services as an
 
02:35:24.790 --> 02:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
prioritized need which you'll hear about
 
02:35:26.070 --> 02:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
uh later next week
 
02:35:28.150 --> 02:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
but those are also on the list from the
 
02:35:28.160 --> 02:35:29.429 align:start position:0%
but those are also on the list from the
governor

02:35:29.429 --> 02:35:29.439 align:start position:0%
governor
 
02:35:36.790 --> 02:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:39.349 --> 02:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
all right so with that we can jump right
 
02:35:39.990 --> 02:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
into the accounting
 
02:35:42.710 --> 02:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
units the first one is 29.56 which is on
 
02:35:42.720 --> 02:35:43.150 align:start position:0%
units the first one is 29.56 which is on
page

02:35:43.150 --> 02:35:43.160 align:start position:0%
page
 
02:35:43.160 --> 02:35:46.389 align:start position:0%
page
933

02:35:46.389 --> 02:35:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:48.550 --> 02:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
this does start at the bottom of page
 
02:35:50.070 --> 02:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
933 just after
 
02:36:02.870 --> 02:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:05.429 --> 02:36:05.439 align:start position:0%
my eyes blur a little bit which which
 
02:36:08.070 --> 02:36:08.080 align:start position:0%
title are we looking at right now
 
02:36:11.670 --> 02:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
um we are in 2956 which is
 
02:36:15.270 --> 02:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:18.150 --> 02:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
dash dcyf it's the very first accounting
 
02:36:18.950 --> 02:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
unit of
 
02:36:29.590 --> 02:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:32.550 --> 02:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
so there's a fairly significant jump
 
02:36:36.389 --> 02:36:36.399 align:start position:0%
going from fy21 to fy22
 
02:36:40.950 --> 02:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:44.790 --> 02:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
yes this is mostly due to um
 
02:36:46.790 --> 02:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
the position increase rebecca can you
 
02:36:48.870 --> 02:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
just speak to what positions were moved
 
02:36:50.309 --> 02:36:50.319 align:start position:0%
into this accounting unit and perhaps
 
02:36:51.830 --> 02:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
where they were moved from
 
02:36:55.030 --> 02:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
or were they converted um
 
02:36:57.750 --> 02:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
there is four positions that are moving
 
02:36:57.760 --> 02:36:58.870 align:start position:0%
there is four positions that are moving
from

02:36:58.870 --> 02:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:37:01.590 --> 02:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
what is currently known as the bureau of
 
02:37:03.590 --> 02:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
organizational learning
 
02:37:07.030 --> 02:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
bulky that's 2960 they
 
02:37:08.870 --> 02:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
and then there's one position coming
 
02:37:12.309 --> 02:37:12.319 align:start position:0%
from juvenile justice
 
02:37:14.710 --> 02:37:14.720 align:start position:0%
so it's a legal person and then it's
 
02:37:15.590 --> 02:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
part of a
 
02:37:19.590 --> 02:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
new piece and that would be on
 
02:37:23.030 --> 02:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
a slide that joe had shown previously
 
02:37:23.040 --> 02:37:27.190 align:start position:0%
a slide that joe had shown previously
um

02:37:27.190 --> 02:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:29.590 --> 02:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
his general account i'm sorry his
 
02:37:32.550 --> 02:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
general counsel legislative liaison
 
02:37:36.710 --> 02:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
group so these are just
 
02:37:39.030 --> 02:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
going sorry these are just being moved
 
02:37:39.910 --> 02:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
they're not
 
02:37:42.630 --> 02:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
new positions could you could you help
 
02:37:43.429 --> 02:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
us with just
 
02:37:46.070 --> 02:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
like a little cheat sheet to show you
 
02:37:46.080 --> 02:37:47.030 align:start position:0%
like a little cheat sheet to show you
know

02:37:47.030 --> 02:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:37:49.670 --> 02:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
where these plus ups where they're being
 
02:37:51.429 --> 02:37:51.439 align:start position:0%
subtracted from other parts of the
 
02:37:53.190 --> 02:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
budget just so we can see the
 
02:37:55.990 --> 02:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
debit equal the credit he actually
 
02:37:57.429 --> 02:37:57.439 align:start position:0%
already provided that for the whole
 
02:37:59.270 --> 02:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
department so kevin should have that
 
02:37:59.280 --> 02:38:01.030 align:start position:0%
department so kevin should have that
already

02:38:01.030 --> 02:38:01.040 align:start position:0%
already
 
02:38:03.510 --> 02:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
i think i sent that out in one of my
 
02:38:05.110 --> 02:38:05.120 align:start position:0%
emails and it's also on the division
 
02:38:10.469 --> 02:38:10.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:13.270 --> 02:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
i can't hear you chair no i'm saying
 
02:38:13.280 --> 02:38:13.750 align:start position:0%
i can't hear you chair no i'm saying
you're

02:38:13.750 --> 02:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
you're
 
02:38:15.590 --> 02:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
you're great you're all over it thank
 
02:38:19.190 --> 02:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:20.870 --> 02:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
so if there are no other questions there
 
02:38:23.590 --> 02:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
the next accounting unit is 29.57
 
02:38:26.070 --> 02:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
which is uh child protection this is
 
02:38:26.080 --> 02:38:26.950 align:start position:0%
which is uh child protection this is
where

02:38:26.950 --> 02:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:38:30.389 --> 02:38:30.399 align:start position:0%
the child protective
 
02:38:42.950 --> 02:38:42.960 align:start position:0%
cpsw positions are
 
02:38:45.990 --> 02:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
this this shows a fairly significant
 
02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:46.710 align:start position:0%
this this shows a fairly significant
increase

02:38:46.710 --> 02:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
increase
 
02:38:49.870 --> 02:38:49.880 align:start position:0%
from fy 21 to
 
02:38:52.790 --> 02:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
fy23 it goes up
 
02:38:56.309 --> 02:38:56.319 align:start position:0%
like four million dollars yeah
 
02:39:00.070 --> 02:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
um but in this current biennium we had
 
02:39:03.750 --> 02:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
sb6 which provided us more supervisors
 
02:39:03.760 --> 02:39:04.150 align:start position:0%
sb6 which provided us more supervisors
and

02:39:04.150 --> 02:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:39:06.790 --> 02:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
cpsw staff that was in its own
 
02:39:08.710 --> 02:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
accounting unit the dollars were only
 
02:39:10.790 --> 02:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
allowed to be used for that specific
 
02:39:10.800 --> 02:39:11.990 align:start position:0%
allowed to be used for that specific
purpose

02:39:11.990 --> 02:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
02:39:14.790 --> 02:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
and this biennium going forward we're
 
02:39:15.830 --> 02:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
putting all of them
 
02:39:18.309 --> 02:39:18.319 align:start position:0%
in the same accounting unit they all
 
02:39:22.469 --> 02:39:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:25.590 --> 02:39:25.600 align:start position:0%
representative irf yeah
 
02:39:27.910 --> 02:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
could you just refer to which number
 
02:39:28.870 --> 02:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
that was kevin
 
02:39:31.990 --> 02:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
that the document is that she was
 
02:39:33.190 --> 02:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
talking about on the last slide which
 
02:39:34.630 --> 02:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
also relates to this one i think moving
 
02:39:34.640 --> 02:39:37.030 align:start position:0%
also relates to this one i think moving
positions

02:39:37.030 --> 02:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
positions
 
02:39:39.110 --> 02:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know that it referenced a
 
02:39:41.349 --> 02:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
specific question however
 
02:39:43.429 --> 02:39:43.439 align:start position:0%
how about this the thing labeled fy
 
02:39:45.830 --> 02:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
position compare
 
02:39:47.910 --> 02:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
i think it's the one labeled dhhs
 
02:39:50.469 --> 02:39:50.479 align:start position:0%
physician movement
 
02:39:52.150 --> 02:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
so on the web page at least it's the
 
02:39:54.550 --> 02:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
last item that's listed
 
02:39:56.070 --> 02:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
okay i'll go back and try to find it i
 
02:39:58.230 --> 02:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
thought i had them all here thank you
 
02:39:58.240 --> 02:40:03.190 align:start position:0%
thought i had them all here thank you
yep

02:40:03.190 --> 02:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:09.349 --> 02:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:12.070 --> 02:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
the next accounting unit is 29.58 uh
 
02:40:14.070 --> 02:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
this accounting unit is where all of the
 
02:40:17.190 --> 02:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
services related to dcyf uh
 
02:40:18.790 --> 02:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
child protection live this is where
 
02:40:21.269 --> 02:40:21.279 align:start position:0%
you'll note that 535
 
02:40:23.670 --> 02:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
was the medicaid expenditures that have
 
02:40:25.269 --> 02:40:25.279 align:start position:0%
been moved so that's why you're seeing a
 
02:40:27.349 --> 02:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
big 30 million dollar expenditure now
 
02:40:30.550 --> 02:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:35.030 --> 02:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
the same with um quest 563
 
02:40:37.349 --> 02:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
it's also moved to medicaid okay thank
 
02:40:37.359 --> 02:40:38.309 align:start position:0%
it's also moved to medicaid okay thank
you

02:40:38.309 --> 02:40:38.319 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:40:39.910 --> 02:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
so representative earth your hand is
 
02:40:43.429 --> 02:40:43.439 align:start position:0%
still up do you have another question or
 
02:40:46.630 --> 02:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
no all right keep going i don't see any
 
02:40:50.870 --> 02:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:53.110 --> 02:40:53.120 align:start position:0%
the next thing coming in is 2959 which
 
02:41:00.790 --> 02:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:04.150 --> 02:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
now it looks like an fy18
 
02:41:08.309 --> 02:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
which you don't have it was
 
02:41:11.670 --> 02:41:11.680 align:start position:0%
it was really pretty small and then
 
02:41:15.510 --> 02:41:15.520 align:start position:0%
from fy20 to fy23
 
02:41:18.950 --> 02:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
it looks like it really hasn't changed
 
02:41:18.960 --> 02:41:19.590 align:start position:0%
it looks like it really hasn't changed
much

02:41:19.590 --> 02:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:41:22.630 --> 02:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
small percentage increases
 
02:41:24.630 --> 02:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
is that is that because we haven't had a
 
02:41:27.030 --> 02:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
growth in domestic violence or
 
02:41:30.950 --> 02:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
what i mean i'm i'm just curious
 
02:41:33.910 --> 02:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
that that line item hasn't grown as
 
02:41:33.920 --> 02:41:34.870 align:start position:0%
that that line item hasn't grown as
aggressively

02:41:34.870 --> 02:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
aggressively
 
02:41:39.110 --> 02:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:41.190 --> 02:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
so this is an area that i know that the
 
02:41:43.910 --> 02:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
governor made purposeful investments
 
02:41:47.030 --> 02:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
last biennium and fiscal year 20 and 21
 
02:41:48.550 --> 02:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
which is probably why you're seeing
 
02:41:50.389 --> 02:41:50.399 align:start position:0%
lower expenditures in some of those
 
02:41:51.830 --> 02:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
earlier years
 
02:41:55.030 --> 02:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
um so that that's what i
 
02:41:56.309 --> 02:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
would say i don't know if joe has
 
02:41:59.269 --> 02:41:59.279 align:start position:0%
anything else to add to that
 
02:42:02.469 --> 02:42:02.479 align:start position:0%
now i think they're also a big a big
 
02:42:05.030 --> 02:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
piece of it is also federal funds and um
 
02:42:07.269 --> 02:42:07.279 align:start position:0%
you know federal grant funding that you
 
02:42:08.469 --> 02:42:08.479 align:start position:0%
know are
 
02:42:10.309 --> 02:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
are not driven by our decisions but
 
02:42:11.590 --> 02:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
driven by what
 
02:42:13.910 --> 02:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
what formula grants apply to new
 
02:42:13.920 --> 02:42:14.950 align:start position:0%
what formula grants apply to new
hampshire

02:42:14.950 --> 02:42:14.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:42:17.110 --> 02:42:17.120 align:start position:0%
yeah now i see that the federal funds
 
02:42:18.950 --> 02:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
are growing faster than our general
 
02:42:18.960 --> 02:42:24.830 align:start position:0%
are growing faster than our general
funds

02:42:24.830 --> 02:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:24.840 --> 02:42:28.230 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:42:28.230 --> 02:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:32.389 --> 02:42:32.399 align:start position:0%
you're on mood sorry um
 
02:42:34.389 --> 02:42:34.399 align:start position:0%
is there a is there a match requirement
 
02:42:37.670 --> 02:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:41.269 --> 02:42:41.279 align:start position:0%
no there's not okay thank you
 
02:42:48.469 --> 02:42:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:53.910 --> 02:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
still up representative i'll put it down
 
02:42:55.510 --> 02:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
moving on to the next account accounting
 
02:42:58.309 --> 02:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
units 29.60 which is
 
02:43:00.630 --> 02:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
the organizational learning and quality
 
02:43:00.640 --> 02:43:01.429 align:start position:0%
the organizational learning and quality
improvement

02:43:01.429 --> 02:43:01.439 align:start position:0%
improvement
 
02:43:17.429 --> 02:43:17.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:23.990 --> 02:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:27.510 --> 02:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
the next accounting unit is 2961
 
02:43:32.630 --> 02:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:34.790 --> 02:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
this is why we see the big jump from
 
02:43:36.190 --> 02:43:36.200 align:start position:0%
fy20 to
 
02:43:39.190 --> 02:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
fy21 because we we went
 
02:43:42.070 --> 02:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
and hired some nurses to look after our
 
02:43:44.630 --> 02:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
foster care settings
 
02:43:50.950 --> 02:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
that's correct and please um
 
02:43:53.030 --> 02:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
rebecca correct me if i'm wrong i
 
02:43:54.389 --> 02:43:54.399 align:start position:0%
believe we earn
 
02:43:56.550 --> 02:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
medicaid admin on this and it is a
 
02:43:58.309 --> 02:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
higher than 50 50 if i
 
02:44:01.750 --> 02:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
recall correctly correct
 
02:44:05.030 --> 02:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
back to 29.60 the travel of state
 
02:44:05.040 --> 02:44:08.630 align:start position:0%
back to 29.60 the travel of state
traffic

02:44:08.630 --> 02:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:10.950 --> 02:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
so i think representative weiler your
 
02:44:12.309 --> 02:44:12.319 align:start position:0%
your microphones on do you have a
 
02:44:14.230 --> 02:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
question about travel
 
02:44:19.590 --> 02:44:19.600 align:start position:0%
the uh yes in 2960
 
02:44:26.389 --> 02:44:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:29.190 --> 02:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
do you want to speak to how that bureau
 
02:44:29.830 --> 02:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
may incur
 
02:44:33.110 --> 02:44:33.120 align:start position:0%
out-of-state travel well this is
 
02:44:35.510 --> 02:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
um this is the bureau where all the
 
02:44:36.630 --> 02:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
training costs
 
02:44:39.990 --> 02:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
are kept for the division um so
 
02:44:43.110 --> 02:44:43.120 align:start position:0%
my my assumption is that that is the
 
02:44:45.429 --> 02:44:45.439 align:start position:0%
those are the the those are associated
 
02:44:46.550 --> 02:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
with training costs
 
02:44:49.590 --> 02:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure rebecca are there other
 
02:44:53.110 --> 02:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
travel costs in there beyond training
 
02:44:56.150 --> 02:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
um there's a few conferences
 
02:44:59.510 --> 02:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
that uh staff would attend
 
02:45:03.429 --> 02:45:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:07.590 --> 02:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:09.510 --> 02:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
it was one of the prioritized needs for
 
02:45:11.030 --> 02:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
the current biennium and it wasn't
 
02:45:11.040 --> 02:45:12.230 align:start position:0%
the current biennium and it wasn't
funded

02:45:12.230 --> 02:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
funded
 
02:45:16.710 --> 02:45:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:18.389 --> 02:45:18.399 align:start position:0%
so i think joe is saying this is for his
 
02:45:20.230 --> 02:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
entire division so it's for all
 
02:45:23.269 --> 02:45:23.279 align:start position:0%
400 500 employees yeah actually i think
 
02:45:24.389 --> 02:45:24.399 align:start position:0%
it's closer to 700
 
02:45:28.870 --> 02:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
yes it's it's sorry 700. it's um
 
02:45:30.710 --> 02:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
this is this is the training the
 
02:45:32.870 --> 02:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
training costs for the entire division
 
02:45:39.670 --> 02:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:43.030 --> 02:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up representative
 
02:45:45.830 --> 02:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
i guess i guess all the training is done
 
02:45:48.150 --> 02:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
out of state
 
02:45:49.429 --> 02:45:49.439 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of training that's
 
02:45:51.030 --> 02:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
required it's not all done out of state
 
02:45:52.469 --> 02:45:52.479 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of training done in state
 
02:45:53.349 --> 02:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
but um
 
02:45:54.630 --> 02:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
but there's a lot of training that is
 
02:46:04.790 --> 02:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:06.790 --> 02:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing other questions do you
 
02:46:08.790 --> 02:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
want to continue
 
02:46:13.590 --> 02:46:13.600 align:start position:0%
um i think we were on 29.61 all right
 
02:46:15.750 --> 02:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
health program i don't know if there are
 
02:46:20.630 --> 02:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:24.950 --> 02:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
that's what representative earth does
 
02:46:26.870 --> 02:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
representative earth you have a question
 
02:46:28.710 --> 02:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
yes the 80 percent increase does not
 
02:46:32.950 --> 02:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:39.830 --> 02:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:42.070 --> 02:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
in 2961 foster care health program
 
02:46:43.590 --> 02:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
general funds went from
 
02:46:47.110 --> 02:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
looks like i see 367 000 431 432 000
 
02:46:47.120 --> 02:46:48.630 align:start position:0%
looks like i see 367 000 431 432 000
roughly

02:46:48.630 --> 02:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
roughly
 
02:46:50.070 --> 02:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
in the budget this was because of the
 
02:46:52.630 --> 02:46:52.640 align:start position:0%
new positions
 
02:46:55.670 --> 02:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
the new nursing position okay i
 
02:46:59.110 --> 02:46:59.120 align:start position:0%
yeah um the chairman mentioned that but
 
02:47:00.870 --> 02:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
i just see 19 for the permanent
 
02:47:00.880 --> 02:47:01.510 align:start position:0%
i just see 19 for the permanent
classifieds

02:47:01.510 --> 02:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
classifieds
 
02:47:03.990 --> 02:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
all the way through should there be
 
02:47:06.150 --> 02:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
different numbers in there
 
02:47:08.309 --> 02:47:08.319 align:start position:0%
i think they weren't funded in fiscal
 
02:47:09.750 --> 02:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
year 20.
 
02:47:11.750 --> 02:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
they didn't get funded until 21 if i
 
02:47:13.269 --> 02:47:13.279 align:start position:0%
remember correctly they got added to the
 
02:47:15.110 --> 02:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
total budget but they didn't get funded
 
02:47:18.469 --> 02:47:18.479 align:start position:0%
until the second year of the biennium
 
02:47:19.670 --> 02:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
right but i'm looking at the second year
 
02:47:22.550 --> 02:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
the biennium costs and that's the thing
 
02:47:23.110 --> 02:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
that jumps
 
02:47:26.230 --> 02:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
into the first year of the the total
 
02:47:26.240 --> 02:47:26.630 align:start position:0%
into the first year of the the total
cost

02:47:26.630 --> 02:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
cost
 
02:47:29.990 --> 02:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
also goes up as well though
 
02:47:32.630 --> 02:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not questioning that okay so the
 
02:47:33.990 --> 02:47:34.000 align:start position:0%
general funds would have to go up
 
02:47:35.750 --> 02:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
if the total cost is going up because we
 
02:47:38.389 --> 02:47:38.399 align:start position:0%
don't the earned percentage
 
02:47:39.990 --> 02:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
that's not the question i'm asking karen
 
02:47:41.750 --> 02:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
if you said you added the person
 
02:47:44.950 --> 02:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
in 21 that's this year yeah
 
02:47:46.950 --> 02:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
and that total is three that annual
 
02:47:48.710 --> 02:47:48.720 align:start position:0%
total is 367.
 
02:47:49.990 --> 02:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
yes and that includes that person
 
02:47:52.230 --> 02:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
correct yes
 
02:47:57.590 --> 02:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:59.110 --> 02:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
or did you just have that person late in
 
02:48:01.269 --> 02:48:01.279 align:start position:0%
the year or something so you're saying
 
02:48:03.349 --> 02:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
and so if if you look at this screen so
 
02:48:05.510 --> 02:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
that you're saying here it's 367 and
 
02:48:07.190 --> 02:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
then it goes to 431
 
02:48:10.630 --> 02:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
correct why is that increasing yes okay
 
02:48:13.110 --> 02:48:13.120 align:start position:0%
so the total costs go from 1.4 million
 
02:48:14.870 --> 02:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
to 1.7 million
 
02:48:18.790 --> 02:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
and the general fund earn is about 25
 
02:48:21.349 --> 02:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
this federal funds are 75 the general
 
02:48:21.910 --> 02:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
funds are
 
02:48:25.349 --> 02:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
25 so that the
 
02:48:28.230 --> 02:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
total percentage on the total didn't
 
02:48:28.240 --> 02:48:29.030 align:start position:0%
total percentage on the total didn't
change

02:48:29.030 --> 02:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
change
 
02:48:31.590 --> 02:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
it's the total cost that went up it
 
02:48:35.030 --> 02:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:36.870 --> 02:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
okay which is maybe that's the right
 
02:48:37.990 --> 02:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
answer because it's not related to
 
02:48:40.150 --> 02:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
people if the people stay the same
 
02:48:42.790 --> 02:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
well this right the salaries increase
 
02:48:44.070 --> 02:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
because of step increases
 
02:48:46.710 --> 02:48:46.720 align:start position:0%
the benefits increase because of pay
 
02:48:46.720 --> 02:48:47.750 align:start position:0%
the benefits increase because of pay
increases

02:48:47.750 --> 02:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
increases
 
02:48:49.990 --> 02:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
so the step the step this time was
 
02:48:50.000 --> 02:48:51.510 align:start position:0%
so the step the step this time was
between

02:48:51.510 --> 02:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
between
 
02:48:54.710 --> 02:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
this year and next year
 
02:48:56.469 --> 02:48:56.479 align:start position:0%
and then there's oh then there's another
 
02:48:58.710 --> 02:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
step every year that's the 5.6
 
02:49:00.710 --> 02:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
and then also fiscal year 23 has an
 
02:49:02.790 --> 02:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
extra pay period
 
02:49:05.510 --> 02:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
okay and part of the reason that this
 
02:49:07.030 --> 02:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
might be a larger jump in some
 
02:49:09.030 --> 02:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
other areas is these were all vacant
 
02:49:09.040 --> 02:49:10.150 align:start position:0%
other areas is these were all vacant
positions

02:49:10.150 --> 02:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
positions
 
02:49:12.150 --> 02:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
and when they're vacant they're budgeted
 
02:49:13.269 --> 02:49:13.279 align:start position:0%
at step one
 
02:49:15.750 --> 02:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
so if we hire any higher if we hire them
 
02:49:17.269 --> 02:49:17.279 align:start position:0%
at a higher pay
 
02:49:19.510 --> 02:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
because of their experience or or their
 
02:49:19.520 --> 02:49:20.469 align:start position:0%
because of their experience or or their
education

02:49:20.469 --> 02:49:20.479 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:49:21.670 --> 02:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
then that's going to make this first
 
02:49:23.910 --> 02:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
year number higher okay
 
02:49:27.510 --> 02:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
thanks sorry
 
02:49:31.110 --> 02:49:31.120 align:start position:0%
well those good questions thank you um
 
02:49:34.710 --> 02:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
okay i think uh we can move on to
 
02:49:37.269 --> 02:49:37.279 align:start position:0%
juvenile field services
 
02:49:41.349 --> 02:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
um i don't think we
 
02:49:42.710 --> 02:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
i don't think we got all the way through
 
02:49:44.790 --> 02:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
these accounting units
 
02:49:47.190 --> 02:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
i was i thought juvenile field services
 
02:49:48.550 --> 02:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
was next
 
02:49:51.190 --> 02:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
it's not good go to your next i'm just
 
02:49:52.070 --> 02:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
02:49:55.750 --> 02:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
my no i don't believe so so the next one
 
02:49:56.950 --> 02:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
was a workman's comp
 
02:49:59.269 --> 02:49:59.279 align:start position:0%
uh which as i've discussed we moved to
 
02:49:59.279 --> 02:50:00.550 align:start position:0%
uh which as i've discussed we moved to
ocom

02:50:00.550 --> 02:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
ocom
 
02:50:04.710 --> 02:50:04.720 align:start position:0%
um oh hold on sorry
 
02:50:10.630 --> 02:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:14.469 --> 02:50:14.479 align:start position:0%
so then workling.com 2967 should be the
 
02:50:19.070 --> 02:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:23.910 --> 02:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
2967 which is child welfare services 4b
 
02:50:42.389 --> 02:50:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:45.510 --> 02:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at the spreadsheet that you
 
02:50:47.510 --> 02:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
put together
 
02:50:50.630 --> 02:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
off of the dhh baseline
 
02:50:55.190 --> 02:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
dhhs fy 18-23
 
02:50:59.510 --> 02:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
yep and it looks like i'm maybe missing
 
02:51:02.830 --> 02:51:02.840 align:start position:0%
this account so that was based off of
 
02:51:04.150 --> 02:51:04.160 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:51:05.429 --> 02:51:05.439 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet used in the department's
 
02:51:07.670 --> 02:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
briefing book which only had accounts of
 
02:51:09.670 --> 02:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
a million dollars or greater
 
02:51:11.670 --> 02:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
so a smaller account wouldn't be in
 
02:51:11.680 --> 02:51:12.710 align:start position:0%
so a smaller account wouldn't be in
there

02:51:12.710 --> 02:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:51:15.030 --> 02:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
okay so there there are there is that
 
02:51:16.950 --> 02:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
line accounts less than a million
 
02:51:16.960 --> 02:51:18.150 align:start position:0%
line accounts less than a million
dollars

02:51:18.150 --> 02:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:51:21.670 --> 02:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
so all right
 
02:51:25.269 --> 02:51:25.279 align:start position:0%
okay so we're on accounting unit 2968
 
02:51:30.830 --> 02:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:30.840 --> 02:51:34.870 align:start position:0%
 
federal

02:51:34.870 --> 02:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:38.469 --> 02:51:38.479 align:start position:0%
okay the next one is 2969
 
02:51:44.830 --> 02:51:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:44.840 --> 02:51:51.830 align:start position:0%
 
federal

02:51:51.830 --> 02:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:54.389 --> 02:51:54.399 align:start position:0%
the next accounting unit is 2970 which
 
02:51:57.190 --> 02:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
is teen independent living
 
02:52:00.790 --> 02:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
that continues on to page 944 also 100
 
02:52:00.800 --> 02:52:05.269 align:start position:0%
that continues on to page 944 also 100
federal

02:52:05.269 --> 02:52:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:08.790 --> 02:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
independent living i i didn't think we
 
02:52:10.030 --> 02:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
had an emanci
 
02:52:12.630 --> 02:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
emancipation program in new hampshire
 
02:52:13.510 --> 02:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
how does
 
02:52:16.790 --> 02:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
how's it how does a teen legally end up
 
02:52:19.750 --> 02:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
living independently i guess after high
 
02:52:21.030 --> 02:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
school or
 
02:52:23.750 --> 02:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
who are these teens these are this is
 
02:52:25.429 --> 02:52:25.439 align:start position:0%
this is some of the federal funding used
 
02:52:26.389 --> 02:52:26.399 align:start position:0%
to support
 
02:52:29.429 --> 02:52:29.439 align:start position:0%
transition-aged youth right so
 
02:52:31.590 --> 02:52:31.600 align:start position:0%
typically these would be 18 year olds
 
02:52:33.269 --> 02:52:33.279 align:start position:0%
right who are transitioning from foster
 
02:52:33.279 --> 02:52:35.910 align:start position:0%
right who are transitioning from foster
care

02:52:35.910 --> 02:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:38.150 --> 02:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
okay and then we've extended the ability
 
02:52:39.429 --> 02:52:39.439 align:start position:0%
to for foster
 
02:52:42.389 --> 02:52:42.399 align:start position:0%
care to to voluntarily go to 21 is
 
02:52:43.349 --> 02:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
another way of
 
02:52:46.389 --> 02:52:46.399 align:start position:0%
of handling it yes okay
 
02:52:48.469 --> 02:52:48.479 align:start position:0%
representative if you have a question
 
02:52:49.670 --> 02:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
just a general question there's about a
 
02:52:51.830 --> 02:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
half a dozen of these all federal fund
 
02:52:54.389 --> 02:52:54.399 align:start position:0%
uh accounts so the federal government
 
02:52:55.429 --> 02:52:55.439 align:start position:0%
basically just say
 
02:52:57.590 --> 02:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
we want to have these kinds of things
 
02:52:59.590 --> 02:52:59.600 align:start position:0%
done and here's the money for it
 
02:53:02.230 --> 02:53:02.240 align:start position:0%
yeah they're they're largely formula
 
02:53:03.750 --> 02:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
grant funded
 
02:53:05.269 --> 02:53:05.279 align:start position:0%
so these different types of programs
 
02:53:07.510 --> 02:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
where the federal government puts some
 
02:53:08.950 --> 02:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
some restrictions around how the funds
 
02:53:10.710 --> 02:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
should be used and then
 
02:53:13.110 --> 02:53:13.120 align:start position:0%
divvied up by the states based on you
 
02:53:13.120 --> 02:53:13.750 align:start position:0%
divvied up by the states based on you
know

02:53:13.750 --> 02:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:53:25.670 --> 02:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
per capita thank you
 
02:53:28.389 --> 02:53:28.399 align:start position:0%
the next accounting is 29.71 adolescent
 
02:53:28.399 --> 02:53:32.309 align:start position:0%
the next accounting is 29.71 adolescent
aftercare

02:53:32.309 --> 02:53:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:39.349 --> 02:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
which is also 100 federal
 
02:53:43.030 --> 02:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
joe what is aftercare um so aftercare is
 
02:53:43.040 --> 02:53:44.070 align:start position:0%
joe what is aftercare um so aftercare is
typically

02:53:44.070 --> 02:53:44.080 align:start position:0%
typically
 
02:53:47.910 --> 02:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
um it's typically less money used for
 
02:53:50.790 --> 02:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
youth who are still having some
 
02:53:52.630 --> 02:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
challenges beyond the age of
 
02:53:53.830 --> 02:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
you know when they would age out of the
 
02:53:55.670 --> 02:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
system so these are not kids who are
 
02:53:57.269 --> 02:53:57.279 align:start position:0%
actively in the foster care program or
 
02:53:58.389 --> 02:53:58.399 align:start position:0%
kids who are
 
02:54:00.790 --> 02:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
um you know who we're providing you know
 
02:54:02.630 --> 02:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
direct support for but
 
02:54:04.150 --> 02:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
um they could be kids who have aged out
 
02:54:06.710 --> 02:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
of the system who who have some type of
 
02:54:10.309 --> 02:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
you know short-term discrete need um
 
02:54:12.150 --> 02:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
again these are kind of federal funds
 
02:54:18.790 --> 02:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:21.510 --> 02:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
thank you the next one is 29.72 which is
 
02:54:21.520 --> 02:54:22.389 align:start position:0%
thank you the next one is 29.72 which is
adolescent

02:54:22.389 --> 02:54:22.399 align:start position:0%
adolescent
 
02:54:25.429 --> 02:54:25.439 align:start position:0%
purchase services this is 100 federal
 
02:54:25.439 --> 02:54:32.830 align:start position:0%
purchase services this is 100 federal
funds

02:54:32.830 --> 02:54:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:32.840 --> 02:54:38.070 align:start position:0%
 
questions

02:54:38.070 --> 02:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:40.710 --> 02:54:40.720 align:start position:0%
okay the next one is 2973 which is
 
02:54:43.349 --> 02:54:43.359 align:start position:0%
promoting safe stable families
 
02:54:47.110 --> 02:54:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:50.469 --> 02:54:50.479 align:start position:0%
how do we promote safe stable families
 
02:54:53.190 --> 02:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
what what what what's like the main tool
 
02:54:53.670 --> 02:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
in our
 
02:54:56.230 --> 02:54:56.240 align:start position:0%
our toolkit for promoting safe stable
 
02:54:58.070 --> 02:54:58.080 align:start position:0%
families is this counseling
 
02:55:00.790 --> 02:55:00.800 align:start position:0%
or is it something else you know i'd
 
02:55:02.309 --> 02:55:02.319 align:start position:0%
have to
 
02:55:04.469 --> 02:55:04.479 align:start position:0%
the all with all of these grants being
 
02:55:06.150 --> 02:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
relatively small amounts of money with
 
02:55:06.160 --> 02:55:07.190 align:start position:0%
relatively small amounts of money with
overlapping

02:55:07.190 --> 02:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
overlapping
 
02:55:09.910 --> 02:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
um missions a lot of them are used to
 
02:55:09.920 --> 02:55:10.630 align:start position:0%
um missions a lot of them are used to
fund

02:55:10.630 --> 02:55:10.640 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:55:12.630 --> 02:55:12.640 align:start position:0%
um you know the same programs i'd have
 
02:55:14.070 --> 02:55:14.080 align:start position:0%
to go back and look at exactly which
 
02:55:16.150 --> 02:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
grants are funding which programs
 
02:55:19.670 --> 02:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
but some of these funds are used to do
 
02:55:21.269 --> 02:55:21.279 align:start position:0%
foster care recruitment and things like
 
02:55:23.670 --> 02:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
that some of these funds are used for
 
02:55:26.790 --> 02:55:26.800 align:start position:0%
supporting our adoption
 
02:55:29.830 --> 02:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
our adoption program we have the adopt
 
02:55:31.990 --> 02:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
nh.org where people can learn about kids
 
02:55:33.830 --> 02:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
who are legally free for adoption
 
02:55:36.950 --> 02:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
some of these funds are used to to fund
 
02:55:38.070 --> 02:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
portions of some of our other
 
02:55:40.309 --> 02:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
programming um
 
02:55:41.750 --> 02:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to think off the top of my
 
02:55:44.550 --> 02:55:44.560 align:start position:0%
head um
 
02:55:46.070 --> 02:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
i'll have to double checking it back to
 
02:55:48.230 --> 02:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
you but there's they they tend to just
 
02:55:51.110 --> 02:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
cover a small piece of of other
 
02:55:52.790 --> 02:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
programming because they are relatively
 
02:55:55.030 --> 02:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
small dollar amount grants
 
02:55:58.070 --> 02:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
sure between the two years it's it's
 
02:56:01.830 --> 02:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
1.3 million so it's it's almost like
 
02:56:03.990 --> 02:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
real money
 
02:56:05.590 --> 02:56:05.600 align:start position:0%
yeah but you can't build a you can't
 
02:56:07.110 --> 02:56:07.120 align:start position:0%
build a comprehensive system with it
 
02:56:07.750 --> 02:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
right you can
 
02:56:10.950 --> 02:56:10.960 align:start position:0%
no i know i'm just curious what it is
 
02:56:14.150 --> 02:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
but it's not urgent that that that can
 
02:56:14.160 --> 02:56:14.630 align:start position:0%
but it's not urgent that that that can
be

02:56:14.630 --> 02:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:56:17.429 --> 02:56:17.439 align:start position:0%
you know as we approach summer and we
 
02:56:17.439 --> 02:56:17.830 align:start position:0%
you know as we approach summer and we
need

02:56:17.830 --> 02:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
need
 
02:56:21.110 --> 02:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
something to talk about um if i could
 
02:56:21.830 --> 02:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
just add
 
02:56:25.110 --> 02:56:25.120 align:start position:0%
that um on the key accomplishments
 
02:56:28.230 --> 02:56:28.240 align:start position:0%
on the presentation that joe provided
 
02:56:29.950 --> 02:56:29.960 align:start position:0%
on the last one the road map to
 
02:56:29.960 --> 02:56:31.349 align:start position:0%
on the last one the road map to
reunification

02:56:31.349 --> 02:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
reunification
 
02:56:34.309 --> 02:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
the partnerships um some of these
 
02:56:35.830 --> 02:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
dollars go to fund
 
02:56:39.670 --> 02:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
part of those contracts yes
 
02:56:44.070 --> 02:56:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:45.830 --> 02:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
all right i think we're ready for the
 
02:56:48.550 --> 02:56:48.560 align:start position:0%
next the next one is 2974 which is
 
02:56:51.429 --> 02:56:51.439 align:start position:0%
adoption services
 
02:56:57.750 --> 02:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:59.590 --> 02:56:59.600 align:start position:0%
again my eyes are having a tough time
 
02:57:01.910 --> 02:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
focusing because i'm using the screen
 
02:57:08.790 --> 02:57:08.800 align:start position:0%
it's uh i'm not i'm not seeing any
 
02:57:11.830 --> 02:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
okay so it's a it's it's basically
 
02:57:13.349 --> 02:57:13.359 align:start position:0%
a little less than two hundred thousand
 
02:57:15.670 --> 02:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
dollars a year yes 195
 
02:57:19.110 --> 02:57:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:21.670 --> 02:57:21.680 align:start position:0%
so one day i'd like to have a a
 
02:57:21.680 --> 02:57:23.110 align:start position:0%
so one day i'd like to have a a
conversation

02:57:23.110 --> 02:57:23.120 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
02:57:26.150 --> 02:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
about what we can do to
 
02:57:30.550 --> 02:57:30.560 align:start position:0%
help the adoption process what we can do
 
02:57:33.349 --> 02:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
what what what what the challenges are
 
02:57:33.359 --> 02:57:33.750 align:start position:0%
what what what what the challenges are
with

02:57:33.750 --> 02:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:57:37.269 --> 02:57:37.279 align:start position:0%
with getting kids adopted and um
 
02:57:38.870 --> 02:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
and what we might be able to do to
 
02:57:40.710 --> 02:57:40.720 align:start position:0%
facilitate that whether it's
 
02:57:43.830 --> 02:57:43.840 align:start position:0%
making the legal process easier or
 
02:57:46.550 --> 02:57:46.560 align:start position:0%
or something i just i'd really like to
 
02:57:48.389 --> 02:57:48.399 align:start position:0%
talk about the adoption where we are
 
02:57:50.950 --> 02:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
with the adoption system
 
02:57:54.550 --> 02:57:54.560 align:start position:0%
we we we can we can make that a may june
 
02:57:54.560 --> 02:57:58.870 align:start position:0%
we we we can we can make that a may june
conversation

02:57:58.870 --> 02:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:02.070 --> 02:58:02.080 align:start position:0%
okay next next accounting unit 29.75 is
 
02:58:03.190 --> 02:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
uh no longer
 
02:58:06.110 --> 02:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
being used and the same is true with
 
02:58:06.120 --> 02:58:07.349 align:start position:0%
being used and the same is true with
8903

02:58:07.349 --> 02:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
8903
 
02:58:10.550 --> 02:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
which now does um wrap up
 
02:58:13.590 --> 02:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
the child's protection area
 
02:58:16.389 --> 02:58:16.399 align:start position:0%
so if i go back over here to the slide
 
02:58:16.399 --> 02:58:17.030 align:start position:0%
so if i go back over here to the slide
deck

02:58:17.030 --> 02:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
deck
 
02:58:18.630 --> 02:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
that was the last accounting unit eating
 
02:58:18.640 --> 02:58:24.150 align:start position:0%
that was the last accounting unit eating
903

02:58:24.150 --> 02:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:27.510 --> 02:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
and the next area is juvenile
 
02:58:31.110 --> 02:58:31.120 align:start position:0%
justice which is made up of 108
 
02:58:31.120 --> 02:58:34.950 align:start position:0%
justice which is made up of 108
employees

02:58:34.950 --> 02:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:39.269 --> 02:58:39.279 align:start position:0%
the total budgets are as follows
 
02:58:42.230 --> 02:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
not much changing from year to year
 
02:58:43.110 --> 02:58:43.120 align:start position:0%
other than
 
02:58:48.230 --> 02:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:51.750 --> 02:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
so so this is under the general title of
 
02:58:54.710 --> 02:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
juvenile field services so there are two
 
02:58:55.670 --> 02:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
accounting units
 
02:58:57.309 --> 02:58:57.319 align:start position:0%
associated with this the first one is
 
02:58:57.319 --> 02:58:58.950 align:start position:0%
associated with this the first one is
7905

02:58:58.950 --> 02:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
7905
 
02:59:02.070 --> 02:59:02.080 align:start position:0%
on page 953
 
02:59:05.030 --> 02:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
where is the field is the is the field
 
02:59:06.950 --> 02:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
all over the state they travel all over
 
02:59:07.590 --> 02:59:07.600 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:59:10.070 --> 02:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
or is the field these folks work at
 
02:59:10.790 --> 02:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
three or four
 
02:59:13.269 --> 02:59:13.279 align:start position:0%
facilities these folks work at the
 
02:59:15.349 --> 02:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
district offices throughout the state
 
02:59:17.349 --> 02:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
and they serve families throughout the
 
02:59:17.359 --> 02:59:18.320 align:start position:0%
and they serve families throughout the
state

02:59:18.320 --> 02:59:18.330 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:59:18.330 --> 02:59:20.469 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
02:59:22.389 --> 02:59:22.399 align:start position:0%
there are their homework fame as the
 
02:59:33.269 --> 02:59:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:34.670 --> 02:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
okay so the first accounting unit is
 
02:59:37.670 --> 02:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
79.05 which starts with page 953 and
 
02:59:46.790 --> 02:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:50.469 --> 02:59:50.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:53.670 --> 02:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any okay the
 
02:59:55.110 --> 02:59:55.120 align:start position:0%
other accounting unit associated with
 
02:59:57.590 --> 02:59:57.600 align:start position:0%
this area is 7906
 
03:00:00.950 --> 03:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
which is ojdp um
 
03:00:04.230 --> 03:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
which if i recall correctly joe is a
 
03:00:08.150 --> 03:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh grant yes
 
03:00:12.150 --> 03:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:13.830 --> 03:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
and does this grant is this the one that
 
03:00:15.670 --> 03:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
has a committee associated with it that
 
03:00:17.670 --> 03:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
determines how the funds are spent
 
03:00:19.670 --> 03:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
that's correct yeah the state advisory
 
03:00:19.680 --> 03:00:20.710 align:start position:0%
that's correct yeah the state advisory
group

03:00:20.710 --> 03:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
group
 
03:00:30.230 --> 03:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:30.240 --> 03:00:33.990 align:start position:0%
 
questions

03:00:33.990 --> 03:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:38.469 --> 03:00:38.479 align:start position:0%
all right go back over to the slide deck
 
03:00:40.630 --> 03:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
um and the last bunch of accounting
 
03:00:42.389 --> 03:00:42.399 align:start position:0%
units so i think we'll meet your 315
 
03:00:43.510 --> 03:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
deadline hopefully
 
03:00:46.630 --> 03:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
chair um is sysc
 
03:00:48.790 --> 03:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
this uh shows the total positions what i
 
03:00:50.230 --> 03:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
would note
 
03:00:52.630 --> 03:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
is there have been several reductions in
 
03:00:54.070 --> 03:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
positions over the past several
 
03:00:54.080 --> 03:00:55.349 align:start position:0%
positions over the past several
bienniums

03:00:55.349 --> 03:00:55.359 align:start position:0%
bienniums
 
03:00:56.950 --> 03:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
and those positions have not been
 
03:00:59.510 --> 03:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
abolished they've only been unfunded
 
03:01:01.830 --> 03:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
so when you look at the total positions
 
03:01:03.750 --> 03:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
you see those
 
03:01:06.469 --> 03:01:06.479 align:start position:0%
22 positions in the position count but
 
03:01:07.429 --> 03:01:07.439 align:start position:0%
there are no fun
 
03:01:09.349 --> 03:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
there is no funding for those 22
 
03:01:09.359 --> 03:01:10.950 align:start position:0%
there is no funding for those 22
positions

03:01:10.950 --> 03:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
positions
 
03:01:12.710 --> 03:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
and if if you're looking at the
 
03:01:14.710 --> 03:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
comparison from the agency phase to the
 
03:01:16.070 --> 03:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
governor's phase
 
03:01:18.309 --> 03:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
um we did accidentally fund some of
 
03:01:19.830 --> 03:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
those in the agency phase and the
 
03:01:20.950 --> 03:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
correction was made in the
 
03:01:24.150 --> 03:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
governor's phase it was just a accident
 
03:01:27.910 --> 03:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
sure so so what is the decision
 
03:01:30.070 --> 03:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
that needs to be made if we're not going
 
03:01:31.269 --> 03:01:31.279 align:start position:0%
to fund a position
 
03:01:33.910 --> 03:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
why do we carry the head count or the
 
03:01:36.469 --> 03:01:36.479 align:start position:0%
fte count still
 
03:01:38.950 --> 03:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
why not just reduce the number of
 
03:01:38.960 --> 03:01:39.910 align:start position:0%
why not just reduce the number of
recommended

03:01:39.910 --> 03:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
recommended
 
03:01:43.030 --> 03:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
positions there's i
 
03:01:44.950 --> 03:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't necessarily say we need all
 
03:01:46.870 --> 03:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
these unfunded positions i will say
 
03:01:48.790 --> 03:01:48.800 align:start position:0%
there is value to having some unfunded
 
03:01:50.630 --> 03:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
positions in areas where there are
 
03:01:50.640 --> 03:01:52.630 align:start position:0%
positions in areas where there are
smaller

03:01:52.630 --> 03:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
smaller
 
03:01:54.630 --> 03:01:54.640 align:start position:0%
numbers of staff unfortunately that's
 
03:01:56.070 --> 03:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
why i see we do see a lot of
 
03:01:58.150 --> 03:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
folks go out on you know medical leave
 
03:01:59.750 --> 03:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
injury things like that
 
03:02:03.269 --> 03:02:03.279 align:start position:0%
um you know for example um you know if
 
03:02:06.070 --> 03:02:06.080 align:start position:0%
if we lose a maintenance staff or or
 
03:02:07.590 --> 03:02:07.600 align:start position:0%
something like that as a result
 
03:02:09.429 --> 03:02:09.439 align:start position:0%
of uh you know some type of injury or
 
03:02:11.830 --> 03:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
medical leave those grounds are so large
 
03:02:13.110 --> 03:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
and complex that we can't really live
 
03:02:14.710 --> 03:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
without those people for too long and
 
03:02:15.429 --> 03:02:15.439 align:start position:0%
being able to
 
03:02:16.950 --> 03:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
fund an unfunded position is a lot
 
03:02:19.590 --> 03:02:19.600 align:start position:0%
easier than creating a new position
 
03:02:22.070 --> 03:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
um so i think there's there is benefit
 
03:02:23.990 --> 03:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
organizationally to being able to have
 
03:02:24.870 --> 03:02:24.880 align:start position:0%
some of that
 
03:02:26.790 --> 03:02:26.800 align:start position:0%
certainly right having 18 unfunded
 
03:02:28.389 --> 03:02:28.399 align:start position:0%
positions of education are never going
 
03:02:29.990 --> 03:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
to be
 
03:02:32.870 --> 03:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
you know that's not necessary let me
 
03:02:34.950 --> 03:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
just comment
 
03:02:37.990 --> 03:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
go ahead in the last budget as a way of
 
03:02:41.110 --> 03:02:41.120 align:start position:0%
keeping the hhs down at the time they
 
03:02:42.150 --> 03:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
had a whole lot of
 
03:02:45.910 --> 03:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
vacancies so what what the last budget
 
03:02:47.750 --> 03:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
did more or less was freeze the number
 
03:02:49.990 --> 03:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
of positions you have
 
03:02:53.750 --> 03:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
and gave them flexibility to okay
 
03:02:55.590 --> 03:02:55.600 align:start position:0%
you really need to hire this person who
 
03:02:58.070 --> 03:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
just left you can replace this position
 
03:02:59.750 --> 03:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
with that position and come before
 
03:03:02.950 --> 03:03:02.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal to tell what they had done and
 
03:03:04.870 --> 03:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
it was a regular thing on fiscals to say
 
03:03:06.469 --> 03:03:06.479 align:start position:0%
well we
 
03:03:08.630 --> 03:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
moving these three positions to these
 
03:03:11.590 --> 03:03:11.600 align:start position:0%
three positions so basically it was
 
03:03:15.990 --> 03:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
a way to keep the spending down in hhs
 
03:03:19.110 --> 03:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
it's not a normally used thing so you
 
03:03:20.469 --> 03:03:20.479 align:start position:0%
had a lot of
 
03:03:23.750 --> 03:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
positions that were if you will
 
03:03:25.750 --> 03:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
funded but not filled because they
 
03:03:27.269 --> 03:03:27.279 align:start position:0%
really weren't funded
 
03:03:30.070 --> 03:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
until another vacancy came available
 
03:03:31.670 --> 03:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
somewhere else
 
03:03:33.830 --> 03:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
that was just a gimmick first time we
 
03:03:36.309 --> 03:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
used it thank you
 
03:03:39.030 --> 03:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
thank you across the department you will
 
03:03:40.550 --> 03:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
see in the budget bill that we have
 
03:03:42.469 --> 03:03:42.479 align:start position:0%
abolished one position
 
03:03:45.510 --> 03:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
this um this biennium it's a medicaid
 
03:03:45.520 --> 03:03:46.309 align:start position:0%
this um this biennium it's a medicaid
position

03:03:46.309 --> 03:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
position
 
03:03:48.790 --> 03:03:48.800 align:start position:0%
um so that's the position that's been
 
03:03:50.630 --> 03:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
abolished and it's being replaced by
 
03:03:51.990 --> 03:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
another position
 
03:03:54.309 --> 03:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
uh you could call me superstitious but
 
03:03:55.429 --> 03:03:55.439 align:start position:0%
we had um
 
03:03:58.309 --> 03:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
three employees in a row pass away while
 
03:04:00.230 --> 03:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
in that position and so we decided to
 
03:04:01.990 --> 03:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
retire that position number and create a
 
03:04:05.269 --> 03:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:06.710 --> 03:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
i know a little strange call me
 
03:04:08.790 --> 03:04:08.800 align:start position:0%
superstitious but it was just too
 
03:04:10.230 --> 03:04:10.240 align:start position:0%
strange to have three employees in a
 
03:04:13.349 --> 03:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
rail pass away and unexpectedly
 
03:04:16.710 --> 03:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
if the number was 666 or something
 
03:04:18.870 --> 03:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
it wasn't it wasn't there was no reason
 
03:04:20.950 --> 03:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
to have suspicion before
 
03:04:23.030 --> 03:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
so so that's the only position abolished
 
03:04:24.790 --> 03:04:24.800 align:start position:0%
in the department
 
03:04:28.309 --> 03:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
okay any questions
 
03:04:32.950 --> 03:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:36.150 --> 03:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
so uh the pie charts show that
 
03:04:38.309 --> 03:04:38.319 align:start position:0%
the budget was essentially level funded
 
03:04:39.590 --> 03:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
from 18
 
03:04:43.269 --> 03:04:43.279 align:start position:0%
19 to 20 21
 
03:04:47.910 --> 03:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
there were layoffs at the end of 1819
 
03:04:50.469 --> 03:04:50.479 align:start position:0%
to achieve that level funding there was
 
03:04:50.479 --> 03:04:50.950 align:start position:0%
to achieve that level funding there was
also

03:04:50.950 --> 03:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
also
 
03:04:54.389 --> 03:04:54.399 align:start position:0%
a back the budget cut in house bill one
 
03:04:56.630 --> 03:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
that specifically related in addition to
 
03:04:58.230 --> 03:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
our department-wide budget cut
 
03:05:01.030 --> 03:05:01.040 align:start position:0%
but excuse me back of the budget cut
 
03:05:01.670 --> 03:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
there was an
 
03:05:03.030 --> 03:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
additional back of the budget cut that
 
03:05:06.150 --> 03:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
specifically related to sysc
 
03:05:09.590 --> 03:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
excuse me all right
 
03:05:11.670 --> 03:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
thank you the additional other funds
 
03:05:12.870 --> 03:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
that you're seeing here
 
03:05:17.910 --> 03:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
are potential funds um from vermont
 
03:05:17.920 --> 03:05:18.389 align:start position:0%
are potential funds um from vermont
which

03:05:18.389 --> 03:05:18.399 align:start position:0%
which
 
03:05:21.750 --> 03:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
may or may not happen from what ops did
 
03:05:22.870 --> 03:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
you say ops
 
03:05:24.950 --> 03:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
no the state of vermont and the contract
 
03:05:26.389 --> 03:05:26.399 align:start position:0%
that we have with them
 
03:05:30.710 --> 03:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:32.309 --> 03:05:32.319 align:start position:0%
so the first accounting unit in this
 
03:05:42.150 --> 03:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:43.910 --> 03:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh starts here sort of at the middle of
 
03:05:45.269 --> 03:05:45.279 align:start position:0%
the page which is the
 
03:06:00.150 --> 03:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
sysc director's office
 
03:06:08.309 --> 03:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:11.269 --> 03:06:11.279 align:start position:0%
uh this is an area as i've mentioned the
 
03:06:11.279 --> 03:06:12.150 align:start position:0%
uh this is an area as i've mentioned the
unemployment

03:06:12.150 --> 03:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
unemployment
 
03:06:15.190 --> 03:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
um and with comp we keep within the
 
03:06:15.200 --> 03:06:15.830 align:start position:0%
um and with comp we keep within the
facility

03:06:15.830 --> 03:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
facility
 
03:06:18.469 --> 03:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
because the workman's comp especially
 
03:06:19.830 --> 03:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
can be very unique
 
03:06:22.150 --> 03:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
to the facility um injuries are very
 
03:06:23.030 --> 03:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
different than
 
03:06:25.670 --> 03:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
somebody like me who's in an office so
 
03:06:26.710 --> 03:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
we do keep those
 
03:06:28.550 --> 03:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
separately within the facilities budgets
 
03:06:30.309 --> 03:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
03:06:34.150 --> 03:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:37.590 --> 03:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
so really the next one is 7913 which is
 
03:06:46.469 --> 03:06:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:49.030 --> 03:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
okay so so that had a bit of a jump is
 
03:06:50.870 --> 03:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
that related to the
 
03:06:55.429 --> 03:06:55.439 align:start position:0%
barn slash roof
 
03:06:57.830 --> 03:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
i think it was more just trying to
 
03:06:58.950 --> 03:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
budget at the level
 
03:07:02.389 --> 03:07:02.399 align:start position:0%
that we've experienced in fiscal year 20
 
03:07:03.670 --> 03:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
they spent about 35
 
03:07:06.580 --> 03:07:06.590 align:start position:0%
000 so we budgeted 37. um
 
03:07:06.590 --> 03:07:07.990 align:start position:0%
000 so we budgeted 37. um
[Music]

03:07:07.990 --> 03:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:07:09.590 --> 03:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
rebecca was there any other reason that
 
03:07:09.600 --> 03:07:12.790 align:start position:0%
rebecca was there any other reason that
that

03:07:12.790 --> 03:07:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:16.070 --> 03:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
no just um potential increasing costs
 
03:07:16.630 --> 03:07:16.640 align:start position:0%
this is
 
03:07:19.349 --> 03:07:19.359 align:start position:0%
um an area where we um this is our
 
03:07:19.359 --> 03:07:20.070 align:start position:0%
um an area where we um this is our
warehouse

03:07:20.070 --> 03:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
warehouse
 
03:07:23.030 --> 03:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
and we uh it's hygiene products for the
 
03:07:23.040 --> 03:07:23.429 align:start position:0%
and we uh it's hygiene products for the
kids

03:07:23.429 --> 03:07:23.439 align:start position:0%
kids
 
03:07:28.870 --> 03:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:31.510 --> 03:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
so is this these these are this is
 
03:07:33.590 --> 03:07:33.600 align:start position:0%
material management for the sununu
 
03:07:34.389 --> 03:07:34.399 align:start position:0%
center or
 
03:07:42.309 --> 03:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:44.309 --> 03:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
so this is one that actually should be
 
03:07:46.150 --> 03:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
really correlated to
 
03:07:48.710 --> 03:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
the number of people that are uh being
 
03:07:50.630 --> 03:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
guests of the facility
 
03:07:54.550 --> 03:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:59.750 --> 03:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:01.910 --> 03:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
the next accounting unit is 1203 which
 
03:08:20.550 --> 03:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:23.670 --> 03:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
okay so someday if i ever were to ask
 
03:08:25.030 --> 03:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
you what the average
 
03:08:28.550 --> 03:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
cost of each meal is you'd be able to
 
03:08:31.429 --> 03:08:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:34.150 --> 03:08:34.160 align:start position:0%
so we can come fairly close because at
 
03:08:35.990 --> 03:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
one time we were providing meals to
 
03:08:37.429 --> 03:08:37.439 align:start position:0%
another part of the facility for a
 
03:08:37.439 --> 03:08:38.630 align:start position:0%
another part of the facility for a
contractor

03:08:38.630 --> 03:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
contractor
 
03:08:40.870 --> 03:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
so we had come up with estimates so if
 
03:08:42.389 --> 03:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
you want we could provide you
 
03:08:43.750 --> 03:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
what we had come up with at that time
 
03:08:47.670 --> 03:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:49.269 --> 03:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
i'm going to be we're going to be asking
 
03:08:50.710 --> 03:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
you a bunch of stuff this
 
03:08:53.190 --> 03:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
that would be an an interesting trivia
 
03:08:53.200 --> 03:08:53.990 align:start position:0%
that would be an an interesting trivia
question

03:08:53.990 --> 03:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:08:59.190 --> 03:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:02.710 --> 03:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
uh representative weiler has a question
 
03:09:06.389 --> 03:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
now one time before we uh opened the new
 
03:09:08.070 --> 03:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
sununu center
 
03:09:10.870 --> 03:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
the meal costs were much lower then they
 
03:09:12.550 --> 03:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
opened the sununu center and the meal
 
03:09:13.750 --> 03:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
costs went up
 
03:09:16.710 --> 03:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
high it was because you had a almost a
 
03:09:16.720 --> 03:09:17.830 align:start position:0%
high it was because you had a almost a
24-hour

03:09:17.830 --> 03:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
24-hour
 
03:09:21.030 --> 03:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
kitchen or cafeteria as it were
 
03:09:23.670 --> 03:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
are we still maintaining that cafeteria
 
03:09:24.870 --> 03:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
for the
 
03:09:27.990 --> 03:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
dozen kids that are there
 
03:09:29.990 --> 03:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
there there does remain a cafeteria in a
 
03:09:32.150 --> 03:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
food service it's not running 24 hours
 
03:09:35.349 --> 03:09:35.359 align:start position:0%
serving three meals a day does it serve
 
03:09:36.550 --> 03:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
three meals a day
 
03:09:41.190 --> 03:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
yes it's probably 18 hours or so
 
03:09:47.990 --> 03:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:51.429 --> 03:09:51.439 align:start position:0%
how many meals a day are they serving
 
03:09:53.910 --> 03:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
depends on the census but you know three
 
03:09:53.920 --> 03:09:54.630 align:start position:0%
depends on the census but you know three
million

03:09:54.630 --> 03:09:54.640 align:start position:0%
million
 
03:09:58.070 --> 03:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
we'll have a full staff
 
03:10:01.269 --> 03:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
yeah the there's the the staffing there
 
03:10:02.950 --> 03:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
has been reduced over the years from
 
03:10:03.910 --> 03:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
what it was
 
03:10:06.229 --> 03:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
um but yeah there are staff there to
 
03:10:06.239 --> 03:10:06.950 align:start position:0%
um but yeah there are staff there to
prepare

03:10:06.950 --> 03:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
prepare
 
03:10:08.469 --> 03:10:08.479 align:start position:0%
those three meals a day seven days a
 
03:10:11.990 --> 03:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
week 365 days a year
 
03:10:15.349 --> 03:10:15.359 align:start position:0%
probably four or three yeah that sounds
 
03:10:16.790 --> 03:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
about right
 
03:10:18.790 --> 03:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
i think there are you know how many are
 
03:10:20.630 --> 03:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
full i think there might be four
 
03:10:27.830 --> 03:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
filled four positions
 
03:10:30.550 --> 03:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
six positions but i think going back to
 
03:10:30.560 --> 03:10:32.389 align:start position:0%
six positions but i think going back to
here

03:10:32.389 --> 03:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:10:34.630 --> 03:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
there are six and one is unfunded
 
03:10:34.640 --> 03:10:35.510 align:start position:0%
there are six and one is unfunded
currently

03:10:35.510 --> 03:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
currently
 
03:10:37.670 --> 03:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
and i think one's vacant and not without
 
03:10:39.670 --> 03:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
the intent to fill so i think it is for
 
03:10:41.349 --> 03:10:41.359 align:start position:0%
better actually
 
03:10:48.150 --> 03:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:51.510 --> 03:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh representative weiler your hand is
 
03:10:53.429 --> 03:10:53.439 align:start position:0%
still up i assume you're done
 
03:10:57.269 --> 03:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:00.710 --> 03:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
karen i was wondering you were showing
 
03:11:02.790 --> 03:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
that on the prioritized needs you needed
 
03:11:04.950 --> 03:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
another half a million dollars each year
 
03:11:04.960 --> 03:11:05.510 align:start position:0%
another half a million dollars each year
for

03:11:05.510 --> 03:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:11:08.710 --> 03:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
utilities where would that where would
 
03:11:08.720 --> 03:11:09.110 align:start position:0%
utilities where would that where would
that

03:11:09.110 --> 03:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:11:12.790 --> 03:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
show up if we were i believe that
 
03:11:14.630 --> 03:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
shouldn't show up i believe that would
 
03:11:16.070 --> 03:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
be in the next budget which
 
03:11:18.309 --> 03:11:18.319 align:start position:0%
would be 7914 maintenance is that
 
03:11:20.830 --> 03:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
correct rebecca
 
03:11:25.750 --> 03:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:31.190 --> 03:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
representative earth are we on 79-14
 
03:11:35.990 --> 03:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
yeah that was actually a question i had
 
03:11:38.070 --> 03:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
earlier i i didn't have material
 
03:11:39.510 --> 03:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
management maintenance separated when i
 
03:11:40.790 --> 03:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
was looking at this
 
03:11:42.070 --> 03:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
that's why i was asking about the barn
 
03:11:44.469 --> 03:11:44.479 align:start position:0%
slash roof i was looking at the the
 
03:11:48.550 --> 03:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
increase there from this year to next
 
03:11:53.590 --> 03:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:55.190 --> 03:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
which is the maintenance can you speak
 
03:11:57.269 --> 03:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
to the increase in current expenses
 
03:12:00.270 --> 03:12:00.280 align:start position:0%
and yes um
 
03:12:00.280 --> 03:12:02.229 align:start position:0%
and yes um
[Music]

03:12:02.229 --> 03:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:12:05.910 --> 03:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
the increase is due to the
 
03:12:08.469 --> 03:12:08.479 align:start position:0%
cleaning contract that we have or the
 
03:12:11.429 --> 03:12:11.439 align:start position:0%
extra cleaning due to the cobid
 
03:12:13.670 --> 03:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that have been included in this
 
03:12:16.710 --> 03:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:18.950 --> 03:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
just unauthorized well it wasn't
 
03:12:19.830 --> 03:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
something that
 
03:12:22.870 --> 03:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
um we had budgeted it was something that
 
03:12:24.389 --> 03:12:24.399 align:start position:0%
we had to do because of
 
03:12:26.469 --> 03:12:26.479 align:start position:0%
the covid right but i'm looking at the
 
03:12:28.389 --> 03:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized just under 700
 
03:12:30.150 --> 03:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
000 and then i'm looking at next year's
 
03:12:31.510 --> 03:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
recommended it
 
03:12:32.790 --> 03:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
a bit under a million nine fifty
 
03:12:36.790 --> 03:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
thousand am i looking at the right line
 
03:12:40.150 --> 03:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
the total for that compartment
 
03:12:43.110 --> 03:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
uh right it's it was it it's in the
 
03:12:43.120 --> 03:12:43.990 align:start position:0%
uh right it's it was it it's in the
actual

03:12:43.990 --> 03:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
actual
 
03:12:49.590 --> 03:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:55.349 --> 03:12:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:57.190 --> 03:12:57.200 align:start position:0%
i'm a little confused i'm looking at 21
 
03:12:59.349 --> 03:12:59.359 align:start position:0%
to 22.
 
03:13:04.150 --> 03:13:04.160 align:start position:0%
okay so there's no cost in there for
 
03:13:06.550 --> 03:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
the cleaning contract that we currently
 
03:13:06.560 --> 03:13:07.830 align:start position:0%
the cleaning contract that we currently
have

03:13:07.830 --> 03:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:13:11.190 --> 03:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
to because of cobid
 
03:13:13.670 --> 03:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
there's no cost in the 21 actual i mean
 
03:13:14.950 --> 03:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized
 
03:13:17.110 --> 03:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
for the cleaning is that correct okay
 
03:13:18.630 --> 03:13:18.640 align:start position:0%
but there is in the next
 
03:13:21.750 --> 03:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
budget yeah yeah so all the money you
 
03:13:23.030 --> 03:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
spent on cleaning this year
 
03:13:28.229 --> 03:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
where is that where does that show up um
 
03:13:30.630 --> 03:13:30.640 align:start position:0%
well we are going to have to move money
 
03:13:30.640 --> 03:13:31.670 align:start position:0%
well we are going to have to move money
to

03:13:31.670 --> 03:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:13:35.190 --> 03:13:35.200 align:start position:0%
pay for that this is just the adjusted
 
03:13:38.229 --> 03:13:38.239 align:start position:0%
budget at the beginning of july so you
 
03:13:39.910 --> 03:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't see any expenditures
 
03:13:42.950 --> 03:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
right now oh so this suggested
 
03:13:43.910 --> 03:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
authorizes as
 
03:13:48.950 --> 03:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
way back to july no yeah yes
 
03:13:53.110 --> 03:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:54.550 --> 03:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
okay i guess i need to understand what
 
03:13:57.510 --> 03:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized means okay
 
03:14:00.630 --> 03:14:00.640 align:start position:0%
why it means july well that's the
 
03:14:02.710 --> 03:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
beginning of the
 
03:14:04.070 --> 03:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
that's the beginning of the budget year
 
03:14:05.349 --> 03:14:05.359 align:start position:0%
i wonder what they're adjusting at that
 
03:14:05.359 --> 03:14:06.150 align:start position:0%
i wonder what they're adjusting at that
point

03:14:06.150 --> 03:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
point
 
03:14:11.110 --> 03:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
that even started
 
03:14:12.790 --> 03:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't change until we go to
 
03:14:17.990 --> 03:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:20.870 --> 03:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
so i think we can go on off of
 
03:14:20.880 --> 03:14:22.630 align:start position:0%
so i think we can go on off of
maintenance

03:14:22.630 --> 03:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
03:14:25.110 --> 03:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
to help i think it's health services but
 
03:14:36.830 --> 03:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:36.840 --> 03:14:37.990 align:start position:0%
 
correct

03:14:37.990 --> 03:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:14:40.550 --> 03:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
these are health services for who who
 
03:14:42.630 --> 03:14:42.640 align:start position:0%
are the beneficiaries
 
03:14:44.469 --> 03:14:44.479 align:start position:0%
the youth in the facility so i believe
 
03:14:46.229 --> 03:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
this has nursing
 
03:14:48.950 --> 03:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
24 7 nursing staff for the facility as
 
03:14:50.870 --> 03:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
well as
 
03:14:53.910 --> 03:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
the contracted dental services
 
03:14:57.269 --> 03:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
physician services um psychiatric and
 
03:14:58.950 --> 03:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
psychological i think they're here too
 
03:15:01.510 --> 03:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
right rebecca the the dartmouth
 
03:15:05.510 --> 03:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
the psychologist um correct as well as
 
03:15:09.990 --> 03:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
um drugs prescriptions for the kids
 
03:15:14.150 --> 03:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
all that type of stuff so that's 2.5
 
03:15:14.160 --> 03:15:17.349 align:start position:0%
all that type of stuff so that's 2.5
million

03:15:17.349 --> 03:15:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:21.030 --> 03:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
throughput in a in a given year of
 
03:15:27.590 --> 03:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:29.190 --> 03:15:29.200 align:start position:0%
i i don't think i fully heard that
 
03:15:31.110 --> 03:15:31.120 align:start position:0%
question either no i'm trying to figure
 
03:15:32.710 --> 03:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
out the math how much were
 
03:15:36.229 --> 03:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
health services we're paying per uh
 
03:15:38.309 --> 03:15:38.319 align:start position:0%
child that transitions through the
 
03:15:39.830 --> 03:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
facility if our
 
03:15:43.030 --> 03:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
if we if we put about a hundred distinct
 
03:15:45.190 --> 03:15:45.200 align:start position:0%
individuals through
 
03:15:49.429 --> 03:15:49.439 align:start position:0%
sununu in a given year uh 1.3 million
 
03:15:53.429 --> 03:15:53.439 align:start position:0%
works out to be about 1300 per
 
03:15:56.710 --> 03:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
uh resident you know and that that would
 
03:15:57.910 --> 03:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
just be an average
 
03:16:00.070 --> 03:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
it's am i missing some math it just
 
03:16:01.750 --> 03:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
sounds like
 
03:16:03.269 --> 03:16:03.279 align:start position:0%
you know it sounds like a pretty decent
 
03:16:05.269 --> 03:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
amount of money
 
03:16:06.950 --> 03:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
i think this is a place where again
 
03:16:08.469 --> 03:16:08.479 align:start position:0%
those economies of scale have really
 
03:16:11.349 --> 03:16:11.359 align:start position:0%
impacted to operate 24 7 nursing
 
03:16:14.309 --> 03:16:14.319 align:start position:0%
um staff for fewer for fewer youth so
 
03:16:17.429 --> 03:16:17.439 align:start position:0%
when you try to calculate it by use days
 
03:16:20.630 --> 03:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
it adds up you guys ever
 
03:16:22.710 --> 03:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
looked at telemedicine as a way of
 
03:16:25.110 --> 03:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
providing some of your health care staff
 
03:16:26.870 --> 03:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
so that you don't have to have physical
 
03:16:29.670 --> 03:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
bodies on site all the time
 
03:16:31.830 --> 03:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
i'd be i'd be anxious not having a nurse
 
03:16:33.190 --> 03:16:33.200 align:start position:0%
in the facility given some of the
 
03:16:34.550 --> 03:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
challenges that we see with
 
03:16:37.670 --> 03:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
with our young people um you know i
 
03:16:38.630 --> 03:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
don't know that our
 
03:16:40.070 --> 03:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
youth counselors or others would be in a
 
03:16:42.790 --> 03:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
position to kind of provide that type of
 
03:16:47.590 --> 03:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:49.269 --> 03:16:49.279 align:start position:0%
i would say it would also potentially
 
03:16:50.950 --> 03:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
increase our medicaid expenditures
 
03:16:51.990 --> 03:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
because it
 
03:16:54.389 --> 03:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
probably would increase a child being
 
03:16:55.910 --> 03:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
taken to the hospital so then they'd
 
03:16:57.590 --> 03:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
have to be transported to the hospital
 
03:16:59.510 --> 03:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:17:01.910 --> 03:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
many of the children are medicaid
 
03:17:03.429 --> 03:17:03.439 align:start position:0%
medicaid would then be charged for the
 
03:17:03.439 --> 03:17:04.309 align:start position:0%
medicaid would then be charged for the
services

03:17:04.309 --> 03:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
services
 
03:17:08.229 --> 03:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
um and as we know hospitals charge more
 
03:17:09.670 --> 03:17:09.680 align:start position:0%
than what probably what we could provide
 
03:17:12.630 --> 03:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
their services for
 
03:17:14.710 --> 03:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
okay representative weiler you had your
 
03:17:16.150 --> 03:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
hand up sir
 
03:17:19.190 --> 03:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
yes thank you both in 79 14
 
03:17:23.110 --> 03:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
and 79 15 we've got agency income
 
03:17:27.510 --> 03:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
that we didn't have a 20 and 21.
 
03:17:30.950 --> 03:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
what did we suddenly start collecting
 
03:17:34.389 --> 03:17:34.399 align:start position:0%
the money for the vermont contract for
 
03:17:35.590 --> 03:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
the kids that
 
03:17:38.469 --> 03:17:38.479 align:start position:0%
we potentially might have that's where
 
03:17:39.990 --> 03:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
those two areas
 
03:17:43.349 --> 03:17:43.359 align:start position:0%
we we budgeted those dollars so if we
 
03:17:44.389 --> 03:17:44.399 align:start position:0%
don't get the kids
 
03:17:46.389 --> 03:17:46.399 align:start position:0%
then we would potentially need other
 
03:17:47.910 --> 03:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
dollars to
 
03:17:50.200 --> 03:17:50.210 align:start position:0%
fund those
 
03:17:50.210 --> 03:17:52.229 align:start position:0%
fund those
[Music]

03:17:52.229 --> 03:17:52.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:17:57.030 --> 03:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:59.910 --> 03:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
could i just understand a little clearer
 
03:17:59.920 --> 03:18:00.389 align:start position:0%
could i just understand a little clearer
what

03:18:00.389 --> 03:18:00.399 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:18:04.070 --> 03:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
rebecca just said so are you saying that
 
03:18:05.030 --> 03:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
we're budgeting
 
03:18:08.070 --> 03:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
in five a half a million
 
03:18:13.990 --> 03:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:16.710 --> 03:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
but if we don't get it from vermont if
 
03:18:19.030 --> 03:18:19.040 align:start position:0%
that doesn't come
 
03:18:23.349 --> 03:18:23.359 align:start position:0%
we will have to replace that with
 
03:18:26.550 --> 03:18:26.560 align:start position:0%
general fund dollars or spend less
 
03:18:30.710 --> 03:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
yes or spend less in this category
 
03:18:33.990 --> 03:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
yes or or in i mean
 
03:18:35.349 --> 03:18:35.359 align:start position:0%
if we needed to move funds from
 
03:18:37.269 --> 03:18:37.279 align:start position:0%
somewhere else in syse and spend
 
03:18:39.620 --> 03:18:39.630 align:start position:0%
less than somewhere else in there um
 
03:18:39.630 --> 03:18:42.469 align:start position:0%
less than somewhere else in there um
[Music]

03:18:42.469 --> 03:18:42.479 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:18:43.990 --> 03:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
or potentially from somewhere else in
 
03:18:45.670 --> 03:18:45.680 align:start position:0%
the department which i know
 
03:18:49.269 --> 03:18:49.279 align:start position:0%
in past years there's been a wording in
 
03:18:52.229 --> 03:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 to say that we um have to
 
03:18:53.990 --> 03:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
come to fiscal committee to transfer it
 
03:18:56.950 --> 03:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
even a dollar into sysc
 
03:18:58.550 --> 03:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
so it would come to fiscal committee if
 
03:19:00.309 --> 03:19:00.319 align:start position:0%
that language was there again which i
 
03:19:04.389 --> 03:19:04.399 align:start position:0%
assume it will be
 
03:19:06.550 --> 03:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
you have another question you both how
 
03:19:09.750 --> 03:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
about you representative uh
 
03:19:11.910 --> 03:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
how many kids from vermont was was
 
03:19:13.910 --> 03:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
possible in that contract
 
03:19:16.389 --> 03:19:16.399 align:start position:0%
the contract had a ceiling of six at a
 
03:19:18.550 --> 03:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
given time but that was
 
03:19:20.630 --> 03:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
we know that it will i i would be
 
03:19:22.229 --> 03:19:22.239 align:start position:0%
shocked if it ever reached that ceiling
 
03:19:23.990 --> 03:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
i think it's much more likely that we'll
 
03:19:24.000 --> 03:19:24.870 align:start position:0%
i think it's much more likely that we'll
see

03:19:24.870 --> 03:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
see
 
03:19:26.790 --> 03:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
between zero and two kids there at a
 
03:19:29.030 --> 03:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
given time um
 
03:19:30.469 --> 03:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
was just developed to make sure that we
 
03:19:32.550 --> 03:19:32.560 align:start position:0%
had the capacity in case there was
 
03:19:35.830 --> 03:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
um additional need a lot of
 
03:19:38.469 --> 03:19:38.479 align:start position:0%
kids that went with pain we budgeted at
 
03:19:39.590 --> 03:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
the one to two
 
03:19:41.670 --> 03:19:41.680 align:start position:0%
kids level we didn't budget at the total
 
03:19:43.030 --> 03:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
of six knowing that that would be
 
03:19:43.040 --> 03:19:44.150 align:start position:0%
of six knowing that that would be
unlikely

03:19:44.150 --> 03:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
unlikely
 
03:19:45.590 --> 03:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
yeah i think rebecca do you remember
 
03:19:46.710 --> 03:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
what the daily rate is that we're
 
03:19:48.710 --> 03:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
charging them it was based on
 
03:19:50.550 --> 03:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
a calculation of the state fiscal year
 
03:19:54.469 --> 03:19:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:57.030 --> 03:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
yeah um i want to say it was over a
 
03:19:58.550 --> 03:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a day
 
03:20:01.429 --> 03:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
i'm not 100 sure it was yeah i think it
 
03:20:01.439 --> 03:20:01.670 align:start position:0%
i'm not 100 sure it was yeah i think it
was

03:20:01.670 --> 03:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:20:04.870 --> 03:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
over i thought it was over 12 or 13 but
 
03:20:12.830 --> 03:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:12.840 --> 03:20:14.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:20:14.630 --> 03:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:18.309 --> 03:20:18.319 align:start position:0%
yes are there other areas in this budget
 
03:20:22.950 --> 03:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:25.990 --> 03:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
scheduling vermont money
 
03:20:28.950 --> 03:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
to come in this isn't the only area
 
03:20:29.910 --> 03:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
where you would
 
03:20:33.590 --> 03:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:37.670 --> 03:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
um go ahead i'm sorry the funds
 
03:20:41.030 --> 03:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
um for the vermont revenue potentially
 
03:20:44.790 --> 03:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
were only budgeted in two class lines
 
03:20:49.030 --> 03:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
the the current one sorry the 7914
 
03:20:50.710 --> 03:20:50.720 align:start position:0%
and then um in the one that we're just
 
03:20:57.510 --> 03:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
discussing 79 15.
 
03:21:01.510 --> 03:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
okay so in 79 14
 
03:21:05.429 --> 03:21:05.439 align:start position:0%
there was 200 and is that 230
 
03:21:08.830 --> 03:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
000 that you scheduled from vermont
 
03:21:12.150 --> 03:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
correct and then another 500
 
03:21:16.469 --> 03:21:16.479 align:start position:0%
000 in 508
 
03:21:19.910 --> 03:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
correct okay so uh three quarters of a
 
03:21:20.870 --> 03:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
03:21:23.990 --> 03:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
each year is in this budget as
 
03:21:27.030 --> 03:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
revenue that's coming from vermont that
 
03:21:28.469 --> 03:21:28.479 align:start position:0%
we don't really know whether we're
 
03:21:28.479 --> 03:21:30.469 align:start position:0%
we don't really know whether we're
getting

03:21:30.469 --> 03:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
getting
 
03:21:33.670 --> 03:21:33.680 align:start position:0%
correct okay thank you
 
03:21:36.950 --> 03:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
if i might just say so you know um
 
03:21:39.830 --> 03:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
there is other revenue budgeted within
 
03:21:41.429 --> 03:21:41.439 align:start position:0%
sununu but that is
 
03:21:45.590 --> 03:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
for um from doe for the meals
 
03:21:48.630 --> 03:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
um and then the school any
 
03:21:52.309 --> 03:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
um if a child has an iep then we can
 
03:21:59.910 --> 03:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:04.710 --> 03:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
questions i think we can go on
 
03:22:07.990 --> 03:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
all right the next one is 7916 which is
 
03:22:23.910 --> 03:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:27.190 --> 03:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any questions actually i
 
03:22:30.550 --> 03:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:35.990 --> 03:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
is that current expenses
 
03:22:39.110 --> 03:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
just like curiosity what does that mean
 
03:22:40.950 --> 03:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
rebecca what are the current expenses of
 
03:22:43.429 --> 03:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
system i mean they're typically supplies
 
03:22:48.550 --> 03:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
um but what are they here um
 
03:23:00.630 --> 03:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:03.750 --> 03:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
i'm going to have to
 
03:23:06.070 --> 03:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
get back to you on that this is out of
 
03:23:07.750 --> 03:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
79 16.
 
03:23:10.150 --> 03:23:10.160 align:start position:0%
yes yeah i don't i mean i don't know
 
03:23:11.349 --> 03:23:11.359 align:start position:0%
what they are just curious as to why
 
03:23:11.990 --> 03:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
03:23:14.950 --> 03:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
what twenty percent jump and then a 16
 
03:23:21.190 --> 03:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:23.349 --> 03:23:23.359 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 is pretty much in line
 
03:23:24.389 --> 03:23:24.399 align:start position:0%
with what we actually
 
03:23:28.710 --> 03:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
spent in fiscal year 20. it's 250
 
03:23:31.830 --> 03:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
more um but we can get back to you on on
 
03:23:33.269 --> 03:23:33.279 align:start position:0%
what that includes
 
03:23:37.990 --> 03:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:40.790 --> 03:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
any other questions i think we can
 
03:23:40.800 --> 03:23:42.550 align:start position:0%
any other questions i think we can
proceed

03:23:42.550 --> 03:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
proceed
 
03:23:56.710 --> 03:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:58.229 --> 03:23:58.239 align:start position:0%
this is one of those areas that rebecca
 
03:23:59.990 --> 03:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
was mentioning about the funds that come
 
03:24:10.630 --> 03:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:12.389 --> 03:24:12.399 align:start position:0%
i'm not hearing any questions so the
 
03:24:15.030 --> 03:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
very last accounting unit is 79
 
03:24:35.429 --> 03:24:35.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:37.830 --> 03:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
that looks like that's all federal money
 
03:24:41.190 --> 03:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
it is correct
 
03:24:42.710 --> 03:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
i believe those are the other funds you
 
03:24:44.389 --> 03:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
were talking about that come from doe
 
03:24:47.429 --> 03:24:47.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:49.990 --> 03:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
this is the title one grant that comes
 
03:24:50.000 --> 03:24:53.030 align:start position:0%
this is the title one grant that comes
from

03:24:53.030 --> 03:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:55.190 --> 03:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
are there are d.o.e any other questions
 
03:24:57.030 --> 03:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
because that looks like it may wrap up
 
03:25:00.150 --> 03:25:00.160 align:start position:0%
the accounting phase
 
03:25:03.510 --> 03:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
it does and that is also the end of the
 
03:25:05.510 --> 03:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
slide presently
 
03:25:09.030 --> 03:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
so we have two or three members i forget
 
03:25:09.040 --> 03:25:09.590 align:start position:0%
so we have two or three members i forget
oh

03:25:09.590 --> 03:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
oh
 
03:25:11.750 --> 03:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
uh go ahead representative what's your
 
03:25:11.760 --> 03:25:13.429 align:start position:0%
uh go ahead representative what's your
question

03:25:13.429 --> 03:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:25:17.110 --> 03:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
so if you know that we we know that the
 
03:25:17.120 --> 03:25:17.670 align:start position:0%
so if you know that we we know that the
cost

03:25:17.670 --> 03:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
cost
 
03:25:21.190 --> 03:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
of running sununu is is very high for
 
03:25:25.110 --> 03:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
per child what what do we know about
 
03:25:27.269 --> 03:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
cost in other states
 
03:25:31.269 --> 03:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
where do we where do we fall in the cost
 
03:25:35.590 --> 03:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
per child for running a detention center
 
03:25:36.790 --> 03:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
like this
 
03:25:40.790 --> 03:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
um where do we compare is are we high
 
03:25:44.229 --> 03:25:44.239 align:start position:0%
are we low are we in the middle
 
03:25:46.469 --> 03:25:46.479 align:start position:0%
i'm positive we are high in the cost per
 
03:25:46.479 --> 03:25:47.269 align:start position:0%
i'm positive we are high in the cost per
child

03:25:47.269 --> 03:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
child
 
03:25:49.670 --> 03:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
calculation i don't have i don't have
 
03:25:51.990 --> 03:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
that data to point to but i
 
03:25:53.830 --> 03:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that it will point to us being
 
03:25:55.910 --> 03:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
high again i think
 
03:25:57.590 --> 03:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
right that i know that folks like to
 
03:26:00.309 --> 03:26:00.319 align:start position:0%
think about this in a cost per child
 
03:26:02.229 --> 03:26:02.239 align:start position:0%
way but i think what's difficult is that
 
03:26:03.750 --> 03:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
when you do the work
 
03:26:06.150 --> 03:26:06.160 align:start position:0%
to keep children out and reduce your
 
03:26:07.349 --> 03:26:07.359 align:start position:0%
economies of scale
 
03:26:08.870 --> 03:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
that you're going to inflate your cost
 
03:26:11.190 --> 03:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
per child i think it's you know it's
 
03:26:13.510 --> 03:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
other states we are incredibly low in
 
03:26:14.870 --> 03:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
the number of children detained and
 
03:26:15.990 --> 03:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
committed compared to other
 
03:26:18.070 --> 03:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions as well
 
03:26:19.910 --> 03:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
and i i'm not advocating to shift our
 
03:26:21.670 --> 03:26:21.680 align:start position:0%
policy to detain and commit more kids to
 
03:26:23.030 --> 03:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
resolve this problem
 
03:26:24.630 --> 03:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying that i think you know
 
03:26:26.550 --> 03:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
it's not an apples-to-apples comparison
 
03:26:28.150 --> 03:26:28.160 align:start position:0%
if you're comparing a state that detains
 
03:26:29.030 --> 03:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
and commits
 
03:26:31.429 --> 03:26:31.439 align:start position:0%
many many kids to a state that detains
 
03:26:35.750 --> 03:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:39.510 --> 03:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
thank you you have a follow-up there no
 
03:26:42.790 --> 03:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
so okay so i think implicit and in some
 
03:26:44.469 --> 03:26:44.479 align:start position:0%
of what you've said through the course
 
03:26:44.479 --> 03:26:45.190 align:start position:0%
of what you've said through the course
of

03:26:45.190 --> 03:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:26:48.229 --> 03:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
the day so far mr ribson is that the
 
03:26:48.239 --> 03:26:48.950 align:start position:0%
the day so far mr ribson is that the
personnel

03:26:48.950 --> 03:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
03:26:51.830 --> 03:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
costs that are associated with providing
 
03:26:53.510 --> 03:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
these services
 
03:26:56.790 --> 03:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
are fixed regardless of how many
 
03:27:00.229 --> 03:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
residents there are in the facility and
 
03:27:04.229 --> 03:27:04.239 align:start position:0%
um and i'm i'm just wondering if we can
 
03:27:04.239 --> 03:27:05.830 align:start position:0%
um and i'm i'm just wondering if we can
afford

03:27:05.830 --> 03:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
afford
 
03:27:09.510 --> 03:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
a system that is offering services
 
03:27:11.590 --> 03:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
for such a small number of kids that if
 
03:27:14.070 --> 03:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
there can't that there must be some more
 
03:27:16.870 --> 03:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
efficient way to say provide library
 
03:27:18.630 --> 03:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
access or to provide
 
03:27:21.750 --> 03:27:21.760 align:start position:0%
meals or i i i just
 
03:27:23.990 --> 03:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
i just don't want people to get
 
03:27:26.150 --> 03:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the idea
 
03:27:29.269 --> 03:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
that our personnel costs are
 
03:27:31.750 --> 03:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
fixed they're only fixed in the short
 
03:27:31.760 --> 03:27:32.710 align:start position:0%
fixed they're only fixed in the short
term

03:27:32.710 --> 03:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
term
 
03:27:34.630 --> 03:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
so we need to be thinking a little
 
03:27:34.640 --> 03:27:36.070 align:start position:0%
so we need to be thinking a little
longer

03:27:36.070 --> 03:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
longer
 
03:27:40.469 --> 03:27:40.479 align:start position:0%
um so so i just wanted to say that
 
03:27:43.910 --> 03:27:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:47.750 --> 03:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i i i do not disagree i think um
 
03:27:49.429 --> 03:27:49.439 align:start position:0%
the personal costs are not entirely
 
03:27:50.790 --> 03:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
fixed right the
 
03:27:52.710 --> 03:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
the yc's are the most youth counselors
 
03:27:54.710 --> 03:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
are the most fluid position based on
 
03:27:56.950 --> 03:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
you know daily need and that does get
 
03:27:58.550 --> 03:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
very complex if you think back to the
 
03:28:00.790 --> 03:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
slide that i showed around
 
03:28:02.229 --> 03:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
the average daily census and how it
 
03:28:04.070 --> 03:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
could swing you know double
 
03:28:06.469 --> 03:28:06.479 align:start position:0%
in a day and then collapse in half in a
 
03:28:06.479 --> 03:28:08.309 align:start position:0%
in a day and then collapse in half in a
day

03:28:08.309 --> 03:28:08.319 align:start position:0%
day
 
03:28:10.389 --> 03:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
that gets that makes staffing very very
 
03:28:10.399 --> 03:28:11.590 align:start position:0%
that gets that makes staffing very very
complex

03:28:11.590 --> 03:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
complex
 
03:28:14.790 --> 03:28:14.800 align:start position:0%
um but those costs will
 
03:28:17.269 --> 03:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
change with the census somewhat and
 
03:28:19.269 --> 03:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
again it's not exactly the census but
 
03:28:20.790 --> 03:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
it's the number of units that need to be
 
03:28:22.550 --> 03:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
run to serve those children
 
03:28:24.950 --> 03:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
that really drives that cost the other
 
03:28:26.469 --> 03:28:26.479 align:start position:0%
car for me
 
03:28:29.190 --> 03:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
what was that it's a step increment you
 
03:28:30.630 --> 03:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
get to step you gotta
 
03:28:33.110 --> 03:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
add more costs yeah but it's it's even
 
03:28:35.990 --> 03:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
more complex than that because it also
 
03:28:37.349 --> 03:28:37.359 align:start position:0%
right you could have one child who
 
03:28:39.030 --> 03:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
requires a coach with them all day
 
03:28:41.110 --> 03:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
a one-to-one supervision all day and
 
03:28:42.790 --> 03:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
that's going to be that's dependent on
 
03:28:44.630 --> 03:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
that child's needs when they show up
 
03:28:46.550 --> 03:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
and that need may change over time is
 
03:28:48.550 --> 03:28:48.560 align:start position:0%
that child stabilizes
 
03:28:50.950 --> 03:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
but they're very unpredictable costs so
 
03:28:51.750 --> 03:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
i think that's
 
03:28:53.830 --> 03:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
that's a real challenge with managing a
 
03:28:55.269 --> 03:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
facility that is
 
03:28:58.550 --> 03:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
um that is as high acuity as this is
 
03:29:00.550 --> 03:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
um some of the other costs that are more
 
03:29:01.990 --> 03:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
fixed in the current structure are the
 
03:29:03.990 --> 03:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
education program the nursing program
 
03:29:06.150 --> 03:29:06.160 align:start position:0%
those types of things
 
03:29:07.990 --> 03:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
i want to ask you about your use of the
 
03:29:10.710 --> 03:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
word acuity you you used it earlier
 
03:29:13.349 --> 03:29:13.359 align:start position:0%
i i'm used to acuity being used in a
 
03:29:14.229 --> 03:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
patient care
 
03:29:17.349 --> 03:29:17.359 align:start position:0%
context to refer to the acuity of a
 
03:29:17.359 --> 03:29:18.550 align:start position:0%
context to refer to the acuity of a
patient

03:29:18.550 --> 03:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
patient
 
03:29:20.790 --> 03:29:20.800 align:start position:0%
that and so i'm just imagining that
 
03:29:22.710 --> 03:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
since these are detained kids and
 
03:29:24.229 --> 03:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
committed kids
 
03:29:27.990 --> 03:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
that by acuity you mean some tend to be
 
03:29:29.349 --> 03:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
more violent than others
 
03:29:32.469 --> 03:29:32.479 align:start position:0%
or need yes and no sometimes it'll
 
03:29:34.150 --> 03:29:34.160 align:start position:0%
manifest as violence but but
 
03:29:36.150 --> 03:29:36.160 align:start position:0%
most of these kids do have complex
 
03:29:38.150 --> 03:29:38.160 align:start position:0%
behavioral health needs
 
03:29:41.030 --> 03:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
um very few of these kids are are you
 
03:29:41.040 --> 03:29:41.590 align:start position:0%
um very few of these kids are are you
know

03:29:41.590 --> 03:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:29:44.950 --> 03:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
are are absent some type of complex
 
03:29:46.469 --> 03:29:46.479 align:start position:0%
behavioral health need on top of the
 
03:29:48.389 --> 03:29:48.399 align:start position:0%
other challenges that they have
 
03:29:50.229 --> 03:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
so sometimes it manifests as violence
 
03:29:51.750 --> 03:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
and sometimes not i wouldn't say that
 
03:29:53.750 --> 03:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
it's always violence that we're
 
03:29:56.309 --> 03:29:56.319 align:start position:0%
not concerned about when i say that it's
 
03:29:56.319 --> 03:29:56.870 align:start position:0%
not concerned about when i say that it's
um

03:29:56.870 --> 03:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:58.550 --> 03:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
it's really what their needs are and how
 
03:30:00.830 --> 03:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
intense their needs are
 
03:30:04.150 --> 03:30:04.160 align:start position:0%
okay um all right so
 
03:30:07.670 --> 03:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions i i
 
03:30:10.950 --> 03:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any i i know we have
 
03:30:13.349 --> 03:30:13.359 align:start position:0%
two or three reps that need to get on to
 
03:30:14.229 --> 03:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
their next
 
03:30:17.510 --> 03:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
event um and uh
 
03:30:19.990 --> 03:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
and you all are welcome to go when you
 
03:30:21.990 --> 03:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
when you want we're going to open up to
 
03:30:24.229 --> 03:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
the attendees to see if anyone has any
 
03:30:24.239 --> 03:30:25.510 align:start position:0%
the attendees to see if anyone has any
questions

03:30:25.510 --> 03:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:30:28.550 --> 03:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
if those who have to leave um
 
03:30:30.389 --> 03:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
can stay just for a little while to
 
03:30:31.990 --> 03:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
listen to some of them um
 
03:30:34.150 --> 03:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
but you'll know that this is on uh being
 
03:30:35.349 --> 03:30:35.359 align:start position:0%
recorded so
 
03:30:37.030 --> 03:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
you can come back and listen to the
 
03:30:38.550 --> 03:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
question and answers uh
 
03:30:40.630 --> 03:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
at your convenience representative
 
03:30:43.750 --> 03:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
walner did you have a question
 
03:30:45.750 --> 03:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
no thank uh i just wanted to know if we
 
03:30:47.670 --> 03:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
were gonna have audience participation
 
03:30:49.429 --> 03:30:49.439 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
03:30:52.229 --> 03:30:52.239 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to integrate that now and and
 
03:30:54.389 --> 03:30:54.399 align:start position:0%
for those of you who are leaving
 
03:30:56.790 --> 03:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
um please take a look at your email i
 
03:30:56.800 --> 03:30:57.910 align:start position:0%
um please take a look at your email i
proposed

03:30:57.910 --> 03:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
03:31:00.469 --> 03:31:00.479 align:start position:0%
some work sessions next week and then
 
03:31:01.990 --> 03:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
after i wrote that email
 
03:31:04.150 --> 03:31:04.160 align:start position:0%
mr ripple let me know that we've got a
 
03:31:05.910 --> 03:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
couple of bills that got
 
03:31:07.990 --> 03:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
referred to finance and i think are
 
03:31:09.349 --> 03:31:09.359 align:start position:0%
making their way to
 
03:31:11.429 --> 03:31:11.439 align:start position:0%
division three for us to be second
 
03:31:12.790 --> 03:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
committee on
 
03:31:16.630 --> 03:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
so so we have uh the good fortune of
 
03:31:18.870 --> 03:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
having more work here in the next 19
 
03:31:20.550 --> 03:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
days than we anticipated
 
03:31:23.830 --> 03:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
so um i'll get you
 
03:31:25.670 --> 03:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
we'll get some information to you about
 
03:31:27.990 --> 03:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
that we'll i'll try to ask the policy
 
03:31:29.429 --> 03:31:29.439 align:start position:0%
committees for
 
03:31:32.550 --> 03:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
any good good testimony that they got
 
03:31:34.790 --> 03:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
so that we can get ahead of the game a
 
03:31:35.910 --> 03:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
03:31:39.269 --> 03:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
but um so
 
03:31:41.429 --> 03:31:41.439 align:start position:0%
uh representative rogers you're you're
 
03:31:43.030 --> 03:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
speaking but you're on mute
 
03:31:46.550 --> 03:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
did you have something to say ma'am
 
03:31:51.750 --> 03:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:54.790 --> 03:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
all right okay so uh
 
03:31:58.229 --> 03:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
i see a question from mr dejoy uh do you
 
03:31:59.670 --> 03:31:59.680 align:start position:0%
want to bring him in
 
03:32:03.670 --> 03:32:03.680 align:start position:0%
mr ripple yep he should be
 
03:32:05.750 --> 03:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
yeah he should be allowed to talk now
 
03:32:08.229 --> 03:32:08.239 align:start position:0%
okay so before you get started uh i
 
03:32:09.590 --> 03:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
don't know how many people are going to
 
03:32:10.469 --> 03:32:10.479 align:start position:0%
want to talk
 
03:32:12.550 --> 03:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
but but i think we're going to try to
 
03:32:14.710 --> 03:32:14.720 align:start position:0%
keep a three-minute timer on people and
 
03:32:16.070 --> 03:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
ask that you keep it
 
03:32:19.429 --> 03:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
uh your comments related to a resourcing
 
03:32:21.670 --> 03:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
issue and not a philosophy issue
 
03:32:26.710 --> 03:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
so you you may speak
 
03:32:28.710 --> 03:32:28.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i have i have a
 
03:32:30.309 --> 03:32:30.319 align:start position:0%
brief statement and i hope
 
03:32:34.229 --> 03:32:34.239 align:start position:0%
i can stick to your resource
 
03:32:37.269 --> 03:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
criteria i just want to start by
 
03:32:40.389 --> 03:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
applauding the department uh for their
 
03:32:42.389 --> 03:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
work in the probation transformation
 
03:32:44.150 --> 03:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
that was mentioned previously
 
03:32:45.830 --> 03:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
as well as the transformative work
 
03:32:47.190 --> 03:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
around the system of care
 
03:32:48.790 --> 03:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
that's integral with child protection
 
03:32:51.030 --> 03:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
but it's also a linchpin
 
03:32:54.229 --> 03:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
of the juvenile justice
 
03:32:57.510 --> 03:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
system as well my comments are
 
03:33:00.550 --> 03:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
in relation to the sysc discussion in
 
03:33:02.790 --> 03:33:02.800 align:start position:0%
the sysc budget
 
03:33:04.229 --> 03:33:04.239 align:start position:0%
waypoint has been working for the
 
03:33:06.870 --> 03:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
closure of sysc for a number of years
 
03:33:06.880 --> 03:33:07.990 align:start position:0%
closure of sysc for a number of years
now

03:33:07.990 --> 03:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:33:09.990 --> 03:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
but the newspaper articles this past
 
03:33:10.000 --> 03:33:11.110 align:start position:0%
but the newspaper articles this past
tuesday

03:33:11.110 --> 03:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
tuesday
 
03:33:12.710 --> 03:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
and the extent of the alleged abuse at
 
03:33:15.510 --> 03:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
sysc has raised this conversation to a
 
03:33:17.030 --> 03:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
new level
 
03:33:19.429 --> 03:33:19.439 align:start position:0%
for the past six years we've undertaken
 
03:33:20.790 --> 03:33:20.800 align:start position:0%
at waypoint
 
03:33:23.030 --> 03:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
many efforts to try to engage the
 
03:33:24.790 --> 03:33:24.800 align:start position:0%
department in conversations about next
 
03:33:24.800 --> 03:33:25.590 align:start position:0%
department in conversations about next
steps

03:33:25.590 --> 03:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
steps
 
03:33:27.910 --> 03:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
and try moving away from the
 
03:33:31.030 --> 03:33:31.040 align:start position:0%
correctional model at sysc
 
03:33:33.990 --> 03:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
but that has not been effective the
 
03:33:34.000 --> 03:33:34.630 align:start position:0%
but that has not been effective the
system

03:33:34.630 --> 03:33:34.640 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:33:38.150 --> 03:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
today at sysc operates essentially the
 
03:33:40.309 --> 03:33:40.319 align:start position:0%
same as it has since it opened
 
03:33:42.150 --> 03:33:42.160 align:start position:0%
um and that's part of what we're talking
 
03:33:43.830 --> 03:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
about as far as the the costs
 
03:33:47.590 --> 03:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
is the the model and the structure
 
03:33:50.229 --> 03:33:50.239 align:start position:0%
the only legislative effort that has had
 
03:33:51.670 --> 03:33:51.680 align:start position:0%
significant impact
 
03:33:54.550 --> 03:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
is house bill 517 which dr is what
 
03:33:56.710 --> 03:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
dropped the census in large part
 
03:34:01.830 --> 03:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
from in the mid 60s to where it is today
 
03:34:04.309 --> 03:34:04.319 align:start position:0%
these are 100 percent nearly 100 percent
 
03:34:07.750 --> 03:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:09.830 --> 03:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
and as the number of kids committed to
 
03:34:11.590 --> 03:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
sysc has decreased
 
03:34:14.070 --> 03:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
the budgets continue to increase and the
 
03:34:15.910 --> 03:34:15.920 align:start position:0%
question for us remains is this the
 
03:34:17.590 --> 03:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
least restrictive setting and the most
 
03:34:19.349 --> 03:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
clinically appropriate facility for
 
03:34:19.359 --> 03:34:20.550 align:start position:0%
clinically appropriate facility for
children

03:34:20.550 --> 03:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
children
 
03:34:23.590 --> 03:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
i think we have before us or more
 
03:34:25.990 --> 03:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
appropriately you have before you
 
03:34:27.990 --> 03:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to transform this
 
03:34:30.150 --> 03:34:30.160 align:start position:0%
facility and transform the treatment for
 
03:34:31.590 --> 03:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
some of the most complex
 
03:34:34.070 --> 03:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
children children with some of the most
 
03:34:36.070 --> 03:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
complex behavioral health needs
 
03:34:39.030 --> 03:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
in the state our neighbor to the west
 
03:34:39.040 --> 03:34:39.990 align:start position:0%
in the state our neighbor to the west
vermont

03:34:39.990 --> 03:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
vermont
 
03:34:42.550 --> 03:34:42.560 align:start position:0%
has undertaken a similar effort just in
 
03:34:43.830 --> 03:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
the past year
 
03:34:46.070 --> 03:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
they closed woodside which is their only
 
03:34:47.830 --> 03:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
juvenile corrections facility
 
03:34:50.790 --> 03:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
around august or september of last year
 
03:34:51.830 --> 03:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
and we can learn
 
03:34:55.429 --> 03:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
a significant amount from their efforts
 
03:34:56.950 --> 03:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
they've grappled with some of the same
 
03:34:58.389 --> 03:34:58.399 align:start position:0%
issues that we've been talking about
 
03:35:00.070 --> 03:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
here today
 
03:35:02.550 --> 03:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
and i i would note that they recently
 
03:35:04.229 --> 03:35:04.239 align:start position:0%
signed a contract with a private
 
03:35:04.239 --> 03:35:05.269 align:start position:0%
signed a contract with a private
provider

03:35:05.269 --> 03:35:05.279 align:start position:0%
provider
 
03:35:09.030 --> 03:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
that the new facility will be open
 
03:35:11.429 --> 03:35:11.439 align:start position:0%
i'm told by a legislator in vermont by
 
03:35:13.429 --> 03:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
the end of this calendar year or just
 
03:35:14.229 --> 03:35:14.239 align:start position:0%
over a year
 
03:35:15.830 --> 03:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
after the decision was made to close
 
03:35:15.840 --> 03:35:17.510 align:start position:0%
after the decision was made to close
woodside

03:35:17.510 --> 03:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
woodside
 
03:35:19.269 --> 03:35:19.279 align:start position:0%
just a couple of points to keep in mind
 
03:35:21.269 --> 03:35:21.279 align:start position:0%
about the children we're talking about
 
03:35:23.910 --> 03:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
these are not hard and criminals these
 
03:35:25.750 --> 03:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
are children
 
03:35:28.150 --> 03:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
by the department's own estimate nearly
 
03:35:28.160 --> 03:35:29.030 align:start position:0%
by the department's own estimate nearly
75

03:35:29.030 --> 03:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
75
 
03:35:31.190 --> 03:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
of these kids have behavioral health
 
03:35:33.269 --> 03:35:33.279 align:start position:0%
needs typically complex
 
03:35:35.910 --> 03:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
behavioral health needs and the one
 
03:35:37.269 --> 03:35:37.279 align:start position:0%
thing we know for sure is that
 
03:35:38.950 --> 03:35:38.960 align:start position:0%
every child in the juvenile justice
 
03:35:41.910 --> 03:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
system by the time they turn 18
 
03:35:44.550 --> 03:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
is returned to to their community or
 
03:35:47.030 --> 03:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
another community for them to live in
 
03:35:50.469 --> 03:35:50.479 align:start position:0%
um so so john that
 
03:35:52.790 --> 03:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
that that's that's three minutes but i'm
 
03:35:54.950 --> 03:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
not seeing any other hands
 
03:35:57.269 --> 03:35:57.279 align:start position:0%
so so maybe you got another three
 
03:35:58.469 --> 03:35:58.479 align:start position:0%
minutes but
 
03:36:01.429 --> 03:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chan hopefully i won't
 
03:36:02.790 --> 03:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
need it i think i need about another
 
03:36:02.800 --> 03:36:03.269 align:start position:0%
need it i think i need about another
minute

03:36:03.269 --> 03:36:03.279 align:start position:0%
minute
 
03:36:06.550 --> 03:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
and a half so thank you um
 
03:36:08.710 --> 03:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
the conversation about recidivism was
 
03:36:10.550 --> 03:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
was very interesting
 
03:36:13.110 --> 03:36:13.120 align:start position:0%
and the 60 number is what i've heard as
 
03:36:13.120 --> 03:36:14.309 align:start position:0%
and the 60 number is what i've heard as
well

03:36:14.309 --> 03:36:14.319 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:36:16.710 --> 03:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
that number tracks pretty closely with
 
03:36:19.110 --> 03:36:19.120 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice
 
03:36:21.750 --> 03:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
programs across the country
 
03:36:23.429 --> 03:36:23.439 align:start position:0%
interestingly as well as
 
03:36:25.590 --> 03:36:25.600 align:start position:0%
adult correctional facilities across the
 
03:36:25.600 --> 03:36:29.429 align:start position:0%
adult correctional facilities across the
country

03:36:29.429 --> 03:36:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:32.150 --> 03:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
so in addition to the budget that you're
 
03:36:33.990 --> 03:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
talking about you also have house bill
 
03:36:36.150 --> 03:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
254 that will be before you
 
03:36:38.870 --> 03:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh momentarily this is a bill that we've
 
03:36:40.070 --> 03:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
advanced that
 
03:36:43.190 --> 03:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
like house bill 517 further restricts
 
03:36:45.030 --> 03:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
the kids that can be committed to
 
03:36:48.070 --> 03:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
sununu this bill along with the
 
03:36:49.510 --> 03:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
transformations that have been mentioned
 
03:36:51.269 --> 03:36:51.279 align:start position:0%
through families first and the system of
 
03:36:51.279 --> 03:36:52.309 align:start position:0%
through families first and the system of
care

03:36:52.309 --> 03:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
care
 
03:36:55.910 --> 03:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
um position us
 
03:36:58.070 --> 03:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
to have fewer and fewer kids at this
 
03:36:58.080 --> 03:36:58.950 align:start position:0%
to have fewer and fewer kids at this
facility

03:36:58.950 --> 03:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
facility
 
03:37:02.070 --> 03:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
and make the opportunity for change
 
03:37:05.750 --> 03:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:07.910 --> 03:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
what i would point out is that across
 
03:37:09.910 --> 03:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
the country in juvenile justice
 
03:37:12.710 --> 03:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
when significant change is made to
 
03:37:14.630 --> 03:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
facilities such as sununu
 
03:37:17.349 --> 03:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
it is not made by the managing agency or
 
03:37:19.429 --> 03:37:19.439 align:start position:0%
in this case dcyf
 
03:37:22.469 --> 03:37:22.479 align:start position:0%
across the country changes are only made
 
03:37:25.030 --> 03:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
and closures and specifically are only
 
03:37:25.040 --> 03:37:25.510 align:start position:0%
and closures and specifically are only
made

03:37:25.510 --> 03:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
made
 
03:37:27.750 --> 03:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
through legislative mandate court
 
03:37:27.760 --> 03:37:28.630 align:start position:0%
through legislative mandate court
mandate

03:37:28.630 --> 03:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
03:37:31.030 --> 03:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
or occasionally through chief executive
 
03:37:31.040 --> 03:37:33.110 align:start position:0%
or occasionally through chief executive
mandate

03:37:33.110 --> 03:37:33.120 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
03:37:36.389 --> 03:37:36.399 align:start position:0%
we waypoint does not find the sysc model
 
03:37:38.150 --> 03:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
to be in the best interest of children
 
03:37:41.510 --> 03:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
and it's clearly costly for taxpayers
 
03:37:43.190 --> 03:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
we believe that now is the time to close
 
03:37:45.590 --> 03:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
sysc and focus on treating children
 
03:37:47.510 --> 03:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
with the most complex behaviors in more
 
03:37:48.710 --> 03:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
clinically appropriate
 
03:37:52.070 --> 03:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
settings for this to happen
 
03:37:54.710 --> 03:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
it will require a definitive
 
03:37:57.590 --> 03:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
pronouncement by the legislature
 
03:38:03.910 --> 03:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:07.670 --> 03:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
and with that i'll conclude my comments
 
03:38:11.510 --> 03:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
so so mr dejoy thank you so much for
 
03:38:12.550 --> 03:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
your comments
 
03:38:15.990 --> 03:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
um i i used to be in the in the military
 
03:38:17.190 --> 03:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
and what we would say
 
03:38:20.389 --> 03:38:20.399 align:start position:0%
to our soldiers oftentimes was
 
03:38:22.870 --> 03:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
you know uh thank you for bringing me a
 
03:38:22.880 --> 03:38:23.990 align:start position:0%
you know uh thank you for bringing me a
problem

03:38:23.990 --> 03:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
problem
 
03:38:27.110 --> 03:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
now bring me a solution and and
 
03:38:29.590 --> 03:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
i would i would uh put the same on you
 
03:38:29.600 --> 03:38:30.150 align:start position:0%
i would i would uh put the same on you
sir

03:38:30.150 --> 03:38:30.160 align:start position:0%
sir
 
03:38:33.429 --> 03:38:33.439 align:start position:0%
just to say uh i think i think
 
03:38:36.150 --> 03:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
there's probably broad agreement that
 
03:38:38.150 --> 03:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
something needs to be done and the real
 
03:38:39.590 --> 03:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
question gets to be
 
03:38:42.710 --> 03:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
exactly what is that something so to the
 
03:38:44.150 --> 03:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
extent that you can help
 
03:38:47.590 --> 03:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
clarify that with some an option or some
 
03:38:49.910 --> 03:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
options it may be a future date
 
03:38:53.110 --> 03:38:53.120 align:start position:0%
that would be really great
 
03:38:55.510 --> 03:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
mr chair i'm happy to share that i have
 
03:38:56.150 --> 03:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
i have
 
03:38:59.429 --> 03:38:59.439 align:start position:0%
a an example of a developed option that
 
03:39:00.870 --> 03:39:00.880 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to share with you in the rest
 
03:39:01.990 --> 03:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
of the division
 
03:39:04.309 --> 03:39:04.319 align:start position:0%
what i would point out is that what i'm
 
03:39:05.349 --> 03:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
going to send to you
 
03:39:08.630 --> 03:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
is an option it is not the only option
 
03:39:10.710 --> 03:39:10.720 align:start position:0%
may not even be the best option but it
 
03:39:12.389 --> 03:39:12.399 align:start position:0%
is an illustration of a way that we can
 
03:39:13.990 --> 03:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
get to where i'm talking about and the
 
03:39:15.349 --> 03:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
department may have
 
03:39:17.910 --> 03:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
um may have better ideas than that and i
 
03:39:19.189 --> 03:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
i would be open to
 
03:39:20.830 --> 03:39:20.840 align:start position:0%
working with the department on those
 
03:39:20.840 --> 03:39:22.389 align:start position:0%
working with the department on those
ideas

03:39:22.389 --> 03:39:22.399 align:start position:0%
ideas
 
03:39:24.630 --> 03:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
all right well great so you so who are
 
03:39:25.830 --> 03:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
you going to send your
 
03:39:32.469 --> 03:39:32.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:36.309 --> 03:39:36.319 align:start position:0%

mention it but
 
03:39:56.070 --> 03:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
uh i i i try to ask if somebody's a
 
03:39:58.710 --> 03:39:58.720 align:start position:0%
lobbyist to introduce themselves as a
 
03:40:01.990 --> 03:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
lobbyist and i believe you are sir
 
03:40:03.990 --> 03:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
i am a lobbyist i'm actually an employee
 
03:40:05.189 --> 03:40:05.199 align:start position:0%
of waypoint but i
 
03:40:06.870 --> 03:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
i do work in their advocacy department
 
03:40:08.389 --> 03:40:08.399 align:start position:0%
and i am a registered lobbyist for
 
03:40:12.309 --> 03:40:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:14.790 --> 03:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
i i see representative nordgren with her
 
03:40:16.469 --> 03:40:16.479 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
03:40:19.750 --> 03:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
i might just comment that john is also a
 
03:40:21.670 --> 03:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
former member of the house
 
03:40:26.790 --> 03:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:28.630 --> 03:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
so are we supposed to hold that against
 
03:40:30.790 --> 03:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
him or or is that good
 
03:40:32.630 --> 03:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
i would just use that as part of his
 
03:40:34.229 --> 03:40:34.239 align:start position:0%
background in
 
03:40:36.389 --> 03:40:36.399 align:start position:0%
doing what he's trying to help us do
 
03:40:38.870 --> 03:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
today thanks
 
03:40:40.790 --> 03:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
i would note on that if i could for
 
03:40:43.990 --> 03:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
context the very first budget i sat on
 
03:40:47.110 --> 03:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
was the inaugural budget for um
 
03:40:50.790 --> 03:40:50.800 align:start position:0%
the new services center oh so we have
 
03:40:53.189 --> 03:40:53.199 align:start position:0%
you to blame
 
03:40:55.269 --> 03:40:55.279 align:start position:0%
uh in in some measure i think that's
 
03:40:55.279 --> 03:40:57.269 align:start position:0%
uh in in some measure i think that's
accurate

03:40:57.269 --> 03:40:57.279 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
03:41:00.309 --> 03:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
so okay so mr ripson i'm sorry that was
 
03:41:02.469 --> 03:41:02.479 align:start position:0%
there's a little lightheartedness there
 
03:41:04.229 --> 03:41:04.239 align:start position:0%
it's a heavy subject i
 
03:41:07.349 --> 03:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't want to um have uh mr
 
03:41:07.359 --> 03:41:08.710 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't want to um have uh mr
dejoy's

03:41:08.710 --> 03:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
dejoy's
 
03:41:10.870 --> 03:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
words hanging out there without giving
 
03:41:13.349 --> 03:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
you an opportunity to respond
 
03:41:16.790 --> 03:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
however you care to thanks you know i
 
03:41:19.189 --> 03:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
as i think we've said here um and as
 
03:41:21.269 --> 03:41:21.279 align:start position:0%
i've said here multiple times i think
 
03:41:23.349 --> 03:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
um it's obvious that a decision needs to
 
03:41:24.309 --> 03:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
be made about
 
03:41:28.229 --> 03:41:28.239 align:start position:0%
what's next for um secured uh you know
 
03:41:30.389 --> 03:41:30.399 align:start position:0%
detention and commitment in this state
 
03:41:32.950 --> 03:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
um i do believe that the the ongoing
 
03:41:34.950 --> 03:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
efforts that mr joy spoke about are
 
03:41:35.830 --> 03:41:35.840 align:start position:0%
going to
 
03:41:38.550 --> 03:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
continue to drive down the need but that
 
03:41:40.229 --> 03:41:40.239 align:start position:0%
isn't going to i do not believe
 
03:41:41.910 --> 03:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
that it will eliminate the need i don't
 
03:41:43.349 --> 03:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
think we've seen a single jurisdiction
 
03:41:44.790 --> 03:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
in this country be able to eliminate the
 
03:41:46.309 --> 03:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
need we've seen people
 
03:41:48.630 --> 03:41:48.640 align:start position:0%
um talk about closing a facility in
 
03:41:50.150 --> 03:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
vermont only to open up a private
 
03:41:50.160 --> 03:41:51.189 align:start position:0%
vermont only to open up a private
facility

03:41:51.189 --> 03:41:51.199 align:start position:0%
facility
 
03:41:52.870 --> 03:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
san francisco made big headway when they
 
03:41:54.070 --> 03:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
announced closing their juvenile
 
03:41:54.080 --> 03:41:54.710 align:start position:0%
announced closing their juvenile
facility

03:41:54.710 --> 03:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
facility
 
03:41:56.150 --> 03:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
but their plan was to transfer those
 
03:41:57.830 --> 03:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
kids to the state facility
 
03:41:59.670 --> 03:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
missouri closed a lot of facilities new
 
03:42:01.189 --> 03:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
jersey's closed a lot of facilities but
 
03:42:02.630 --> 03:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
they moved them to other facilities
 
03:42:04.469 --> 03:42:04.479 align:start position:0%
nobody's actually been able to eliminate
 
03:42:05.830 --> 03:42:05.840 align:start position:0%
the need
 
03:42:08.309 --> 03:42:08.319 align:start position:0%
so i think you know it the idea that
 
03:42:09.750 --> 03:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
there's a closure
 
03:42:13.189 --> 03:42:13.199 align:start position:0%
without a step two is is a very very
 
03:42:13.199 --> 03:42:13.910 align:start position:0%
without a step two is is a very very
risky

03:42:13.910 --> 03:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
risky
 
03:42:16.630 --> 03:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
dangerous proposition um and i think
 
03:42:17.670 --> 03:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
that you know it's
 
03:42:20.309 --> 03:42:20.319 align:start position:0%
it would be risky to jump into demanding
 
03:42:21.830 --> 03:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
that something closes at a certain point
 
03:42:24.070 --> 03:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
before a plan is in place um
 
03:42:26.469 --> 03:42:26.479 align:start position:0%
to have whatever is saved whatever we go
 
03:42:27.910 --> 03:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
to next
 
03:42:30.790 --> 03:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
i i just just so you know from a
 
03:42:32.550 --> 03:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
personal perspective i couldn't agree
 
03:42:33.590 --> 03:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
with you more
 
03:42:35.830 --> 03:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
as a as an old plans officer you don't
 
03:42:37.670 --> 03:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
take step one unless you know where
 
03:42:39.030 --> 03:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
you're gonna land on
 
03:42:42.229 --> 03:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
step two so uh so
 
03:42:45.750 --> 03:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
so i i i i get your point i i
 
03:42:49.030 --> 03:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
to to come back to a question if we did
 
03:42:51.030 --> 03:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
drive the census down further
 
03:42:53.830 --> 03:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me like we've structured
 
03:42:54.790 --> 03:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
the services
 
03:42:57.030 --> 03:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
and the personnel that support them in a
 
03:42:59.189 --> 03:42:59.199 align:start position:0%
way in which
 
03:43:01.910 --> 03:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
we might still not be driving down costs
 
03:43:01.920 --> 03:43:02.790 align:start position:0%
we might still not be driving down costs
much

03:43:02.790 --> 03:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
much
 
03:43:04.710 --> 03:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
i mean we could we could get to near
 
03:43:06.229 --> 03:43:06.239 align:start position:0%
zero and still
 
03:43:10.070 --> 03:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
have a pretty hefty bill right
 
03:43:11.910 --> 03:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
yeah i think some hard decisions are
 
03:43:13.670 --> 03:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
going to have to be made about what some
 
03:43:16.070 --> 03:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
of those fixed costs are in terms of
 
03:43:19.110 --> 03:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
educational programming you know
 
03:43:22.229 --> 03:43:22.239 align:start position:0%
food service um medical programming you
 
03:43:23.429 --> 03:43:23.439 align:start position:0%
know i
 
03:43:24.950 --> 03:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
like i said i'm not comfortable with
 
03:43:27.269 --> 03:43:27.279 align:start position:0%
eliminating 24 7 nursing but
 
03:43:29.590 --> 03:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
you know you to drive down costs those
 
03:43:30.870 --> 03:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
are the kinds of things that people are
 
03:43:31.990 --> 03:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
going to have to wrestle with
 
03:43:34.950 --> 03:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
which you know are not things that i'd
 
03:43:35.910 --> 03:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
be comfortable
 
03:43:39.189 --> 03:43:39.199 align:start position:0%
recommending the elimination of um
 
03:43:41.830 --> 03:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
i do think that you know by structuring
 
03:43:43.269 --> 03:43:43.279 align:start position:0%
a new program we could probably be more
 
03:43:45.030 --> 03:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
thoughtful about how staffing could be
 
03:43:47.349 --> 03:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
used in a different setup
 
03:43:48.710 --> 03:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
you know right now with a lot of space
 
03:43:50.550 --> 03:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
to cover staff you know we're covering
 
03:43:51.830 --> 03:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
different units that hold
 
03:43:53.269 --> 03:43:53.279 align:start position:0%
large number of kids so you might be
 
03:43:55.110 --> 03:43:55.120 align:start position:0%
able to gain some some efficiencies
 
03:43:56.870 --> 03:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
through different structures of the
 
03:43:59.670 --> 03:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
of the units through developing a new a
 
03:44:00.309 --> 03:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
new um
 
03:44:03.269 --> 03:44:03.279 align:start position:0%
program and i think that um you know
 
03:44:04.389 --> 03:44:04.399 align:start position:0%
reduced census
 
03:44:06.150 --> 03:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
like i said it's not just the census
 
03:44:07.590 --> 03:44:07.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's the units
 
03:44:09.269 --> 03:44:09.279 align:start position:0%
so it's it's about figuring out i think
 
03:44:11.750 --> 03:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
as representative wallner said before
 
03:44:13.830 --> 03:44:13.840 align:start position:0%
what do we do to to treat girls if we
 
03:44:15.189 --> 03:44:15.199 align:start position:0%
know that there's only going to be
 
03:44:19.110 --> 03:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
at most a couple girls in the program
 
03:44:21.590 --> 03:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
i think that there's you know it would
 
03:44:23.510 --> 03:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
be difficult to say there's no option
 
03:44:25.990 --> 03:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
for the girl in the state of new
 
03:44:26.000 --> 03:44:27.030 align:start position:0%
for the girl in the state of new
hampshire

03:44:27.030 --> 03:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:44:28.389 --> 03:44:28.399 align:start position:0%
but maybe there's a way to think
 
03:44:30.070 --> 03:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
differently about what that looks like
 
03:44:33.590 --> 03:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:35.990 --> 03:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
there are things that can be done but
 
03:44:38.550 --> 03:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
it's it is very complex and it's
 
03:44:40.950 --> 03:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
hard to do in the absence of knowing
 
03:44:43.590 --> 03:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
what the impacts of our current reforms
 
03:44:45.590 --> 03:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
are going to date i know that's not
 
03:44:47.750 --> 03:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
satisfactory to a lot of folks but
 
03:44:49.349 --> 03:44:49.359 align:start position:0%
i'm not particularly comfortable making
 
03:44:51.990 --> 03:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
a prediction on exactly what these small
 
03:44:53.590 --> 03:44:53.600 align:start position:0%
numbers are going to be
 
03:44:55.510 --> 03:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
in future years until we see the impact
 
03:44:56.550 --> 03:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
of some of the reforms that are
 
03:45:00.550 --> 03:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:02.229 --> 03:45:02.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for that are there are there
 
03:45:03.990 --> 03:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
any other questions i don't see any from
 
03:45:05.110 --> 03:45:05.120 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
03:45:08.469 --> 03:45:08.479 align:start position:0%
any from the attendees uh
 
03:45:11.030 --> 03:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
i had one thing to that chair where are
 
03:45:12.469 --> 03:45:12.479 align:start position:0%
you oh go ahead
 
03:45:14.790 --> 03:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
thank you um so one thing i would just
 
03:45:16.550 --> 03:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
mention in every legislative committee
 
03:45:17.750 --> 03:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
that has looked at this
 
03:45:19.830 --> 03:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
of course evaluates this as well but i
 
03:45:22.150 --> 03:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
think it's something that has
 
03:45:24.469 --> 03:45:24.479 align:start position:0%
uh made it difficult from a return on
 
03:45:26.070 --> 03:45:26.080 align:start position:0%
investment standpoint to build a new
 
03:45:28.950 --> 03:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
facility is that when this building is
 
03:45:31.269 --> 03:45:31.279 align:start position:0%
no longer used for this purpose
 
03:45:33.110 --> 03:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
there is a potential 10 million dollar
 
03:45:35.830 --> 03:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
payback to the federal government
 
03:45:39.110 --> 03:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
that um was part of how the building was
 
03:45:40.309 --> 03:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
paid for when it was built
 
03:45:42.229 --> 03:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
so that's something we didn't talk about
 
03:45:43.670 --> 03:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
specifically in the presentation but i
 
03:45:44.389 --> 03:45:44.399 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
03:45:47.590 --> 03:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
most people know that um but i wanted to
 
03:45:48.229 --> 03:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
mention it
 
03:45:50.790 --> 03:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
so that it's not forgotten well most
 
03:45:50.800 --> 03:45:51.269 align:start position:0%
so that it's not forgotten well most
people

03:45:51.269 --> 03:45:51.279 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:45:54.070 --> 03:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
knew that and but i didn't so i
 
03:45:54.080 --> 03:45:54.870 align:start position:0%
knew that and but i didn't so i
appreciate

03:45:54.870 --> 03:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
03:45:58.790 --> 03:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
you telling me thank you
 
03:46:02.309 --> 03:46:02.319 align:start position:0%
um all right well it's
