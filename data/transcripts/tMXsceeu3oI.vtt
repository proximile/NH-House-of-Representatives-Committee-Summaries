00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
so this is a bill that i had started
 
00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:07.039 align:start position:0%
back before we
 
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
canceled everything because of covid
 
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
and it got lost in those omnibus bills
 
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
or didn't get in actually an omnibus
 
00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
built and it's also a little bit
 
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
confusing because i think we
 
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
also discussed before about how um
 
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
there was movement to get you know every
 
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 align:start position:0%
new session there's a movement to go
 
00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.590 align:start position:0%
new session there's a movement to go
through

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
the different uh committees uh
 
00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:31.510 align:start position:0%
the different uh committees uh
the

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
like the oversight committees
 
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
and see which ones have been meeting and
 
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
which ones haven't and
 
00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
try to get a handle on which ones to
 
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.029 align:start position:0%
try to get a handle on which ones to
continue

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
continue
 
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
this one one of the reasons i think it
 
00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
stayed in was because of this bill that
 
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
i had
 
00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
submitted before to try to address the
 
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee because i think
 
00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:51.919 align:start position:0%
it's very important
 
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
charter schools are going to play a role
 
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
in our our
 
00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
public school system have uh they offer
 
00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
an alternative and i
 
00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.070 align:start position:0%
an alternative and i
i

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
want to say right up front that that i
 
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
support types of charter schools
 
00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
um i think they're important
 
00:07:07.599 --> 00:07:08.629 align:start position:0%
um i think they're important
um

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:10.639 align:start position:0%
for a lot of different reasons
 
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
but the charters and i've passed out
 
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.589 align:start position:0%
but the charters and i've passed out
information

00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
charter schools started in 1996
 
00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
and originally originally their
 
00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:22.639 align:start position:0%
mission was
 
00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
to provide a laboratory for innovative
 
00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:26.790 align:start position:0%
to provide a laboratory for innovative
education

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.309 align:start position:0%
education
and

00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
the original concept was
 
00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
by the name of the fellow that uh
 
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
devised this his idea was for groups of
 
00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
teachers to set up contracts
 
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
or charters with their local school
 
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.070 align:start position:0%
or charters with their local school
boards

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
boards
 
00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
to discover new approaches and ids in
 
00:07:44.469 --> 00:07:44.479 align:start position:0%
the field of education and then
 
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
bring those back
 
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
to see if they could be
 
00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
used in the in the general public
 
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
education system
 
00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
however over the years
 
00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.629 align:start position:0%
however over the years
particularly

00:07:56.629 --> 00:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
in the last few years
 
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
charter schools have kind of taken
 
00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a turn
 
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
we still have some of those schools
 
00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
charter schools that are
 
00:08:07.039 --> 00:08:07.990 align:start position:0%
charter schools that are
schools

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
that are doing quite well that
 
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.350 align:start position:0%
that are doing quite well that
are

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:13.919 align:start position:0%
innovative um they're usually centered
 
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
around a certain theme
 
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
and they do really well um and
 
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
all charter schools are trying to do the
 
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
best they can uh but it's now it seems
 
00:08:24.869 --> 00:08:24.879 align:start position:0%
to be more
 
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
to offer
 
00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:28.160 align:start position:0%
an independent
 
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
alternative for the public school system
 
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
that's independent
 
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
from the existing school district or
 
00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:35.440 align:start position:0%
school system structure
 
00:08:37.029 --> 00:08:37.039 align:start position:0%
and being exempt from many of the
 
00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:39.039 align:start position:0%
regulations that public schools are put
 
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
on and i just can't say that enough
 
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
that public school systems in in the
 
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire are over
 
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
regulated and underfunded and we just
 
00:08:51.509 --> 00:08:51.519 align:start position:0%
seem to be putting more regulations on
 
00:08:53.509 --> 00:08:53.519 align:start position:0%
them all the time
 
00:08:53.519 --> 00:08:54.630 align:start position:0%
them all the time
so

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:54.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
as part of the statute in
 
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
your yellow books or whatever color
 
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.990 align:start position:0%
your yellow books or whatever color
behind

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:02.000 align:start position:0%
behind
 
00:09:04.389 --> 00:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
you'll find that there's a legislative
 
00:09:07.269 --> 00:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
oversight committee for charter schools
 
00:09:07.279 --> 00:09:09.190 align:start position:0%
oversight committee for charter schools
and

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
when i went back to look at the charter
 
00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:13.519 align:start position:0%
schools and do a little bit of review on
 
00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:14.470 align:start position:0%
schools and do a little bit of review on
them

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:14.480 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
i found out that this particular
 
00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee
 
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
was very active in the beginning and if
 
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
you look at the second page
 
00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
you'll see that there's um
 
00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
a chart that shows
 
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
how often the meetings were held
 
00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
and even after they weren't being held
 
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:34.720 align:start position:0%
which is really kind of interesting
 
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
people were still putting in legislation
 
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
to change the oversight committee
 
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
and there's many reasons that a than an
 
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
oversight committee or any committee
 
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
like that
 
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
and when we were talking about the study
 
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
of the study yesterday many reasons why
 
00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:53.519 align:start position:0%
study committees don't don't meet
 
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
oftentimes it's because they can't get a
 
00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
quorum get people all together
 
00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.990 align:start position:0%
quorum get people all together
so

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
what i tried to do is i tried to through
 
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
this bill offer some changes that i
 
00:10:06.069 --> 00:10:06.079 align:start position:0%
thought could revitalize the committee
 
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
and also
 
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
be a true legislative oversight
 
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
committee that actually looks at the at
 
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
the program um and not just the
 
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
financial or application part of it so
 
00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
what i have in this is that uh you know
 
00:10:22.949 --> 00:10:22.959 align:start position:0%
we've got chairs
 
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
from the house and senate committee or
 
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
their designees so they can isn't you
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
know right based on those on the
 
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
education committee a member from the
 
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
finance committee because charter
 
00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:35.990 align:start position:0%
finance committee because charter
schools

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
have a very special type of financing
 
00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.750 align:start position:0%
have a very special type of financing
appoint

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
appoint
 
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
people that are appointed by the senate
 
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
president and the speaker of the house
 
00:10:48.069 --> 00:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
and then a non-voting charter school
 
00:10:49.509 --> 00:10:49.519 align:start position:0%
specialist from the department of
 
00:10:49.519 --> 00:10:51.829 align:start position:0%
specialist from the department of
education

00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
and set it up so it actually has
 
00:10:55.509 --> 00:10:55.519 align:start position:0%
allowance for mileage
 
00:10:57.509 --> 00:10:57.519 align:start position:0%
meets twice a year
 
00:10:59.350 --> 00:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
and then expand a little bit the area of
 
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
oversight so that
 
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:02.240 align:start position:0%
they receive
 
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
and review the reports from the state
 
00:11:05.829 --> 00:11:05.839 align:start position:0%
board of education that's part of the
 
00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
statute that they
 
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
they are supposed to get an annual
 
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
report from
 
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
the state board
 
00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
about charter schools
 
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if that's happening or
 
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
not it's kind of hard to find some of
 
00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
these things
 
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
deliver their report to the education
 
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
committees in the house and senate
 
00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:25.839 align:start position:0%
because i think as we're finding things
 
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
we need to
 
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:31.200 align:start position:0%
people find out about the great things
 
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
that charter schools are doing and some
 
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:34.720 align:start position:0%
of the issues that charter schools have
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
that maybe we can help them out
 
00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
and and try to make this
 
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
particular part of the public school
 
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
system and public
 
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
more effective and efficient
 
00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
monitor the effects of the charter
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
school statutes so we have a whole
 
00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
section on charter schools review the
 
00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
charter school system
 
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
and in the early years as i've put here
 
00:12:00.629 --> 00:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
the charter school system actually had a
 
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
review and
 
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
quite an involved review
 
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
it not only did their financial but it
 
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
also did their academic
 
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
and mission and
 
00:12:16.949 --> 00:12:16.959 align:start position:0%
that was done by an outside organization
 
00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
and then for a number of years there was
 
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
no review of charter schools and then
 
00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:24.959 align:start position:0%
recently within the last i think maybe
 
00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:28.240 align:start position:0%
five or six years i not quite sure
 
00:12:30.389 --> 00:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
the department of education has started
 
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
that again but as you can imagine they
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
have a backlog because as we get more
 
00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
charters and the fact they didn't do
 
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
reviews before they're now catching up
 
00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
uh you know once every five years
 
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to review charter
 
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
schools and i think it's important to
 
00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
make that transparent so that those
 
00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
reviews are available to the to the
 
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
public and to the parents of the
 
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:52.240 align:start position:0%
students that are going to the charter
 
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
school and also to the education
 
00:12:56.069 --> 00:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
committees who are trying to make
 
00:12:59.269 --> 00:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
legislation or not um to help this whole
 
00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:00.150 align:start position:0%
legislation or not um to help this whole
system

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:13:01.829 --> 00:13:01.839 align:start position:0%
and then um
 
00:13:04.069 --> 00:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
at the end of my remarks i just left a
 
00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
couple of
 
00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
places that you may want to just look
 
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959 align:start position:0%
the first one is a reference to the
 
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
beginning of charter schools
 
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:11.910 align:start position:0%
beginning of charter schools
so

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
that's my little spiel
 
00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
and i've offered it in house bill 1047
 
00:13:17.279 --> 00:13:18.150 align:start position:0%
and i've offered it in house bill 1047
and

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:20.240 align:start position:0%
i'll take any questions are there any
 
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
questions for the presenter yes
 
00:13:23.829 --> 00:13:23.839 align:start position:0%
represent hobson
 
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question i
 
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
apologize for being late um i wanted to
 
00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
just ask you when was the last time this
 
00:13:34.629 --> 00:13:34.639 align:start position:0%
committee met do you know um well if you
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
look at the second page right
 
00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:38.240 align:start position:0%
uh it goes uh
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
2018 okay and that was the last that i
 
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
had an opportunity to actually
 
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
do it but as you can see
 
00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:46.790 align:start position:0%
do it but as you can see
um

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
you know there had been uh
 
00:13:52.389 --> 00:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
at least 2017 seems to be the last time
 
00:13:54.629 --> 00:13:54.639 align:start position:0%
and they actually scheduled a meeting
 
00:13:57.189 --> 00:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
right after i submitted the bill
 
00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
uh two years ago and i sat outside
 
00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
waiting for the
 
00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
meeting to start and never started
 
00:14:03.279 --> 00:14:05.829 align:start position:0%
meeting to start and never started
so

00:14:05.829 --> 00:14:05.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
it wasn't held then either
 
00:14:11.189 --> 00:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
it was scheduled but not held
 
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
further question representative cordelli
 
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you
 
00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.470 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you
representative

00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to see what the actual
 
00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:22.389 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to see what the actual
changes

00:14:22.389 --> 00:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:22.399 --> 00:14:23.189 align:start position:0%
 
are

00:14:23.189 --> 00:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
being proposed because this is a repeal
 
00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
and reenactment of the existing statute
 
00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:30.389 align:start position:0%
and reenactment of the existing statute
so

00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:14:31.750 --> 00:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
looking at it
 
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
would i be correct that the
 
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
main changes that you are suggesting in
 
00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.430 align:start position:0%
main changes that you are suggesting in
this

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.470 align:start position:0%
this
bill

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
are the makeup of the committee
 
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
um the date of the committee to submit a
 
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
report on line 24. that's a change
 
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
and just line 2829 and the
 
00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
date for the state board
 
00:14:58.949 --> 00:14:58.959 align:start position:0%
to issue a report if they have any
 
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
are those the only changes yeah um i
 
00:15:05.269 --> 00:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
think i i listed it on my um
 
00:15:07.269 --> 00:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
my paper that i sent out to you that the
 
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
major changes were the makeup of the
 
00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.470 align:start position:0%
major changes were the makeup of the
committee

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
um and hopefully with this makeup uh it
 
00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
will allow uh
 
00:15:17.189 --> 00:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
you know the current one i think only
 
00:15:17.199 --> 00:15:17.990 align:start position:0%
you know the current one i think only
has

00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
um three or four members to it so
 
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
if one of the senators don't show up and
 
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
then somebody else is not available it
 
00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
just doesn't go and that's the problem
 
00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.069 align:start position:0%
just doesn't go and that's the problem
so

00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
making the committee a little bit more
 
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
expanded having the non-voting member
 
00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
from the department of education
 
00:15:36.629 --> 00:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
specializing in charter schools
 
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
the meeting schedule and and the dates
 
00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
when it's due and also a little bit on
 
00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
the expanded area of oversight and
 
00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
reporting those are the three basic
 
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.990 align:start position:0%
reporting those are the three basic
things

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh representative porter
 
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:51.749 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um

representative
 
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
do you know
 
00:15:55.350 --> 00:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
are there any reports
 
00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
on charter schools that are available to
 
00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
the public
 
00:16:00.629 --> 00:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
on a yearly basis i know my local school
 
00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
district puts out the yearly report card
 
00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.470 align:start position:0%
district puts out the yearly report card
that

00:16:04.470 --> 00:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:16:05.749 --> 00:16:05.759 align:start position:0%
the does
 
00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:07.519 align:start position:0%
does on them it's on their website is
 
00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:09.519 align:start position:0%
there anything like that for charter
 
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
schools do you know
 
00:16:13.829 --> 00:16:13.839 align:start position:0%
um when we did this back two years ago
 
00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
uh i couldn't find anything at that
 
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
point and and really i'm not a expert
 
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
researcher uh jen helped me a little bit
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
on it but um
 
00:16:26.949 --> 00:16:26.959 align:start position:0%
i couldn't i couldn't find anything
 
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
representative i have a question for you
 
00:16:30.079 --> 00:16:31.590 align:start position:0%
representative i have a question for you
um

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
in in the past and i'm trying to recall
 
00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.430 align:start position:0%
in in the past and i'm trying to recall
um

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:38.079 align:start position:0%
why you have chosen to go the route of
 
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
putting a non-voting member on a
 
00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
committee which is usually a legislative
 
00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:43.910 align:start position:0%
committee which is usually a legislative
assignment

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
assignment
 
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
in the legislative oriented committee
 
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
verse where we have committees or
 
00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
councils like advisory councils such as
 
00:16:52.629 --> 00:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
we have in numerous areas
 
00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:54.959 align:start position:0%
where in fact we have
 
00:16:57.189 --> 00:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
some folks from doe chairing those
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
particular councils or commissions where
 
00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
we have active involvement
 
00:17:03.269 --> 00:17:03.279 align:start position:0%
in this case you've gone the other way
 
00:17:05.590 --> 00:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
and put it on a legislative committee
 
00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
which are are you aware of that if
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
that's done like that and any other
 
00:17:12.069 --> 00:17:12.079 align:start position:0%
committees we have i'm not and i must
 
00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
say that um
 
00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
the the uh
 
00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:16.959 align:start position:0%
gentleman that it that is the principle
 
00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
of the ledger charter school up in my
 
00:17:21.429 --> 00:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
area uh also used to be a colleague of
 
00:17:23.029 --> 00:17:23.039 align:start position:0%
mine and so
 
00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:25.039 align:start position:0%
when i was developing this i actually
 
00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:28.079 align:start position:0%
talked to him and uh he was distressed
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
that you know
 
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
as i think teachers and principals and
 
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
school board members in general are
 
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
distressed that you know they feel as
 
00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:38.799 align:start position:0%
though the legislative work goes in a
 
00:17:38.799 --> 00:17:39.830 align:start position:0%
though the legislative work goes in a
bubble

00:17:39.830 --> 00:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
bubble
 
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
that doesn't know what's really
 
00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
happening out in the field and um he
 
00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
suggested that uh yes have you know have
 
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
a legislative oversight committee he was
 
00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
uh okay with that but he said you need
 
00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
to have somebody there
 
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
that's um
 
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
going to be there on a regular basis
 
00:17:59.590 --> 00:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
that actually knows what's going on in
 
00:18:02.789 --> 00:18:02.799 align:start position:0%
the charter school field and i so as a
 
00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
compromise to him
 
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
not not a compromise but taking that
 
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
suggestion from him
 
00:18:11.669 --> 00:18:11.679 align:start position:0%
my solution was to come up with
 
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
having somebody from the department of
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
education which i think they probably
 
00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:17.360 align:start position:0%
would show up just like
 
00:18:19.909 --> 00:18:19.919 align:start position:0%
attorney fenton shows up here uh for the
 
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
meeting and but put it in in the legis
 
00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
in the um
 
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
makeup of the committee
 
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
so that they would be invited on a
 
00:18:30.549 --> 00:18:30.559 align:start position:0%
regular basis and be there as an expert
 
00:18:33.029 --> 00:18:33.039 align:start position:0%
in the field of charter schools
 
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
i understand where you're where you're
 
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
going and and the purpose behind that
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
but i question
 
00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:41.919 align:start position:0%
whether that we can do that uh every
 
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
committee that i know of and would you
 
00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
believe that every committee that i've
 
00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
been part of we've always had either
 
00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:49.919 align:start position:0%
dyna fenton there or we've had jeff
 
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
beard there or we've had eric
 
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
froworth there you know all these
 
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
directors always make sure when we ask
 
00:18:59.190 --> 00:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
to have that technical support available
 
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm just questioning whether this
 
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
is something that you would think about
 
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
changing if
 
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
you can be assured by the department
 
00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
which i've always been assured that
 
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
somebody would be present to
 
00:19:13.430 --> 00:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
provide that advice
 
00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
um certainly i i would i just
 
00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
my hesitation only is that
 
00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
um instead of technical just technical
 
00:19:23.909 --> 00:19:23.919 align:start position:0%
support um i would expect that this
 
00:19:23.919 --> 00:19:24.870 align:start position:0%
support um i would expect that this
person

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
would offer some suggestions from from
 
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
their standpoint how
 
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh things might be changed um like
 
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
application forms or something like that
 
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
that they would
 
00:19:38.789 --> 00:19:38.799 align:start position:0%
they would even offer uh some
 
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
information at the at the um
 
00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
meetings rather than just sit in the
 
00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
back and when we call them up you know
 
00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
say you know give us this technical
 
00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
issue but how you know if it's
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware that it was wasn't
 
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
something that wasn't being done so if
 
00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
it's there's some way to change this
 
00:19:58.950 --> 00:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh i'm more than happy to do that
 
00:19:58.960 --> 00:19:59.750 align:start position:0%
uh i'm more than happy to do that
would

00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh would you be opposed to this being
 
00:20:03.909 --> 00:20:03.919 align:start position:0%
called a
 
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh oversight
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
advisory council
 
00:20:09.909 --> 00:20:09.919 align:start position:0%
whereas then we could have for example
 
00:20:09.919 --> 00:20:10.950 align:start position:0%
whereas then we could have for example
like

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:20:13.270 --> 00:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
dave waters and i have both chaired at
 
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
times the advisory council for cte now
 
00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
the the chair of that committee is jeff
 
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
beard who happens to be the
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
person from the d.o.e
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh so um i guess there's different ways
 
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
of looking at this yeah certainly
 
00:20:30.549 --> 00:20:30.559 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
it's in the semantics of it but um the
 
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
reason i called it a charter school
 
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
oversight committee was that it's in
 
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
statute now
 
00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:39.590 align:start position:0%
statute now
and

00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
if we had a council it would seem that
 
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
you would have then two bodies
 
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
doing the exact same thing that or close
 
00:20:52.310 --> 00:20:52.320 align:start position:0%
close enough that it would be quite a
 
00:20:53.909 --> 00:20:53.919 align:start position:0%
duplication kind of like a study of a
 
00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:55.029 align:start position:0%
duplication kind of like a study of a
study

00:20:55.029 --> 00:20:55.039 align:start position:0%
study
 
00:20:58.789 --> 00:20:58.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:00.940 align:start position:0%
you have a question of reps and hobson
 
00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:02.789 align:start position:0%
you have a question of reps and hobson
[Laughter]

00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:02.799 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:21:04.470 --> 00:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
okay are there any further questions
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
yes representative moffitt thank you mr
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
thank you take my question i'm looking
 
00:21:11.029 --> 00:21:11.039 align:start position:0%
at the existing statute and i see that
 
00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
it calls for three senators and three
 
00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
reps and would you believe i'm not
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
surprised that a meeting is not included
 
00:21:20.149 --> 00:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
three senators
 
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
yes uh they've really had quite a
 
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:25.919 align:start position:0%
problem with that makeup yes they do so
 
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
further comments or questions from the
 
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
committee not saying thank you very much
 
00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:32.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
i don't think we have any other cards on
 
00:21:41.679 --> 00:21:42.950 align:start position:0%
i don't think we have any other cards on
this

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
on this bill so with that we're going to
 
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:52.559 align:start position:0%
and that takes us into the business
 
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:55.440 align:start position:0%

forward into doing something exactly on
 
01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:28.480 align:start position:0%

okay for the for for committee members
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh we have a list of bills which we want
 
01:01:46.789 --> 01:01:46.799 align:start position:0%
to go over and so i'll share that with
 
01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
you right now so you know where we're
 
01:01:50.549 --> 01:01:50.559 align:start position:0%
going and um
 
01:01:53.349 --> 01:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
and the need for perhaps a break or two
 
01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
within that schedule for us either to
 
01:01:58.710 --> 01:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
you know talk uh to the individual
 
01:02:00.549 --> 01:02:00.559 align:start position:0%
caucuses for for about four or five
 
01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
minutes or to maybe uh amendments but uh
 
01:02:05.589 --> 01:02:05.599 align:start position:0%
that i think that'll be later so the
 
01:02:07.589 --> 01:02:07.599 align:start position:0%
first bill which we'll be looking at and
 
01:02:08.789 --> 01:02:08.799 align:start position:0%
then i'm going to go down the list is
 
01:02:08.799 --> 01:02:10.470 align:start position:0%
then i'm going to go down the list is
1564.

01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
1564.
 
01:02:13.349 --> 01:02:13.359 align:start position:0%
that's a bill dealing with breakfast
 
01:02:13.359 --> 01:02:14.870 align:start position:0%
that's a bill dealing with breakfast
1626

01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%

bill
 
01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
and then uh 1639 we're going to do at a
 
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
later time there's probably amending
 
01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
language which we brought forward we
 
01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
don't have that together at this point
 
01:02:29.710 --> 01:02:29.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:31.670 align:start position:0%
 
1198

1198
 
01:02:33.589 --> 01:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
we will be dealing with that that's not
 
01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
on that initial list it's what we came
 
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
up with last night jointly to work
 
01:02:40.710 --> 01:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
towards getting these accomplished
 
01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
12-12 hb 12-12 we will be addressing
 
01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:45.430 align:start position:0%
12-12 hb 12-12 we will be addressing
that

01:02:45.430 --> 01:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
12 41
 
01:02:49.990 --> 01:02:50.000 align:start position:0%

uh 1588
 
01:02:56.069 --> 01:02:56.079 align:start position:0%
uh 1336 we'll probably add on to that
 
01:02:57.029 --> 01:02:57.039 align:start position:0%
but we're gonna have to have a little
 
01:02:59.750 --> 01:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
break before it uh to discuss that to be
 
01:03:00.829 --> 01:03:00.839 align:start position:0%
about five
 
01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
minutes uh then we have 12 36 which we
 
01:03:07.109 --> 01:03:07.119 align:start position:0%
have some amending language that hasn't
 
01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
been put together well it's been put

01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
testimony or guidance i guess from the
 
01:04:51.920 --> 01:04:53.430 align:start position:0%
testimony or guidance i guess from the
doe

01:04:53.430 --> 01:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
doe
 
01:04:54.789 --> 01:04:54.799 align:start position:0%
the federally
 
01:04:54.799 --> 01:04:55.750 align:start position:0%
the federally
federal

01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
federal
 
01:04:58.470 --> 01:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
government would not fund the startup
 
01:04:58.480 --> 01:04:59.589 align:start position:0%
government would not fund the startup
costs

01:04:59.589 --> 01:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:05:02.309 --> 01:05:02.319 align:start position:0%
and the continuing costs for positions
 
01:05:04.870 --> 01:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
that would be needed to oversee
 
01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
this program
 
01:05:09.029 --> 01:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
so i'm hoping that our committee will
 
01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
remember the other study committee that
 
01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
we talked about yesterday and this is
 
01:05:15.589 --> 01:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
one of the items that we can add to that
 
01:05:15.599 --> 01:05:17.589 align:start position:0%
one of the items that we can add to that
yeah

01:05:17.589 --> 01:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
represent nelson did you have uh any
 
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.710 align:start position:0%
represent nelson did you have uh any
comments

01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
comments
 
01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
from the committee any other comments
 
01:05:28.789 --> 01:05:28.799 align:start position:0%
not yes representative ellison uh thank
 
01:05:30.789 --> 01:05:30.799 align:start position:0%
you mr chair uh i'll just repeat what i
 
01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
said yesterday that a priority for this
 
01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:35.200 align:start position:0%
committee should be feeding students
 
01:05:37.270 --> 01:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
whether it's breakfast or lunch
 
01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh and i guess i would also add that
 
01:05:42.390 --> 01:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
since i look at the list of sponsors and
 
01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
our friends representative wolf and
 
01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
representative allard our sponsors on
 
01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:48.079 align:start position:0%
this that that tends to make me think
 
01:05:51.029 --> 01:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
that it's a good piece of legislation
 
01:05:53.270 --> 01:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:55.270 align:start position:0%
further discussion
representative

01:05:55.270 --> 01:05:55.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:05:58.630 --> 01:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
uh thank you um you know
 
01:06:00.549 --> 01:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
breakfast is so important i mean it's
 
01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
it's the
 
01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
in many circles it's the most important
 
01:06:06.309 --> 01:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
meal of the day
 
01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
to get kids and for kids to get started
 
01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
off on the right foot at school
 
01:06:13.829 --> 01:06:13.839 align:start position:0%
and there are ways to get
 
01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
breakfast i know with kearsarge we had
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
every student practically was bussed in
 
01:06:22.309 --> 01:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:25.029 --> 01:06:25.039 align:start position:0%
sometimes the buses were late and it it
 
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
was a problem with the breakfast program
 
01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:27.750 align:start position:0%
was a problem with the breakfast program
but

01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
what they did was they had bags
 
01:06:31.829 --> 01:06:31.839 align:start position:0%
that kids that were coming in later
 
01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
running late could just come to the
 
01:06:35.829 --> 01:06:35.839 align:start position:0%
cafeteria and pick up a bag that had you
 
01:06:37.510 --> 01:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
know a power bar in it and some other
 
01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
things just to get some food in them and
 
01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
um i know i worked with teenagers which
 
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
can be like locusts sometimes because
 
01:06:46.549 --> 01:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
they're they're growing and uh you know
 
01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
they grow an inch in a in a couple of
 
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:50.720 align:start position:0%
weeks and they just need so many
 
01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:52.799 align:start position:0%
calories and so much food i'm i'm very
 
01:06:55.029 --> 01:06:55.039 align:start position:0%
jealous of that but uh it was something
 
01:06:57.829 --> 01:06:57.839 align:start position:0%
that um you know like i said yesterday i
 
01:06:59.190 --> 01:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
kept food
 
01:07:01.829 --> 01:07:01.839 align:start position:0%
in my area and i know almost every other
 
01:07:01.839 --> 01:07:02.870 align:start position:0%
in my area and i know almost every other
teacher

01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
01:07:05.270 --> 01:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
did that because you'd have kids that
 
01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
you would see just you know
 
01:07:11.270 --> 01:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
dr drowsy or just not acting and say you
 
01:07:12.630 --> 01:07:12.640 align:start position:0%
know do you need something to kind of
 
01:07:14.789 --> 01:07:14.799 align:start position:0%
pick yourself up and eventually they got
 
01:07:16.230 --> 01:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
to the point where they knew where they
 
01:07:18.150 --> 01:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
could go to get some food so i think
 
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
this is a really important
 
01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
program um
 
01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
and i just back up with representative
 
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
ellison said thank you thank you further
 
01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:28.640 align:start position:0%
discussion representative woodcock and
 
01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
then uh
 
01:07:31.349 --> 01:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
represent lakes and then represent
 
01:07:31.359 --> 01:07:33.430 align:start position:0%
represent lakes and then represent
london

01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
london
 
01:07:35.829 --> 01:07:35.839 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman good morning
 
01:07:37.349 --> 01:07:37.359 align:start position:0%
i would like to follow up in the same
 
01:07:39.109 --> 01:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
the same line we spoke about again
 
01:07:39.119 --> 01:07:40.309 align:start position:0%
the same line we spoke about again
yesterday

01:07:40.309 --> 01:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
on the breakfast meals i don't see this
 
01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
as a study committee i don't see this
 
01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
wrapping this is pretty this is pretty
 
01:07:47.910 --> 01:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
clear feed the youngsters breakfast
 
01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
there's they're already on the
 
01:07:51.270 --> 01:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
nutritional program the school's off the
 
01:07:53.190 --> 01:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
lunch it's the most important meal of
 
01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:55.039 align:start position:0%
the day to start the day for for kids
 
01:07:57.029 --> 01:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
when they get there um
 
01:07:58.789 --> 01:07:58.799 align:start position:0%
it's it's almost inexcusable that we
 
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to provide a meal
 
01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
that we know
 
01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
we know from all of our data all of our
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
research the brain easily you know get
 
01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
going um and and this is it these kids
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
are growing and we're not doing
 
01:08:13.990 --> 01:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
ourselves any academic success
 
01:08:15.430 --> 01:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
why not giving this opportunity to start
 
01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
today with something in their stomachs i
 
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
know very few of us around this table
 
01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
would allow our children to start the
 
01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:22.480 align:start position:0%
day when they were in school without
 
01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:23.590 align:start position:0%
day when they were in school without
breakfast

01:08:23.590 --> 01:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
breakfast
 
01:08:24.709 --> 01:08:24.719 align:start position:0%
why should we do the same thing with
 
01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
those that can't afford it thank you
 
01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:28.950 align:start position:0%
those that can't afford it thank you
representative

01:08:28.950 --> 01:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:08:30.070 --> 01:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
which was
 
01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:33.669 align:start position:0%
which was
represented

01:08:33.669 --> 01:08:33.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:36.390 --> 01:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
as so often
 
01:08:39.430 --> 01:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
i say it's a 28-day violation and if we
 
01:08:42.149 --> 01:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
want to do yes there's some things but
 
01:08:44.470 --> 01:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
the problem is their estimate
 
01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
they said as much as 23 000 per school
 
01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
in startup costs not covered
 
01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:51.749 align:start position:0%
in startup costs not covered
um

01:08:51.749 --> 01:08:51.759 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:53.430 --> 01:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
those who meet the requirements but
 
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
don't apply which there are quite a few
 
01:08:57.749 --> 01:08:57.759 align:start position:0%
of where they will not be able to be
 
01:08:59.189 --> 01:08:59.199 align:start position:0%
reimbursed for
 
01:09:01.590 --> 01:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
etc so
 
01:09:03.349 --> 01:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
that's why i see
 
01:09:07.110 --> 01:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
this going i mean if town wants to do it
 
01:09:09.189 --> 01:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
that's awesome if we can encourage towns
 
01:09:11.669 --> 01:09:11.679 align:start position:0%
to do it that's awesome but forcing them
 
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
to do it without fully funding it
 
01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
that's my problem and so that's why i
 
01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
think it needs to be fixed
 
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
because we're forcing and we're
 
01:09:24.149 --> 01:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
mandating schools to do it without fully
 
01:09:27.189 --> 01:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
funding it and that's a 28a violation
 
01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
and so that's why
 
01:09:30.309 --> 01:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
before that committee that's what you've
 
01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
got to look at how about those other
 
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
costs how about the 28 000 how about the
 
01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:36.229 align:start position:0%
costs how about the 28 000 how about the
ongoing

01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
ongoing
 
01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
you know pay for whoever puts those bags
 
01:09:41.189 --> 01:09:41.199 align:start position:0%
together or whatever it is
 
01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
somehow we have to cover if we're going
 
01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
to mandate it we have to cover it
 
01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's the constitution
 
01:09:50.149 --> 01:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
thank you representative luno
 
01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:52.799 align:start position:0%
thanks very much mr chair and um
 
01:09:52.799 --> 01:09:53.990 align:start position:0%
thanks very much mr chair and um
and

01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:56.790 --> 01:09:56.800 align:start position:0%
so i'm sort of focused on a on a
 
01:09:58.390 --> 01:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
different um
 
01:09:59.510 --> 01:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
part in
 
01:10:01.270 --> 01:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
01:10:03.990 --> 01:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
down on on line 10
 
01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:04.870 align:start position:0%
down on on line 10
it

01:10:04.870 --> 01:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:05.830 align:start position:0%
it
it

01:10:05.830 --> 01:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
it changes current law
 
01:10:11.430 --> 01:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
from from allowing school districts to
 
01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:12.719 align:start position:0%
decide whether or not they'll
 
01:10:15.510 --> 01:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
participate in the national school
 
01:10:18.149 --> 01:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
breakfast program to shall participate
 
01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
in the national school breakfast program
 
01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know what other implications
 
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
that may have like do you also have to
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
participate in the national school lunch
 
01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
program because there are some districts
 
01:10:29.910 --> 01:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
that don't participate in the national
 
01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
school lunch program
 
01:10:34.149 --> 01:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
and i don't recall from my time on the
 
01:10:34.159 --> 01:10:35.030 align:start position:0%
and i don't recall from my time on the
board

01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:10:37.669 --> 01:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
what what what the pros and cons were
 
01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
but i think there are reasonable pros
 
01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
and cons
 
01:10:43.350 --> 01:10:43.360 align:start position:0%
for determining whether or not a school
 
01:10:46.070 --> 01:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
district participates in the usda
 
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
national school uh lunch program
 
01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh i know we had that conversation in
 
01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
hopkinton many years ago uh uh it may
 
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
have to do with uh with with the um uh
 
01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
requirements on uh on on the news
 
01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
nutritional requirements or the certain
 
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
food product requirements that uh
 
01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
that um that that students um would be
 
01:11:10.630 --> 01:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
receiving it may be that that districts
 
01:11:11.669 --> 01:11:11.679 align:start position:0%
want to move
 
01:11:14.709 --> 01:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
want to move a different way on it i i'm
 
01:11:17.590 --> 01:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
i'm i apologize that that i'm not as
 
01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
current on that argument but but i think
 
01:11:21.669 --> 01:11:21.679 align:start position:0%
it's uh i think it's something that
 
01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
would require
 
01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
further um
 
01:11:28.149 --> 01:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
analysis on on the part of of the
 
01:11:28.159 --> 01:11:29.350 align:start position:0%
analysis on on the part of of the
committee

01:11:29.350 --> 01:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:31.280 align:start position:0%
and we did only hear i think from
 
01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
representative duchess on um on this
 
01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
bill so we don't i don't have any
 
01:11:38.550 --> 01:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
additional background um on it
 
01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
and i guess the final thought is with
 
01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:42.640 align:start position:0%
102 bills i don't think we have time to
 
01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
fix everything
 
01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
and um there's going to be some things
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
that that may be maybe good bills but um
 
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
but we we
 
01:11:54.550 --> 01:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
we just don't have the capacity
 
01:11:57.189 --> 01:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
to address everything at this time so
 
01:11:58.390 --> 01:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm
 
01:12:04.149 --> 01:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
were there any other representatives rep
 
01:12:05.679 --> 01:12:06.870 align:start position:0%
were there any other representatives rep

looked up um
 
01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
how much is the average cost to produce
 
01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:14.440 align:start position:0%
a breakfast for a school child and it's
 
01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
2.72 cents
 
01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
with a federal subsidy
 
01:12:22.630 --> 01:12:22.640 align:start position:0%
of a dollar 88 taken away from that so

that's what we're talking about we're
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%

01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:01.910 align:start position:0%
education
and

01:15:01.910 --> 01:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:02.870 align:start position:0%
and
is

01:15:02.870 --> 01:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
current practice
 
01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:06.310 align:start position:0%
current practice
provided

01:15:06.310 --> 01:15:06.320 align:start position:0%

by the department
and

01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:09.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
it was felt that uh statutes uh should
 
01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
be brought up to date with what is
 
01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
actually going on
 
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
um as this information is required uh
 
01:15:22.229 --> 01:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
in chartered public schools and by the
 
01:15:24.870 --> 01:15:24.880 align:start position:0%

work
so

01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:15:29.669 --> 01:15:29.679 align:start position:0%
statutes should reflect uh
 
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:32.400 align:start position:0%

consent agenda uh the next bill that we
 
01:17:38.950 --> 01:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
have tentatively on that list and the
 
01:17:40.709 --> 01:17:40.719 align:start position:0%
reason why we're not doing it today
 
01:17:44.950 --> 01:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
that's uh uh 1672 misuse of efa funds we
 
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
have a number of bills left on efas and
 
01:17:49.350 --> 01:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
they kind of all intertwin and twain
 
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
with each other and we're going to put
 
01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
them all together so we can have that
 
01:17:58.709 --> 01:17:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
okay so those bills are intertwined
 
01:18:04.390 --> 01:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
there so we'll now go on to the uh next
 
01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
bill which we have on the dock which is
 
01:18:06.159 --> 01:18:08.550 align:start position:0%
bill which we have on the dock which is
1198

01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:08.560 align:start position:0%

1198
1198

01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:18.630 --> 01:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
this is relative to the rules of the
 
01:18:20.470 --> 01:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
department of education concerning
 
01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:31.600 align:start position:0%

01:18:34.229 --> 01:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
reps and cordelli
 
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
i will move itl
 
01:18:39.990 --> 01:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh i understand the intent
 
01:18:55.590 --> 01:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
and we are all concerned about uh the
 
01:18:57.430 --> 01:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
culture and what's going on in our
 
01:18:59.669 --> 01:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
schools um but
 
01:19:01.510 --> 01:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
i don't think this
 
01:19:04.229 --> 01:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
bill as uh drafted
 
01:19:04.239 --> 01:19:05.750 align:start position:0%
bill as uh drafted
um

01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:07.430 --> 01:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
provides uh
 
01:19:08.470 --> 01:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
really the
 
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
information or the
 
01:19:12.709 --> 01:19:12.719 align:start position:0%
scope of
 
01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
what might be included i i think that
 
01:19:18.950 --> 01:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
there's a lack of definition
 
01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:20.550 align:start position:0%
there's a lack of definition
and

01:19:20.550 --> 01:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
other problems with the legislation as
 
01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:24.630 align:start position:0%
other problems with the legislation as
drafted

01:19:24.630 --> 01:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
drafted
 
01:19:26.709 --> 01:19:26.719 align:start position:0%
and therefore i i don't think it should
 
01:19:31.510 --> 01:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:33.189 --> 01:19:33.199 align:start position:0%
representative do you have any further
 
01:19:33.199 --> 01:19:34.470 align:start position:0%
representative do you have any further
comments

01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
comments
 
01:19:37.030 --> 01:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
i i do have a comment on that in support
 
01:19:38.709 --> 01:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
of what uh representative cordelli and
 
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
representative cornell have uh made with
 
01:19:42.709 --> 01:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
their motions here
 
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
that if you look at the minimum
 
01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
standards for public school approval
 
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
in 306
 
01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:49.430 align:start position:0%
in 306
um

01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:53.110 --> 01:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
0.06 it mentions culture and climate i'm
 
01:19:54.630 --> 01:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
looking at the categories listed
 
01:19:57.750 --> 01:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
underneath it a and b and c
 
01:19:59.270 --> 01:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
and that's stuff that we're all doing or
 
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
should be doing in our schools right now
 
01:20:04.149 --> 01:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
uh i have no objections the way the the
 
01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
department has set this up and it's been
 
01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
approved by jalcar
 
01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
which is our own legislative committee
 
01:20:13.510 --> 01:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
and so with that i i also support uh the
 
01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
motion that's on on the table before us
 
01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:21.030 align:start position:0%
motion that's on on the table before us
here

01:20:21.030 --> 01:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:23.030 --> 01:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
any further discussion yes represent
 
01:20:25.669 --> 01:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
tanner um yes i i think it's important
 
01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
to also realize that we've had
 
01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
quite a
 
01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
study in a governor's council
 
01:20:33.750 --> 01:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
that has really reported on culture in
 
01:20:35.590 --> 01:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
the school and made it made some very
 
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
strong recommendations
 
01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:38.149 align:start position:0%
strong recommendations
um

01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
that in the in their 2018 report so i
 
01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:41.669 align:start position:0%
that in the in their 2018 report so i
think

01:20:41.669 --> 01:20:41.679 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh that covers a lot of the issues that
 
01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
that people were bringing up thank you
 
01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
yeah and that was a commission study
 
01:20:52.550 --> 01:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
which was widely participated in uh and
 
01:20:54.070 --> 01:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
we've had you know perry plummer
 
01:20:55.270 --> 01:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
involved with that which even was
 
01:20:57.590 --> 01:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
homeland security and safety so
 
01:20:59.590 --> 01:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
um a lot to it
 
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
so any further discussion from the
 
01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:03.510 align:start position:0%
so any further discussion from the
committee

01:21:03.510 --> 01:21:03.520 align:start position:0%

01:23:33.430 --> 01:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
manchester to try to coordinate
 
01:23:35.590 --> 01:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
calendars as soon as the calendar comes
 
01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:36.470 align:start position:0%
calendars as soon as the calendar comes
out

01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:23:38.550 --> 01:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
and that they do provide transportation
 
01:23:40.550 --> 01:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
on days that
 
01:23:42.950 --> 01:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
the calendar is different manchester in
 
01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
case anyone doesn't know also provides
 
01:23:47.189 --> 01:23:47.199 align:start position:0%
transportation to all of the private
 
01:23:50.790 --> 01:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
schools too in manchester not just the
 
01:23:52.870 --> 01:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
public charter schools they provide to
 
01:23:56.149 --> 01:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
holy family mount st mary's mount zion
 
01:23:58.629 --> 01:23:58.639 align:start position:0%
saint benedict's and catherine st joseph
 
01:23:58.639 --> 01:23:59.430 align:start position:0%
saint benedict's and catherine st joseph
so

01:23:59.430 --> 01:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:24:01.990 --> 01:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
i think the public schools that go above
 
01:24:03.990 --> 01:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
and beyond trying to coordinate and
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
provide transportation and
 
01:24:07.669 --> 01:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
transportation if anyone's looked at
 
01:24:10.629 --> 01:24:10.639 align:start position:0%
school budgets is a huge amount of money
 
01:24:13.590 --> 01:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
so i think maybe in the future better
 
01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
cooperation between
 
01:24:18.709 --> 01:24:18.719 align:start position:0%
public schools and public charter
 
01:24:21.270 --> 01:24:21.280 align:start position:0%
schools on calendars would be the right
 
01:24:24.629 --> 01:24:24.639 align:start position:0%
way to go on this so i move itl
 
01:24:26.950 --> 01:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative bowm
 
01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i totally agree with
 
01:24:31.189 --> 01:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
representative cornell one of the
 
01:24:33.669 --> 01:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
problems we've had saying with cte
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's a big issue for
 
01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
charter schools which everybody knows
 
01:24:39.990 --> 01:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
i'm pro-charter schools align the
 
01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.270 align:start position:0%
i'm pro-charter schools align the
calendars

01:24:41.270 --> 01:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
calendars
 
01:24:43.110 --> 01:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
and in manchester where you have four or
 
01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
five charter schools and
 
01:24:49.270 --> 01:24:49.280 align:start position:0%
i mean all over the place i mean yeah
 
01:24:51.510 --> 01:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's kind of hard to do that in
 
01:24:54.709 --> 01:24:54.719 align:start position:0%
impossible uh but yeah all the schools
 
01:24:56.950 --> 01:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
have to do and charter schools should
 
01:24:59.430 --> 01:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
hey align your calendars and you
 
01:25:01.590 --> 01:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
everybody's still got to go 180 days so
 
01:25:04.390 --> 01:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
make them the same and i don't see that
 
01:25:07.430 --> 01:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
big of a deal especially if it's in
 
01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
one school district we have a big no we
 
01:25:11.189 --> 01:25:11.199 align:start position:0%
have a big issue with cte because
 
01:25:12.709 --> 01:25:12.719 align:start position:0%
there's multiple school districts we're
 
01:25:14.950 --> 01:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
talking one school district allowing
 
01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
your calendar
 
01:25:17.669 --> 01:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:25:19.430 --> 01:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
when we're talking the cte program
 
01:25:20.629 --> 01:25:20.639 align:start position:0%
remember that
 
01:25:22.629 --> 01:25:22.639 align:start position:0%
if a student's
 
01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
from their home to the school they get
 
01:25:28.070 --> 01:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
themselves from the home to the school
 
01:25:30.390 --> 01:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
and then the ascending school provides
 
01:25:32.870 --> 01:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
that service down wherever your career
 
01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
tech center is or it may be in fact in
 
01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
the building then of course you wouldn't
 
01:25:39.430 --> 01:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
even have it that day then but uh
 
01:25:41.910 --> 01:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
yeah it's it's a requirement that and if
 
01:25:44.550 --> 01:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
the kids don't use that they're given x
 
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
numbers pennies
 
01:25:49.910 --> 01:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
per mile for a reimbursement
 
01:25:51.669 --> 01:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
uh for their transportation if they
 
01:25:51.679 --> 01:25:53.590 align:start position:0%
uh for their transportation if they
self-transport

01:25:53.590 --> 01:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
self-transport
 
01:25:55.510 --> 01:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
so represent like us
 
01:25:57.270 --> 01:25:57.280 align:start position:0%
i just wondered if as soon as this is
 
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
done i could inject an off topic that
 
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
had to do with the bill yesterday
 
01:26:05.590 --> 01:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
i talked to the cte last night i went to
 
01:26:07.030 --> 01:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
their open house
 
01:26:08.950 --> 01:26:08.960 align:start position:0%

01:26:10.470 --> 01:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
wanted you to know they said thank you
 
01:26:12.390 --> 01:26:12.400 align:start position:0%

01:26:14.629 --> 01:26:14.639 align:start position:0%

days was an awful lot 46 this year
 
01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
at alvirne cte which is regional cte 46
 
01:26:25.110 --> 01:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
days difference in the calendar
 
01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
so they said to tell all of you thank
 
01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
you very much that was the nature and
 
01:26:32.229 --> 01:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
reasoning for the for the bill and uh

02:01:21.270 --> 02:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
be kind um
 
02:01:24.390 --> 02:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
it can't be done i mean a two-week lapse
 
02:01:26.550 --> 02:01:26.560 align:start position:0%
in your district i mean
 
02:01:28.070 --> 02:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
even in the regular public school
 
02:01:29.910 --> 02:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
district it might take more than two
 
02:01:32.950 --> 02:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
weeks to find the right person for the
 
02:01:32.960 --> 02:01:34.229 align:start position:0%

to if you can't do it in two weeks we're
 
02:01:41.990 --> 02:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
going to do it that's just totally
 
02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:43.350 align:start position:0%
going to do it that's just totally
unreasonable

02:01:43.350 --> 02:01:43.360 align:start position:0%
unreasonable
 
02:01:45.030 --> 02:01:45.040 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:01:47.910 --> 02:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
that's why the itl it's
 
02:01:51.030 --> 02:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
and you know if if your public school
 
02:01:53.109 --> 02:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
which has the resources to find people
 
02:01:55.589 --> 02:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
can't find people and and the charter
 
02:01:59.430 --> 02:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
school might just find somebody you know
 
02:01:59.440 --> 02:02:00.709 align:start position:0%
school might just find somebody you know
completely

02:02:00.709 --> 02:02:00.719 align:start position:0%
completely
 
02:02:02.390 --> 02:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
out of district and
 
02:02:05.109 --> 02:02:05.119 align:start position:0%
cost million dollars more so
 
02:02:07.270 --> 02:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
it's unreasonable for it especially for
 
02:02:08.709 --> 02:02:08.719 align:start position:0%
two weeks
 
02:02:10.709 --> 02:02:10.719 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:02:12.070 --> 02:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
reps and hops and do you have anything
 
02:02:14.390 --> 02:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
to add nope i would agree with um what
 
02:02:16.390 --> 02:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
representative baum
 
02:02:17.589 --> 02:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
02:02:17.599 --> 02:02:18.790 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
cordelli

02:02:18.790 --> 02:02:18.800 align:start position:0%
cordelli
 
02:02:20.470 --> 02:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
yes thank you if i could just mention i
 
02:02:22.470 --> 02:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
think um it was in relation to this bill
 
02:02:24.149 --> 02:02:24.159 align:start position:0%
the subject of
 
02:02:27.510 --> 02:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
charter schools and lease came in uh to
 
02:02:27.520 --> 02:02:28.310 align:start position:0%
charter schools and lease came in uh to
play

02:02:28.310 --> 02:02:28.320 align:start position:0%
play
 
02:02:30.310 --> 02:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
and i checked with the national center
 
02:02:33.430 --> 02:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
for special education in charter schools
 
02:02:37.669 --> 02:02:37.679 align:start position:0%
and i think this was from 2017-18
 
02:02:39.990 --> 02:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
there were 27 states
 
02:02:41.109 --> 02:02:41.119 align:start position:0%
in which
 
02:02:43.189 --> 02:02:43.199 align:start position:0%
the charter school was part of an
 
02:02:43.199 --> 02:02:46.390 align:start position:0%
the charter school was part of an
e-l-e-a

02:02:46.390 --> 02:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:48.070 --> 02:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
just wanted to mention that and i'd like
 
02:02:50.790 --> 02:02:50.800 align:start position:0%
to just add that
 
02:02:53.910 --> 02:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
there's an extreme shortage of special
 
02:02:55.589 --> 02:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
education personnel in the state
 
02:02:57.830 --> 02:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
especially those that are occupational
 
02:02:59.589 --> 02:02:59.599 align:start position:0%
therapists physical therapists speech
 
02:02:59.599 --> 02:03:01.430 align:start position:0%
therapists physical therapists speech
pathologists

02:03:01.430 --> 02:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
pathologists
 
02:03:04.629 --> 02:03:04.639 align:start position:0%
and if you're a district that has a
 
02:03:06.790 --> 02:03:06.800 align:start position:0%
folks on board i can remember the school
 
02:03:08.870 --> 02:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
i had i had two speech pathologists in
 
02:03:10.790 --> 02:03:10.800 align:start position:0%
the school alone
 
02:03:13.270 --> 02:03:13.280 align:start position:0%
and that was just an elementary school
 
02:03:16.390 --> 02:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
so um but to find them today is very
 
02:03:18.390 --> 02:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
difficult and i can remember an
 
02:03:20.149 --> 02:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
experience i had with my own grandchild
 
02:03:21.910 --> 02:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
up in woodsville
 
02:03:23.510 --> 02:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
and we could not find a speech
 
02:03:26.149 --> 02:03:26.159 align:start position:0%
pathologist there and the speech
 
02:03:28.470 --> 02:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
pathologist eventually was a contracted
 
02:03:31.510 --> 02:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
service out of concord
 
02:03:34.149 --> 02:03:34.159 align:start position:0%
and and that took a lot longer than two
 
02:03:36.149 --> 02:03:36.159 align:start position:0%
weeks for this youngster it took about
 
02:03:38.470 --> 02:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
six weeks for everything to get in place
 
02:03:40.709 --> 02:03:40.719 align:start position:0%
and the district was honestly trying as
 
02:03:42.950 --> 02:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
best they could and i don't think if
 
02:03:44.950 --> 02:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
there were a charter school up there
 
02:03:46.229 --> 02:03:46.239 align:start position:0%
that um
 
02:03:48.550 --> 02:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
they'd find anybody there either
 
02:03:51.189 --> 02:03:51.199 align:start position:0%
it's these people are just very rare and
 
02:03:55.350 --> 02:03:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:57.270 --> 02:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
so any further discuss reference
 
02:03:57.280 --> 02:04:01.189 align:start position:0%
so any further discuss reference
woodcock

02:04:01.189 --> 02:04:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:03.189 --> 02:04:03.199 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you chairman
 
02:04:06.069 --> 02:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
um i think the other part that i find uh
 
02:04:07.510 --> 02:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
concerning about this besides is
 
02:04:08.950 --> 02:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
representative bowman said the two weeks
 
02:04:11.589 --> 02:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
is impossible in public school
 
02:04:14.149 --> 02:04:14.159 align:start position:0%
i find that that it's it's unfortunate
 
02:04:16.310 --> 02:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
that a particular school and the
 
02:04:18.709 --> 02:04:18.719 align:start position:0%
district district is set aside as they
 
02:04:20.629 --> 02:04:20.639 align:start position:0%
get all the special dispensation when it
 
02:04:22.390 --> 02:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
comes to special needs of the higher
 
02:04:24.390 --> 02:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
district if one school in the district
 
02:04:26.629 --> 02:04:26.639 align:start position:0%
if we can't find that specialist that's
 
02:04:28.069 --> 02:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
happening within the whole district and
 
02:04:29.910 --> 02:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
not just the one public charter school
 
02:04:31.510 --> 02:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
in our district and i find that
 
02:04:33.189 --> 02:04:33.199 align:start position:0%
relatively discriminatory and unfair as
 
02:04:33.199 --> 02:04:33.990 align:start position:0%
relatively discriminatory and unfair as
well

02:04:33.990 --> 02:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:04:35.510 --> 02:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:04:37.510 --> 02:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
that's a ricochet effect
 
02:04:41.350 --> 02:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
and it's it's very legitimate
 
02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:42.470 align:start position:0%
and it's it's very legitimate
uh

02:04:42.470 --> 02:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:04:44.950 --> 02:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
represent porter just just another aside
 
02:04:47.270 --> 02:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
on the topic mr chair and committee
 
02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:48.470 align:start position:0%
on the topic mr chair and committee
members

02:04:48.470 --> 02:04:48.480 align:start position:0%
members
 
02:04:50.950 --> 02:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
i was fortunate to be the chair of the
 
02:04:52.550 --> 02:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire commission on deafness and
 
02:04:55.589 --> 02:04:55.599 align:start position:0%
hearing loss for a while and one of um
 
02:04:56.950 --> 02:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
that's another area where there's a lot
 
02:04:59.189 --> 02:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
of shortages of of people to deal with
 
02:05:00.790 --> 02:05:00.800 align:start position:0%
children who have are deaf or hard of
 
02:05:00.800 --> 02:05:01.669 align:start position:0%
children who have are deaf or hard of
hearing

02:05:01.669 --> 02:05:01.679 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
02:05:04.870 --> 02:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
and we actually asked to have put in the
 
02:05:08.790 --> 02:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
budget funding for um
 
02:05:11.270 --> 02:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
a loan forgiveness program for
 
02:05:11.280 --> 02:05:12.390 align:start position:0%
a loan forgiveness program for
people

02:05:12.390 --> 02:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:05:14.149 --> 02:05:14.159 align:start position:0%
who would take up this kind of
 
02:05:16.069 --> 02:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
profession in new hampshire
 
02:05:17.910 --> 02:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
and one of the issues that we have with
 
02:05:19.910 --> 02:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
these people these kinds of professions
 
02:05:22.709 --> 02:05:22.719 align:start position:0%
here is that our pay scale is low
 
02:05:24.709 --> 02:05:24.719 align:start position:0%
so the a lot of the people that would
 
02:05:27.109 --> 02:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
come here are going to other states
 
02:05:29.669 --> 02:05:29.679 align:start position:0%
around because they get more money for
 
02:05:31.750 --> 02:05:31.760 align:start position:0%
doing that service so it's they don't
 
02:05:36.390 --> 02:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:37.830 --> 02:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
represent nelson did you have your hand
 
02:05:37.840 --> 02:05:39.189 align:start position:0%
represent nelson did you have your hand
up

02:05:39.189 --> 02:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:05:41.189 --> 02:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
yeah somebody ended up asking this and
 
02:05:43.030 --> 02:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
if it was a contracted service that had
 
02:05:45.510 --> 02:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
a mileage paid by mileage they could
 
02:05:48.629 --> 02:05:48.639 align:start position:0%
bring somebody in from berlin down to
 
02:05:52.310 --> 02:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
salem and you'd really be up to crete
 
02:05:54.629 --> 02:05:54.639 align:start position:0%
and just to take on to that if you get a
 
02:05:56.229 --> 02:05:56.239 align:start position:0%
contract or service out of concord up
 
02:05:58.550 --> 02:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
where you pay the transportation school
 
02:06:00.870 --> 02:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
district years ago they used to pay for
 
02:06:02.629 --> 02:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
that transportation
 
02:06:04.790 --> 02:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
that's been cut out
 
02:06:06.470 --> 02:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
it's no longer there for school
 
02:06:07.669 --> 02:06:07.679 align:start position:0%
districts so
 
02:06:10.069 --> 02:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to this that we we should
 
02:06:13.109 --> 02:06:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:15.830 --> 02:06:15.840 align:start position:0%

we've been in communication with the doe
 
02:14:09.669 --> 02:14:09.679 align:start position:0%
and they have asked us not to put this
 
02:14:12.229 --> 02:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
in law because it makes it harder for
 
02:14:14.470 --> 02:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
changes to be made and there are some
 
02:14:16.470 --> 02:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
changes that they're working on right
 
02:14:16.480 --> 02:14:17.510 align:start position:0%
changes that they're working on right
now

02:14:17.510 --> 02:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:14:19.109 --> 02:14:19.119 align:start position:0%
and if we
 
02:14:21.990 --> 02:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
codify this then it will you know be
 
02:14:23.510 --> 02:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
that much longer before they can make
 
02:14:25.030 --> 02:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
the changes so
 
02:14:28.470 --> 02:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:31.510 --> 02:14:31.520 align:start position:0%

like to go into this a little bit
 
02:14:33.840 --> 02:14:34.709 align:start position:0%
like to go into this a little bit
um

02:14:34.709 --> 02:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:36.470 --> 02:14:36.480 align:start position:0%

what is
 
02:14:39.990 --> 02:14:40.000 align:start position:0%

02:14:41.350 --> 02:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
initially put this together and
 
02:14:43.189 --> 02:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
represented leicester took it
 
02:14:46.229 --> 02:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
um addresses both the code of ethics and
 
02:14:48.550 --> 02:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
the code of conduct the code of ethics
 
02:14:51.030 --> 02:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
is aspirational
 
02:14:53.589 --> 02:14:53.599 align:start position:0%
and it's not the conduct it's not what
 
02:14:56.790 --> 02:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
you're doing it's not the action
 
02:14:59.589 --> 02:14:59.599 align:start position:0%
and this bill if we were to
 
02:15:00.870 --> 02:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
act on it
 
02:15:03.270 --> 02:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
we'd have to re-change that title of the
 
02:15:05.430 --> 02:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
bill so it's not code ethics it's the
 
02:15:07.990 --> 02:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
code of conduct which we're addressing
 
02:15:10.069 --> 02:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
but more importantly to me
 
02:15:12.629 --> 02:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
i i think there's another process in
 
02:15:12.639 --> 02:15:13.589 align:start position:0%
i i think there's another process in
which

02:15:13.589 --> 02:15:13.599 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:15:15.430 --> 02:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
we can address some of the issues
 
02:15:17.430 --> 02:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
dealing with this rather than having to
 
02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:19.109 align:start position:0%
dealing with this rather than having to
place

02:15:19.109 --> 02:15:19.119 align:start position:0%
place
 
02:15:21.510 --> 02:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
certain aspects of the code into
 
02:15:23.669 --> 02:15:23.679 align:start position:0%
statutory language
 
02:15:25.189 --> 02:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
and right now the department does have
 
02:15:27.669 --> 02:15:27.679 align:start position:0%
the authority to
 
02:15:29.430 --> 02:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
deal with this topic by way of what
 
02:15:32.870 --> 02:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
we've done previously in years past
 
02:15:32.880 --> 02:15:33.830 align:start position:0%
we've done previously in years past
i'm

02:15:33.830 --> 02:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
02:15:36.870 --> 02:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
proposing that we also as a committee
 
02:15:39.350 --> 02:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
forward a letter to the
 
02:15:41.350 --> 02:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
02:15:44.069 --> 02:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
which uh i've addressed that issue with
 
02:15:46.390 --> 02:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
the attorney from the department and i'd
 
02:15:48.310 --> 02:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
like to take a moment and read that
 
02:15:48.320 --> 02:15:49.510 align:start position:0%
like to take a moment and read that
letter

02:15:49.510 --> 02:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
letter
 
02:15:51.270 --> 02:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
and and if we're
 
02:15:53.350 --> 02:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
all good with that then we would you
 
02:15:55.430 --> 02:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
know you know sort of tie that in with
 
02:15:57.350 --> 02:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
this you know what we're going to do
 
02:16:00.950 --> 02:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
here is that we itl and ford are our
 
02:16:03.990 --> 02:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
concern to the department
 
02:16:07.350 --> 02:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
it goes on dear commissioner edelbloom
 
02:16:08.790 --> 02:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
following the submission and hearing of
 
02:16:11.750 --> 02:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
hv 1336 regarding the new hampshire code
 
02:16:13.430 --> 02:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
of ethics and the code of conduct for
 
02:16:15.189 --> 02:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
educational professionals
 
02:16:16.550 --> 02:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
i've been asked on behalf of the
 
02:16:18.149 --> 02:16:18.159 align:start position:0%
education committee to forward an
 
02:16:19.910 --> 02:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
additional option that may assist the
 
02:16:22.149 --> 02:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
department and state board when dealing
 
02:16:24.390 --> 02:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
with matters of professional educator
 
02:16:24.400 --> 02:16:25.750 align:start position:0%
with matters of professional educator
conduct

02:16:25.750 --> 02:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
conduct
 
02:16:29.030 --> 02:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
hb 1336 incorrectly referenced both the
 
02:16:31.430 --> 02:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
code of ethics and the code of conduct
 
02:16:33.349 --> 02:16:33.359 align:start position:0%
the committee recognizes that the code
 
02:16:36.230 --> 02:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
of ethics is aspirational and meaning
 
02:16:37.910 --> 02:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
while the code of conduct is directly
 
02:16:40.309 --> 02:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
associated with professional educator
 
02:16:40.319 --> 02:16:41.509 align:start position:0%
associated with professional educator
action

02:16:41.509 --> 02:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
action
 
02:16:44.469 --> 02:16:44.479 align:start position:0%
the intent of hb 1336 was strictly
 
02:16:46.469 --> 02:16:46.479 align:start position:0%
designed to address the code of conduct
 
02:16:49.270 --> 02:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
and to codify the terms of riverman
 
02:16:52.389 --> 02:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
suspension and revocation in statute it
 
02:16:54.070 --> 02:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
has been determined that by addressing
 
02:16:56.309 --> 02:16:56.319 align:start position:0%
like terminology directly in statute
 
02:16:58.709 --> 02:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
rather than making any modifications to
 
02:17:00.870 --> 02:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
quote of conduct through the rule-making
 
02:17:03.910 --> 02:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
process would be in error
 
02:17:05.750 --> 02:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
therefore rather than amending the code
 
02:17:07.509 --> 02:17:07.519 align:start position:0%
of conduct through legislation the
 
02:17:07.519 --> 02:17:08.629 align:start position:0%
of conduct through legislation the
committee

02:17:08.629 --> 02:17:08.639 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:17:08.639 --> 02:17:10.070 align:start position:0%
committee
opines

02:17:10.070 --> 02:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
opines
 
02:17:11.669 --> 02:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
some of that legal talk and our lawyer's
 
02:17:12.709 --> 02:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
not here
 
02:17:14.870 --> 02:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
that modification to the code can best
 
02:17:16.709 --> 02:17:16.719 align:start position:0%
be accomplished through the rule-making
 
02:17:16.719 --> 02:17:17.990 align:start position:0%
be accomplished through the rule-making
process

02:17:17.990 --> 02:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:17:20.150 --> 02:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
in addition to the three categories of
 
02:17:21.830 --> 02:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
action that may be administered for
 
02:17:24.150 --> 02:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
infractions of the code of conduct
 
02:17:26.389 --> 02:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
the education committee requests that
 
02:17:28.150 --> 02:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire board of education
 
02:17:30.469 --> 02:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
consider an option prior to
 
02:17:33.429 --> 02:17:33.439 align:start position:0%
administering reprimand suspension or
 
02:17:35.990 --> 02:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
revocation as an outcome
 
02:17:37.750 --> 02:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
in re-lettering the three options
 
02:17:39.509 --> 02:17:39.519 align:start position:0%
previously noted
 
02:17:42.389 --> 02:17:42.399 align:start position:0%
the one two and three i just mentioned
 
02:17:44.070 --> 02:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
the committee recommends that rule
 
02:17:46.629 --> 02:17:46.639 align:start position:0%
making process include a fourth category
 
02:17:49.349 --> 02:17:49.359 align:start position:0%
that would precede reprimand suspension
 
02:17:51.830 --> 02:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
or revocation the first option would
 
02:17:53.190 --> 02:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
then state
 
02:17:56.230 --> 02:17:56.240 align:start position:0%
a confidential letter of concern which
 
02:17:59.270 --> 02:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
shall mean a non-disciplinary non-public
 
02:18:03.190 --> 02:18:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:05.190 --> 02:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
or and then it's or and then we go up
 
02:18:07.589 --> 02:18:07.599 align:start position:0%
into the and then followed by reprimand
 
02:18:09.509 --> 02:18:09.519 align:start position:0%
suspension and revocation is currently
 
02:18:11.429 --> 02:18:11.439 align:start position:0%
in the code of conduct thank you for
 
02:18:13.030 --> 02:18:13.040 align:start position:0%

contact me if further information is
 
02:18:20.309 --> 02:18:20.319 align:start position:0%
necessary that's the letter which we i'd
 
02:18:22.309 --> 02:18:22.319 align:start position:0%
ask for support from the committee to
 
02:18:25.589 --> 02:18:25.599 align:start position:0%
forward if we go through with the itl uh
 
02:18:28.950 --> 02:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
as as proposed
 
02:18:31.030 --> 02:18:31.040 align:start position:0%

this takes us to the bottom of the list
 
02:20:24.960 --> 02:20:26.630 align:start position:0%
this takes us to the bottom of the list
which

02:20:26.630 --> 02:20:26.640 align:start position:0%

02:20:43.110 --> 02:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
we had 12 36 but i don't think that
 
02:20:45.590 --> 02:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
amendment is ready
 
02:20:47.429 --> 02:20:47.439 align:start position:0%
that deals with the legislative
 
02:20:49.030 --> 02:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
oversight committee for improvement and
 
02:20:49.040 --> 02:20:50.469 align:start position:0%
oversight committee for improvement and
assessment

02:20:50.469 --> 02:20:50.479 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
02:20:52.950 --> 02:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
i think that would once we get that
 
02:20:54.550 --> 02:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
designed i think that shouldn't be a
 
02:20:54.560 --> 02:20:56.950 align:start position:0%
designed i think that shouldn't be a
problem

02:20:56.950 --> 02:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:20:58.790 --> 02:20:58.800 align:start position:0%
is there anything else that we want do
 
02:21:01.510 --> 02:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
we want to discuss the efas today and
 
02:21:02.950 --> 02:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
try to
 
02:21:04.870 --> 02:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
what we're looking at what i'm looking
 
02:21:06.630 --> 02:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
at is we have a number of bills dealing
 
02:21:08.469 --> 02:21:08.479 align:start position:0%
with efa i'd like to
 
02:21:10.469 --> 02:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
do them all at one time we have some
 
02:21:12.309 --> 02:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
duplication we have some duplication
 
02:21:14.150 --> 02:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
also on the mass
 
02:21:15.190 --> 02:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
and to
 
02:21:17.349 --> 02:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
bring those together there's no sense
 
02:21:20.630 --> 02:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
acting separately on three or four bills
 
02:21:22.389 --> 02:21:22.399 align:start position:0%
when in fact
 
02:21:23.830 --> 02:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
we can probably
 
02:21:23.840 --> 02:21:25.190 align:start position:0%
we can probably
meld

02:21:25.190 --> 02:21:25.200 align:start position:0%
meld
 
02:21:26.630 --> 02:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
into one bill
 
02:21:28.790 --> 02:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
or or or
 
02:21:32.070 --> 02:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:34.870 --> 02:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
time that limited time we have and
 
02:21:36.710 --> 02:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
discuss them all at once rather than
 
02:21:38.870 --> 02:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
going through the same repetitive
 
02:21:41.830 --> 02:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
discussion over and over and over
 
02:21:45.030 --> 02:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
so i and and uh and so in addition to
 
02:21:47.830 --> 02:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
the efas and those those you know
 
02:21:50.150 --> 02:21:50.160 align:start position:0%
intertangled related
 
02:21:51.510 --> 02:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
bills and the three i think we're
 
02:21:53.590 --> 02:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
looking at are 1355
 
02:21:57.110 --> 02:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
1672 and 1669. yes
 
02:21:59.990 --> 02:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
i think we have similar uh interrelated
 
02:22:03.030 --> 02:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
bills where where it um where they apply
 
02:22:05.830 --> 02:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
to co-op school districts yes and then
 
02:22:05.840 --> 02:22:07.030 align:start position:0%
to co-op school districts yes and then
masks

02:22:07.030 --> 02:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
masks
 
02:22:09.990 --> 02:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
and um and maybe what uh maybe what we
 
02:22:12.790 --> 02:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
could do is um is go through our
 
02:22:15.429 --> 02:22:15.439 align:start position:0%
remaining bills and try to i mean like
 
02:22:17.750 --> 02:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
we can work together on on
 
02:22:17.760 --> 02:22:18.469 align:start position:0%
we can work together on on
yeah

02:22:18.469 --> 02:22:18.479 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:22:20.230 --> 02:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
we'd spoken last night i believe in
 
02:22:22.550 --> 02:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
about the cooperative schools districts
 
02:22:22.560 --> 02:22:23.349 align:start position:0%
about the cooperative schools districts
uh

02:22:23.349 --> 02:22:23.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:22:25.590 --> 02:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
that you know is no sense doing those as
 
02:22:27.510 --> 02:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
individual on different days
 
02:22:30.710 --> 02:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
let's get let's hit it and and you know
 
02:22:32.710 --> 02:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
if you want to nuke the whole program
 
02:22:34.550 --> 02:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
like the person sitting beside me that's
 
02:22:36.950 --> 02:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
fine but uh let's talk about that all at
 
02:22:38.389 --> 02:22:38.399 align:start position:0%
one time
 
02:22:40.630 --> 02:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
and i and i really like um mr i really
 
02:22:42.469 --> 02:22:42.479 align:start position:0%
like the approach that you're you're
 
02:22:45.110 --> 02:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
taking where we can discuss all three
 
02:22:48.309 --> 02:22:48.319 align:start position:0%
and then exec them separately following
 
02:22:50.230 --> 02:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
discussion yes and there may be an
 
02:22:52.950 --> 02:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
amendment prepared between discussion
 
02:22:54.630 --> 02:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
and exec yeah
 
02:22:56.230 --> 02:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
it will certainly be a time saver if
 
02:22:57.750 --> 02:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
there's four bills and we can figure
 
02:22:59.030 --> 02:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
well here's the three we're going to get
 
02:23:00.790 --> 02:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
rid of and we're going to go you know
 
02:23:02.469 --> 02:23:02.479 align:start position:0%
and we'll have to come to agreement
 
02:23:04.790 --> 02:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
and we're never all going to agree
 
02:23:06.230 --> 02:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
as we i think we've even seen a little
 
02:23:09.349 --> 02:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
bit today on certain topics it's it's
 
02:23:12.630 --> 02:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
it's just just the way it is in america
 
02:23:12.640 --> 02:23:14.950 align:start position:0%
it's just just the way it is in america
so

02:23:14.950 --> 02:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:17.270 --> 02:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
yeah and and you know from from today as
 
02:23:18.550 --> 02:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
well rick
 
02:23:20.469 --> 02:23:20.479 align:start position:0%
um i like the fact that we got we got
 
02:23:22.950 --> 02:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
some split votes on on both sides
 
02:23:25.750 --> 02:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
because i think that that shows that uh
 
02:23:28.070 --> 02:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
you know we're all um you know bringing
 
02:23:30.230 --> 02:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
our own sort of experience and
 
02:23:33.270 --> 02:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
representing our constituents um well so
 
02:23:35.990 --> 02:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to um you know
 
02:23:39.349 --> 02:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
extend my thanks to uh to you know both
 
02:23:42.150 --> 02:23:42.160 align:start position:0%
ends of the room here in uh in doing
 
02:23:42.160 --> 02:23:43.190 align:start position:0%
ends of the room here in uh in doing
that

02:23:43.190 --> 02:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:23:43.200 --> 02:23:43.990 align:start position:0%
that
so

02:23:43.990 --> 02:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:23:47.510 --> 02:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
my parting words would be that now that
 
02:23:49.830 --> 02:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
we will try to get a flow chart out to
 
02:23:52.230 --> 02:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
you with all the updated information
 
02:23:54.950 --> 02:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
what we have done or haven't done
 
02:23:56.950 --> 02:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
and we know that we have x number of
 
02:23:59.510 --> 02:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
days left approximately seven days
 
02:24:01.590 --> 02:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
excluding that week of the 28th which we
 
02:24:03.030 --> 02:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
want to take off
 
02:24:04.550 --> 02:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
so there's going to be four days that
 
02:24:06.070 --> 02:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
following week and we have about you
 
02:24:08.790 --> 02:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
know well we know we have the
 
02:24:10.870 --> 02:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
well i think the 15th take we have some
 
02:24:13.270 --> 02:24:13.280 align:start position:0%
bills that we're doing on hearing there
 
02:24:16.150 --> 02:24:16.160 align:start position:0%
we took from the fourth
 
02:24:17.670 --> 02:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
and looking at this schedule what we
 
02:24:19.590 --> 02:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
have left there we may have about six
 
02:24:21.670 --> 02:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
days left which are available for
 
02:24:23.910 --> 02:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
exactly i think we can do it
 
02:24:26.309 --> 02:24:26.319 align:start position:0%
and we should be able to do it
 
02:24:28.389 --> 02:24:28.399 align:start position:0%
if we just you know
 
02:24:31.270 --> 02:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
all don't try to say something over and
 
02:24:35.190 --> 02:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:36.790 --> 02:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
i'm not looking at you represent the
 
02:24:36.800 --> 02:24:41.030 align:start position:0%
i'm not looking at you represent the
woodcock

02:24:41.030 --> 02:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:42.870 --> 02:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at rips and like us over
 
02:24:42.880 --> 02:24:46.309 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at rips and like us over
here

02:24:46.309 --> 02:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:48.710 --> 02:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
well i can always hear him so you don't
 
02:24:50.870 --> 02:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
ever have to worry about that
 
02:24:50.880 --> 02:24:51.590 align:start position:0%
ever have to worry about that
so

02:24:51.590 --> 02:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:24:53.830 --> 02:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
but you know look these bills over
 
02:24:55.349 --> 02:24:55.359 align:start position:0%
because we're going to come down to the
 
02:24:57.429 --> 02:24:57.439 align:start position:0%
point where we're going to have to delve
 
02:24:59.110 --> 02:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
into everything
 
02:25:00.790 --> 02:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
and it shouldn't come as a great shock
 
02:25:02.309 --> 02:25:02.319 align:start position:0%
that we're doing it
 
02:25:04.469 --> 02:25:04.479 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to do it and so the
 
02:25:06.550 --> 02:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
time is limited
 
02:25:09.110 --> 02:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
so be looking at the efa bills to be
 
02:25:11.190 --> 02:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
looking at the co-op bills be looking at
 
02:25:13.110 --> 02:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
the masking bills
 
02:25:15.510 --> 02:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
there's some other bills but those are
 
02:25:17.670 --> 02:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
ones which i will communicate with
 
02:25:19.910 --> 02:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
represent lunon will try to work out but
 
02:25:21.429 --> 02:25:21.439 align:start position:0%
those other bills
 
02:25:23.030 --> 02:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
advise right now
 
02:25:24.710 --> 02:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
look at them because we could be taking
 
02:25:27.110 --> 02:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
them up pretty much so
 
02:25:29.030 --> 02:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
can i are you okay with me asking you a
 
02:25:31.590 --> 02:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
question about this chairman yeah
 
02:25:34.230 --> 02:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
so the masking bills yesterday we talked
 
02:25:35.830 --> 02:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
a little bit about whether or not the
 
02:25:39.349 --> 02:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
25th was going to be a date that we used
 
02:25:39.359 --> 02:25:40.230 align:start position:0%
25th was going to be a date that we used
to

02:25:40.230 --> 02:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:25:40.240 --> 02:25:41.429 align:start position:0%
to
hear

02:25:41.429 --> 02:25:41.439 align:start position:0%
hear
 
02:25:43.270 --> 02:25:43.280 align:start position:0%
whatever the numbers yes we had two
 
02:25:46.150 --> 02:25:46.160 align:start position:0%
bills just recall that we had postponed
 
02:25:49.510 --> 02:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
right seating right so would we be doing
 
02:25:53.270 --> 02:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
all of the masking bills on that day
 
02:25:54.389 --> 02:25:54.399 align:start position:0%
how would we
 
02:25:58.070 --> 02:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
i is that the 25th or the 15th
 
02:26:00.150 --> 02:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
no it's the 25th it's the 25th it's
 
02:26:02.630 --> 02:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
friday the 25th that's the day that the
 
02:26:06.070 --> 02:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
fourth bills were taken
 
02:26:07.110 --> 02:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
02:26:07.120 --> 02:26:08.389 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
so

02:26:08.389 --> 02:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:26:10.070 --> 02:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
if there's time
 
02:26:12.150 --> 02:26:12.160 align:start position:0%
we can't be messing around a whole lot
 
02:26:14.070 --> 02:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
so we may take some of the other efa
 
02:26:16.309 --> 02:26:16.319 align:start position:0%
bills of the mass bills up on that on
 
02:26:18.469 --> 02:26:18.479 align:start position:0%
that date we're on that topic
 
02:26:20.389 --> 02:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
right yeah i just want to be prepared
 
02:26:23.270 --> 02:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah be prepared okay all right i'm
 
02:26:25.910 --> 02:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
saying be prepared on the masking on the
 
02:26:29.510 --> 02:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
efas and the co-op districts yep uh
 
02:26:32.150 --> 02:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
bills those are bills which you know if
 
02:26:33.750 --> 02:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
we get some moments of course we're
 
02:26:35.910 --> 02:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
going to need more time to discuss all
 
02:26:38.070 --> 02:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
those bills at one time but if we have a
 
02:26:40.309 --> 02:26:40.319 align:start position:0%
day dedicated to that like we do on the
 
02:26:40.319 --> 02:26:41.830 align:start position:0%
day dedicated to that like we do on the
25th

02:26:41.830 --> 02:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
25th
 
02:26:43.429 --> 02:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
that would be a good day to take up the
 
02:26:45.830 --> 02:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
other masking stuff
