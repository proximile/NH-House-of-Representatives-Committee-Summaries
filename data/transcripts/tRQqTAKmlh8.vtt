representing 15 communities large part
 
00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:10.280 align:start position:0%
of Grafton County Sullivan County and

of New London so it's it's great to be
 
00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
here today thank you for taking the time
 
00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:19.479 align:start position:0%
to talk with me about Senate Bill
 
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
185 so I'm introducing this to establish
 
00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
the study committee um to look at the
 
00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:27.479 align:start position:0%
various barri barriers to dis discharge
 
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
of patients um really to Safe
 
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
environments including you know from
 
00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:34.639 align:start position:0%
acute care facilities and these
 
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280 align:start position:0%
environments could be home environments
 
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
they could be Continuing Care
 
00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:40.039 align:start position:0%
environments and we'll get into that a
 
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
little bit further and that's why you
 
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
have the purpose of a a study committee
 
00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:46.759 align:start position:0%
before you so this started well over a
 
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 align:start position:0%
year ago and in conversations with the
 
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Hospital Association I
 
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
became aware that there's a growing
 
00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:56.479 align:start position:0%
population of inpatients in hospital
 
00:06:59.230 --> 00:06:59.240 align:start position:0%
beds and acute care hospital beds that
 
00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
don't need to be in those beds but are
 
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
in them because they don't have any safe
 
00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
place to be discharged to and so I'd
 
00:07:09.309 --> 00:07:09.319 align:start position:0%
heard that this was a Statewide issue um
 
00:07:11.309 --> 00:07:11.319 align:start position:0%
and I talk to the hospitals within my
 
00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
district which there are three of them
 
00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:15.319 align:start position:0%
and confirmed that indeed they have
 
00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
patients who are in beds that other
 
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
patients need and could occupy but they
 
00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:23.080 align:start position:0%
don't have a place for them to go for
 
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
various reasons um hence again the study
 
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:29.240 align:start position:0%
committee every case is different this
 
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
ISS is most impactful um on the adult
 
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
that's actually waiting to go to either
 
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
go to a safe home location or to another
 
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
facility that isolated world that they
 
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
are in in that acute care bed starts to
 
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
um starts to close in on them and they
 
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
actually I've heard um I've heard
 
00:07:54.309 --> 00:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
numerous stories of of dwindling or
 
00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:56.120 align:start position:0%
declining because of the atmosphere that
 
00:07:58.350 --> 00:07:58.360 align:start position:0%
they're in and the closest folks that
 
00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:00.639 align:start position:0%
they come to at that point are actually
 
00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
staff become like family members
 
00:08:05.189 --> 00:08:05.199 align:start position:0%
celebrating birthdays and holidays there
 
00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
are patients that have been in these
 
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
acute care beds for upwards of a 100
 
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
plus days or more and I gather from some
 
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
folks that are here to testify behind me
 
00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:17.000 align:start position:0%
you'll hear some of those exact
 
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
statistics from their acute care
 
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
hospital so in 2022 the New Hampshire
 
00:08:24.309 --> 00:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
Hospital associ Association did publish
 
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
a report on barriers to discharge this
 
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
report highlights patients AC across the
 
00:08:31.749 --> 00:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
state that remain in these acute care
 
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
hospital beds when they no longer need
 
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
acute inpatient care the patients remain
 
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
in the hospital again not because they
 
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
need they don't have a need to leave
 
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:43.320 align:start position:0%
they need to stay there but because
 
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
there's a barrier to discharge they
 
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:47.480 align:start position:0%
range from lack of available supports in
 
00:08:49.389 --> 00:08:49.399 align:start position:0%
the community including within their
 
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:52.240 align:start position:0%
home to insufficient long-term care beds
 
00:08:54.389 --> 00:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
to legal barriers that may exist so
 
00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
there's not one particular solution and
 
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
every case has been different different
 
00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
that we've talked about in other words
 
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
these are again not medically necessary
 
00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
that they occupy these beds but they
 
00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
remain there because there's sadly no
 
00:09:12.829 --> 00:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
place for them to go so in the early
 
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
days of this this was a bill that was
 
00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
retained and we came back to work on it
 
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
again um this year uh we gathered
 
00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519 align:start position:0%
stakeholders from from hospitals
 
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:26.440 align:start position:0%
to from hospitals to disability rights
 
00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:30.079 align:start position:0%
to AARP to um adult protection Services
 
00:09:32.829 --> 00:09:32.839 align:start position:0%
we brought in people from all all
 
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
different um walks that take care of or
 
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
their purpose they have some crossover
 
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
into this area of you know adult care
 
00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:44.200 align:start position:0%
and we couldn't come to a consensus
 
00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:46.160 align:start position:0%
because there were there were different
 
00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
situations and each situation
 
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:51.160 align:start position:0%
required a potentially different
 
00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
solution and some of them may be legal
 
00:09:57.949 --> 00:09:57.959 align:start position:0%
in nature um so with that um I was
 
00:09:59.910 --> 00:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
fortunate enough that senator Carson
 
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
stepped forward and tried to assist me
 
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
with this and said why don't we move
 
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
ourselves into a steady committee mode
 
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:09.720 align:start position:0%
and really drill down on you know
 
00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
considering that we have a report that
 
00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
gives us what the barriers are but
 
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:15.720 align:start position:0%
looking at each of those what are the
 
00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.750 align:start position:0%
looking at each of those what are the
real

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
real
 
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
solutions um that we can bring forward
 
00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
we can all agree on and that we can act
 
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
in inact so most importantly those
 
00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:26.680 align:start position:0%
patients or those those those
 
00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
individuals who are sitting in those
 
00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
hospital beds that don't need to be
 
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
there have a place that they can go
 
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
their life is not a hospital room they
 
00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
can emerge back into the community in a
 
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
setting that fits them that's most
 
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
important the second piece backing that
 
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:44.920 align:start position:0%
up is acute care hospital beds can be
 
00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:47.560 align:start position:0%
fewer far between and we need to make
 
00:10:50.350 --> 00:10:50.360 align:start position:0%
those free um when we can so that
 
00:10:52.509 --> 00:10:52.519 align:start position:0%
patients are not waiting in emergency
 
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
departments for beds are being
 
00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:56.680 align:start position:0%
transferred to other facilities and know
 
00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
by the way there might not be an
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
ambulance available for that in facility
 
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:01.240 align:start position:0%
transfer because our you know our
 
00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
healthare system is facing all of these
 
00:11:06.509 --> 00:11:06.519 align:start position:0%
different challenges so with that said
 
00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:09.560 align:start position:0%
I'll wrap up we and just again I'm
 
00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
thankful for the opportunity to talk to
 
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:14.200 align:start position:0%
you about this we have a good idea of
 
00:11:16.269 --> 00:11:16.279 align:start position:0%
what the barriers are we can agree on a
 
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
solution Senator Carson was wonderful in
 
00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
collaborating with me on building a
 
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
study committee so we could really drill
 
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
down and get these stakeholders to a
 
00:11:27.710 --> 00:11:27.720 align:start position:0%
place where um we can have solutions for
 
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
these individuals who will know longer
 
00:11:32.829 --> 00:11:32.839 align:start position:0%
need to be you know living at um at one
 
00:11:34.389 --> 00:11:34.399 align:start position:0%
Medical Center Drive potentially in
 
00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
Lebanon or whatever an address might be
 
00:11:37.949 --> 00:11:37.959 align:start position:0%
but back in their Community thank you
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
chair Lin and members of the Community
 
00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
Committee I'd be happy to take any
 
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
questions you might have and if I don't
 
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
have an answer and I do have another
 
00:11:45.629 --> 00:11:45.639 align:start position:0%
bill I have to go introduce and we have
 
00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:47.480 align:start position:0%
Representatives here from the hospital
 
00:11:50.069 --> 00:11:50.079 align:start position:0%
Association and St Joseph's hospital and
 
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:58.710 --> 00:11:58.720 align:start position:0%
you thank you for thank you for taking
 
00:12:00.509 --> 00:12:00.519 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:12:02.509 --> 00:12:02.519 align:start position:0%
I was a nurse for 42 years most of that
 
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
in intensive care I understand exactly
 
00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:08.279 align:start position:0%
what you mean um but um having
 
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
personally run into a thing safety is a
 
00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
huge issue yeah um that's the I tell
 
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
people use the safety where they're not
 
00:12:20.269 --> 00:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
safe coming home you know but do you f
 
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
my husband was uh in the hospital and I
 
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
tried to get him into an acute care
 
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:29.240 align:start position:0%
Medicare was my obstacle did you find in
 
00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
any of your research that Medicare ended
 
00:12:33.189 --> 00:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
up being an obstacle we ended up paying
 
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
for ourselves out of pocket for him to
 
00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:37.519 align:start position:0%
go to acute care but then I fought the
 
00:12:40.189 --> 00:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
insurance company and won after two
 
00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
years but Medicare was was a a problem
 
00:12:45.629 --> 00:12:45.639 align:start position:0%
with this and then the other thing that
 
00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
I found in working for years
 
00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
was families don't want them to leave
 
00:12:55.189 --> 00:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
the hospital because once they leave the
 
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
hospital somebody's going to be
 
00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
responsible for that bill
 
00:13:02.269 --> 00:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
but until they leave the
 
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
hospital the bill is ongoing and
 
00:13:07.629 --> 00:13:07.639 align:start position:0%
nobody's responsible Tech I don't that's
 
00:13:09.629 --> 00:13:09.639 align:start position:0%
not the right word but nobody's nobody's
 
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
paying the bill right then and there so
 
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
those were two different things that I
 
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
wondered that when you form this
 
00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:17.839 align:start position:0%
committee hopefully that you will look
 
00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
at because it's not just no place to go
 
00:13:25.069 --> 00:13:25.079 align:start position:0%
there are other entities that seem to um
 
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
get in the way so so representative PR
 
00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question and
 
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
financial barriers are indeed part of
 
00:13:34.269 --> 00:13:34.279 align:start position:0%
the discussion I actually heard more
 
00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
about the Medicaid component of this
 
00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
than the Medicare component of this so I
 
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:41.480 align:start position:0%
will leave that to um some of the
 
00:13:43.509 --> 00:13:43.519 align:start position:0%
experts that I have um that we're
 
00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:45.160 align:start position:0%
fortunate enough to have with us but
 
00:13:47.829 --> 00:13:47.839 align:start position:0%
certainly that that's part of it and if
 
00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
you can't if if I may if you can't say
 
00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
if you
 
00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
don't have say family members or legal
 
00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
guardians or someone who's responsible
 
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
foray paperwork I don't think legal
 
00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:01.720 align:start position:0%
guardian is the appropriate term for me
 
00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:04.120 align:start position:0%
to use here and we can't get them
 
00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:06.680 align:start position:0%
engaged to even enroll them in one of
 
00:14:09.629 --> 00:14:09.639 align:start position:0%
these programs that's a barrier as well
 
00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
I mean it is like literally being on an
 
00:14:14.269 --> 00:14:14.279 align:start position:0%
island for so many of these folks so
 
00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
services in the Community Financial
 
00:14:19.629 --> 00:14:19.639 align:start position:0%
barriers they're all intertwined in this
 
00:14:19.639 --> 00:14:22.310 align:start position:0%
barriers they're all intertwined in this
thank

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:24.240 align:start position:0%
you thank
 
00:14:26.749 --> 00:14:26.759 align:start position:0%
you good morning it's wonderful to have
 
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
I don't think anyone will
 
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
question the need to resolve a serious
 
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
problem my question to you is what makes
 
00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.670 align:start position:0%
problem my question to you is what makes
you

00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
legislators are going to be able to
 
00:15:00.069 --> 00:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
solve this problem
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
if all of the work with those who are
 
00:15:08.189 --> 00:15:08.199 align:start position:0%
directly involved has not resulted in a
 
00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
solution thank you for the question
 
00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
representative Smith and it is see good
 
00:15:15.629 --> 00:15:15.639 align:start position:0%
to see you this morning U there's been
 
00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:18.959 align:start position:0%
time that's laped since we first engaged
 
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and tried to develop
 
00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
Solutions and with that time we've
 
00:15:29.189 --> 00:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
gained um some some more Advocates and
 
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
interest not just in the legislature but
 
00:15:33.949 --> 00:15:33.959 align:start position:0%
within the communities but at a certain
 
00:15:36.389 --> 00:15:36.399 align:start position:0%
point I had to put this on you know we
 
00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
basically held it to the side and after
 
00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:41.560 align:start position:0%
it started to sit over here those
 
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
including again hospitals and Advocates
 
00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:47.240 align:start position:0%
who were not in the initial discussions
 
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
started to come forward um Senators as
 
00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
well as Representatives started to be
 
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
contacted by their local hospitals or
 
00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:57.240 align:start position:0%
within their districts whatever area
 
00:15:59.910 --> 00:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
they're covering and they were like why
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
aren't we moving forward with this how
 
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
can we help you
 
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
so in response to your question it is my
 
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
sincere hope now that this we have put a
 
00:16:11.069 --> 00:16:11.079 align:start position:0%
light on this and elevated the issue
 
00:16:12.829 --> 00:16:12.839 align:start position:0%
that we can get better commitments at
 
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
the table to solve the problem or folks
 
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
will continue to sit where they
 
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:25.110 --> 00:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
questions yeah thank thanks and and
 
00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
thanks senator for um taking the
 
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
question um I guess my one concern ER
 
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
and maybe it's a practical thing I'm I'm
 
00:16:32.069 --> 00:16:32.079 align:start position:0%
guessing it's a practical thing is the
 
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
end date for for this um of November 1st
 
00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:39.160 align:start position:0%
2024 it seems like a lot to accomplish
 
00:16:42.269 --> 00:16:42.279 align:start position:0%
in a very short period of time um I
 
00:16:43.389 --> 00:16:43.399 align:start position:0%
don't know if that's because we're in
 
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
our second year of our of our cycle and
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
that's sort of a practical limitation
 
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
but um I was wondering about about
 
00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
whether or not that would provide enough
 
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
time to actually achieve what this sort
 
00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:58.360 align:start position:0%
of intends to tackle which is very large
 
00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:00.279 align:start position:0%
it it thank you representative turn for
 
00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:02.440 align:start position:0%
your question it is very large and it it
 
00:17:04.829 --> 00:17:04.839 align:start position:0%
is so half of this is the fact that we
 
00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:07.480 align:start position:0%
are in the second year but I actually
 
00:17:09.829 --> 00:17:09.839 align:start position:0%
think we need to leave the date and we
 
00:17:12.189 --> 00:17:12.199 align:start position:0%
need to and I know it sounds aggressive
 
00:17:15.789 --> 00:17:15.799 align:start position:0%
but the accelerated timeline is where I
 
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
think you know now that we have the
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
light on the issue we have people that
 
00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:21.640 align:start position:0%
are really willing to engage in this by
 
00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
keeping this timeline in place there's
 
00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
nothing better in my experience than a
 
00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
deadline that has to be
 
00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.909 align:start position:0%
deadline that has to be
met

00:17:30.909 --> 00:17:30.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
report also as a as a practical matter
 
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't having this this committee's
 
00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:38.600 align:start position:0%
report will come after um or during the
 
00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:40.640 align:start position:0%
filing window in the in the two bodies
 
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
so this um this allows uh the sponsors
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
of this bill first all encourage them to
 
00:17:47.190 --> 00:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
be a bipartisan group but doesn't this
 
00:17:49.950 --> 00:17:49.960 align:start position:0%
also give them just a few extra weeks to
 
00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
work it up before we can before the next
 
00:17:56.149 --> 00:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
legislator convenes in January
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
2025 so thank you represent organ is
 
00:18:00.909 --> 00:18:00.919 align:start position:0%
your question that our window would be
 
00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
small between the time my question is it
 
00:18:04.510 --> 00:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
kind of gives you a little bit more time
 
00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:06.200 align:start position:0%
before the filing deadline so they don't
 
00:18:08.669 --> 00:18:08.679 align:start position:0%
have the a bill that's introduced by
 
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
this study committee has a looser filing
 
00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:13.919 align:start position:0%
deadline than just than one that was
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
just by introduced by one or more
 
00:18:17.909 --> 00:18:17.919 align:start position:0%
legislators acting on their own is that
 
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
senator for uh presenting this to us
 
00:18:31.029 --> 00:18:31.039 align:start position:0%
this morning in your previous uh
 
00:18:33.669 --> 00:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
research or study that you've done were
 
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
the County Nursing Home representatives
 
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
from the County nursing homes a part of
 
00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
the discussion and uh and if not perhaps
 
00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
going forward the County nursing homes
 
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
may present a at least a temporary
 
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
solution uh at least getting them in on
 
00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:50.200 align:start position:0%
the dialogue is has that been the case
 
00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
in the past thank you representative gon
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
and through the uh Bureau of elderly and
 
00:18:59.149 --> 00:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
Adult Services as well as a AARP there
 
00:19:00.669 --> 00:19:00.679 align:start position:0%
were some connections made to County
 
00:19:03.149 --> 00:19:03.159 align:start position:0%
nursing homes because they definitely
 
00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:07.400 align:start position:0%
have a stake in this so um they are U
 
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
they have been and we would obviously
 
00:19:11.149 --> 00:19:11.159 align:start position:0%
encourage them to be involved I think um
 
00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:12.200 align:start position:0%
I think what I know is one of my
 
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
experiences been with study committees
 
00:19:16.029 --> 00:19:16.039 align:start position:0%
is it does give you the flexibility even
 
00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
though it's built of legisl legislators
 
00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
you can decide um you know as a make
 
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
basically draw consensus on who you want
 
00:19:26.029 --> 00:19:26.039 align:start position:0%
to talk to and make sure that they are
 
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
in the room uh for you know what ever
 
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
points in times as well as the entire
 
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
Committee hearing committee the entire
 
00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
time the committee meets so yes on the
 
00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:36.919 align:start position:0%
counties welcome them back we'll
 
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
continue to start with this Core group
 
00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:40.760 align:start position:0%
and make sure that's appropriately
 
00:19:43.950 --> 00:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
expanded for involvement thank
 
00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:49.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question Senator do we have u
 
00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:52.559 align:start position:0%
a numbers of how serious this problem is
 
00:19:54.669 --> 00:19:54.679 align:start position:0%
and stacked up patients in the state of
 
00:19:54.679 --> 00:19:56.350 align:start position:0%
and stacked up patients in the state of
New

00:19:56.350 --> 00:19:56.360 align:start position:0%
New
 
00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire good to see you representative
 
00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:01.799 align:start position:0%
state I miss Claremont um so the
 
00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:03.320 align:start position:0%
hospital Association will be able to
 
00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:05.320 align:start position:0%
give you the best number but there was a
 
00:20:08.029 --> 00:20:08.039 align:start position:0%
point where one of the towers at
 
00:20:10.990 --> 00:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock had 150 patients
 
00:20:13.149 --> 00:20:13.159 align:start position:0%
that needed this was within the last two
 
00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:16.360 align:start position:0%
years um that needed placement and had
 
00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I'm going to show
 
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
my ignorance on healthc care because uh
 
00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
you using a term that I don't recognize
 
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:39.789 --> 00:20:39.799 align:start position:0%
for um I don't know what an an acute
 
00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:44.360 align:start position:0%
care facility is oh a hospital so um a
 
00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
hospital so you have 26 acute care
 
00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
facilities in the state hospitals are
 
00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
considered acute care and some of them
 
00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:52.280 align:start position:0%
are also designated as critical access
 
00:20:54.909 --> 00:20:54.919 align:start position:0%
hospitals so I'm talking about Parkland
 
00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
Medical Center I'm talking about
 
00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock Dartmouth health I'm
 
00:21:00.669 --> 00:21:00.679 align:start position:0%
talking talk about the Elliott hospital
 
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
all right which now it makes sense that
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh oh followup and U now it makes sense
 
00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
that representative gon ask about the uh
 
00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
uh the County nursing homes because
 
00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
they're obviously not acute care
 
00:21:15.909 --> 00:21:15.919 align:start position:0%
facilities no they're typically skilled
 
00:21:19.390 --> 00:21:19.400 align:start position:0%
nursing beds and um they this is this
 
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
may be depending on the nature a place
 
00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
for that particular individual to go all
 
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
right thank you very much you're
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question my
 
00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
question is okay we have the New
 
00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:38.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Hospital Association a and all
 
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
these other groups why haven't they
 
00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
formed a core group and come up with a
 
00:21:45.549 --> 00:21:45.559 align:start position:0%
solution over the years so
 
00:21:46.669 --> 00:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for the
 
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
question and I am going to have to leave
 
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
but what I am going to say they're
 
00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
waiting for me in HHS what I'm going to
 
00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:53.320 align:start position:0%
tell you is that we got those folks to
 
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
the table and we could not come early on
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
to a consensus because the problem was
 
00:22:02.149 --> 00:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
not as well understood as it is now so
 
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
and they were all there uh but it just
 
00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:08.360 align:start position:0%
we couldn't come to a consensus time has
 
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
lapsed interest has built acute
 
00:22:14.909 --> 00:22:14.919 align:start position:0%
hospitals have spoken up um advocates
 
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
for families and patients have spoken up
 
00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
so we're just in a different place now
 
00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:21.320 align:start position:0%
thank you and and I do hate to cut it
 
00:22:23.669 --> 00:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
short but they are waiting for me that's
 
00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:26.200 align:start position:0%
okay and I thank you very much I have
 
00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
really enjoyed the back and forth thank
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
you all right next I'm going to call on
 
00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
please good morning morning welcome uh U
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
representative hacken Phillips from
 
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
Grafton 12 which is the towns of hover
 
00:22:50.029 --> 00:22:50.039 align:start position:0%
and lime and uh Senator Apprentice is
 
00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:52.360 align:start position:0%
the actual expert on the topic um but I
 
00:22:53.909 --> 00:22:53.919 align:start position:0%
did want to come today as a co-sponsor
 
00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
and express my support for the bill as
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
amended by the senate for three
 
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
particular reasons one um you know I
 
00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
think this is a life and death issue we
 
00:23:05.950 --> 00:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
should all recognize that every bed that
 
00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
is not turned over on a timely basis in
 
00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:11.000 align:start position:0%
a tertiary care system means that
 
00:23:12.549 --> 00:23:12.559 align:start position:0%
someone who has potentially a
 
00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
lifethreatening issue cannot be
 
00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:17.320 align:start position:0%
addressed at that hospital they cannot
 
00:23:18.789 --> 00:23:18.799 align:start position:0%
receive the care that they need in the
 
00:23:20.669 --> 00:23:20.679 align:start position:0%
moment and they're pushed further
 
00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
outside the envelope of the service area
 
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
of our state um into other um service
 
00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
areas to address their needs and that
 
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:30.440 align:start position:0%
you know 5 10 minutes difference can be
 
00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
a huge huge life and death matter so I
 
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
just really want to reiterate the
 
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
urgency of the issue second is that um
 
00:23:42.269 --> 00:23:42.279 align:start position:0%
this is really a business viability
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
issue for our state tertiary Hospital
 
00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
Systems who are already meeting several
 
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
challenges um postco recovery and U
 
00:23:53.149 --> 00:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
while each U one of these opportunities
 
00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:56.440 align:start position:0%
to turn a bed bed over is another
 
00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
viability point in their business model
 
00:24:02.029 --> 00:24:02.039 align:start position:0%
to to to remain you know in operation um
 
00:24:04.029 --> 00:24:04.039 align:start position:0%
is such a critical critical issue for
 
00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:07.240 align:start position:0%
our state um so please do not um
 
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
underestimate the economic value of this
 
00:24:12.269 --> 00:24:12.279 align:start position:0%
study committee and then third is just
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
to say that um you know this is a public
 
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
health issue and um and that for every
 
00:24:20.430 --> 00:24:20.440 align:start position:0%
you know Granite State Community that
 
00:24:22.909 --> 00:24:22.919 align:start position:0%
can support a proper tertiary care
 
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
system uh you know our communities
 
00:24:27.630 --> 00:24:27.640 align:start position:0%
Thrive and are healthier so of course of
 
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
course this really do matter so please
 
00:24:31.029 --> 00:24:31.039 align:start position:0%
keep the big picture in mind as you make
 
00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:33.320 align:start position:0%
your deliberations today and that's it
 
00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:34.960 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to take any questions
 
00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
questions for this
 
00:24:40.149 --> 00:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none oh representative
 
00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:43.240 align:start position:0%
trip thank you chair oh thank you for
 
00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:44.200 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
question once again I have to show my
 
00:24:48.430 --> 00:24:48.440 align:start position:0%
ignorance of the Health Care system
 
00:24:51.909 --> 00:24:51.919 align:start position:0%
because you Ed the term tertiary health
 
00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
care what exactly does that mean uh so
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um I'll try
 
00:24:59.909 --> 00:24:59.919 align:start position:0%
to do my best Layman uh definition for
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
you and basically a tertiary care system
 
00:25:04.149 --> 00:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
is a large hospital system that has
 
00:25:06.789 --> 00:25:06.799 align:start position:0%
multiple levels of care so not just you
 
00:25:09.789 --> 00:25:09.799 align:start position:0%
know kind of like walk-in emergency
 
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
services but also like proper Surgical
 
00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:15.640 align:start position:0%
and internal medicine and I the whole
 
00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:20.360 align:start position:0%
gam of multiple um healthc care points
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
of service and like topics of medicine
 
00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
are all practiced Under One Roof more or
 
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
less does that help well you you explain
 
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
a follow sure uh you explain a lot of
 
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
things but you never use the term
 
00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:38.440 align:start position:0%
tertiary in your
 
00:25:41.230 --> 00:25:41.240 align:start position:0%
explanation oh a hospital oh it's yeah
 
00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:43.039 align:start position:0%
it's like a it's a large hospital system
 
00:25:45.549 --> 00:25:45.559 align:start position:0%
it's a large Hospital yeah so uh for
 
00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:47.480 align:start position:0%
instance Dartmouth health is considered
 
00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:49.640 align:start position:0%
a tertiary hospital system because they
 
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
offer a wide breadth of services not
 
00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
just you know internal Med but it could
 
00:25:58.830 --> 00:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
also be surgical or it could be um
 
00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
neurological it covers many different
 
00:26:02.789 --> 00:26:02.799 align:start position:0%
areas of Medical
 
00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
Practice one more sure so uh so a
 
00:26:11.669 --> 00:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
secondary health care facility would be
 
00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:13.960 align:start position:0%
something that uh like
 
00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:16.269 align:start position:0%
something that uh like
a

00:26:16.269 --> 00:26:16.279 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:26:16.279 --> 00:26:17.909 align:start position:0%
a
local

00:26:17.909 --> 00:26:17.919 align:start position:0%
local
 
00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:20.600 align:start position:0%
Healthcare um well I'm not I I don't
 
00:26:23.149 --> 00:26:23.159 align:start position:0%
want to um oversimplify the matter but I
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
think earlier there was a mention about
 
00:26:26.389 --> 00:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
the County nursing home system where
 
00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:28.000 align:start position:0%
that would not qualify as a tertiary
 
00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
care system because you know for
 
00:26:30.669 --> 00:26:30.679 align:start position:0%
instance they don't have an emergency
 
00:26:33.149 --> 00:26:33.159 align:start position:0%
department they don't operate surgical
 
00:26:35.389 --> 00:26:35.399 align:start position:0%
cases there so it's it's kind of a step
 
00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
down um like nursing primarily driven um
 
00:26:41.669 --> 00:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
operation so that's it's a different
 
00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
level of care it's a little lower I
 
00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:46.520 align:start position:0%
would say so um I'm hoping that helps
 
00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
for the description other questions for
 
00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
this witness seeing none thank you very
 
00:26:53.669 --> 00:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
much thanks next I'm going to call on
 
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
Ben Bradley from the hospital
 
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:19.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
00:27:21.389 --> 00:27:21.399 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Ben
 
00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:23.480 align:start position:0%
Bradley I'm the vice president of state
 
00:27:24.669 --> 00:27:24.679 align:start position:0%
government relations for the New
 
00:27:27.630 --> 00:27:27.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Hospital Association um our
 
00:27:29.549 --> 00:27:29.559 align:start position:0%
hospitals are dealing with unprecedented
 
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:31.480 align:start position:0%
challenges regarding the inability to
 
00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
safely discharge patients once they're
 
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
no longer in need of acute care services
 
00:27:39.789 --> 00:27:39.799 align:start position:0%
the issue is complex and the reasons are
 
00:27:42.909 --> 00:27:42.919 align:start position:0%
very greatly um as noted by Senator
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
Apprentice last year 185 was retained in
 
00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:47.640 align:start position:0%
the Senate and amended this year to
 
00:27:50.830 --> 00:27:50.840 align:start position:0%
establish a study committee that will uh
 
00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:52.360 align:start position:0%
look into the various barriers to
 
00:27:54.389 --> 00:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
discharge for patients medically cleared
 
00:27:57.310 --> 00:27:57.320 align:start position:0%
but unable to leave the acute care
 
00:27:59.950 --> 00:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
hospital bed
 
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
of all the bills in the legislature this
 
00:28:07.509 --> 00:28:07.519 align:start position:0%
session s SP 185 is one of the hospital
 
00:28:10.389 --> 00:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
association's top priorities I cannot
 
00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:13.960 align:start position:0%
stress that enough on any given day in
 
00:28:15.789 --> 00:28:15.799 align:start position:0%
hospitals across New Hampshire there are
 
00:28:19.669 --> 00:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
dozens of patients and I can uh suggest
 
00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
that it's well over a hundred patients
 
00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:25.480 align:start position:0%
today in an impatient bed medically
 
00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
cleared for discharge but unable to
 
00:28:29.549 --> 00:28:29.559 align:start position:0%
leave the hospital Hospital these
 
00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
lengthy non-medically necessary hospital
 
00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:34.799 align:start position:0%
stays are caused by a number of barriers
 
00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
to discharge including but not limited
 
00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:41.320 align:start position:0%
to things like Medicaid Eligibility
 
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
determinations securing
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
guardianship access to long-term care
 
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:48.559 align:start position:0%
and other specialty settings something
 
00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:50.080 align:start position:0%
as simple as
 
00:28:52.149 --> 00:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
transportation and occasionally
 
00:28:52.159 --> 00:28:53.149 align:start position:0%
transportation and occasionally
Insurance

00:28:53.149 --> 00:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
Insurance
 
00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
denials these barriers impact not only
 
00:28:57.789 --> 00:28:57.799 align:start position:0%
patients unable to leave the hospital
 
00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
but also patients whose care may be
 
00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
delayed due to a lack of an impatient
 
00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:03.509 align:start position:0%
delayed due to a lack of an impatient
bed

00:29:03.509 --> 00:29:03.519 align:start position:0%
bed
 
00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
availability understanding why patients
 
00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:08.200 align:start position:0%
remain in an acute care hospital bed
 
00:29:10.149 --> 00:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
longer than medically necessary will
 
00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
help identify areas where improvements
 
00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:14.120 align:start position:0%
can be made to reduce the number of
 
00:29:16.509 --> 00:29:16.519 align:start position:0%
patients affected that's why this bill
 
00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:20.360 align:start position:0%
is so important we are eager to work
 
00:29:22.269 --> 00:29:22.279 align:start position:0%
with members of the study committee
 
00:29:24.269 --> 00:29:24.279 align:start position:0%
along with a large stakeholder group
 
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
that this will require to support any
 
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
efforts to engage the community
 
00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
brainstorm legislative and
 
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
non-legislative Solutions and advocate
 
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
for patients facing these challenging
 
00:29:38.230 --> 00:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
circumstances I want to thank you for
 
00:29:40.029 --> 00:29:40.039 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to provide comments
 
00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
please take this bill seriously and we
 
00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
ask for your support I know you will
 
00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
take it seriously um I'm happy to answer
 
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
any questions you have we do have a
 
00:29:52.669 --> 00:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
updated report on barriers to discharge
 
00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
coming out very soon that I would like
 
00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:56.360 align:start position:0%
to provide the committee this will
 
00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
identify the areas in in our hospitals
 
00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
where barriers exist how much of a
 
00:30:03.909 --> 00:30:03.919 align:start position:0%
barrier that
 
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
is um how many unnecessary days patients
 
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
are staying in hospitals um and uh and
 
00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:14.440 align:start position:0%
other factors as well
 
00:30:17.789 --> 00:30:17.799 align:start position:0%
um representative Smith you if I may you
 
00:30:21.389 --> 00:30:21.399 align:start position:0%
had asked about what um we think a
 
00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:24.440 align:start position:0%
committee like this would do uh what
 
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
what makes us think that a committee of
 
00:30:28.509 --> 00:30:28.519 align:start position:0%
six members of the legislature could
 
00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:30.440 align:start position:0%
help resolve this issue I think it's
 
00:30:33.549 --> 00:30:33.559 align:start position:0%
leadership um at a state level uh to
 
00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
identify those legislative Solutions and
 
00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:38.120 align:start position:0%
non-legislative solutions that we can
 
00:30:40.149 --> 00:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
move forward in the next bium
 
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
potentially with budget proposals and
 
00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:43.480 align:start position:0%
other policy
 
00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
considerations thank
 
00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:47.480 align:start position:0%
you representative Smith and then
 
00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:50.200 align:start position:0%
representative testm thank you actually
 
00:30:53.509 --> 00:30:53.519 align:start position:0%
this is a question for you Mr chair um
 
00:30:58.029 --> 00:30:58.039 align:start position:0%
why is this bill before this committee
 
00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:02.120 align:start position:0%
other than for example Health and Human
 
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
Services well that's an excellent
 
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
question for which I don't have the only
 
00:31:08.269 --> 00:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
answer I can give is it it came in our
 
00:31:11.149 --> 00:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
mailbox and I didn't and I did not uh I
 
00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:13.720 align:start position:0%
did not think to raise an issue about it
 
00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
but you raise a good point I think it's
 
00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
probably too late now for us to it is
 
00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:19.480 align:start position:0%
too late once the hearing has been
 
00:31:21.669 --> 00:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
scheduled it cannot be you know changed
 
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
to another committee but I think that
 
00:31:28.269 --> 00:31:28.279 align:start position:0%
the questions that um at least one of of
 
00:31:32.590 --> 00:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
our colleagues asked reflects that very
 
00:31:34.909 --> 00:31:34.919 align:start position:0%
precisely that this is not an area where
 
00:31:36.389 --> 00:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
we have built up
 
00:31:38.269 --> 00:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
expertise and
 
00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
so I don't think we are the right place
 
00:31:44.830 --> 00:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
for this and I add to that my continued
 
00:31:49.509 --> 00:31:49.519 align:start position:0%
concern that I still don't see why when
 
00:31:51.789 --> 00:31:51.799 align:start position:0%
the principles have not been
 
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
able to reach an agreement since it's so
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
clearly in their own self-interest to
 
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
reach agreement why you think six people
 
00:32:07.389 --> 00:32:07.399 align:start position:0%
in the end of a term meaning that there
 
00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:09.320 align:start position:0%
is not going to be any legislation
 
00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
coming forth from this why you think
 
00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:14.200 align:start position:0%
that that that would solve the problem I
 
00:32:17.549 --> 00:32:17.559 align:start position:0%
need to be enlightened
 
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
thank um so just in response I think
 
00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:24.200 align:start position:0%
that initially this bill um when it was
 
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:26.320 align:start position:0%
proposed in the Senate went to Judiciary
 
00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
because it focused on
 
00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:29.919 align:start position:0%
um patient
 
00:32:32.669 --> 00:32:32.679 align:start position:0%
abandonment and the need for
 
00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:35.880 align:start position:0%
guardianship um this has changed uh to
 
00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:37.720 align:start position:0%
some extent to create this study
 
00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
committee those elements remain because
 
00:32:42.669 --> 00:32:42.679 align:start position:0%
there are patients who are stuck in
 
00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
hospitals that have been abandoned by
 
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
their family and need to be assigned
 
00:32:51.509 --> 00:32:51.519 align:start position:0%
guardianship so there are areas where um
 
00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:53.720 align:start position:0%
we as a Hospital Association our members
 
00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:57.519 align:start position:0%
feel um the legislature needs to become
 
00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:00.559 align:start position:0%
famili amiliar with and help to support
 
00:33:04.350 --> 00:33:04.360 align:start position:0%
legislative Solutions in future years um
 
00:33:06.509 --> 00:33:06.519 align:start position:0%
that's why we feel it's necessary to
 
00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
engage a study committee on this issue
 
00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:12.909 align:start position:0%
engage a study committee on this issue
representative

00:33:12.909 --> 00:33:12.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:20.430 --> 00:33:20.440 align:start position:0%
microphone I don't see a reason for this
 
00:33:24.269 --> 00:33:24.279 align:start position:0%
study committee I see a lot of
 
00:33:27.389 --> 00:33:27.399 align:start position:0%
members interested people who could sit
 
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
down and solve this and we seem to be
 
00:33:36.549 --> 00:33:36.559 align:start position:0%
asked to come in to fulfill some need
 
00:33:39.909 --> 00:33:39.919 align:start position:0%
that I don't see being presented I just
 
00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:42.200 align:start position:0%
I don't understand why a study committee
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
is necessary why the interested people
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
and parties who are going to be part of
 
00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
that can't sit down across the table and
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
sort this out and then finally come to
 
00:33:58.830 --> 00:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
us and say I need this action I it just
 
00:33:58.840 --> 00:33:59.830 align:start position:0%
us and say I need this action I it just
seems

00:33:59.830 --> 00:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
seems
 
00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:02.360 align:start position:0%
useless um respectively Mr chairman if I
 
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
may respond of course um I think uh it
 
00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:07.480 align:start position:0%
is critical to have legislative
 
00:34:10.950 --> 00:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
engagement on this issue um we need
 
00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:12.310 align:start position:0%
engagement on this issue um we need
legislative

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
00:34:15.310 --> 00:34:15.320 align:start position:0%
Solutions and this committee will help
 
00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:18.919 align:start position:0%
to Foster those legislative Solutions or
 
00:34:20.829 --> 00:34:20.839 align:start position:0%
at least be able to report on their
 
00:34:22.869 --> 00:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
findings for legislative Solutions in
 
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
future that can be referenced in future
 
00:34:28.869 --> 00:34:28.879 align:start position:0%
legislator legisl
 
00:34:31.629 --> 00:34:31.639 align:start position:0%
legislatures um I'm going to just give a
 
00:34:32.829 --> 00:34:32.839 align:start position:0%
couple of
 
00:34:36.629 --> 00:34:36.639 align:start position:0%
examples one is it's very challenging to
 
00:34:39.589 --> 00:34:39.599 align:start position:0%
secure a guardian when patients are left
 
00:34:42.069 --> 00:34:42.079 align:start position:0%
in a hospital and need to secure a
 
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
guardian because either their family is
 
00:34:46.349 --> 00:34:46.359 align:start position:0%
incapable of making determinations for
 
00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
their care safe care or nobody is
 
00:34:55.069 --> 00:34:55.079 align:start position:0%
available um we need a a strong process
 
00:34:58.589 --> 00:34:58.599 align:start position:0%
for uh securing guardianship ship that
 
00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
will include ensuring there are enough
 
00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
Guardians in New
 
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um which may include
 
00:35:07.069 --> 00:35:07.079 align:start position:0%
increasing the number of slots that the
 
00:35:08.829 --> 00:35:08.839 align:start position:0%
state the state allocates for
 
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
guardianship under their contracts it
 
00:35:14.710 --> 00:35:14.720 align:start position:0%
may include expedited guardianship as we
 
00:35:17.589 --> 00:35:17.599 align:start position:0%
saw during covid-19 when the Circuit
 
00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
Court designated a um specific Judge for
 
00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:24.440 align:start position:0%
these determinations so patients could
 
00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
secure a guardian and decisions could be
 
00:35:29.829 --> 00:35:29.839 align:start position:0%
made for those paat s to move into a new
 
00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
an appropriate
 
00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
facility another is around Medicaid
 
00:35:37.589 --> 00:35:37.599 align:start position:0%
Eligibility currently the process for
 
00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
securing Medicaid is very cumbersome
 
00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
it's an extensive process and if there's
 
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
a way that we can move legislative
 
00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
proposals that help to ensure patients
 
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
may be able to move into a new facility
 
00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
into a more appropriate facility before
 
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
actually securing Medicaid Eligibility
 
00:35:58.870 --> 00:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
then we want to pursue those options as
 
00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:01.960 align:start position:0%
well but these are all topics that we
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
feel are Justified bringing to a
 
00:36:07.349 --> 00:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
legislative committee that needs to
 
00:36:10.829 --> 00:36:10.839 align:start position:0%
become familiar and provide um some
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
reports by gathering
 
00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
stakeholders uh for legislative
 
00:36:17.349 --> 00:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
Solutions and non-legislative Solutions
 
00:36:19.349 --> 00:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
in the future because we don't want to
 
00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
try to propose a legislative solution
 
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
when it can be resolved um without
 
00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.910 align:start position:0%
when it can be resolved um without
legislation

00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
so respectfully I I I can't share um how
 
00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:31.960 align:start position:0%
strongly enough we believe this is an
 
00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:34.280 align:start position:0%
important bill for the legislature all
 
00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:37.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:39.480 align:start position:0%
testerman I guess it just seems to me
 
00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:40.640 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:43.640 align:start position:0%
answers and you and you you come to us
 
00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:48.040 align:start position:0%
with a bill to say do this you know
 
00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:50.680 align:start position:0%
rather than talk about doing it just a
 
00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
bill for each of those two or three that
 
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
you came up with and I'm sure you have
 
00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:56.190 align:start position:0%
you came up with and I'm sure you have
more

00:36:56.190 --> 00:36:56.200 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
and because we're getting towards the
 
00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:03.040 align:start position:0%
end of a term that many people who are
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
going to be on some committee won't be
 
00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
here so it just seems to me that you
 
00:37:12.309 --> 00:37:12.319 align:start position:0%
you're you're you're basically
 
00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:17.240 align:start position:0%
asking uh committee to do it just P
 
00:37:20.589 --> 00:37:20.599 align:start position:0%
around with it and then drop it I it
 
00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:22.280 align:start position:0%
just it worries me if this is so
 
00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
critical let's do it come up with four
 
00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
or five so is there I didn't hear a
 
00:37:28.829 --> 00:37:28.839 align:start position:0%
question there the question really is
 
00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:31.400 align:start position:0%
why are you this why why are we doing a
 
00:37:33.550 --> 00:37:33.560 align:start position:0%
study committee when you already know
 
00:37:35.710 --> 00:37:35.720 align:start position:0%
the answers or at least the potential
 
00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
answers that put them put the put the
 
00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:39.230 align:start position:0%
answers that put them put the put the
answers

00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
answers
 
00:37:41.589 --> 00:37:41.599 align:start position:0%
forward thanks for the question
 
00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
representative testerman I'm going to
 
00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
just refer to my previous answers all
 
00:37:47.829 --> 00:37:47.839 align:start position:0%
right other questions uh yes
 
00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:49.720 align:start position:0%
representative dorenzo and then
 
00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:50.680 align:start position:0%
representative tur and then
 
00:37:52.349 --> 00:37:52.359 align:start position:0%
representative Staples okay mine's just
 
00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:53.720 align:start position:0%
a quick one thank you for taking my
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
question and thank you Mr chair um when
 
00:37:58.430 --> 00:37:58.440 align:start position:0%
do you expect the report to be issued
 
00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
I would hope uh before the sunset of
 
00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
this Committee in November uh no that's
 
00:38:05.790 --> 00:38:05.800 align:start position:0%
not a good
 
00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
answer do you have a report on data now
 
00:38:11.430 --> 00:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh we have data that we're Gathering
 
00:38:13.829 --> 00:38:13.839 align:start position:0%
from our Hospitals now yes okay
 
00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
representative ter because I I just want
 
00:38:18.430 --> 00:38:18.440 align:start position:0%
to I just feel like we would have a
 
00:38:20.309 --> 00:38:20.319 align:start position:0%
better idea of what we're dealing with
 
00:38:23.069 --> 00:38:23.079 align:start position:0%
if we saw the numbers and it
 
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
situations and thank you if I may uh Mr
 
00:38:27.870 --> 00:38:27.880 align:start position:0%
chairman that's exactly the point that
 
00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:29.800 align:start position:0%
we're trying to make which is we're
 
00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:31.640 align:start position:0%
gathering information we want to provide
 
00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
that to a legislative study committee
 
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:36.200 align:start position:0%
and work with the state and the
 
00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:38.440 align:start position:0%
legislature to move some of these things
 
00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
forward so thank you representative tur
 
00:38:43.349 --> 00:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
yeah actually thanks and and thanks for
 
00:38:45.309 --> 00:38:45.319 align:start position:0%
taking the question uh that was actually
 
00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
a good segue to my question which is and
 
00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:51.160 align:start position:0%
this is from my non-legislative head on
 
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
at the moment but um do you have the
 
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
ability to sort of identify these uh uh
 
00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:01.480 align:start position:0%
days um and situations in the
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
administrative data either in the
 
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
hospital discharge data set or the
 
00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
all-payer you know claims data set so
 
00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
that it's possible to sort of and and
 
00:39:11.990 --> 00:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking within the time frame of a
 
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
committee like this um examine sort of
 
00:39:18.510 --> 00:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
the the subsets within the bigger
 
00:39:20.069 --> 00:39:20.079 align:start position:0%
problem that it sounds like maybe this
 
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
report already is is is focused on like
 
00:39:24.589 --> 00:39:24.599 align:start position:0%
within different payer groups within
 
00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
different uh facility types and things
 
00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
like that so that so that it's not just
 
00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:31.160 align:start position:0%
kind of an aggregate um I guess the real
 
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
question is is the data available and is
 
00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:35.960 align:start position:0%
that something that could be dealt with
 
00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:38.680 align:start position:0%
by a sub by a committee uh thank you for
 
00:39:40.750 --> 00:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
the question representative yes we've
 
00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
done a lot of there's been a lot of
 
00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:45.400 align:start position:0%
Labor and and intensive work on
 
00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:49.240 align:start position:0%
Gathering data from our hospitals on uh
 
00:39:51.589 --> 00:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
the challenges that they're facing with
 
00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
getting patients to an appropriate level
 
00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
of care I feel very confident that we
 
00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
will be a valuable resource to the
 
00:40:02.349 --> 00:40:02.359 align:start position:0%
efforts of this study committee and I
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
believe that we can hit the ground
 
00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:05.839 align:start position:0%
running on day one
 
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
without simply doing introductions and a
 
00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:12.520 align:start position:0%
overview of the committee uh even on
 
00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
even the first meeting that we have I
 
00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:17.839 align:start position:0%
think we can get to um some really
 
00:40:20.109 --> 00:40:20.119 align:start position:0%
strong and comprehensive information
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
that will help them form the committee
 
00:40:21.839 --> 00:40:22.750 align:start position:0%
that will help them form the committee
very

00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
quickly representative
 
00:40:27.069 --> 00:40:27.079 align:start position:0%
Stapleton thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
you for for taking my
 
00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:31.160 align:start position:0%
question having been
 
00:40:34.589 --> 00:40:34.599 align:start position:0%
familiar with helping constituents
 
00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:37.240 align:start position:0%
through the Medicaid application
 
00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
process and also involved with the
 
00:40:42.109 --> 00:40:42.119 align:start position:0%
complexities of
 
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
guardianship I can appreciate how much
 
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
delay could be attributed to those two
 
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
factors alone never thought about the
 
00:40:53.829 --> 00:40:53.839 align:start position:0%
hospital emergency room Stack Up in such
 
00:40:57.550 --> 00:40:57.560 align:start position:0%
a regard but because they're so back
 
00:40:58.670 --> 00:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
logged in
 
00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
DHHS Medicaid and the courts uh handling
 
00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:05.880 align:start position:0%
guardianship cases there's a great deal
 
00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
of time and and resources that are
 
00:41:11.829 --> 00:41:11.839 align:start position:0%
absent to address that if you could
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
condense those wouldn't it make it
 
00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
probably would make sense that you could
 
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
move these people along a lot quicker um
 
00:41:23.309 --> 00:41:23.319 align:start position:0%
I recognize that the legislation is a
 
00:41:26.589 --> 00:41:26.599 align:start position:0%
component of all the tools that you need
 
00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
and so it's an important piece that
 
00:41:30.910 --> 00:41:30.920 align:start position:0%
brings it into Focus to the head of the
 
00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:34.720 align:start position:0%
culture question how could you give me a
 
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
rough percentage about how many people
 
00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
are stacked up on Guardianship and
 
00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid issues in the system within New
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um from a inpatient acute care
 
00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
hospital bed setting um our report
 
00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
should identify that meaning should
 
00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
identify how many patients are awaiting
 
00:41:59.910 --> 00:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
a determination from Medicaid for
 
00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Eligibility before they can
 
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
secure it and move to an appropriate
 
00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:07.160 align:start position:0%
level of care we will be able to
 
00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
identify that similarly Guardians we
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
have we know what patients are in need
 
00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:15.800 align:start position:0%
of a guardian and SEC identifying and
 
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
securing those Guardians um is part of
 
00:42:21.309 --> 00:42:21.319 align:start position:0%
the effort to uh get patients to where
 
00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
they need to go so yes I feel confident
 
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
we can answer those questions yes can
 
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
you just give me a rough ballpark kind
 
00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:31.000 align:start position:0%
of an idea other than Medical
 
00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
Transportation other factors how much
 
00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:35.960 align:start position:0%
guardianship Medicaid might represent
 
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
very rough percentage figures of all
 
00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
those people stacked up in our system so
 
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
i' I'd say there's over a hundred
 
00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:47.240 align:start position:0%
patients Statewide and on on daily and
 
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
on any given day for each of those
 
00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:51.839 align:start position:0%
categories I would say there are
 
00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:55.480 align:start position:0%
dozens dozens of patients that's my best
 
00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
representative Andrews
 
00:42:59.270 --> 00:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
question has anybody in the hospital
 
00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:08.200 align:start position:0%
Association or any other like a or
 
00:43:12.309 --> 00:43:12.319 align:start position:0%
anybody been to individual legislators
 
00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
and said we need this bill or we need
 
00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:16.390 align:start position:0%
and said we need this bill or we need
this

00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:18.520 align:start position:0%
bill um I think
 
00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
that's no but it's part of a
 
00:43:24.309 --> 00:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
comprehensive effort to propose as part
 
00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:26.440 align:start position:0%
of this study committee representative
 
00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:29.630 align:start position:0%
of this study committee representative
Smith

00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm a little um unsure about how
 
00:43:38.589 --> 00:43:38.599 align:start position:0%
to proceed but uh the witness who is a
 
00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
presenting to us the position of the
 
00:43:43.230 --> 00:43:43.240 align:start position:0%
hospital Association tells us we need
 
00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
data tells us the way to proceed is to
 
00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
have this study committee and tells us
 
00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:53.960 align:start position:0%
the information that we will need for
 
00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:56.720 align:start position:0%
the study committee which expires in
 
00:44:00.109 --> 00:44:00.119 align:start position:0%
November member will be available to us
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
by November so I think that there's a
 
00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
little disconnect here and I I hope you
 
00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
don't mind my making that point Mr chair
 
00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
and I'm making that comment to you not
 
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
to the speaker right no I I hear you may
 
00:44:16.349 --> 00:44:16.359 align:start position:0%
I respond I don't know if I was unclear
 
00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
in responding to uh representative D
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
Lorenzo our data is available within the
 
00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
next we we have historical date we have
 
00:44:28.750 --> 00:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
a former report on this it was issued in
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
September we're updating that report
 
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
that should be out this
 
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:35.440 align:start position:0%
month which should give insight to the
 
00:44:36.670 --> 00:44:36.680 align:start position:0%
study committee that would be
 
00:44:39.309 --> 00:44:39.319 align:start position:0%
established this summer and work
 
00:44:41.549 --> 00:44:41.559 align:start position:0%
diligently to identify important
 
00:44:43.309 --> 00:44:43.319 align:start position:0%
legislative and non-legislative
 
00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
solutions for next legislative session
 
00:44:48.549 --> 00:44:48.559 align:start position:0%
for the for the next legislature to
 
00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
consider as part of their report um we
 
00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:55.240 align:start position:0%
have the data it's not coming out in
 
00:44:58.750 --> 00:44:58.760 align:start position:0%
November uh it it it's a available now
 
00:45:01.150 --> 00:45:01.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to provide what we have
 
00:45:04.670 --> 00:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
historically gathered and any updates
 
00:45:06.430 --> 00:45:06.440 align:start position:0%
that may be forthcoming but it's
 
00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:08.200 align:start position:0%
misguided to believe that we we don't
 
00:45:10.829 --> 00:45:10.839 align:start position:0%
have data available now and and we'd
 
00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
have to wait until November to get that
 
00:45:15.790 --> 00:45:15.800 align:start position:0%
to the study committee I apologize if I
 
00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:17.800 align:start position:0%
was mis no
 
00:45:19.990 --> 00:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
misguiding representative
 
00:45:22.549 --> 00:45:22.559 align:start position:0%
Manos thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:45:25.069 --> 00:45:25.079 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um I have two
 
00:45:28.069 --> 00:45:28.079 align:start position:0%
questions one is I represent at them so
 
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if you could review the
 
00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
definition of an acute care hospital
 
00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
because I'm thinking through whether
 
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
exitor Hospital would fall under that
 
00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
they don't have a psychiatric unit
 
00:45:40.109 --> 00:45:40.119 align:start position:0%
they're a general hospital so I was
 
00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:43.240 align:start position:0%
wondering about that yes a a acute care
 
00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
settings are
 
00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
hospitals all hospitals in New Hampshire
 
00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
settings yep go ahead my second question
 
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
is when someone's occupying excuse me
 
00:46:00.510 --> 00:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
when someone's occupying a bed for
 
00:46:04.069 --> 00:46:04.079 align:start position:0%
non-medically necessary reasons who's
 
00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:06.520 align:start position:0%
paying the bill for that who who's
 
00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:09.400 align:start position:0%
absorbing the costs of that um thank you
 
00:46:11.589 --> 00:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
for the question representative the
 
00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
hospital does not get reimbursed
 
00:46:18.270 --> 00:46:18.280 align:start position:0%
for um any Services provided that aren't
 
00:46:21.549 --> 00:46:21.559 align:start position:0%
acute in the hospital so that patient
 
00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
there there's no payment to the hospital
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
and the hospital absorbs those
 
00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:27.910 align:start position:0%
and the hospital absorbs those
costs

00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
costs
 
00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
other other questions for this witness
 
00:46:33.670 --> 00:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sir all right uh
 
00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:49.030 --> 00:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
please good morning chairman Lynn and
 
00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:50.920 align:start position:0%
honorable committee members this is my
 
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
first time doing this so I'm a little
 
00:46:55.349 --> 00:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
nervous I just want to let you guys know
 
00:46:57.069 --> 00:46:57.079 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Christina Cardwell and the
 
00:46:58.670 --> 00:46:58.680 align:start position:0%
director of care coordination at St
 
00:47:00.349 --> 00:47:00.359 align:start position:0%
Joseph hospital and I thank you for the
 
00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:02.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify in strong support
 
00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
of s SP 185 we are very appreciative of
 
00:47:07.150 --> 00:47:07.160 align:start position:0%
the collaborative efforts of Senator
 
00:47:08.670 --> 00:47:08.680 align:start position:0%
apprentice and Senator Carson in
 
00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
addressing a critical issue faced not
 
00:47:13.069 --> 00:47:13.079 align:start position:0%
only by hospitals but most importantly
 
00:47:13.079 --> 00:47:14.069 align:start position:0%
only by hospitals but most importantly
our

00:47:14.069 --> 00:47:14.079 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
patients hospitals have been tasked with
 
00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:17.800 align:start position:0%
caring for individuals who have been
 
00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
abandoned in the emergency room or main
 
00:47:21.870 --> 00:47:21.880 align:start position:0%
entrance of a hospital by families who
 
00:47:23.829 --> 00:47:23.839 align:start position:0%
either cannot care for them at home or
 
00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
unwilling or are unwilling to do so
 
00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:28.640 align:start position:0%
hospitals are also finding that patients
 
00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
are admitted for a medical condition
 
00:47:32.549 --> 00:47:32.559 align:start position:0%
treated and at discharge the family is
 
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
either unwilling or unable to care for
 
00:47:36.510 --> 00:47:36.520 align:start position:0%
the patient at home leaving the
 
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
long-term care planning of that patient
 
00:47:41.790 --> 00:47:41.800 align:start position:0%
now up to the hospital this results in
 
00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:43.480 align:start position:0%
an extended length of stay for what we
 
00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
call social barriers currently at St
 
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
Joseph Hospital alone there are five
 
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
patients in this situation one was
 
00:47:51.829 --> 00:47:51.839 align:start position:0%
brought in through the emergency room
 
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
and abandoned by Family three of the
 
00:47:55.549 --> 00:47:55.559 align:start position:0%
patients have family who are unable to
 
00:47:57.470 --> 00:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
care for them at the patients care for
 
00:47:58.710 --> 00:47:58.720 align:start position:0%
the patients at home you know what Miss
 
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
C I don't mean to interrupt you but it
 
00:48:02.309 --> 00:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
you've given us your written testimony
 
00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:05.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm not if if you so I guess what
 
00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:07.400 align:start position:0%
I'm saying is we we can all of us can
 
00:48:10.030 --> 00:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
and will read this but there is there is
 
00:48:12.309 --> 00:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
some we have some time pressure because
 
00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
we're running a little late so if I
 
00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
don't want to interrupt you but but it
 
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
in terms of productivity it's not
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
particularly productive to just read
 
00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
what you've already given us sure what
 
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
so I'll just um mention the numbers
 
00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
because I think the numbers are
 
00:48:30.270 --> 00:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
sure so um currently at St Joe's there
 
00:48:32.990 --> 00:48:33.000 align:start position:0%
are five patients today who have been
 
00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:35.960 align:start position:0%
abandoned uh the total number of days in
 
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
the hospital for these five patients is
 
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
756 days of those 756 days only 66 days
 
00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:47.960 align:start position:0%
were medically appropriate um so that
 
00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:50.440 align:start position:0%
690 days that a bed was held up for
 
00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:52.040 align:start position:0%
patients who were waiting for
 
00:48:54.789 --> 00:48:54.799 align:start position:0%
guardianship Medicaid and then placement
 
00:48:57.270 --> 00:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
into another facility
 
00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
that at St Joseph's our average length
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
of stay is 4.1 days so if you do the
 
00:49:06.309 --> 00:49:06.319 align:start position:0%
calculations for that with those five
 
00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
patients taking up 690 days of bed days
 
00:49:12.990 --> 00:49:13.000 align:start position:0%
that left 168 medically appropriate
 
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
patients from our community that then
 
00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
could not be admitted to those beds in
 
00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:18.680 align:start position:0%
that time frame
 
00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
um so that I had it all planned just to
 
00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
read the whole
 
00:49:25.349 --> 00:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
thing I I understand that I think that
 
00:49:27.069 --> 00:49:27.079 align:start position:0%
that out of everything that I wrote here
 
00:49:28.789 --> 00:49:28.799 align:start position:0%
I think that's the most important piece
 
00:49:30.349 --> 00:49:30.359 align:start position:0%
and and I assure you we we will the
 
00:49:31.829 --> 00:49:31.839 align:start position:0%
members of the committee will read your
 
00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
your written testimony don't worry about
 
00:49:35.789 --> 00:49:35.799 align:start position:0%
that but um so thank you questions for
 
00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:38.280 align:start position:0%
this witness representative Andrew thank
 
00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
question how long has this acute problem
 
00:49:47.030 --> 00:49:47.040 align:start position:0%
been go been going
 
00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
on I it's been going on for I would say
 
00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
it's been getting worse over the years
 
00:49:57.309 --> 00:49:57.319 align:start position:0%
um I've been a nurse for 18 years and I
 
00:49:59.670 --> 00:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
would say maybe in the last five we've
 
00:50:02.470 --> 00:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
started to see the uptake of Abandonment
 
00:50:05.829 --> 00:50:05.839 align:start position:0%
um or at least in my um experience it's
 
00:50:07.150 --> 00:50:07.160 align:start position:0%
been in the last five years that I've
 
00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:11.720 align:start position:0%
seen it um more so since the pandemic
 
00:50:14.190 --> 00:50:14.200 align:start position:0%
the co pandemic it definitely ticked up
 
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
from there something it's been going on
 
00:50:18.549 --> 00:50:18.559 align:start position:0%
for a couple of years other questions
 
00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness
 
00:50:24.349 --> 00:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
representative Anders thank you Mr chair
 
00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:27.839 align:start position:0%
okay this has been an ongoing
 
00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:30.760 align:start position:0%
problem has the hospital done anything
 
00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
to try to correct it or is just gone on
 
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
and now it's getting to be a severe
 
00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
problem um so hospitals have tried to
 
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
figure out creative ways to discharge
 
00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
patients safely um my background is the
 
00:50:48.750 --> 00:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
care coordination and it is our
 
00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility to get a safe discharge
 
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
plan for patients and there's been times
 
00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
when we have a safe discharge plan for
 
00:50:58.750 --> 00:50:58.760 align:start position:0%
home but then the family refuses to take
 
00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:00.280 align:start position:0%
that patient home so we have a safe
 
00:51:02.349 --> 00:51:02.359 align:start position:0%
discharge plan but the family says no we
 
00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:03.760 align:start position:0%
can't really control what the family
 
00:51:07.829 --> 00:51:07.839 align:start position:0%
does um hospitals do or at least our
 
00:51:09.510 --> 00:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
hospital I would say has a contract with
 
00:51:12.030 --> 00:51:12.040 align:start position:0%
a Genesis facility that we can
 
00:51:14.109 --> 00:51:14.119 align:start position:0%
occasionally use if there's a long-term
 
00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
care bed available where we will pay the
 
00:51:18.109 --> 00:51:18.119 align:start position:0%
facility to take the patient while
 
00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
they're waiting for their Medicaid um
 
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
application to go
 
00:51:25.789 --> 00:51:25.799 align:start position:0%
through but the the issue is finding the
 
00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
bed and get them to agree to that
 
00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
contract so we we've tried to do things
 
00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
um I just I feel that now at this point
 
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
we need assistance from
 
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
legislation you're welcome other
 
00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:40.640 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness
 
00:51:43.789 --> 00:51:43.799 align:start position:0%
yes beyond the health of the individual
 
00:51:46.109 --> 00:51:46.119 align:start position:0%
who is in the system uh in one of your
 
00:51:49.230 --> 00:51:49.240 align:start position:0%
beds what is the cost to all other
 
00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
health care payers into the system with
 
00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
the burden of this
 
00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
occurring I I don't really understand
 
00:51:59.710 --> 00:51:59.720 align:start position:0%
the question so is there a cost to all
 
00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:02.680 align:start position:0%
Health Care users for providing care for
 
00:52:06.190 --> 00:52:06.200 align:start position:0%
these individuals who are not paying um
 
00:52:08.069 --> 00:52:08.079 align:start position:0%
I would say no there's not a financial
 
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
cost to other um Healthcare payers for
 
00:52:13.349 --> 00:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
this particular patient sitting in a bed
 
00:52:15.349 --> 00:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
there was a cost to the hospital uh
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
that's a loss of at minimum
 
00:52:21.069 --> 00:52:21.079 align:start position:0%
$1,660 a day that the hospital is not
 
00:52:21.079 --> 00:52:22.710 align:start position:0%
$1,660 a day that the hospital is not
getting

00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
getting
 
00:52:25.710 --> 00:52:25.720 align:start position:0%
paid presumably I I think what the what
 
00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
the legislator was getting at is
 
00:52:29.069 --> 00:52:29.079 align:start position:0%
presumably the hospital attempts to
 
00:52:31.309 --> 00:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
recover that in some way in charges to
 
00:52:34.510 --> 00:52:34.520 align:start position:0%
other patients the rates go up so to
 
00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:36.520 align:start position:0%
speak I'm not sure if that is actually
 
00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
the case okay I don't have anything to
 
00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
do with the billing process in the
 
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
hospital all right representative
 
00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:44.720 align:start position:0%
Horgan yes I experienced situation with
 
00:52:48.030 --> 00:52:48.040 align:start position:0%
a family member who unfortunately um was
 
00:52:51.349 --> 00:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
admitted to the ICU of a well I guess I
 
00:52:53.109 --> 00:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
now know it's called a tertiary care
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
hospital a major hospital here in New
 
00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and
 
00:52:59.910 --> 00:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
they um what we ended up what we ended
 
00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
up doing was admitting admitting them to
 
00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
hos to hospice and they didn't they
 
00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
actually stayed within the same building
 
00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:07.200 align:start position:0%
but they were being cared for by
 
00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
different organization you know with
 
00:53:11.309 --> 00:53:11.319 align:start position:0%
different funding and so forth so that
 
00:53:12.309 --> 00:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
is just
 
00:53:15.549 --> 00:53:15.559 align:start position:0%
something um that this one of the is
 
00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
this one of the U strategies that this
 
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
committee would be would be looking into
 
00:53:21.710 --> 00:53:21.720 align:start position:0%
possibly certain the opposite is kind of
 
00:53:23.069 --> 00:53:23.079 align:start position:0%
the flip side of other problem so
 
00:53:25.030 --> 00:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
there's actual bed and a space available
 
00:53:29.069 --> 00:53:29.079 align:start position:0%
in the facility but there uh they they
 
00:53:30.829 --> 00:53:30.839 align:start position:0%
they still handed handed the patient off
 
00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
to a different different organization is
 
00:53:34.349 --> 00:53:34.359 align:start position:0%
doing different type of care than what
 
00:53:35.789 --> 00:53:35.799 align:start position:0%
the hospital was doing so I don't know
 
00:53:37.390 --> 00:53:37.400 align:start position:0%
if I made myself clear is that one of
 
00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
the things that this committee would
 
00:53:41.589 --> 00:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
probably be looking at um I don't
 
00:53:42.789 --> 00:53:42.799 align:start position:0%
necessarily think that they would be
 
00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:44.680 align:start position:0%
looking at that Medicare does have a
 
00:53:46.589 --> 00:53:46.599 align:start position:0%
hospice benefit for what we call uh
 
00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:48.520 align:start position:0%
General inpatient so hospitals have
 
00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%
contracts with hospice agencies um for
 
00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:53.720 align:start position:0%
those patients who are at end of life
 
00:53:55.870 --> 00:53:55.880 align:start position:0%
and need to be in a facility where the
 
00:53:57.950 --> 00:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
Medicare hospice benefit pays for the
 
00:53:59.470 --> 00:53:59.480 align:start position:0%
patient to be in the hospital and that
 
00:54:01.109 --> 00:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
agency then comes in to help care for
 
00:54:03.990 --> 00:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
them okay good thanks I sort of UND said
 
00:54:06.109 --> 00:54:06.119 align:start position:0%
what happened to us obviously other
 
00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
things on my mind aside from the
 
00:54:10.430 --> 00:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
Medicare benefit but thank so so that's
 
00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
uh that's something that's already
 
00:54:12.829 --> 00:54:12.839 align:start position:0%
already being done effectively so the
 
00:54:14.309 --> 00:54:14.319 align:start position:0%
committee probably would have that much
 
00:54:15.789 --> 00:54:15.799 align:start position:0%
trouble with that particular issue so
 
00:54:19.109 --> 00:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
thanks cor
 
00:54:21.950 --> 00:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
L I just wanted to make a statement
 
00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
that's all is just saying I'm really
 
00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
surprised that um your able to get
 
00:54:31.150 --> 00:54:31.160 align:start position:0%
patients into a nursing home um um
 
00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
because Medicaid usually always makes
 
00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:37.720 align:start position:0%
sure that you that the um Medicaid has
 
00:54:39.309 --> 00:54:39.319 align:start position:0%
gone through before a patient is
 
00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:43.160 align:start position:0%
admitted to a a nursing home so the
 
00:54:45.549 --> 00:54:45.559 align:start position:0%
critical must uh it must be very very
 
00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:48.640 align:start position:0%
critical in order to um Al like you say
 
00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:50.920 align:start position:0%
have this going
 
00:54:54.349 --> 00:54:54.359 align:start position:0%
on other questions seeing none thank you
 
00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
very much thank you is there uh is there

Hampshire Senate district 15 which
 
00:55:29.589 --> 00:55:29.599 align:start position:0%
includes the wonderful communities of Bo
 
00:55:32.069 --> 00:55:32.079 align:start position:0%
conquered Penacook and hopkington it's
 
00:55:34.270 --> 00:55:34.280 align:start position:0%
good to see many of you today I'm
 
00:55:37.630 --> 00:55:37.640 align:start position:0%
honored to introduce Senate Bill 507 a
 
00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
bill to ensure justice prevails in the
 
00:55:42.549 --> 00:55:42.559 align:start position:0%
Granite State this bill deals with the
 
00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:45.400 align:start position:0%
post conviction process and it extends
 
00:55:48.109 --> 00:55:48.119 align:start position:0%
the time to petition a court for a new
 
00:55:51.870 --> 00:55:51.880 align:start position:0%
trial in certain cases as a refresher
 
00:55:54.069 --> 00:55:54.079 align:start position:0%
for folks uh not familiar with the post
 
00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
commission process the post conviction
 
00:55:59.470 --> 00:55:59.480 align:start position:0%
process is in place to protect both
 
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
innocent and guilty individuals from
 
00:56:04.309 --> 00:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
inherent human error in the criminal
 
00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
justice system unfortunately there are
 
00:56:09.390 --> 00:56:09.400 align:start position:0%
still innocent people who are convicted
 
00:56:12.109 --> 00:56:12.119 align:start position:0%
of crimes and spend years in prison
 
00:56:15.829 --> 00:56:15.839 align:start position:0%
while the real offender remains free
 
00:56:17.549 --> 00:56:17.559 align:start position:0%
although it's exceedingly difficult to
 
00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
overcome a conviction even for an
 
00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
innocent individual convictions are
 
00:56:24.750 --> 00:56:24.760 align:start position:0%
being overturned and individuals are
 
00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
being exonerated with increasing
 
00:56:30.430 --> 00:56:30.440 align:start position:0%
frequency in postconviction cases an
 
00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
exoneration may occur when a person
 
00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
who's been convicted of a crime is
 
00:56:37.390 --> 00:56:37.400 align:start position:0%
officially cleared based on new evidence
 
00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
of Innocence this may this can occur
 
00:56:41.390 --> 00:56:41.400 align:start position:0%
through a pardon based on actual
 
00:56:44.750 --> 00:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
innocence an acquittal at retrial or a
 
00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:47.640 align:start position:0%
conviction being vacated and indictment
 
00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
dismissed the use of DNA testing has
 
00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
been used to in to include or eliminate
 
00:56:54.910 --> 00:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
suspects and exonerate those convicted
 
00:56:57.470 --> 00:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
in serious crimes there have only been
 
00:57:00.549 --> 00:57:00.559 align:start position:0%
three exonerations uh in New Hampshire
 
00:57:02.789 --> 00:57:02.799 align:start position:0%
this low number is despite the fact that
 
00:57:05.950 --> 00:57:05.960 align:start position:0%
DNA testing has been available since the
 
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
1980s although we wish this was because
 
00:57:10.670 --> 00:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has a justice system that
 
00:57:13.789 --> 00:57:13.799 align:start position:0%
is perfect data suggests that the more
 
00:57:16.069 --> 00:57:16.079 align:start position:0%
likely reason for the low number is that
 
00:57:18.750 --> 00:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
wrongful convictions just aren't being
 
00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
discovered one bar to discovery of
 
00:57:24.190 --> 00:57:24.200 align:start position:0%
wrongful convictions is New Hampshire's
 
00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
existing archaic statute which provides
 
00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:30.200 align:start position:0%
only 3 years to overturn a conviction
 
00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
this timeline does not allow for
 
00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
consideration of changes in forensic
 
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
science new investigative leads new
 
00:57:40.190 --> 00:57:40.200 align:start position:0%
scientific techniques or procedures or
 
00:57:41.950 --> 00:57:41.960 align:start position:0%
other newly discovered or better
 
00:57:44.430 --> 00:57:44.440 align:start position:0%
understood evidence we all know that
 
00:57:47.069 --> 00:57:47.079 align:start position:0%
science is constantly changing and the
 
00:57:49.150 --> 00:57:49.160 align:start position:0%
courts in New Hampshire must be able to
 
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
accommodate this growth I want to point
 
00:57:53.630 --> 00:57:53.640 align:start position:0%
out that New Hampshire is out of step
 
00:57:56.190 --> 00:57:56.200 align:start position:0%
with the rest of New England and is
 
00:57:57.630 --> 00:57:57.640 align:start position:0%
wildly out of step with the rest of New
 
00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:00.200 align:start position:0%
England and is only one of Six States
 
00:58:02.430 --> 00:58:02.440 align:start position:0%
with absolute timelines which we can
 
00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
talk about further I also want to point
 
00:58:07.029 --> 00:58:07.039 align:start position:0%
out the American Bar Association their
 
00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
standard on postconviction statute of
 
00:58:11.950 --> 00:58:11.960 align:start position:0%
limitations states that a quote a
 
00:58:14.270 --> 00:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
specific time period as a statute of
 
00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
limitations to Bar postconviction review
 
00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
of criminal conviction uh convictions is
 
00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
unsound and that's what New Hampshire
 
00:58:24.270 --> 00:58:24.280 align:start position:0%
has conviction finality is meaningless
 
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
where the conviction is wrongful there
 
00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
can be little Comfort to victims in
 
00:58:31.710 --> 00:58:31.720 align:start position:0%
convicting the wrong person I want to
 
00:58:34.109 --> 00:58:34.119 align:start position:0%
provide an a an example to illustrate
 
00:58:37.069 --> 00:58:37.079 align:start position:0%
why this bill is so necessary a man
 
00:58:38.789 --> 00:58:38.799 align:start position:0%
named Gary was convicted of a brutal
 
00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
assault and murder out of Massachusetts
 
00:58:40.799 --> 00:58:41.589 align:start position:0%
assault and murder out of Massachusetts
in

00:58:41.589 --> 00:58:41.599 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:58:44.150 --> 00:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
1983 his innocence was not litigated
 
00:58:48.349 --> 00:58:48.359 align:start position:0%
until 2017 35 years later well after the
 
00:58:50.829 --> 00:58:50.839 align:start position:0%
statute would have run Gary's
 
00:58:52.589 --> 00:58:52.599 align:start position:0%
exoneration began with the discovery
 
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
that bitar Mark science was not what
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
forensic UT ologists had believed it to
 
00:58:59.829 --> 00:58:59.839 align:start position:0%
be at the time of trial because the
 
00:59:01.549 --> 00:59:01.559 align:start position:0%
massachusett statute accommodates
 
00:59:03.390 --> 00:59:03.400 align:start position:0%
changes in science and its statutes of
 
00:59:05.630 --> 00:59:05.640 align:start position:0%
limitation Gary's case was able to be
 
00:59:08.309 --> 00:59:08.319 align:start position:0%
litigated and Gary was exonerated this
 
00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:09.839 align:start position:0%
would not have happened in New Hampshire
 
00:59:12.390 --> 00:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
under our current statute I just want to
 
00:59:14.670 --> 00:59:14.680 align:start position:0%
note that the Senate Judiciary Committee
 
00:59:17.029 --> 00:59:17.039 align:start position:0%
spent a great deal of time working the
 
00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
with the parties um in crafting this
 
00:59:22.270 --> 00:59:22.280 align:start position:0%
language you'll see that it is slightly
 
00:59:24.829 --> 00:59:24.839 align:start position:0%
narrowed from the original version of
 
00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
the bill there are many many folks at
 
00:59:30.029 --> 00:59:30.039 align:start position:0%
the table that have worked on this bill
 
00:59:32.029 --> 00:59:32.039 align:start position:0%
and I will say they continue to work on
 
00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
it um they you know as the version that
 
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
you have before you was sort of hashed
 
00:59:40.750 --> 00:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
out in a room with County attorneys the
 
00:59:42.510 --> 00:59:42.520 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office the Innocence
 
00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
Project folks who actually work in the
 
00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
field but of course you know as we
 
00:59:48.510 --> 00:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
continue to think about the issue we
 
00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
want to get it right so I would say and
 
00:59:52.789 --> 00:59:52.799 align:start position:0%
the folks behind me can describe it in
 
00:59:54.510 --> 00:59:54.520 align:start position:0%
Greater detail I think folks are on the
 
00:59:57.950 --> 00:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
same page that we do need to change this
 
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
absolute timeline but we need to get the
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
language just right so um I I am an
 
01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:06.280 align:start position:0%
attorney but I do not practice nor have
 
01:00:08.349 --> 01:00:08.359 align:start position:0%
I ever practiced in this area but there
 
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
are many very very talented lawyers
 
01:00:13.230 --> 01:00:13.240 align:start position:0%
behind me who do practice in this area
 
01:00:16.309 --> 01:00:16.319 align:start position:0%
so I will defer technical questions to
 
01:00:18.829 --> 01:00:18.839 align:start position:0%
how this postc conviction process uh
 
01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
Works to them thank you very much and I
 
01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate the committee's consideration
 
01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:24.760 align:start position:0%
of the bill and I'm happy to take the
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
questions that I can questions for this
 
01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:28.680 align:start position:0%
witness representative Wallace thank you
 
01:00:29.950 --> 01:00:29.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thanks for taking my
 
01:00:32.430 --> 01:00:32.440 align:start position:0%
question in the uh case you cited in uh
 
01:00:34.349 --> 01:00:34.359 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts what was the was the
 
01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
actual perpetrator caught and prosecuted
 
01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
or was just the wrongfully convicted
 
01:00:39.829 --> 01:00:39.839 align:start position:0%
individual I don't know that thank you
 
01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
for that question but the folks behind
 
01:00:43.309 --> 01:00:43.319 align:start position:0%
me will know that yeah thank you thank
 
01:00:44.789 --> 01:00:44.799 align:start position:0%
you for that question other questions
 
01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
for this witness thank you very much
 
01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:49.720 align:start position:0%
representative me I have to re lean
 
01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
around the represent yeah yeah good to
 
01:00:54.829 --> 01:00:54.839 align:start position:0%
see you Senator you too um just a quick
 
01:00:56.990 --> 01:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
one on new scientific understanding is
 
01:00:58.990 --> 01:00:59.000 align:start position:0%
that defined anywhere or does it just
 
01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:00.920 align:start position:0%
get its common definition yeah and that
 
01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question and I think
 
01:01:05.549 --> 01:01:05.559 align:start position:0%
that is the sort of one of the areas of
 
01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:07.799 align:start position:0%
conversation it is likely just like in
 
01:01:10.109 --> 01:01:10.119 align:start position:0%
other states that you know and um your
 
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
chair knows this well that often times a
 
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
statute is written and the courts need
 
01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
to interpret it and um and we want to
 
01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
strike that balance in statute by being
 
01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
clear enough but not being overly
 
01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
prescriptive so thank you for
 
01:01:25.630 --> 01:01:25.640 align:start position:0%
identifying that issue other questions
 
01:01:27.309 --> 01:01:27.319 align:start position:0%
for this witness seeing none thank you
 
01:01:29.029 --> 01:01:29.039 align:start position:0%
very much thank you very much next I'm
 
01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:38.000 align:start position:0%

01:01:46.190 --> 01:01:46.200 align:start position:0%

01:01:57.710 --> 01:01:57.720 align:start position:0%
was a public def in New Hampshire uh and
 
01:02:00.589 --> 01:02:00.599 align:start position:0%
I was a law clerk uh actually was in
 
01:02:02.430 --> 01:02:02.440 align:start position:0%
Hill South judin when you were there as
 
01:02:05.349 --> 01:02:05.359 align:start position:0%
well um so I'm sort of in this unique
 
01:02:06.750 --> 01:02:06.760 align:start position:0%
experience of having been in the
 
01:02:09.309 --> 01:02:09.319 align:start position:0%
pre-trial and the postconviction world
 
01:02:11.309 --> 01:02:11.319 align:start position:0%
um and I'm the only attorney in the
 
01:02:13.870 --> 01:02:13.880 align:start position:0%
entire State that's working full-time on
 
01:02:16.789 --> 01:02:16.799 align:start position:0%
postconviction uh litigation and the
 
01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
only person that's working on these uh
 
01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
innocence cases uh full-time and I say
 
01:02:23.069 --> 01:02:23.079 align:start position:0%
all this only to say that I'm sort of in
 
01:02:24.589 --> 01:02:24.599 align:start position:0%
this unique position of having this
 
01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
understanding about how this stat of
 
01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
limitations is impacting our ability to
 
01:02:30.269 --> 01:02:30.279 align:start position:0%
litigate these wrongful conviction cases
 
01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and how these changes
 
01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
that we're proposing today would not
 
01:02:36.109 --> 01:02:36.119 align:start position:0%
only help free innocent people but would
 
01:02:37.789 --> 01:02:37.799 align:start position:0%
also really improve the criminal legal
 
01:02:40.269 --> 01:02:40.279 align:start position:0%
system as a whole so the current version
 
01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
of statute of limitations requires
 
01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
motions to be filed within three years
 
01:02:45.390 --> 01:02:45.400 align:start position:0%
with the rendition of judgment this is
 
01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
virtually impossible um to meet in
 
01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
wrongful conviction cases and 2016 the
 
01:02:52.109 --> 01:02:52.119 align:start position:0%
National Registry for exonerations
 
01:02:53.710 --> 01:02:53.720 align:start position:0%
reported that the average exoneration
 
01:02:56.589 --> 01:02:56.599 align:start position:0%
actually takes 11 years uh which is
 
01:02:58.789 --> 01:02:58.799 align:start position:0%
almost three times that three-year limit
 
01:03:00.789 --> 01:03:00.799 align:start position:0%
that's currently being set wrongful
 
01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
conviction work is very slow for lots of
 
01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
reasons it's hard to find case documents
 
01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
in the years after things um are closed
 
01:03:09.950 --> 01:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
and resolved Witnesses die they move on
 
01:03:11.470 --> 01:03:11.480 align:start position:0%
and scientific understanding which we
 
01:03:14.309 --> 01:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
will talk a little bit about has changed
 
01:03:17.470 --> 01:03:17.480 align:start position:0%
um as an example I've been litig
 
01:03:19.109 --> 01:03:19.119 align:start position:0%
litigating a case in New Hampshire since
 
01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
I started in
 
01:03:24.269 --> 01:03:24.279 align:start position:0%
2019 uh this case is from 1988 um this
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
was brought to the Court's attention in
 
01:03:27.950 --> 01:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
2022 and the Attorney General's office
 
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
just in 2024 found new evidence in the
 
01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
case and it's been with the Attorney
 
01:03:34.069 --> 01:03:34.079 align:start position:0%
General's office for 2
 
01:03:36.670 --> 01:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
years it's not a fault issue they did
 
01:03:38.349 --> 01:03:38.359 align:start position:0%
find the box but it took two years to
 
01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
find it um and we're in this space where
 
01:03:43.309 --> 01:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
we can't find the evidence for two years
 
01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
a three-year statute of limitations is
 
01:03:48.029 --> 01:03:48.039 align:start position:0%
unduly burdensome um and is preventing
 
01:03:50.589 --> 01:03:50.599 align:start position:0%
viable claims from moving forward the
 
01:03:52.349 --> 01:03:52.359 align:start position:0%
current statute also doesn't account for
 
01:03:55.109 --> 01:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
changes in science so as uh Senator
 
01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
Whitley explained exped there's been
 
01:03:58.670 --> 01:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
this um Discovery in terms of bitemark
 
01:04:00.750 --> 01:04:00.760 align:start position:0%
evidence and that's Gary's case and I
 
01:04:02.549 --> 01:04:02.559 align:start position:0%
will speak specifically to the facts of
 
01:04:05.630 --> 01:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
Gary's case um but also there's been
 
01:04:07.870 --> 01:04:07.880 align:start position:0%
other science and scientific
 
01:04:08.829 --> 01:04:08.839 align:start position:0%
understandings that have changed so
 
01:04:11.349 --> 01:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
arson science uh pattern matching so all
 
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
the handwriting fingerprinting all of
 
01:04:15.390 --> 01:04:15.400 align:start position:0%
these kinds of things have changed over
 
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
time and we can't account for that with
 
01:04:20.309 --> 01:04:20.319 align:start position:0%
this statute so if arson science at one
 
01:04:23.269 --> 01:04:23.279 align:start position:0%
point in time we had a we have a case um
 
01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:26.200 align:start position:0%
named Victor Rosario uh the man was
 
01:04:29.549 --> 01:04:29.559 align:start position:0%
charged with arson uh uh they alleged
 
01:04:31.390 --> 01:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
that he had used a Molotov cocktail to
 
01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:33.400 align:start position:0%
start a fire in a building as it turns
 
01:04:35.150 --> 01:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
out fire science has now revealed that
 
01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
the fire was not set purposefully and
 
01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
was actually set set accidentally it was
 
01:04:42.510 --> 01:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
a wiring defect in the building
 
01:04:44.269 --> 01:04:44.279 align:start position:0%
meanwhile Victor Rosario sat in prison
 
01:04:46.029 --> 01:04:46.039 align:start position:0%
for 25 years for a crime he didn't
 
01:04:48.150 --> 01:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
commit if we had been in this space with
 
01:04:50.829 --> 01:04:50.839 align:start position:0%
this statute of limitations in this
 
01:04:53.069 --> 01:04:53.079 align:start position:0%
state Victor's case would never have
 
01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
come to light because we still would
 
01:04:55.789 --> 01:04:55.799 align:start position:0%
have been in the position where we could
 
01:04:58.750 --> 01:04:58.760 align:start position:0%
address that because of this statute um
 
01:05:00.789 --> 01:05:00.799 align:start position:0%
a lot of new other things have have come
 
01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
to into play and and you know we're
 
01:05:04.349 --> 01:05:04.359 align:start position:0%
aware of that hair comparisons blood
 
01:05:05.950 --> 01:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
stain pattern all of those sorts of
 
01:05:08.510 --> 01:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
things um and it's not just this
 
01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
discredited science but it's these
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
advances in Sciences um you know we've
 
01:05:14.309 --> 01:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
talked about DNA and there is a separate
 
01:05:16.390 --> 01:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
Statute in the state for DNA
 
01:05:20.309 --> 01:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
exonerations um but DNA uh can be useful
 
01:05:22.829 --> 01:05:22.839 align:start position:0%
in different ways um and that three-year
 
01:05:25.470 --> 01:05:25.480 align:start position:0%
limitation can still uh inhibit us there
 
01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
as as well not only is it true that only
 
01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
six states have absolute time bars but
 
01:05:34.029 --> 01:05:34.039 align:start position:0%
32 have no time limits um for these new
 
01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
trial motions and what we're trying to
 
01:05:38.430 --> 01:05:38.440 align:start position:0%
do is really as Senator Whitley
 
01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
highlighted bring New Hampshire in line
 
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
with the rest of the country um I want
 
01:05:45.430 --> 01:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
to address a couple of points and I I
 
01:05:46.789 --> 01:05:46.799 align:start position:0%
know one of the things that we've been
 
01:05:49.470 --> 01:05:49.480 align:start position:0%
talking about with the um County
 
01:05:50.990 --> 01:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
attorneys and the attorney generals is
 
01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
the concern that this amendment will be
 
01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:56.150 align:start position:0%
the concern that this amendment will be
um

01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:58.109 --> 01:05:58.119 align:start position:0%
like a change to the standard and how
 
01:06:00.069 --> 01:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
the court will consider what can be
 
01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:01.880 align:start position:0%
grounds for a new trial what I would
 
01:06:04.190 --> 01:06:04.200 align:start position:0%
tell the committee is that that standard
 
01:06:06.390 --> 01:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
is laid out in RSA
 
01:06:09.510 --> 01:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
5261 we are not changing amending
 
01:06:13.309 --> 01:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
adjusting trying to adjust that standard
 
01:06:15.789 --> 01:06:15.799 align:start position:0%
it's spelled out what when a new trial
 
01:06:18.069 --> 01:06:18.079 align:start position:0%
can be granted and that standard is the
 
01:06:19.589 --> 01:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
standard and will be the standard and
 
01:06:22.269 --> 01:06:22.279 align:start position:0%
we're not trying to change that this
 
01:06:24.670 --> 01:06:24.680 align:start position:0%
bill is only meant to request a change
 
01:06:26.589 --> 01:06:26.599 align:start position:0%
in when we can petition so we're just
 
01:06:28.789 --> 01:06:28.799 align:start position:0%
trying to ask the court right now we
 
01:06:30.750 --> 01:06:30.760 align:start position:0%
can't even ask the court to consider
 
01:06:33.029 --> 01:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
things we're just trying to ask the
 
01:06:34.910 --> 01:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
court to look at it whether it will be
 
01:06:37.349 --> 01:06:37.359 align:start position:0%
granted or not that standard Remains the
 
01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
Same so that's one specific issue uh I
 
01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:41.960 align:start position:0%
know that the County attorneys and are
 
01:06:43.870 --> 01:06:43.880 align:start position:0%
have raised that you know the language
 
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
would be uh usable in that way I think
 
01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
the language as is forecloses that
 
01:06:51.269 --> 01:06:51.279 align:start position:0%
because it's very specific that this is
 
01:06:53.230 --> 01:06:53.240 align:start position:0%
regarding the time limit and doesn't
 
01:06:54.750 --> 01:06:54.760 align:start position:0%
change anything about the standard and
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
the standard is SP out in 5261 with no
 
01:06:59.950 --> 01:06:59.960 align:start position:0%
amendments um with respect to Mr cisari
 
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
who's Gary that Senator Whitley
 
01:07:04.309 --> 01:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
mentioned the reality of that case was
 
01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
that the original suspect in that case
 
01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:08.480 align:start position:0%
was a man named Michael the police had
 
01:07:10.470 --> 01:07:10.480 align:start position:0%
written him off because he had told them
 
01:07:12.589 --> 01:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
that he didn't do it it turns out that
 
01:07:16.029 --> 01:07:16.039 align:start position:0%
it was his DNA that was uh found on her
 
01:07:19.789 --> 01:07:19.799 align:start position:0%
and on the uh stuff at the scene he had
 
01:07:23.069 --> 01:07:23.079 align:start position:0%
already died so he was not prosecuted
 
01:07:25.870 --> 01:07:25.880 align:start position:0%
however while he was out he committed
 
01:07:28.269 --> 01:07:28.279 align:start position:0%
additional rapes and murders in the
 
01:07:30.589 --> 01:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
community um and so that was something
 
01:07:32.430 --> 01:07:32.440 align:start position:0%
that could have been addressed if we had
 
01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
known um in terms of the new scientific
 
01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
understanding um representative Ming
 
01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
that you had asked about that language
 
01:07:42.549 --> 01:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
is used in other states um it's used in
 
01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
regards to a different uh statute so in
 
01:07:47.390 --> 01:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that language is used in
 
01:07:49.950 --> 01:07:49.960 align:start position:0%
terms of granting new Motions like the
 
01:07:52.349 --> 01:07:52.359 align:start position:0%
substance of new motions so it has been
 
01:07:54.510 --> 01:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
interpreted but not in the context of
 
01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
the changing the stat of limitations but
 
01:07:58.990 --> 01:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
we add that because there's a difference
 
01:08:00.950 --> 01:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
between these discredited sciences and a
 
01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:02.839 align:start position:0%
new scientific understanding of an old
 
01:08:05.109 --> 01:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
science so we know that DNA has changed
 
01:08:07.230 --> 01:08:07.240 align:start position:0%
so much over the years even in 2002 we
 
01:08:09.269 --> 01:08:09.279 align:start position:0%
were using what's called rflp testing we
 
01:08:11.029 --> 01:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
don't use that anymore hardly at all we
 
01:08:13.870 --> 01:08:13.880 align:start position:0%
now use PCR testing for example but if I
 
01:08:15.630 --> 01:08:15.640 align:start position:0%
came into court and said I want to argue
 
01:08:17.430 --> 01:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
DNA testing you would say we had DNA
 
01:08:19.789 --> 01:08:19.799 align:start position:0%
testing in you know 2003 and I would say
 
01:08:22.030 --> 01:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
to you we have much more exacting DNA
 
01:08:24.510 --> 01:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
testing that can collect that can detect
 
01:08:26.630 --> 01:08:26.640 align:start position:0%
that can uh be used with more paral
 
01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
profiles with less information than we
 
01:08:30.390 --> 01:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
could back in the day so it has been
 
01:08:32.189 --> 01:08:32.199 align:start position:0%
defined in other places not in New
 
01:08:34.110 --> 01:08:34.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hasn't been used here but the
 
01:08:36.349 --> 01:08:36.359 align:start position:0%
way it's been used in other places is
 
01:08:37.789 --> 01:08:37.799 align:start position:0%
different than the way we're using it in
 
01:08:40.189 --> 01:08:40.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the scientific
 
01:08:41.950 --> 01:08:41.960 align:start position:0%
understanding would still be governed by
 
01:08:43.789 --> 01:08:43.799 align:start position:0%
dabert which is the Court's test in
 
01:08:45.910 --> 01:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
terms of determining whether new science
 
01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
and new scientific theories and
 
01:08:48.510 --> 01:08:48.520 align:start position:0%
techniques would be acceptable in the
 
01:08:50.829 --> 01:08:50.839 align:start position:0%
courtroom that would still apply so the
 
01:08:52.590 --> 01:08:52.600 align:start position:0%
court would still be able to evaluate
 
01:08:54.510 --> 01:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
that we're not in any way trying to
 
01:08:56.990 --> 01:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
introduce something that would be
 
01:08:59.749 --> 01:08:59.759 align:start position:0%
upsetting to that case law or in any way
 
01:09:03.229 --> 01:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
subvert it or uh get around it um I'm
 
01:09:05.709 --> 01:09:05.719 align:start position:0%
happy to take any other questions other
 
01:09:07.110 --> 01:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
questions for this
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
witness yes representative Manos thank
 
01:09:12.309 --> 01:09:12.319 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you for taking my question
 
01:09:14.789 --> 01:09:14.799 align:start position:0%
as I read the the bill it would apply to
 
01:09:17.349 --> 01:09:17.359 align:start position:0%
both civil and criminal cases is that
 
01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
correct that's true so actually this
 
01:09:20.590 --> 01:09:20.600 align:start position:0%
this is one of the things that we've
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
been having a lot of discussions about
 
01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
is this statute was originally drafted
 
01:09:26.269 --> 01:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
to apply only to civil cases and it's
 
01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
been interpreted through case law to
 
01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
apply to criminal cases because there is
 
01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
no separate uh statute of liit Statute
 
01:09:34.749 --> 01:09:34.759 align:start position:0%
of uh for a new trial for criminal cases
 
01:09:36.269 --> 01:09:36.279 align:start position:0%
so it's been interpreted to apply to
 
01:09:38.590 --> 01:09:38.600 align:start position:0%
both so that's that's correct however
 
01:09:40.110 --> 01:09:40.120 align:start position:0%
the language that we've specifically
 
01:09:41.910 --> 01:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
written in here is that the motion for
 
01:09:43.829 --> 01:09:43.839 align:start position:0%
new trial and any criminal conviction so
 
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
the bill itself the the law itself does
 
01:09:47.749 --> 01:09:47.759 align:start position:0%
apply to civil cases but the amendment
 
01:09:49.749 --> 01:09:49.759 align:start position:0%
that we're making only applies in
 
01:09:51.189 --> 01:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
criminal cases so I draw your attention
 
01:09:52.870 --> 01:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
to section two where it says this time
 
01:09:54.149 --> 01:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
limit shall not apply to a motion for
 
01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
new trial in any Criminal conviction so
 
01:09:58.950 --> 01:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
it it actually doesn't apply uh to these
 
01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
civil cases although the bill the law as
 
01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
a whole does apply in civil cases but
 
01:10:05.950 --> 01:10:05.960 align:start position:0%
our Amendment does not other questions
 
01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
for this witness so I just I guess I
 
01:10:09.709 --> 01:10:09.719 align:start position:0%
have one is is this three-year
 
01:10:12.510 --> 01:10:12.520 align:start position:0%
limitation really of of particular
 
01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
significance given that you have habius
 
01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
Corpus available so the thing about
 
01:10:19.470 --> 01:10:19.480 align:start position:0%
habius Corpus is that as the court as
 
01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
that as you're very well aware judge
 
01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
that would um that would return uh your
 
01:10:25.870 --> 01:10:25.880 align:start position:0%
case to the only to the the court where
 
01:10:28.030 --> 01:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
the body is held so conquered or Berlin
 
01:10:29.669 --> 01:10:29.679 align:start position:0%
for the most part for us for folks that
 
01:10:29.679 --> 01:10:30.550 align:start position:0%
for the most part for us for folks that
are

01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:10:34.110 --> 01:10:34.120 align:start position:0%
incarcerated the court of of conviction
 
01:10:35.550 --> 01:10:35.560 align:start position:0%
which is where a new trial would be
 
01:10:37.229 --> 01:10:37.239 align:start position:0%
heard is really the proper court for
 
01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
these cases to be heard in because this
 
01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:41.080 align:start position:0%
is the court that you know originally
 
01:10:42.669 --> 01:10:42.679 align:start position:0%
held the case and has all the evidence
 
01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
and has heard the case in the first
 
01:10:45.669 --> 01:10:45.679 align:start position:0%
instance so the hope is is that that
 
01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
Court would be able to correct their own
 
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
errors in that instance I think the
 
01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
other issue is that habius Corpus has
 
01:10:52.990 --> 01:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
sort of different standards than the
 
01:10:55.070 --> 01:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
motion for new trial we've always had
 
01:10:57.870 --> 01:10:57.880 align:start position:0%
these sort of separate um there's sort
 
01:10:59.470 --> 01:10:59.480 align:start position:0%
of three main ways to get back into
 
01:11:01.110 --> 01:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
court in New Hampshire following a
 
01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
conviction there's a habius corpus uh
 
01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
provision there's the motion for new
 
01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
trial which is spelled out in 526 and
 
01:11:09.550 --> 01:11:09.560 align:start position:0%
then there's the DNA statute which is
 
01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
specific to DNA and allows you to get in
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
on new DNA testing if you can get that
 
01:11:15.550 --> 01:11:15.560 align:start position:0%
from the court I think this is a
 
01:11:18.030 --> 01:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
separate and important um statute
 
01:11:19.470 --> 01:11:19.480 align:start position:0%
because it is a different standard than
 
01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
the hab standard and it puts it back in
 
01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
the court where it was first heard okay
 
01:11:25.590 --> 01:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
all right other question represent
 
01:11:28.270 --> 01:11:28.280 align:start position:0%
minutes I just wanted to follow up what
 
01:11:32.830 --> 01:11:32.840 align:start position:0%
was the rationale excuse me for limiting
 
01:11:35.430 --> 01:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
um this to criminal convictions I mean
 
01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
our concern as for because we're the New
 
01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
England Innocence Project is really
 
01:11:41.629 --> 01:11:41.639 align:start position:0%
solely based around criminal convictions
 
01:11:44.229 --> 01:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
that are are wrongfully occurred I I
 
01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:46.360 align:start position:0%
really couldn't speak to as all loyers
 
01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
will tell you we really know just our
 
01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
little field and the things that should
 
01:11:53.070 --> 01:11:53.080 align:start position:0%
go outside I I couldn't tell you so and
 
01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
from our perspective the main concern is
 
01:11:56.750 --> 01:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
Criminal convictions we don't have the
 
01:11:59.149 --> 01:11:59.159 align:start position:0%
same uh perspective and we don't bring
 
01:12:01.629 --> 01:12:01.639 align:start position:0%
the same knowledge to the Civil field
 
01:12:03.870 --> 01:12:03.880 align:start position:0%
other question representative
 
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
Alexander thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um if this bill
 
01:12:11.310 --> 01:12:11.320 align:start position:0%
were to pass could you see almost
 
01:12:12.629 --> 01:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
everybody in the Department of
 
01:12:14.709 --> 01:12:14.719 align:start position:0%
Corrections filing a
 
01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
petition for newly discovered evidence
 
01:12:20.270 --> 01:12:20.280 align:start position:0%
um I I mean I see this as like I mean
 
01:12:22.110 --> 01:12:22.120 align:start position:0%
indeterminable increase but I see this
 
01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
as like really big increase like
 
01:12:26.590 --> 01:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
everybody could file a petition and and
 
01:12:28.590 --> 01:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
try to get the courts to get them to
 
01:12:30.110 --> 01:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
overturn their case like this seems like
 
01:12:33.470 --> 01:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
a like a mess so uh again we're not
 
01:12:35.629 --> 01:12:35.639 align:start position:0%
changing the standard so the standard
 
01:12:38.189 --> 01:12:38.199 align:start position:0%
for granting a new trial Remains the
 
01:12:40.669 --> 01:12:40.679 align:start position:0%
Same that's RSA
 
01:12:43.870 --> 01:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
5261 that standard is still in place so
 
01:12:45.669 --> 01:12:45.679 align:start position:0%
in terms of the Court screening out
 
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
these cases they still would be able to
 
01:12:51.270 --> 01:12:51.280 align:start position:0%
do that through RSA 5261 we're allowing
 
01:12:55.390 --> 01:12:55.400 align:start position:0%
additional people to apply for uh to ask
 
01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
the court to hear their cases the
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
Practical reality is having been a
 
01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
public defender for a very long time
 
01:13:02.790 --> 01:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
although there is sort of a common idea
 
01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
that everybody in prison is innocent
 
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
that is actually not the case um and
 
01:13:10.669 --> 01:13:10.679 align:start position:0%
they actually don't say that very often
 
01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
most of our cases resolved by plea and
 
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
the Practical reality is that um folks
 
01:13:18.910 --> 01:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
that will be in those positions uh to
 
01:13:21.310 --> 01:13:21.320 align:start position:0%
ask for new trials those motions would
 
01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
be immediately uh identifiable as
 
01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
uncredible and uh the court could screen
 
01:13:30.270 --> 01:13:30.280 align:start position:0%
them out there would be there is no uh
 
01:13:33.390 --> 01:13:33.400 align:start position:0%
guaranteed right for Council there is no
 
01:13:36.390 --> 01:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
additional uh there would be no
 
01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
additional um cost incurred and the
 
01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
reality is is that I I don't think
 
01:13:44.189 --> 01:13:44.199 align:start position:0%
people would take advantage of this I
 
01:13:46.229 --> 01:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
think that's one of these alarm bells
 
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
that people ring anytime we try to give
 
01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
people additional rights but the
 
01:13:51.870 --> 01:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
Practical reality is is that we're
 
01:13:54.189 --> 01:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
keeping out valid and legitimate and
 
01:13:57.229 --> 01:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
important claims of actual innocence in
 
01:13:59.830 --> 01:13:59.840 align:start position:0%
the event uh you know if we were if we
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
were to say this is too big of a
 
01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
Floodgate is that we're opening we're
 
01:14:05.390 --> 01:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
closing these doors to very valid and
 
01:14:08.270 --> 01:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
very problematic innocence claims uh in
 
01:14:11.229 --> 01:14:11.239 align:start position:0%
order to not Dison inconvenience the
 
01:14:13.310 --> 01:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
court other question
 
01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
representative yeses I'm just thinking
 
01:14:19.390 --> 01:14:19.400 align:start position:0%
just the staff time of having a somebody
 
01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
in the court screen out all of these
 
01:14:26.030 --> 01:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
cases that in itself I I think I haven't
 
01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:28.520 align:start position:0%
like spoken to inmates recently but I
 
01:14:30.870 --> 01:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
think that any one of them will want to
 
01:14:33.310 --> 01:14:33.320 align:start position:0%
at least file a petition to overturn
 
01:14:35.870 --> 01:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
their conviction they still have the
 
01:14:37.149 --> 01:14:37.159 align:start position:0%
ability to do that within that
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
three-year time period so if they were
 
01:14:40.669 --> 01:14:40.679 align:start position:0%
going to do that on that basis they can
 
01:14:42.669 --> 01:14:42.679 align:start position:0%
always file that within that three-year
 
01:14:45.310 --> 01:14:45.320 align:start position:0%
time period as it stands now so if it
 
01:14:46.990 --> 01:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
was the case that they were intending to
 
01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
file that there should have been some
 
01:14:49.950 --> 01:14:49.960 align:start position:0%
sort of flood in litigation in those
 
01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
initial first three years and there just
 
01:14:54.310 --> 01:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
isn't so the Practical reality is that's
 
01:14:56.350 --> 01:14:56.360 align:start position:0%
just not born out by the way the numbers
 
01:14:59.830 --> 01:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
work um at this point in time anyway
 
01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:02.350 align:start position:0%
work um at this point in time anyway
representative

01:15:02.350 --> 01:15:02.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:15:04.270 --> 01:15:04.280 align:start position:0%
katab thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I guess I'd
 
01:15:08.669 --> 01:15:08.679 align:start position:0%
like to know how many are currently
 
01:15:10.270 --> 01:15:10.280 align:start position:0%
within that three-year time period
 
01:15:12.110 --> 01:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
actually filing something because I do
 
01:15:14.629 --> 01:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
share a similar concern and it's not
 
01:15:17.790 --> 01:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
clear in this bill if these petitions
 
01:15:20.030 --> 01:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
would just be reviewed by the court or
 
01:15:21.790 --> 01:15:21.800 align:start position:0%
if everybody would be granted
 
01:15:23.430 --> 01:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
potentially a hearing before a judge and
 
01:15:25.030 --> 01:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
I could see this as a way resp
 
01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
respectfully for an inmate to say well
 
01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
i' I'd like to go on a field trip to the
 
01:15:32.430 --> 01:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
court I mean and I do mean that
 
01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
respectfully but when you're
 
01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
incarcerated and you can't get out I
 
01:15:37.110 --> 01:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
could see somebody being like it would
 
01:15:38.310 --> 01:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
be nice to get out for a day and go to
 
01:15:39.709 --> 01:15:39.719 align:start position:0%
the court I can actually get some fresh
 
01:15:41.629 --> 01:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
air and and and go somewhere for a day
 
01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
see some other people um and and I again
 
01:15:45.390 --> 01:15:45.400 align:start position:0%
I do mean that respectfully but I think
 
01:15:47.070 --> 01:15:47.080 align:start position:0%
when you're incarcerated for a long
 
01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
period of time especially the people
 
01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
that potentially are in there with life
 
01:15:53.229 --> 01:15:53.239 align:start position:0%
in prison and and don't routinely get to
 
01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
leave so how many do you do you have
 
01:15:56.950 --> 01:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
numbers about how many who do file
 
01:15:58.990 --> 01:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
within three years in I don't work for
 
01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
the court so I don't have those numbers
 
01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
and I couldn't tell you what I can tell
 
01:16:04.629 --> 01:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
you is having been uh in contact
 
01:16:05.790 --> 01:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
regularly with folks that are
 
01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
incarcerated most folks don't want to
 
01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
leave the prison and come down to the
 
01:16:10.629 --> 01:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
jail which is where they would have to
 
01:16:11.870 --> 01:16:11.880 align:start position:0%
be if they were going to be held
 
01:16:13.790 --> 01:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
somewhere else and that's really not
 
01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
something that they're interested in
 
01:16:17.110 --> 01:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
doing um it's actually very difficult to
 
01:16:18.590 --> 01:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
leave and come back because of the
 
01:16:20.430 --> 01:16:20.440 align:start position:0%
trauma of incarceration and then being
 
01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
reexposed to a community beyond that to
 
01:16:25.229 --> 01:16:25.239 align:start position:0%
return back into um the prison after
 
01:16:26.990 --> 01:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
that is actually extremely traumatizing
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
and most people don't want to do that
 
01:16:31.030 --> 01:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness
 
01:16:34.149 --> 01:16:34.159 align:start position:0%
representative tur thanks and thanks for
 
01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
taking the question um I guess looking
 
01:16:38.669 --> 01:16:38.679 align:start position:0%
at the the the language of this it's
 
01:16:40.950 --> 01:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
basically hinges on newly discovered
 
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
evidence and new testing and scientific
 
01:16:46.270 --> 01:16:46.280 align:start position:0%
understanding is it your sense that
 
01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
these petitions could be filed
 
01:16:50.910 --> 01:16:50.920 align:start position:0%
iteratively um in the future in other
 
01:16:53.709 --> 01:16:53.719 align:start position:0%
words this is not sort of a single
 
01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to file for a new case
 
01:16:59.070 --> 01:16:59.080 align:start position:0%
but you know I mean new scientific uh
 
01:17:00.590 --> 01:17:00.600 align:start position:0%
methods are coming out every day I'm
 
01:17:02.070 --> 01:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
wondering whether or not this could lead
 
01:17:05.110 --> 01:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
to to to representative Alexander's case
 
01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
you know a a lot of retrying and
 
01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
repetition I think in the event that a
 
01:17:12.390 --> 01:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
new scientific understanding arises that
 
01:17:14.070 --> 01:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
shows that you are innocent you should
 
01:17:15.870 --> 01:17:15.880 align:start position:0%
be able to come back into court and make
 
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
that argument so every time new
 
01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
scientific understanding of a piece of
 
01:17:22.390 --> 01:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
evidence comes to court and says this is
 
01:17:24.030 --> 01:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
something that this is evidence that we
 
01:17:25.629 --> 01:17:25.639 align:start position:0%
should not have taken into the courtroom
 
01:17:27.550 --> 01:17:27.560 align:start position:0%
in the first instance and this is not
 
01:17:29.149 --> 01:17:29.159 align:start position:0%
evidence that we should be relying on
 
01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
because this is not reliable this is not
 
01:17:33.709 --> 01:17:33.719 align:start position:0%
accurate and this is not scientific the
 
01:17:35.550 --> 01:17:35.560 align:start position:0%
court should be willing to adjust its
 
01:17:37.550 --> 01:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
own practices to allow those cases to
 
01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
come back to court so to the extent that
 
01:17:40.830 --> 01:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
a new scientific understanding is going
 
01:17:42.510 --> 01:17:42.520 align:start position:0%
to generate additional petitions down
 
01:17:44.310 --> 01:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
the line I hope that that's exactly what
 
01:17:45.790 --> 01:17:45.800 align:start position:0%
happens because that's how the statute
 
01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
is supposed to function if the concern
 
01:17:49.390 --> 01:17:49.400 align:start position:0%
is is that there are going to be
 
01:17:51.910 --> 01:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
frivolous petitions the reality is is
 
01:17:54.110 --> 01:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
that as I said the standard Remains the
 
01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
Same and the court Court can still say
 
01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
this is a frivolous petition based on
 
01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
nothing this only allows us to ask the
 
01:18:02.790 --> 01:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
court to hear the petition that was the
 
01:18:04.110 --> 01:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
case for the three-year statute of
 
01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
limitations to begin with so we don't
 
01:18:06.990 --> 01:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
think there would be additional
 
01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
frivolous petitions filed under this
 
01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
under this uh motion under this uh
 
01:18:14.510 --> 01:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment and if there was going to be
 
01:18:15.870 --> 01:18:15.880 align:start position:0%
frivolous petitions filed they would
 
01:18:17.229 --> 01:18:17.239 align:start position:0%
have been filed in those three years
 
01:18:19.149 --> 01:18:19.159 align:start position:0%
anyway and to the extent that additional
 
01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
petitions are going to be filed because
 
01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
there's new science or new understanding
 
01:18:24.270 --> 01:18:24.280 align:start position:0%
of evidence that was presented in a case
 
01:18:26.510 --> 01:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
they should be
 
01:18:28.709 --> 01:18:28.719 align:start position:0%
of course yep uh so just one follow-up
 
01:18:31.669 --> 01:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
question um I'm wondering you know it
 
01:18:34.790 --> 01:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
sounds like essentially you know there's
 
01:18:36.390 --> 01:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
no real standard for what would
 
01:18:38.669 --> 01:18:38.679 align:start position:0%
constitute new or different so you could
 
01:18:41.470 --> 01:18:41.480 align:start position:0%
sort of come back almost immediately you
 
01:18:43.310 --> 01:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
know and claim that there's an an
 
01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
additional modification to I'm wondering
 
01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
whether or not something like a time
 
01:18:51.229 --> 01:18:51.239 align:start position:0%
limit in terms of how soon after one is
 
01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
turned down you could come back again
 
01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
would be something that you would think
 
01:18:58.590 --> 01:18:58.600 align:start position:0%
would be useful I mean I don't because I
 
01:19:00.030 --> 01:19:00.040 align:start position:0%
think that the reality is is when we
 
01:19:02.229 --> 01:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
think about DNA testing in 2003 which
 
01:19:03.870 --> 01:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
was 20 years ago and we think about it
 
01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
now it's completely different and the
 
01:19:06.990 --> 01:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
science is completely different so the
 
01:19:08.629 --> 01:19:08.639 align:start position:0%
Practical reality is saying oh well you
 
01:19:10.590 --> 01:19:10.600 align:start position:0%
had the ability to do rflp testing and
 
01:19:12.030 --> 01:19:12.040 align:start position:0%
you didn't take advantage of that and
 
01:19:13.310 --> 01:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
now I don't want you to be able to do
 
01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
anything with that for a while I think
 
01:19:18.189 --> 01:19:18.199 align:start position:0%
is uh like inhibitory and allows people
 
01:19:19.510 --> 01:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
to continue to sit in prison for
 
01:19:21.629 --> 01:19:21.639 align:start position:0%
something they didn't do so our main
 
01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
concern is that we don't want people to
 
01:19:25.070 --> 01:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
sit in prison for any longer than they
 
01:19:27.070 --> 01:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
need to be sitting in prison our concern
 
01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
in this case is freeing people that are
 
01:19:31.270 --> 01:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
innocent so the Practical reality is
 
01:19:33.430 --> 01:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
we've we've put nothing in here about
 
01:19:38.189 --> 01:19:38.199 align:start position:0%
adjusting for errors of law or uh F what
 
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
we what we call uh legal innocence so
 
01:19:42.229 --> 01:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
the legal innocence claims would be
 
01:19:44.430 --> 01:19:44.440 align:start position:0%
things like they had a warrant but the
 
01:19:46.390 --> 01:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
warrant didn't have the proper basis so
 
01:19:47.270 --> 01:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't have been able to get in
 
01:19:50.229 --> 01:19:50.239 align:start position:0%
my house that's not the same issues that
 
01:19:52.830 --> 01:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
we addressing by by this amendment we're
 
01:19:55.310 --> 01:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
addressing factual innocence which is a
 
01:19:57.390 --> 01:19:57.400 align:start position:0%
completely different and much more
 
01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:00.750 align:start position:0%
completely different and much more
significant

01:20:00.750 --> 01:20:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:03.149 --> 01:20:03.159 align:start position:0%
question yes representative D Lorenzo
 
01:20:04.709 --> 01:20:04.719 align:start position:0%
and then representative grion uh thank
 
01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:20:08.990 --> 01:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
question are there any advocacy groups
 
01:20:12.310 --> 01:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
in the prison that help um convicted
 
01:20:14.629 --> 01:20:14.639 align:start position:0%
people with working on a claim sort of
 
01:20:18.149 --> 01:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
like this so that's a great question um
 
01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
the at this point in time although there
 
01:20:23.030 --> 01:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
is a group of folks uh that are within
 
01:20:26.189 --> 01:20:26.199 align:start position:0%
the prison that sort of help each other
 
01:20:28.149 --> 01:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
um there isn't an advocacy group aware
 
01:20:29.709 --> 01:20:29.719 align:start position:0%
that I'm aware of other than sort of the
 
01:20:32.070 --> 01:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
ACLU that can help people and the ACLU
 
01:20:33.669 --> 01:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't do factual innocence so we're
 
01:20:37.229 --> 01:20:37.239 align:start position:0%
the only ones um and we have no unique
 
01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
access to being able to help folks
 
01:20:40.470 --> 01:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
unless they apply to us know about us
 
01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
and reach out to us yes representative
 
01:20:46.070 --> 01:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
gon thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:20:48.189 --> 01:20:48.199 align:start position:0%
your for the information you've provided
 
01:20:49.750 --> 01:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
for us it
 
01:20:52.629 --> 01:20:52.639 align:start position:0%
uh the question I have is in the
 
01:20:56.070 --> 01:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
language of this bill it uses the the
 
01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:57.390 align:start position:0%
language of this bill it uses the the
word

01:20:57.390 --> 01:20:57.400 align:start position:0%
word
 
01:21:00.990 --> 01:21:01.000 align:start position:0%
Avers what is the standard for avering
 
01:21:04.229 --> 01:21:04.239 align:start position:0%
something uh in a legal context and is
 
01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
that a uh tight enough standard or high
 
01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
enough standard that or would this
 
01:21:14.189 --> 01:21:14.199 align:start position:0%
potentially need to be modified
 
01:21:15.790 --> 01:21:15.800 align:start position:0%
somewhere so we don't think it needs to
 
01:21:17.629 --> 01:21:17.639 align:start position:0%
be modified so under under the the
 
01:21:19.750 --> 01:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
statute as it stands so we used the we
 
01:21:21.510 --> 01:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
had we had originally drafted using a
 
01:21:22.830 --> 01:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
different language but after we had
 
01:21:24.149 --> 01:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
spoken with the County attorneys this
 
01:21:25.149 --> 01:21:25.159 align:start position:0%
was the Lang anguage that was more
 
01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
comfortable was a so uh the reason that
 
01:21:30.430 --> 01:21:30.440 align:start position:0%
is is because I think that's like legal
 
01:21:31.950 --> 01:21:31.960 align:start position:0%
language that the courts are more
 
01:21:34.510 --> 01:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
familiar with the reason why we've
 
01:21:36.990 --> 01:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
included AES here is because this is a
 
01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
this is a this is what we're doing here
 
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
is a this is a petition standard so it's
 
01:21:44.910 --> 01:21:44.920 align:start position:0%
not a hearing standard right so the
 
01:21:48.189 --> 01:21:48.199 align:start position:0%
hearing standard is in 5261 the petition
 
01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
standard is in this this statute 5264
 
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
you know the new
 
01:21:56.830 --> 01:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
bill so all we're asking is that the
 
01:21:59.510 --> 01:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
pleadings have to allege these specific
 
01:22:02.229 --> 01:22:02.239 align:start position:0%
things that's why AES is in there it's
 
01:22:03.990 --> 01:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
not a standard of proof because we're
 
01:22:06.750 --> 01:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
not at a hearing stage so at a hearing
 
01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
stage a higher standard or must prove
 
01:22:11.470 --> 01:22:11.480 align:start position:0%
this Beyond a reasonable doubt this
 
01:22:12.910 --> 01:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing evidence this
 
01:22:15.070 --> 01:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
preponderance of evidence doesn't apply
 
01:22:16.510 --> 01:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
at a pleading standard because we're
 
01:22:18.310 --> 01:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
only laying out the the rules for a
 
01:22:19.830 --> 01:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
pleading at this point and that's why
 
01:22:22.750 --> 01:22:22.760 align:start position:0%
we've used that here other questions for
 
01:22:24.590 --> 01:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
this witness saying none Thank you very
 
01:22:30.629 --> 01:22:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:33.629 --> 01:22:33.639 align:start position:0%
please time say attorney oh all right
 
01:22:37.149 --> 01:22:37.159 align:start position:0%
sure so attorney uh alberon and attorney
 
01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
Enders attorney Ed to Deep dive into
 
01:22:41.229 --> 01:22:41.239 align:start position:0%
this swallet
 
01:22:43.870 --> 01:22:43.880 align:start position:0%
him thank you good morning my name is
 
01:22:45.350 --> 01:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
Step Anders I'm an assistant County
 
01:22:46.830 --> 01:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
Attorney at the marac county attorney's
 
01:22:48.990 --> 01:22:49.000 align:start position:0%
office with me is attorney Halverson
 
01:22:51.470 --> 01:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
who's the maram County Attorney both of
 
01:22:54.709 --> 01:22:54.719 align:start position:0%
us have been prosecutors for over 20
 
01:22:57.709 --> 01:22:57.719 align:start position:0%
years um certainly we agree with the
 
01:22:59.910 --> 01:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
spirit of the bill and don't want to see
 
01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
innocent people incarcerated and I think
 
01:23:04.270 --> 01:23:04.280 align:start position:0%
that goes without saying that all
 
01:23:06.030 --> 01:23:06.040 align:start position:0%
prosecutors I've ever spoken to everyone
 
01:23:08.070 --> 01:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
at the AG's office we all agree we don't
 
01:23:10.510 --> 01:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
want to see innocent people
 
01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
incarcerated what what strikes me about
 
01:23:17.270 --> 01:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
this is it's an amendment to RSA
 
01:23:20.830 --> 01:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
5264 and when you look at chapter 526
 
01:23:23.110 --> 01:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
it's the the chapter that deals with new
 
01:23:25.470 --> 01:23:25.480 align:start position:0%
trials one of the things about chapter
 
01:23:28.990 --> 01:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
526 is it hasn't been amended since
 
01:23:32.510 --> 01:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
1842 and that's the entire chapter
 
01:23:35.390 --> 01:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
itself is in the same condition as it
 
01:23:37.390 --> 01:23:37.400 align:start position:0%
was in
 
01:23:41.830 --> 01:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
1842 so being a curious person I pulled
 
01:23:44.590 --> 01:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
the 1842 revised statutes and this was
 
01:23:47.229 --> 01:23:47.239 align:start position:0%
originally under title 22 which was
 
01:23:50.590 --> 01:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
titled of reviews in new trials and one
 
01:23:52.709 --> 01:23:52.719 align:start position:0%
thing that that has changed in some of
 
01:23:55.950 --> 01:23:55.960 align:start position:0%
the language is the first part in in
 
01:23:59.629 --> 01:23:59.639 align:start position:0%
1842 did read in all civil actions which
 
01:24:02.030 --> 01:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
judgment has been rendered in the
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
court so certainly this only originally
 
01:24:09.310 --> 01:24:09.320 align:start position:0%
in 1842 dealt with civil
 
01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
cases um and that makes sense because
 
01:24:15.510 --> 01:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
even the language
 
01:24:18.229 --> 01:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
in you know
 
01:24:21.870 --> 01:24:21.880 align:start position:0%
5264 talks about judgments and we know
 
01:24:23.709 --> 01:24:23.719 align:start position:0%
that judgment is a civil thing it's it's
 
01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
not part of the criminal context and we
 
01:24:28.030 --> 01:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
certainly know it was civil in 1842
 
01:24:30.709 --> 01:24:30.719 align:start position:0%
because the chapter before this in 1842
 
01:24:33.030 --> 01:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
was chapter 190 that talked about all
 
01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
judgments shall be rendered in dollars
 
01:24:40.709 --> 01:24:40.719 align:start position:0%
and cents so this is language from 1842
 
01:24:43.350 --> 01:24:43.360 align:start position:0%
that doesn't necessarily fit into our
 
01:24:46.950 --> 01:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
modern context one of the other issues
 
01:24:49.030 --> 01:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
how this doesn't fit into necess modern
 
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
context is the the circuit courts were
 
01:24:53.109 --> 01:24:53.119 align:start position:0%
established in New Hampshire I believe
 
01:24:55.470 --> 01:24:55.480 align:start position:0%
in 1963
 
01:24:57.910 --> 01:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
so this statute only talks about
 
01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
petitioning in Superior Court um and
 
01:25:03.709 --> 01:25:03.719 align:start position:0%
there's case law that says this only
 
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
applies to Superior Court not
 
01:25:10.270 --> 01:25:10.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily Circuit Court
 
01:25:13.870 --> 01:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
decisions so I initially have some
 
01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
concerns about amending an 1842 statute
 
01:25:18.910 --> 01:25:18.920 align:start position:0%
that deals with civil cases in superior
 
01:25:21.550 --> 01:25:21.560 align:start position:0%
court to allow motions for new trial in
 
01:25:25.229 --> 01:25:25.239 align:start position:0%
in criminal cases as attorney M pointed
 
01:25:27.470 --> 01:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
out there is another spot in New
 
01:25:30.990 --> 01:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire statute's RSA 651 D that talks
 
01:25:35.070 --> 01:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
about postconviction DNA testing um that
 
01:25:37.109 --> 01:25:37.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't contain a statute of
 
01:25:40.430 --> 01:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
limitations and it strikes me that if
 
01:25:43.070 --> 01:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a new scientific
 
01:25:45.950 --> 01:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
understanding that perhaps instead of
 
01:25:48.709 --> 01:25:48.719 align:start position:0%
amending um
 
01:25:53.149 --> 01:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
5264 it may make sense to either expand
 
01:25:55.629 --> 01:25:55.639 align:start position:0%
the postconviction D testing to include
 
01:25:59.390 --> 01:25:59.400 align:start position:0%
other scientific methods other than DNA
 
01:26:01.470 --> 01:26:01.480 align:start position:0%
or write a completely new statute that
 
01:26:04.510 --> 01:26:04.520 align:start position:0%
talks about new scientific
 
01:26:06.510 --> 01:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
understandings when I started doing a
 
01:26:09.270 --> 01:26:09.280 align:start position:0%
little bit of research on this I found
 
01:26:12.310 --> 01:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
that Texas has what is sort of
 
01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
colloquially referred to as a junk
 
01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
science Statute in the Texas code of
 
01:26:21.750 --> 01:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
criminal procedure it's section
 
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
11.73 and that makes it clear that if
 
01:26:25.870 --> 01:26:25.880 align:start position:0%
there's a new scientific understanding
 
01:26:28.669 --> 01:26:28.679 align:start position:0%
that that can form the basis for a Hab
 
01:26:30.950 --> 01:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
um at least in Texas and that may make
 
01:26:33.109 --> 01:26:33.119 align:start position:0%
sense to to have a statute similar to
 
01:26:35.070 --> 01:26:35.080 align:start position:0%
that in New
 
01:26:37.870 --> 01:26:37.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I certainly agree that I was
 
01:26:40.149 --> 01:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
at the table when we initially
 
01:26:42.750 --> 01:26:42.760 align:start position:0%
discussed um the language here as was
 
01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:43.629 align:start position:0%
discussed um the language here as was
attorney

01:26:43.629 --> 01:26:43.639 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
Halverson and we tried to come up with
 
01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
language that again limited this to
 
01:26:51.270 --> 01:26:51.280 align:start position:0%
criminal cases Our concern with civil
 
01:26:54.350 --> 01:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
cases was at some point I think in civil
 
01:26:57.390 --> 01:26:57.400 align:start position:0%
cases you want a final judgment we I
 
01:26:59.310 --> 01:26:59.320 align:start position:0%
know we had talked about like a motion
 
01:27:01.510 --> 01:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
of quiet title on real estate that if
 
01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
that you could file a a motion for a new
 
01:27:06.149 --> 01:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
trial forever after that you could never
 
01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
never necessarily have a quiet title in
 
01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:09.430 align:start position:0%
never necessarily have a quiet title in
real

01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
real
 
01:27:12.070 --> 01:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
estate but what always sort of concerned
 
01:27:14.310 --> 01:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
me and didn't feel great about this
 
01:27:16.629 --> 01:27:16.639 align:start position:0%
proposed language is
 
01:27:19.990 --> 01:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
that while attorney muso is clear that
 
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
this only changes the time frame and I
 
01:27:25.510 --> 01:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
agree changing time frame is a good
 
01:27:28.350 --> 01:27:28.360 align:start position:0%
thing it almost seems like this changes
 
01:27:31.270 --> 01:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
the process as well and the reason I say
 
01:27:33.550 --> 01:27:33.560 align:start position:0%
that is because when I first read it it
 
01:27:36.070 --> 01:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
struck me that this was changing the
 
01:27:38.750 --> 01:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
process that if you could file a motion
 
01:27:40.709 --> 01:27:40.719 align:start position:0%
that avert a new scientific
 
01:27:42.629 --> 01:27:42.639 align:start position:0%
understanding you'd essentially be
 
01:27:45.790 --> 01:27:45.800 align:start position:0%
entitled to a new trial and and I agree
 
01:27:47.629 --> 01:27:47.639 align:start position:0%
with attorney muso that's not what this
 
01:27:51.470 --> 01:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
says but I initially read it that way
 
01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
and then when we sent copies of this to
 
01:27:57.390 --> 01:27:57.400 align:start position:0%
the the Department of Justice um I know
 
01:27:59.350 --> 01:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
that there were some concerns from
 
01:28:01.229 --> 01:28:01.239 align:start position:0%
members at the AG's office that they
 
01:28:03.070 --> 01:28:03.080 align:start position:0%
thought this sort of changed the process
 
01:28:05.669 --> 01:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
as well and I know attorney lhan who's
 
01:28:07.709 --> 01:28:07.719 align:start position:0%
the Senate legal counsel had that same
 
01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
concern or at least I I interpreted that
 
01:28:12.709 --> 01:28:12.719 align:start position:0%
to be the same concern uh and we set up
 
01:28:14.310 --> 01:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
a second meeting but we were a little I
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
think too late to change anything one of
 
01:28:21.310 --> 01:28:21.320 align:start position:0%
my suggestions would be if the the
 
01:28:24.790 --> 01:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
legislature were to pass this bill and
 
01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:26.149 align:start position:0%
legislature were to pass this bill and
amend

01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
amend
 
01:28:29.070 --> 01:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
5264 what I would suggest is that to
 
01:28:30.750 --> 01:28:30.760 align:start position:0%
make it clear that we're only dealing
 
01:28:32.430 --> 01:28:32.440 align:start position:0%
with the statute of limitations and not
 
01:28:36.149 --> 01:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
the process paragraph one starts out a
 
01:28:38.830 --> 01:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
new trial shall not be granted unless
 
01:28:40.910 --> 01:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
the petition is filed within three years
 
01:28:42.310 --> 01:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
after the rendition of the Judgment
 
01:28:45.629 --> 01:28:45.639 align:start position:0%
complained of or failure of the suit and
 
01:28:47.550 --> 01:28:47.560 align:start position:0%
I would respectfully suggest that
 
01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps to make it clear that we're only
 
01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with the statute of limitations
 
01:28:54.709 --> 01:28:54.719 align:start position:0%
that paragraph one be changed to begin a
 
01:28:57.709 --> 01:28:57.719 align:start position:0%
motion for a new trial shall be
 
01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
filed within 3 years so replace the
 
01:29:03.189 --> 01:29:03.199 align:start position:0%
language a new trial shall not be
 
01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:06.719 align:start position:0%
granted unless the petition is with a
 
01:29:08.709 --> 01:29:08.719 align:start position:0%
motion for a new trial shall be filed
 
01:29:11.629 --> 01:29:11.639 align:start position:0%
within three years and that language a
 
01:29:14.070 --> 01:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
motion for a new trial is sort of stolen
 
01:29:16.350 --> 01:29:16.360 align:start position:0%
from the rules of criminal procedure
 
01:29:19.350 --> 01:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
specifically rule 43 that talks about uh
 
01:29:21.950 --> 01:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
the time frame for filing motions to
 
01:29:23.790 --> 01:29:23.800 align:start position:0%
reconsider uh but I think that would
 
01:29:26.550 --> 01:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
help make it clearer that this only
 
01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
deals with the time frame and and not
 
01:29:31.430 --> 01:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
the process I'm not sure if attorney how
 
01:29:33.109 --> 01:29:33.119 align:start position:0%
anything to add and I know I'd be happy
 
01:29:35.229 --> 01:29:35.239 align:start position:0%
to answer questions if anyone had any it
 
01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
all comes down it all comes down to the
 
01:29:39.910 --> 01:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
um statute limitations issue I agree
 
01:29:42.109 --> 01:29:42.119 align:start position:0%
with with attorney endress uh with his
 
01:29:45.109 --> 01:29:45.119 align:start position:0%
recommended change on line five there um
 
01:29:46.629 --> 01:29:46.639 align:start position:0%
there was a question earlier I believe
 
01:29:49.750 --> 01:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
too about using the word Aver uh I
 
01:29:50.910 --> 01:29:50.920 align:start position:0%
actually was uncomfortable with that
 
01:29:52.870 --> 01:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
word to begin with but I looked at the
 
01:29:54.430 --> 01:29:54.440 align:start position:0%
colloquial definition of of it and I
 
01:29:57.510 --> 01:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
think it fits uh so I have I have less
 
01:30:00.229 --> 01:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
um con concern about that uh I think
 
01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
there are also two questions about uh
 
01:30:04.510 --> 01:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
the number of uh petitions that may be
 
01:30:06.709 --> 01:30:06.719 align:start position:0%
filed for a new trial and granting a new
 
01:30:09.149 --> 01:30:09.159 align:start position:0%
trial how many would be granted um I
 
01:30:11.950 --> 01:30:11.960 align:start position:0%
think that question flows with what
 
01:30:14.629 --> 01:30:14.639 align:start position:0%
attorney ERS pointed out concerning our
 
01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
initial uh reading and other people's
 
01:30:19.870 --> 01:30:19.880 align:start position:0%
readings of um uh the language in
 
01:30:21.550 --> 01:30:21.560 align:start position:0%
paragra on line five that attorney
 
01:30:23.310 --> 01:30:23.320 align:start position:0%
Enders is suggesting to change to make
 
01:30:25.669 --> 01:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
it clear that this agrees uh or
 
01:30:27.550 --> 01:30:27.560 align:start position:0%
addresses only a statute limitations
 
01:30:29.790 --> 01:30:29.800 align:start position:0%
issue uh so should you wish to go
 
01:30:31.510 --> 01:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
forward with this uh that would be my
 
01:30:33.149 --> 01:30:33.159 align:start position:0%
recommendation two would be to change
 
01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:35.040 align:start position:0%
that language on line five as attorney
 
01:30:36.990 --> 01:30:37.000 align:start position:0%
endress mentioned uh other than that I
 
01:30:38.070 --> 01:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
have nothing to add to attorney
 
01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
andress's comments and glad to take your
 
01:30:43.189 --> 01:30:43.199 align:start position:0%
questions representative Smith thank you
 
01:30:48.109 --> 01:30:48.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um I found your historic
 
01:30:50.430 --> 01:30:50.440 align:start position:0%
research just fascinating and I thank
 
01:30:54.870 --> 01:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
you for the time that you put into to it
 
01:30:58.629 --> 01:30:58.639 align:start position:0%
um but now I'm looking at
 
01:31:03.030 --> 01:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
2024 and I'm looking at existing law I'm
 
01:31:06.430 --> 01:31:06.440 align:start position:0%
looking at existing practice in the last
 
01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
80 years um that has US established in
 
01:31:13.709 --> 01:31:13.719 align:start position:0%
in practice uh
 
01:31:17.149 --> 01:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
interpretations I look at uh number
 
01:31:19.950 --> 01:31:19.960 align:start position:0%
one um and realize that and there's a
 
01:31:22.669 --> 01:31:22.679 align:start position:0%
question and realize that the only
 
01:31:28.270 --> 01:31:28.280 align:start position:0%
change in number one is to take the
 
01:31:31.189 --> 01:31:31.199 align:start position:0%
language uh three and turn it to
 
01:31:31.199 --> 01:31:33.070 align:start position:0%
language uh three and turn it to
numerical

01:31:33.070 --> 01:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
numerical
 
01:31:37.510 --> 01:31:37.520 align:start position:0%
three period and then number two which
 
01:31:41.709 --> 01:31:41.719 align:start position:0%
says this time limit shall not apply to
 
01:31:45.629 --> 01:31:45.639 align:start position:0%
a motion for a new trial and goes on
 
01:31:50.229 --> 01:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
from there so my question is I
 
01:31:52.350 --> 01:31:52.360 align:start position:0%
understand that you said when you first
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
read it or when the attorney General
 
01:31:56.430 --> 01:31:56.440 align:start position:0%
first read it or perhaps when we first
 
01:31:59.990 --> 01:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
read it we thought perhaps it might mean
 
01:32:04.629 --> 01:32:04.639 align:start position:0%
this but on more careful reading we see
 
01:32:09.149 --> 01:32:09.159 align:start position:0%
clearly what is meant and therefore with
 
01:32:12.629 --> 01:32:12.639 align:start position:0%
all due respect why are there any legs
 
01:32:15.910 --> 01:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
left on your argument since on further
 
01:32:19.669 --> 01:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
reading you realized what this meant I'm
 
01:32:21.390 --> 01:32:21.400 align:start position:0%
I'm glad I can convince you that's what
 
01:32:24.229 --> 01:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
it means and I hope that if I find
 
01:32:26.750 --> 01:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
myself in front of a judge with an
 
01:32:29.070 --> 01:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
opposing attorney who's saying No this
 
01:32:32.070 --> 01:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
clearly says if we Aver newly discovered
 
01:32:33.870 --> 01:32:33.880 align:start position:0%
evidence we get a trial that I can
 
01:32:36.149 --> 01:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
convince that judge that that's not what
 
01:32:40.149 --> 01:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
it means either and that's my concern is
 
01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
that when you're dealing with the
 
01:32:44.629 --> 01:32:44.639 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system you're dealing
 
01:32:47.070 --> 01:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
with people who are making judgment
 
01:32:47.080 --> 01:32:48.350 align:start position:0%
with people who are making judgment
calls

01:32:48.350 --> 01:32:48.360 align:start position:0%
calls
 
01:32:51.990 --> 01:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
and I I'd be concerned that a judge May
 
01:32:55.590 --> 01:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps misread that
 
01:32:57.229 --> 01:32:57.239 align:start position:0%
I I don't want to belabor it's getting
 
01:33:00.390 --> 01:33:00.400 align:start position:0%
late but I do want to ask
 
01:33:04.790 --> 01:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
you acknowledging that even the members
 
01:33:09.390 --> 01:33:09.400 align:start position:0%
of the third branch of government are
 
01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
some of them at least have not been
 
01:33:14.310 --> 01:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
perfect of course we know that some have
 
01:33:17.390 --> 01:33:17.400 align:start position:0%
been perfect but others have not been
 
01:33:19.229 --> 01:33:19.239 align:start position:0%
perfect don't we
 
01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
assume that these are knowledgeable
 
01:33:26.189 --> 01:33:26.199 align:start position:0%
trained people who are in a court
 
01:33:29.550 --> 01:33:29.560 align:start position:0%
proceeding which under our law and our
 
01:33:33.189 --> 01:33:33.199 align:start position:0%
Traditions have people representing both
 
01:33:36.629 --> 01:33:36.639 align:start position:0%
sides and those attorneys are
 
01:33:40.229 --> 01:33:40.239 align:start position:0%
responsible for making sure that the
 
01:33:44.229 --> 01:33:44.239 align:start position:0%
questions are raised and answered it
 
01:33:47.910 --> 01:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
says very specifically shall not apply
 
01:33:50.510 --> 01:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
and then it goes on
 
01:33:53.189 --> 01:33:53.199 align:start position:0%
so I don't think we can expect any
 
01:33:53.199 --> 01:33:54.350 align:start position:0%
so I don't think we can expect any
legisl

01:33:54.350 --> 01:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
legisl
 
01:33:56.830 --> 01:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
to uh require
 
01:34:00.910 --> 01:34:00.920 align:start position:0%
Perfection um but isn't this specific
 
01:34:05.629 --> 01:34:05.639 align:start position:0%
language clearly stated so much so that
 
01:34:07.310 --> 01:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
when you read it more carefully you
 
01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:08.950 align:start position:0%
when you read it more carefully you
realized

01:34:08.950 --> 01:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
realized
 
01:34:11.830 --> 01:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
it I think it could be
 
01:34:15.790 --> 01:34:15.800 align:start position:0%
clearer and and I also think and I mean
 
01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
and that's why I suggest an amendment to
 
01:34:19.229 --> 01:34:19.239 align:start position:0%
change it from a new trial shall not be
 
01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
granted to a a motion shall not be filed
 
01:34:24.189 --> 01:34:24.199 align:start position:0%
because I think that does make make it
 
01:34:26.310 --> 01:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
clearer um and unfortunately I think
 
01:34:29.149 --> 01:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
mistakes can be made and that's why we
 
01:34:31.030 --> 01:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
have a supreme court and that's why we
 
01:34:33.270 --> 01:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
have app pellet review my concern is
 
01:34:35.310 --> 01:34:35.320 align:start position:0%
that when we're talking about new
 
01:34:38.310 --> 01:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
trials you're also often talking about
 
01:34:40.350 --> 01:34:40.360 align:start position:0%
victims and you're talking about people
 
01:34:43.149 --> 01:34:43.159 align:start position:0%
who have gone through trial and maybe
 
01:34:45.310 --> 01:34:45.320 align:start position:0%
had some what they believe to be closure
 
01:34:47.470 --> 01:34:47.480 align:start position:0%
in their life and then they get a phone
 
01:34:49.629 --> 01:34:49.639 align:start position:0%
call from the prosecutor's office 8 nine
 
01:34:52.830 --> 01:34:52.840 align:start position:0%
10 years later saying uh hey this person
 
01:34:55.149 --> 01:34:55.159 align:start position:0%
who is convicted after a trial is now
 
01:34:57.590 --> 01:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
seeking a new
 
01:35:00.350 --> 01:35:00.360 align:start position:0%
trial I think that can be potentially
 
01:35:01.510 --> 01:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
stressful and I think it would be
 
01:35:03.750 --> 01:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
important to get it right to begin
 
01:35:06.510 --> 01:35:06.520 align:start position:0%
with Mr chair I know we're not supposed
 
01:35:10.870 --> 01:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
to exchange in dialogue and so I won't
 
01:35:14.950 --> 01:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
and um but please know that I would
 
01:35:17.390 --> 01:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
certainly have liked to respond to
 
01:35:19.590 --> 01:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:35:22.470 --> 01:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
Manos thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:35:24.350 --> 01:35:24.360 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
01:35:28.189 --> 01:35:28.199 align:start position:0%
um the house just passed a bill 1432
 
01:35:31.229 --> 01:35:31.239 align:start position:0%
that sets criminal and civil penalties
 
01:35:34.790 --> 01:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
for the use of AI and deep fakes that
 
01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:35.830 align:start position:0%
for the use of AI and deep fakes that
injure

01:35:35.830 --> 01:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
injure
 
01:35:39.910 --> 01:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
people and so I'm just um and that bill
 
01:35:43.310 --> 01:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
originated from this committee um and so
 
01:35:47.350 --> 01:35:47.360 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm just um struggling with the lack
 
01:35:52.070 --> 01:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
of of the lack of civil relief because
 
01:35:54.430 --> 01:35:54.440 align:start position:0%
theoretically somebody could be
 
01:35:57.629 --> 01:35:57.639 align:start position:0%
convicted for a criminal offense using
 
01:36:00.990 --> 01:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
Ai and then new scientific understanding
 
01:36:03.229 --> 01:36:03.239 align:start position:0%
could come forward that would say this
 
01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
person didn't create the AI and the Deep
 
01:36:09.870 --> 01:36:09.880 align:start position:0%
fake but it was somebody else but still
 
01:36:12.950 --> 01:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
there would be civil liability and so
 
01:36:15.310 --> 01:36:15.320 align:start position:0%
I'm struggling with that so if you could
 
01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:23.149 --> 01:36:23.159 align:start position:0%
that for me personally again I find
 
01:36:24.990 --> 01:36:25.000 align:start position:0%
myself a situation similar to attorney
 
01:36:28.310 --> 01:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
muso and that I'm not a civil attorney
 
01:36:30.270 --> 01:36:30.280 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know that I can help you
 
01:36:33.430 --> 01:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
with that same same from my side are
 
01:36:34.629 --> 01:36:34.639 align:start position:0%
there was there other questions over
 
01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
here that I see other yes representative
 
01:36:38.990 --> 01:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
Stapleton thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:36:41.750 --> 01:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question going back to
 
01:36:44.270 --> 01:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
just the previous discussion a moment
 
01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
ago I'm going to ask the
 
01:36:50.189 --> 01:36:50.199 align:start position:0%
question while closure and victims
 
01:36:54.310 --> 01:36:54.320 align:start position:0%
concerns are immensely important do they
 
01:36:59.149 --> 01:36:59.159 align:start position:0%
Trump the focus needed on establishing
 
01:37:03.070 --> 01:37:03.080 align:start position:0%
innocence absolutely not without a doubt
 
01:37:06.350 --> 01:37:06.360 align:start position:0%
not and I think and in my conversations
 
01:37:07.950 --> 01:37:07.960 align:start position:0%
with other County attorneys and I
 
01:37:10.430 --> 01:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
contacted I believe all of them on this
 
01:37:13.830 --> 01:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
issue and um every prosecutor otherwise
 
01:37:16.030 --> 01:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
that I talked to local prosecutors all
 
01:37:20.669 --> 01:37:20.679 align:start position:0%
agreed that the steps if someone has an
 
01:37:23.229 --> 01:37:23.239 align:start position:0%
issue with the science and uh uh
 
01:37:24.470 --> 01:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
something something about their actual
 
01:37:26.510 --> 01:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
innocence it ought to be brought be
 
01:37:29.430 --> 01:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
before court and frankly I think
 
01:37:31.350 --> 01:37:31.360 align:start position:0%
attorney mosu and I and attorney erson
 
01:37:32.990 --> 01:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
every other attorney that I know
 
01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't disagree with that so
 
01:37:37.950 --> 01:37:37.960 align:start position:0%
peripheral considerations of closure and
 
01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:38.990 align:start position:0%
peripheral considerations of closure and
victim's

01:37:38.990 --> 01:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
victim's
 
01:37:42.629 --> 01:37:42.639 align:start position:0%
concerns um are not a consideration
 
01:37:46.310 --> 01:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
for um evaluating new possible evidence
 
01:37:48.589 --> 01:37:48.599 align:start position:0%
that might point to
 
01:37:52.510 --> 01:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
innocence not a valid claim right yeah
 
01:37:53.950 --> 01:37:53.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:37:56.550 --> 01:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
right Representative kab no I wanted to
 
01:37:59.070 --> 01:37:59.080 align:start position:0%
ask a question of the chair if I may but
 
01:38:01.270 --> 01:38:01.280 align:start position:0%
I can wait till okay all right any other
 
01:38:03.030 --> 01:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
questions for these
 
01:38:05.189 --> 01:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
Witnesses seeing none thank you very
 
01:38:07.390 --> 01:38:07.400 align:start position:0%
much thank is there anyone else who
 
01:38:11.669 --> 01:38:11.679 align:start position:0%
wishes to testify on Senate Bill
 
01:38:14.270 --> 01:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
507 seeing none I'm going to close the
 
01:38:18.310 --> 01:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
hearing on Senate Bill U oh oh oh sure
 
01:38:20.430 --> 01:38:20.440 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely um I wanted to ask if
 
01:38:22.270 --> 01:38:22.280 align:start position:0%
it's possible to
 
01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
have the committee researcher look into
 
01:38:27.109 --> 01:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
this a bit because as I'm looking at the
 
01:38:28.910 --> 01:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
statue that they
 
01:38:31.750 --> 01:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
that the attorneys before us just
 
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
pointed out regarding DNA testing it is
 
01:38:38.709 --> 01:38:38.719 align:start position:0%
quite an extensive list of requirements
 
01:38:41.189 --> 01:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
that you have to meet to even be allowed
 
01:38:43.270 --> 01:38:43.280 align:start position:0%
to have a hearing and whatnot and and
 
01:38:45.070 --> 01:38:45.080 align:start position:0%
proving like why this DNA wasn't
 
01:38:47.550 --> 01:38:47.560 align:start position:0%
previously available vers this current
 
01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
bill before
 
01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
us is like two sentences verse this
 
01:38:54.910 --> 01:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
entire chapter and so I'm curious in
 
01:38:57.950 --> 01:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
these other states which do allow
 
01:39:00.709 --> 01:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
for broader amounts of times to have a
 
01:39:04.390 --> 01:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
rehearing if their chapters are more
 
01:39:06.109 --> 01:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
descriptive on all this burden that you
 
01:39:08.510 --> 01:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
have to prove I'm concerned that the
 
01:39:11.790 --> 01:39:11.800 align:start position:0%
terminology and what not would just open
 
01:39:14.229 --> 01:39:14.239 align:start position:0%
up the floodgates for for for lots of
 
01:39:17.790 --> 01:39:17.800 align:start position:0%
potential petitions um
 
01:39:20.109 --> 01:39:20.119 align:start position:0%
and I wonder if we could kind of do a
 
01:39:21.830 --> 01:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
little bit of research to see what other
 
01:39:24.430 --> 01:39:24.440 align:start position:0%
states are doing
 
01:39:25.910 --> 01:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh sure we can have I mean we can
 
01:39:28.790 --> 01:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
definitely ask our um our uh committee
 
01:39:31.030 --> 01:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
researcher to to look into um other
 
01:39:33.189 --> 01:39:33.199 align:start position:0%
states and I I mean I know you're right
 
01:39:36.750 --> 01:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
I I had a I had significant involvement
 
01:39:39.149 --> 01:39:39.159 align:start position:0%
in the DNA Statute in before I when I
 
01:39:42.589 --> 01:39:42.599 align:start position:0%
was still on the court um in a in a one
 
01:39:45.149 --> 01:39:45.159 align:start position:0%
case in particular um but yes we can do
 
01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
that um all right uh any all right uh so
 
01:39:50.430 --> 01:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
we have no other Witnesses so I'm going
 
01:39:54.189 --> 01:39:54.199 align:start position:0%
to close the hearing on Senate Bill 507
 
01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
um and um I guess what I what I would
 
01:40:02.750 --> 01:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
like to raise now before we get into our
 
01:40:05.950 --> 01:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
executive session on the other bills is
 
01:40:09.149 --> 01:40:09.159 align:start position:0%
um with regard to Senate Bill
 
01:40:12.990 --> 01:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
185 um I guess I would have to say I I
 
01:40:16.229 --> 01:40:16.239 align:start position:0%
think I completely share uh the ranking
 
01:40:19.669 --> 01:40:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:23.350 --> 01:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
that I'm very suspicious that the report
 
01:40:25.070 --> 01:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
we get from the study committee in
 
01:40:27.750 --> 01:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
November is going to say we are at
 
01:40:30.430 --> 01:40:30.440 align:start position:0%
loggerheads and we haven't really
 
01:40:34.070 --> 01:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
Advanced the uh the ball very much
 
01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:36.070 align:start position:0%
Advanced the uh the ball very much
but

01:40:36.070 --> 01:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:40:39.390 --> 01:40:39.400 align:start position:0%
but maybe I'm just being overly negative
 
01:40:44.430 --> 01:40:44.440 align:start position:0%
and uh uh you know and and Senator uh
 
01:40:46.310 --> 01:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
Apprentice may have some some a very
 
01:40:48.109 --> 01:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
good point that maybe the pressure has
 
01:40:50.229 --> 01:40:50.239 align:start position:0%
built uh that will cause people to come
 
01:40:52.910 --> 01:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
together so my inclination is that
 
01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:54.229 align:start position:0%
together so my inclination is that
despite

01:40:54.229 --> 01:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
despite
 
01:40:56.629 --> 01:40:56.639 align:start position:0%
sharing representative Smith's
 
01:41:00.669 --> 01:41:00.679 align:start position:0%
reservations we should uh pass 185 and
 
01:41:03.390 --> 01:41:03.400 align:start position:0%
so I would propose since it's only a
 
01:41:06.430 --> 01:41:06.440 align:start position:0%
study committee to execute now if
 
01:41:09.350 --> 01:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
Senator Smith is agreeable to do that
 
01:41:13.470 --> 01:41:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
that I would consider it actually a
 
01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:20.589 align:start position:0%
that I would consider it actually a
[Laughter]

01:41:20.589 --> 01:41:20.599 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:41:25.830 --> 01:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:27.390 --> 01:41:27.400 align:start position:0%
you have to raise you have to raise
 
01:41:29.669 --> 01:41:29.679 align:start position:0%
money to run for the Senate and I won't
 
01:41:37.589 --> 01:41:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:40.149 --> 01:41:40.159 align:start position:0%
um I I
 
01:41:43.750 --> 01:41:43.760 align:start position:0%
won't stand in the way
 
01:41:47.270 --> 01:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
unless I hear any objection from any of
 
01:41:50.270 --> 01:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
my Democratic colleagues if you want to
 
01:41:52.229 --> 01:41:52.239 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:41:52.239 --> 01:41:54.390 align:start position:0%
go ahead
now

01:41:54.390 --> 01:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:41:56.189 --> 01:41:56.199 align:start position:0%
and I guess I should say if I you know I
 
01:41:58.589 --> 01:41:58.599 align:start position:0%
I'm sort of I'm sort of thinking that
 
01:42:00.189 --> 01:42:00.199 align:start position:0%
from the questioning I was sort of
 
01:42:01.750 --> 01:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
assuming that everybody was going to say
 
01:42:04.030 --> 01:42:04.040 align:start position:0%
even even though they had reservations
 
01:42:06.109 --> 01:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
let we should we might as well go ahead
 
01:42:08.350 --> 01:42:08.360 align:start position:0%
if if if I'm reading that wrong then
 
01:42:10.550 --> 01:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
maybe we should do something else I've
 
01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:12.510 align:start position:0%
maybe we should do something else I've
got

01:42:12.510 --> 01:42:12.520 align:start position:0%
got
 
01:42:15.390 --> 01:42:15.400 align:start position:0%
question I I'm wondering if and it stems
 
01:42:19.070 --> 01:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
from the question that I asked is
 
01:42:22.310 --> 01:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
is not only can we permit some of these
 
01:42:24.669 --> 01:42:24.679 align:start position:0%
patients to to take up some temporary
 
01:42:27.470 --> 01:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
Residence at a County nursing home and
 
01:42:30.270 --> 01:42:30.280 align:start position:0%
do can we do this through administrative
 
01:42:32.990 --> 01:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
rules and not the legislative process
 
01:42:34.350 --> 01:42:34.360 align:start position:0%
where there could be memoranda of
 
01:42:37.109 --> 01:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
agreement between the H hospital and the
 
01:42:40.229 --> 01:42:40.239 align:start position:0%
County nursing home if there already I I
 
01:42:41.629 --> 01:42:41.639 align:start position:0%
I believe I understood there that
 
01:42:44.229 --> 01:42:44.239 align:start position:0%
there's already a private nursing home a
 
01:42:46.310 --> 01:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
contract with between a hospital and a
 
01:42:49.669 --> 01:42:49.679 align:start position:0%
private nursing home if they can do that
 
01:42:52.709 --> 01:42:52.719 align:start position:0%
why can't there be something between uh
 
01:42:54.669 --> 01:42:54.679 align:start position:0%
these hospitals and a and a County
 
01:42:57.470 --> 01:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
nursing home for a temporary residence
 
01:42:59.270 --> 01:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
until a permanent solution can be fixed
 
01:43:00.750 --> 01:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't need to be legislative
 
01:43:02.189 --> 01:43:02.199 align:start position:0%
at least I don't I would I wouldn't
 
01:43:03.990 --> 01:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
think so so could there not be something
 
01:43:06.189 --> 01:43:06.199 align:start position:0%
done through rules that would allow them
 
01:43:09.030 --> 01:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
to do that right I mean I guess my only
 
01:43:11.470 --> 01:43:11.480 align:start position:0%
you may be entirely you may be entirely
 
01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
correct but I mean are I suppose I think
 
01:43:16.229 --> 01:43:16.239 align:start position:0%
the senator Apprentice if she was here
 
01:43:17.830 --> 01:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
would say and that's something that the
 
01:43:20.310 --> 01:43:20.320 align:start position:0%
study committee could you know include
 
01:43:22.310 --> 01:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
in their report but anyway uh
 
01:43:23.629 --> 01:43:23.639 align:start position:0%
representative alexand ER then
 
01:43:26.550 --> 01:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
representative lza and then
 
01:43:29.189 --> 01:43:29.199 align:start position:0%
representative excuse me I hate to be
 
01:43:32.550 --> 01:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
stuffy about this but if we are going to
 
01:43:35.550 --> 01:43:35.560 align:start position:0%
be discussing this
 
01:43:39.550 --> 01:43:39.560 align:start position:0%
bill then I think you have to open up an
 
01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:41.830 align:start position:0%
bill then I think you have to open up an
executive

01:43:41.830 --> 01:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
executive
 
01:43:45.589 --> 01:43:45.599 align:start position:0%
session on this well no well I you know
 
01:43:47.350 --> 01:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
what I guess what I'd say this I because
 
01:43:49.550 --> 01:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
the hearing was closed so there either
 
01:43:52.229 --> 01:43:52.239 align:start position:0%
has to be a work session which would
 
01:43:56.350 --> 01:43:56.360 align:start position:0%
have had to have been declared or an
 
01:44:00.149 --> 01:44:00.159 align:start position:0%
executive session which you could start
 
01:44:04.350 --> 01:44:04.360 align:start position:0%
with the agreement of the chair and the
 
01:44:08.189 --> 01:44:08.199 align:start position:0%
ranking member but just the general
 
01:44:10.189 --> 01:44:10.199 align:start position:0%
conversation we could have Dan in the
 
01:44:11.910 --> 01:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
lunchroom but I don't think we could
 
01:44:13.950 --> 01:44:13.960 align:start position:0%
have here all right so here's I guess my
 
01:44:17.149 --> 01:44:17.159 align:start position:0%
question is this I'm I was think I was
 
01:44:20.070 --> 01:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
thinking that everybody was sort of
 
01:44:21.870 --> 01:44:21.880 align:start position:0%
generally on the same page that we
 
01:44:23.950 --> 01:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
should just exec this and get it done it
 
01:44:25.910 --> 01:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
sounds like I was wrong in that and if
 
01:44:28.070 --> 01:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
that's the case then I would say I my
 
01:44:30.229 --> 01:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
inclination would be let's not exec this
 
01:44:32.390 --> 01:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
today let's EXA it some other time I
 
01:44:34.430 --> 01:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
think you might be on the you might be
 
01:44:37.830 --> 01:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
on the the right track that we are all
 
01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
ready to exact what I'm not sure you're
 
01:44:42.510 --> 01:44:42.520 align:start position:0%
on the right track with is what the
 
01:44:44.629 --> 01:44:44.639 align:start position:0%
motion is and that's where the
 
01:44:46.750 --> 01:44:46.760 align:start position:0%
difference is I agree I think I think
 
01:44:48.910 --> 01:44:48.920 align:start position:0%
we're all probably ready to move but I I
 
01:44:51.030 --> 01:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
would say I I want to itl it because I
 
01:44:52.310 --> 01:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
think people can just get together on
 
01:44:54.109 --> 01:44:54.119 align:start position:0%
their own where the number of people on
 
01:44:56.910 --> 01:44:56.920 align:start position:0%
that committee isn't a
 
01:44:59.589 --> 01:44:59.599 align:start position:0%
quorum representative
 
01:45:04.149 --> 01:45:04.159 align:start position:0%
Perez I would like us to move to
 
01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
exact Senate Bill
 
01:45:10.109 --> 01:45:10.119 align:start position:0%
185 today and see if we can come to a
 
01:45:12.109 --> 01:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
decision on that before we do any
 
01:45:13.910 --> 01:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
further in
 
01:45:16.910 --> 01:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Andrew thank
 
01:45:19.910 --> 01:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I am totally against this
 
01:45:21.990 --> 01:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
bill it should be it and I'm going to
 
01:45:26.510 --> 01:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
tell you why as far as I'm concerned the
 
01:45:29.470 --> 01:45:29.480 align:start position:0%
new hang on hang on so so wait minute
 
01:45:32.790 --> 01:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
hang on hang on what based upon what I
 
01:45:35.070 --> 01:45:35.080 align:start position:0%
have heard we are not executing this
 
01:45:37.629 --> 01:45:37.639 align:start position:0%
bill today it's clear that there are
 
01:45:40.070 --> 01:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
disagreements because I'm G change my
 
01:45:42.350 --> 01:45:42.360 align:start position:0%
mind I think everybody
 
01:45:45.790 --> 01:45:45.800 align:start position:0%
AG so let me just fine let's take a hang
 
01:45:48.950 --> 01:45:48.960 align:start position:0%
on let's take let's take a Stuffle what
 
01:45:52.350 --> 01:45:52.360 align:start position:0%
so first let me let me sort of propose
 
01:45:54.790 --> 01:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
it what if the if the motion was ought
 
01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
to pass on this who would vote ought to
 
01:45:59.990 --> 01:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
pass wait just hang hang on we're going
 
01:46:02.070 --> 01:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
to take a straw vote on this we're going
 
01:46:05.070 --> 01:46:05.080 align:start position:0%
to take a straw vote if if if we were to
 
01:46:07.350 --> 01:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
exec this and the motion was ought to
 
01:46:10.870 --> 01:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:13.510 --> 01:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
pass right and who would vote something
 
01:46:15.109 --> 01:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
other than ought to
 
01:46:18.550 --> 01:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
pass okay so that that is enough to say
 
01:46:20.350 --> 01:46:20.360 align:start position:0%
we're not going to exec this today we'll
 
01:46:22.189 --> 01:46:22.199 align:start position:0%
have we need to have a a more thorough
 
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
discussion on it
 
01:46:25.709 --> 01:46:25.719 align:start position:0%
uh and and it sounds like I mean it
 
01:46:27.950 --> 01:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
sounds like for example myself and the
 
01:46:29.310 --> 01:46:29.320 align:start position:0%
ranking member would have a different
 
01:46:31.390 --> 01:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
view so that in itself would say that we
 
01:46:33.750 --> 01:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we shouldn't go forward all
 
01:46:35.390 --> 01:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
right a rare
 
01:46:39.189 --> 01:46:39.199 align:start position:0%
occurrence point of order yes I made it
 
01:46:41.870 --> 01:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
I did make a motion but you made a
 
01:46:43.229 --> 01:46:43.239 align:start position:0%
motion but we're not in executive
 
01:46:45.310 --> 01:46:45.320 align:start position:0%
session so I'm so the motion is out of
 
01:46:49.830 --> 01:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
order oh I got fatted all right all
 
01:46:54.589 --> 01:46:54.599 align:start position:0%
right so now now now I am going to open
 
01:46:57.910 --> 01:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
the executive session on the three bills
 
01:47:01.350 --> 01:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
that we had noticed for 11:00 and I know
 
01:47:05.430 --> 01:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
we're behind um it's Senate Bill 314
 
01:47:06.790 --> 01:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
327 and Senate Bill uh
 
01:47:14.550 --> 01:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
435 um I see that we have in the in the
 
01:47:17.390 --> 01:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
audience and I and I know they've been
 
01:47:20.390 --> 01:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
waiting um for a significant period of
 
01:47:23.070 --> 01:47:23.080 align:start position:0%
time so I in the interest of not having
 
01:47:24.830 --> 01:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
them wait any longer I'm going to take
 
01:47:29.669 --> 01:47:29.679 align:start position:0%
up 435 first um this is the the uh
 
01:47:34.030 --> 01:47:34.040 align:start position:0%
unitrust bill um you all have an
 
01:47:36.149 --> 01:47:36.159 align:start position:0%
amendment which I I sent to you last
 
01:47:38.189 --> 01:47:38.199 align:start position:0%
night and and it's now been been
 
01:47:41.910 --> 01:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
circulated this morning it's Amendment
 
01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:44.270 align:start position:0%
circulated this morning it's Amendment
20241

01:47:44.270 --> 01:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
20241
 
01:47:49.910 --> 01:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
1454 um and so I would like to move that
 
01:47:52.109 --> 01:47:52.119 align:start position:0%
Amendment and ask if there's a second
 
01:47:55.070 --> 01:47:55.080 align:start position:0%
second seconded by representative
 
01:48:00.310 --> 01:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:03.350 --> 01:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
um just making a note
 
01:48:05.790 --> 01:48:05.800 align:start position:0%
here um if I could just speak to it
 
01:48:07.030 --> 01:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
briefly I
 
01:48:09.470 --> 01:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
think so the first motion you're moving
 
01:48:11.270 --> 01:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
is ought to pass correct is I'm sorry
 
01:48:13.310 --> 01:48:13.320 align:start position:0%
ought to pass yes I ought to pass on
 
01:48:16.510 --> 01:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
this amendment um and I and I guess I
 
01:48:18.990 --> 01:48:19.000 align:start position:0%
would speak to to say as you I suspect
 
01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
that many of you as you started to read
 
01:48:22.910 --> 01:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
this your eyes glazed over because it's
 
01:48:26.990 --> 01:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
very technical um it uh I think we got
 
01:48:29.149 --> 01:48:29.159 align:start position:0%
some very good testimony at the hearing
 
01:48:32.510 --> 01:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
about what the what the these um uh what
 
01:48:36.629 --> 01:48:36.639 align:start position:0%
the bill is intended to do and um what
 
01:48:39.510 --> 01:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
the Amendments uh to basically to
 
01:48:42.510 --> 01:48:42.520 align:start position:0%
correct sort of language uh difficulties
 
01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
in the bill uh I don't really think that
 
01:48:46.030 --> 01:48:46.040 align:start position:0%
there's much in the way of if anything
 
01:48:47.550 --> 01:48:47.560 align:start position:0%
in the way of any substance in the
 
01:48:49.910 --> 01:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
amendment that changes the uh the
 
01:48:53.870 --> 01:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
substance of the bill um uh as as
 
01:48:57.350 --> 01:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
Senator delandro indicated in his
 
01:48:59.030 --> 01:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
testimony and as the witnesses have
 
01:49:01.390 --> 01:49:01.400 align:start position:0%
indicated this is an important bill I
 
01:49:04.350 --> 01:49:04.360 align:start position:0%
think for uh
 
01:49:07.109 --> 01:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
for continuing to have New Hampshire
 
01:49:10.149 --> 01:49:10.159 align:start position:0%
move forward as a state that has very
 
01:49:10.159 --> 01:49:11.350 align:start position:0%
move forward as a state that has very
well-developed

01:49:11.350 --> 01:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
well-developed
 
01:49:14.629 --> 01:49:14.639 align:start position:0%
and uh modern trust law and so I think
 
01:49:16.990 --> 01:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
it's I think it's important uh and I
 
01:49:18.870 --> 01:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
guess that's really and I think it's I
 
01:49:21.310 --> 01:49:21.320 align:start position:0%
think it's it's done right so to speak
 
01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
in here um
 
01:49:26.189 --> 01:49:26.199 align:start position:0%
and so I that's really all I have to say
 
01:49:29.310 --> 01:49:29.320 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any comments on
 
01:49:32.990 --> 01:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
435 yes have a question um you know you
 
01:49:35.510 --> 01:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
said just kind of technical changes and
 
01:49:37.990 --> 01:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
as I declared last time when we
 
01:49:40.830 --> 01:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
discussed this bill and as I repeat I
 
01:49:42.990 --> 01:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
don't understand a blessed thing and so
 
01:49:46.189 --> 01:49:46.199 align:start position:0%
I'm not pretending that I understand
 
01:49:51.109 --> 01:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
anything substantively but um when you
 
01:49:55.430 --> 01:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
say in line 14 D after a trust is
 
01:49:57.229 --> 01:49:57.239 align:start position:0%
converted to a
 
01:49:57.239 --> 01:49:59.950 align:start position:0%
converted to a
uni

01:49:59.950 --> 01:49:59.960 align:start position:0%
uni
 
01:50:05.109 --> 01:50:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:07.750 --> 01:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
provisions of
 
01:50:12.270 --> 01:50:12.280 align:start position:0%
56 for c107 shall apply and
 
01:50:15.189 --> 01:50:15.199 align:start position:0%
then and then everything's crossed
 
01:50:20.270 --> 01:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:25.870 --> 01:50:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:30.030 align:start position:0%
 
c107

01:50:36.709 --> 01:50:36.719 align:start position:0%
that's well this is changing Part D
 
01:50:38.430 --> 01:50:38.440 align:start position:0%
right that you're talking about line 16
 
01:50:43.629 --> 01:50:43.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:46.990 --> 01:50:47.000 align:start position:0%
right and I

01:50:55.669 --> 01:50:55.679 align:start position:0%
106f I mean I anyway it looks like
 
01:50:58.189 --> 01:50:58.199 align:start position:0%

okay that answers that question thank
 
01:52:02.109 --> 01:52:02.119 align:start position:0%
you and that was part of the initial
 
01:52:03.709 --> 01:52:03.719 align:start position:0%
initial bill that didn't change in this
 
01:52:06.709 --> 01:52:06.719 align:start position:0%
amendment these cross okay are there are
 
01:52:11.270 --> 01:52:11.280 align:start position:0%

the motion to uh uh pass the adopt the
 
01:52:30.109 --> 01:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:34.030 --> 01:52:34.040 align:start position:0%

01:53:04.709 --> 01:53:04.719 align:start position:0%
Wallace all right um and I would ask
 
01:53:07.669 --> 01:53:07.679 align:start position:0%
anybody anybody have any other comments
 
01:53:10.350 --> 01:53:10.360 align:start position:0%
questions anything on the bill Mr chair
 
01:53:12.270 --> 01:53:12.280 align:start position:0%
wh yes representative Doren thank you Mr
 
01:53:13.990 --> 01:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
chair you know I feel like I don't know
 
01:53:16.510 --> 01:53:16.520 align:start position:0%
enough about this um even though I've
 
01:53:18.750 --> 01:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
read everything and I've been through it
 
01:53:22.910 --> 01:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
and trying to reason you know what this
 
01:53:26.109 --> 01:53:26.119 align:start position:0%
is all about and what the um liabilities
 
01:53:29.109 --> 01:53:29.119 align:start position:0%
might be for the state and when I think
 
01:53:31.109 --> 01:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
of that way I think about the frm
 
01:53:34.229 --> 01:53:34.239 align:start position:0%
Scandal um from a few years ago where we
 
01:53:37.229 --> 01:53:37.239 align:start position:0%
ended up um having the taxpayers um put
 
01:53:39.790 --> 01:53:39.800 align:start position:0%
the bill for the losses because of um
 
01:53:42.470 --> 01:53:42.480 align:start position:0%
Bad actors and so that makes me a little
 
01:53:45.669 --> 01:53:45.679 align:start position:0%
bit skeptical so I'm hesitating thank
 
01:53:47.990 --> 01:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
you okay all right other uh
 
01:53:49.990 --> 01:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
representative Smith did you have a
 
01:53:52.990 --> 01:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
comment I I do have a comment
 
01:53:57.709 --> 01:53:57.719 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and because um I vote first
 
01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
when we get to um my part of the RO our
 
01:54:08.069 --> 01:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:12.589 --> 01:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
that I at the moment I am leaning to
 
01:54:17.350 --> 01:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
oppose or to pass having nothing to do
 
01:54:20.830 --> 01:54:20.840 align:start position:0%
with the merits but having to do with
 
01:54:24.790 --> 01:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
the process I have great respect for the
 
01:54:29.149 --> 01:54:29.159 align:start position:0%
private bar I have great respect for how
 
01:54:32.390 --> 01:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
they they help
 
01:54:35.350 --> 01:54:35.360 align:start position:0%
us understand what's happening out in
 
01:54:37.790 --> 01:54:37.800 align:start position:0%
the real world rather than in Allison
 
01:54:42.830 --> 01:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
Wonderland where we live here but I
 
01:54:47.550 --> 01:54:47.560 align:start position:0%
don't have confidence that I understand
 
01:54:47.560 --> 01:54:48.310 align:start position:0%
don't have confidence that I understand
the

01:54:48.310 --> 01:54:48.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:54:52.669 --> 01:54:52.679 align:start position:0%
implications enough to be responsibly V
 
01:54:57.350 --> 01:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
in a way that might affect the Financial
 
01:55:00.750 --> 01:55:00.760 align:start position:0%
Security of people in the state I do I
 
01:55:04.270 --> 01:55:04.280 align:start position:0%
make no pretense that I know what I'm
 
01:55:06.870 --> 01:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
doing and I make and I don't expect
 
01:55:08.470 --> 01:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
anyone to
 
01:55:11.069 --> 01:55:11.079 align:start position:0%
follow um and I might be the only one
 
01:55:14.109 --> 01:55:14.119 align:start position:0%
who would vote that way I just don't
 
01:55:18.189 --> 01:55:18.199 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable without our having had
 
01:55:21.550 --> 01:55:21.560 align:start position:0%
um a subcommittee a work group uh a side
 
01:55:26.470 --> 01:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
by side and analysis um uh whatever and
 
01:55:30.069 --> 01:55:30.079 align:start position:0%
so I I want to say that so that no one
 
01:55:32.069 --> 01:55:32.079 align:start position:0%
thinks that by my
 
01:55:34.830 --> 01:55:34.840 align:start position:0%
voting any way that I would expect
 
01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
anyone else to follow thank you Mr chair
 
01:55:39.109 --> 01:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
all right anyone else representative
 
01:55:41.750 --> 01:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
Wallace thank you Mr chairman um if I
 
01:55:43.709 --> 01:55:43.719 align:start position:0%
might just make a couple of comments so
 
01:55:44.950 --> 01:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
people might understand this a little
 
01:55:48.189 --> 01:55:48.199 align:start position:0%
bit better um and again this will be the
 
01:55:50.709 --> 01:55:50.719 align:start position:0%
rers do just sweet and condensed version
 
01:55:53.589 --> 01:55:53.599 align:start position:0%
as a trustee sitting on um whatever the
 
01:55:55.430 --> 01:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
type of trust that might be you are
 
01:55:57.709 --> 01:55:57.719 align:start position:0%
bound by your fiduciary responsibilities
 
01:56:00.069 --> 01:56:00.079 align:start position:0%
and obligations to both the current
 
01:56:02.350 --> 01:56:02.360 align:start position:0%
income beneficiaries as well as the
 
01:56:04.750 --> 01:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
subsequent Airs of the granters of a
 
01:56:07.830 --> 01:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
trust this change in statute
 
01:56:11.589 --> 01:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
provides um an opportunity or so that
 
01:56:14.430 --> 01:56:14.440 align:start position:0%
the trustees can manage both fiduciary
 
01:56:16.149 --> 01:56:16.159 align:start position:0%
interests to the current income
 
01:56:18.229 --> 01:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
recipients of the trust income and
 
01:56:21.310 --> 01:56:21.320 align:start position:0%
future Generations by adopting a hybrid
 
01:56:23.950 --> 01:56:23.960 align:start position:0%
investment strategy which will ensure
 
01:56:25.910 --> 01:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
better and Optimal Performance for all
 
01:56:28.510 --> 01:56:28.520 align:start position:0%
ears and all beneficiaries um going
 
01:56:31.470 --> 01:56:31.480 align:start position:0%
forward in throughout time and experts
 
01:56:33.510 --> 01:56:33.520 align:start position:0%
in the room feel free to correct me if
 
01:56:35.470 --> 01:56:35.480 align:start position:0%
that was not quite
 
01:56:38.910 --> 01:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
accurate we're getting a unanimous nods
 
01:56:41.270 --> 01:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
okay so hopefully that might dispel some
 
01:56:44.990 --> 01:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
of your concerns so I'm sorry do other
 
01:56:48.310 --> 01:56:48.320 align:start position:0%
people have any comments so here here's
 
01:56:52.990 --> 01:56:53.000 align:start position:0%
what I I I guess what my concern is this
 
01:56:56.790 --> 01:56:56.800 align:start position:0%
I if people are uncomfortable voting on
 
01:56:59.430 --> 01:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
this now I don't want to in any way you
 
01:57:01.830 --> 01:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
know we we don't have to exec this today
 
01:57:04.109 --> 01:57:04.119 align:start position:0%
and I'm not and I'm perfectly willing to
 
01:57:07.830 --> 01:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
put it off my only concern is this I
 
01:57:11.109 --> 01:57:11.119 align:start position:0%
don't I certainly don't profess to be an
 
01:57:13.750 --> 01:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
expert in this area of the law and
 
01:57:15.189 --> 01:57:15.199 align:start position:0%
although we have other attorneys on the
 
01:57:16.709 --> 01:57:16.719 align:start position:0%
committee I'm not sure that any of us
 
01:57:19.870 --> 01:57:19.880 align:start position:0%
are experts in this area of the law I
 
01:57:22.589 --> 01:57:22.599 align:start position:0%
think we did receive testimony from
 
01:57:25.510 --> 01:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
people who are experts in this area and
 
01:57:25.520 --> 01:57:26.390 align:start position:0%
people who are experts in this area and
I

01:57:26.390 --> 01:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:57:29.709 --> 01:57:29.719 align:start position:0%
didn't I don't recall hearing anybody on
 
01:57:31.470 --> 01:57:31.480 align:start position:0%
the committee questioning them or
 
01:57:34.109 --> 01:57:34.119 align:start position:0%
suggesting that there was something more
 
01:57:37.310 --> 01:57:37.320 align:start position:0%
that they needed to hear or that we had
 
01:57:41.149 --> 01:57:41.159 align:start position:0%
some concerns about things and so I I
 
01:57:43.709 --> 01:57:43.719 align:start position:0%
guess what I what I'm concerned about is
 
01:57:47.390 --> 01:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
if we don't exec this today what you
 
01:57:49.470 --> 01:57:49.480 align:start position:0%
know we our hearing is over so unless we
 
01:57:51.629 --> 01:57:51.639 align:start position:0%
were going to have another hearing we're
 
01:57:53.830 --> 01:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
presumably not going to hear any new
 
01:57:58.430 --> 01:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
Witnesses um and so I'm I'm you know I'm
 
01:58:01.390 --> 01:58:01.400 align:start position:0%
I'm sort of left with the idea that if
 
01:58:03.669 --> 01:58:03.679 align:start position:0%
if if we wait two weeks to exec this
 
01:58:05.069 --> 01:58:05.079 align:start position:0%
we're going to be in exactly the same
 
01:58:07.750 --> 01:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
position we are in right now um without
 
01:58:10.229 --> 01:58:10.239 align:start position:0%
any without any further
 
01:58:13.350 --> 01:58:13.360 align:start position:0%
information um unless you know there's
 
01:58:15.830 --> 01:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
somebody on the committee that wants to
 
01:58:17.830 --> 01:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
become an expert in trust law between
 
01:58:19.550 --> 01:58:19.560 align:start position:0%
now and two weeks and I can tell you
 
01:58:24.229 --> 01:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
that that's not going to be me um uh but
 
01:58:27.149 --> 01:58:27.159 align:start position:0%
but um so that that's why I guess I
 
01:58:30.149 --> 01:58:30.159 align:start position:0%
would suggest that it makes and I would
 
01:58:33.310 --> 01:58:33.320 align:start position:0%
you know and I would note um this this
 
01:58:36.109 --> 01:58:36.119 align:start position:0%
has gone through the Senate it's go it's
 
01:58:37.350 --> 01:58:37.360 align:start position:0%
been gone
 
01:58:40.629 --> 01:58:40.639 align:start position:0%
through line by line and I think with
 
01:58:44.790 --> 01:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
great care by uh Mr Perlo and and people
 
01:58:46.189 --> 01:58:46.199 align:start position:0%
who were working with him who was who
 
01:58:48.790 --> 01:58:48.800 align:start position:0%
was our one of our Witnesses last time
 
01:58:52.390 --> 01:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
um when we got the first draft of of an
 
01:58:56.750 --> 01:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
amendment back um I uh I submitted it to
 
01:58:58.470 --> 01:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
him to said you know make sure can you
 
01:58:59.790 --> 01:58:59.800 align:start position:0%
please take a look at this and make sure
 
01:59:02.430 --> 01:59:02.440 align:start position:0%
that they've Incorporated all the
 
01:59:05.550 --> 01:59:05.560 align:start position:0%
proposed changes and he and his people
 
01:59:06.750 --> 01:59:06.760 align:start position:0%
that are working with him went through
 
01:59:08.629 --> 01:59:08.639 align:start position:0%
it line by line and got back to me with
 
01:59:11.270 --> 01:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
a very nice sort of summary of here you
 
01:59:12.870 --> 01:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
know here are things that they missed
 
01:59:15.069 --> 01:59:15.079 align:start position:0%
here are the changes that should be made
 
01:59:17.990 --> 01:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
that was submitted back to OS for for
 
01:59:19.430 --> 01:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
this current Amendment and when the
 
01:59:20.950 --> 01:59:20.960 align:start position:0%
current Amendment came back I went
 
01:59:22.629 --> 01:59:22.639 align:start position:0%
through it I I
 
01:59:25.310 --> 01:59:25.320 align:start position:0%
uh to make sure that the all the changes
 
01:59:28.510 --> 01:59:28.520 align:start position:0%
that had been suggested were captured
 
01:59:32.550 --> 01:59:32.560 align:start position:0%
so again I'm you know if people are
 
01:59:36.470 --> 01:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable in voting on the bill as
 
01:59:39.149 --> 01:59:39.159 align:start position:0%
on the ought to pass as amended now I'm
 
01:59:40.550 --> 01:59:40.560 align:start position:0%
then we will not have a vote today I
 
01:59:41.870 --> 01:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
don't want anybody to leave here
 
01:59:44.030 --> 01:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
thinking that we there was some Rush
 
01:59:47.589 --> 01:59:47.599 align:start position:0%
that we had to do this today um uh but
 
01:59:50.750 --> 01:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
I'm I really am sort of left like where
 
01:59:51.669 --> 01:59:51.679 align:start position:0%
you know what are we going to do if we
 
01:59:53.830 --> 01:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
don't do that so can I just ask sort
 
01:59:55.830 --> 01:59:55.840 align:start position:0%
kind of before we actually take the vote
 
01:59:57.470 --> 01:59:57.480 align:start position:0%
can I just ask for sort of a show of
 
01:59:59.350 --> 01:59:59.360 align:start position:0%
hands of who would be willing to vote or
 
02:00:07.109 --> 02:00:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:09.510 --> 02:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
now and who would be who would rather
 
02:00:11.990 --> 02:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
not do that right
 
02:00:15.790 --> 02:00:15.800 align:start position:0%
now I'm not asking for a delay okay I'm
 
02:00:17.709 --> 02:00:17.719 align:start position:0%
I'm not asking for a delay okay I'm just
 
02:00:19.390 --> 02:00:19.400 align:start position:0%
explaining my vote your vote all right
 
02:00:21.030 --> 02:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
okay all right so it appears that we
 
02:00:22.750 --> 02:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
have a fairly substantial majority that
 
02:00:24.310 --> 02:00:24.320 align:start position:0%
are willing to go forward so I'm going
 
02:00:26.510 --> 02:00:26.520 align:start position:0%

is I did uh send a copy I just send an
 
02:03:35.510 --> 02:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
email with a copy of uh or I'm not sure
 
02:03:36.669 --> 02:03:36.679 align:start position:0%
if I sent a copy of the bill but I sent
 
02:03:38.149 --> 02:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
an email to the Attorney General's
 
02:03:41.830 --> 02:03:41.840 align:start position:0%
office asking them if you know do you
 
02:03:43.830 --> 02:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
have any problem with this uh with this
 
02:03:46.709 --> 02:03:46.719 align:start position:0%

you do get back to me and I haven't
 
02:03:49.629 --> 02:03:49.639 align:start position:0%
heard back from them so I assume that
 
02:03:52.430 --> 02:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
they do not um which gives me comfort
 
02:03:56.270 --> 02:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
that you know it's not this isn't like
 
02:03:59.669 --> 02:03:59.679 align:start position:0%
way out in the out in the left field so
 
02:04:05.310 --> 02:04:05.320 align:start position:0%
um representative uh Smith thank you
 
02:04:10.910 --> 02:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
um I I acknowledge the problem that is
 
02:04:12.709 --> 02:04:12.719 align:start position:0%
the importance of the problem that is
 
02:04:16.549 --> 02:04:16.559 align:start position:0%
addressed here and I owledge the
 
02:04:19.950 --> 02:04:19.960 align:start position:0%
substance of the testimony that we
 
02:04:28.750 --> 02:04:28.760 align:start position:0%
receive I am troubled by a a Reliance on
 
02:04:34.750 --> 02:04:34.760 align:start position:0%
electronic um hearings um particularly
 
02:04:36.750 --> 02:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
involving by
 
02:04:41.109 --> 02:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
definition uh individuals who might not
 
02:04:42.910 --> 02:04:42.920 align:start position:0%
be able to
 
02:04:46.270 --> 02:04:46.280 align:start position:0%
function at the extremely high level
 
02:04:48.310 --> 02:04:48.320 align:start position:0%
that all of us sitting around this table
 
02:04:52.270 --> 02:04:52.280 align:start position:0%
can function um and uh
 
02:04:52.280 --> 02:04:53.950 align:start position:0%
can function um and uh
uh

02:04:53.950 --> 02:04:53.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:04:57.390 --> 02:04:57.400 align:start position:0%
that bothers me
 
02:05:00.189 --> 02:05:00.199 align:start position:0%
um and I would
 
02:05:02.830 --> 02:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
be interested in knowing how other
 
02:05:06.149 --> 02:05:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:09.109 --> 02:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
that representative I was concerned
 
02:05:11.430 --> 02:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
about that as well but then I I remember
 
02:05:13.910 --> 02:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
seeing in the bill that it stated that
 
02:05:16.390 --> 02:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
you only had to do that if agreed so the
 
02:05:18.669 --> 02:05:18.679 align:start position:0%
party could just wave and say or the
 
02:05:20.750 --> 02:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
attorney could for them could say that
 
02:05:24.109 --> 02:05:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:28.030 --> 02:05:28.040 align:start position:0%
that wasn't that if I could uh I I hear
 
02:05:33.629 --> 02:05:33.639 align:start position:0%
what you're saying um there is no fiscal
 
02:05:37.350 --> 02:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
note and so I'm
 
02:05:41.830 --> 02:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
wondering if there is a
 
02:05:45.270 --> 02:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
guarantee of legal
 
02:05:45.280 --> 02:05:47.510 align:start position:0%
guarantee of legal
counsel

02:05:47.510 --> 02:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
counsel
 
02:05:52.830 --> 02:05:52.840 align:start position:0%
um that is included in this um or is it
 
02:05:54.470 --> 02:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
possible that
 
02:06:00.109 --> 02:06:00.119 align:start position:0%
someone would be involved in
 
02:06:04.910 --> 02:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
um uh I mean it it is you know it
 
02:06:07.589 --> 02:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
is I guess it's criminal because it's
 
02:06:09.629 --> 02:06:09.639 align:start position:0%
prosecutor or defense
 
02:06:14.149 --> 02:06:14.159 align:start position:0%
counsel but um so that I believe there
 
02:06:16.589 --> 02:06:16.599 align:start position:0%
has to be
 
02:06:20.350 --> 02:06:20.360 align:start position:0%
um Council provided but why isn't there
 
02:06:23.589 --> 02:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:25.109 --> 02:06:25.119 align:start position:0%
well you know what I I I mean I don't
 
02:06:27.430 --> 02:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
know for sure but it may it may be that
 
02:06:30.750 --> 02:06:30.760 align:start position:0%
there that there these proceedings are
 
02:06:33.470 --> 02:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
conducted already and there and so it
 
02:06:35.830 --> 02:06:35.840 align:start position:0%
may be that you know this changes the
 
02:06:38.510 --> 02:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
procedures but but not the not the but
 
02:06:41.510 --> 02:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
not the whether it will have no effect
 
02:06:43.589 --> 02:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
on cost I'm not sure I mean but but
 
02:06:49.669 --> 02:06:49.679 align:start position:0%
maybe not not a substantial amount um so
 
02:06:52.510 --> 02:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
um any yes repres
 
02:06:55.830 --> 02:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
stap I hate to dive in on this
 
02:06:59.270 --> 02:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
but shall be
 
02:07:05.189 --> 02:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
guilty um it's kind of retive and going
 
02:07:07.189 --> 02:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
to the next line subject to the
 
02:07:10.830 --> 02:07:10.840 align:start position:0%
punishment um what about subject to due
 
02:07:13.109 --> 02:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
process I just have I just have a
 
02:07:15.470 --> 02:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
problem with the the word guilty in
 
02:07:17.229 --> 02:07:17.239 align:start position:0%
there I know where it's coming from it's
 
02:07:19.629 --> 02:07:19.639 align:start position:0%
a message that you could be subject to
 
02:07:22.589 --> 02:07:22.599 align:start position:0%
the rsa's pointed to two in the first
 
02:07:26.149 --> 02:07:26.159 align:start position:0%
part but um a declaration of guilty in
 
02:07:28.950 --> 02:07:28.960 align:start position:0%

02:09:23.669 --> 02:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:24.950 --> 02:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
all right representative Kennedy you
 
02:09:27.189 --> 02:09:27.199 align:start position:0%
wish to speak to your Amendment uh yes
 
02:09:28.990 --> 02:09:29.000 align:start position:0%
please um so it's a very simple
 
02:09:31.030 --> 02:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment um in the original bill it
 
02:09:35.470 --> 02:09:35.480 align:start position:0%
changes lines 18 through 23 um based off
 
02:09:39.069 --> 02:09:39.079 align:start position:0%
attorney studid dolos testimony um he
 
02:09:41.629 --> 02:09:41.639 align:start position:0%
has been a sports official uh longer
 
02:09:43.470 --> 02:09:43.480 align:start position:0%
than I've been alive so he has a lot of
 
02:09:45.750 --> 02:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
experience with this um two things he
 
02:09:48.390 --> 02:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
felt missing in the bill um that would
 
02:09:50.510 --> 02:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
be relevant it's on the amendment it's
 
02:09:53.030 --> 02:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
on line five uh stalking and criminal
 
02:09:54.910 --> 02:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
mischief um so this amendment just
 
02:09:57.830 --> 02:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
simply adds that language
 
02:10:00.430 --> 02:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
in all right any
 
02:10:03.109 --> 02:10:03.119 align:start position:0%
uh it does it does see make sense to me
 
02:10:05.910 --> 02:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
any other comments on this all right
 
02:10:08.990 --> 02:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
then so um I would propose to just have
 
02:10:11.310 --> 02:10:11.320 align:start position:0%
a show of hands on the amendment uh all
 
02:10:12.589 --> 02:10:12.599 align:start position:0%

02:12:28.629 --> 02:12:28.639 align:start position:0%

yes the speaker would like reports in
 
02:12:57.830 --> 02:12:57.840 align:start position:0%

02:13:00.510 --> 02:13:00.520 align:start position:0%

non-technical short report in by the end
 
02:13:07.470 --> 02:13:07.480 align:start position:0%
of the day today on
 
02:13:07.480 --> 02:13:09.830 align:start position:0%
of the day today on
4:35

02:13:09.830 --> 02:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
4:35
 
02:13:13.870 --> 02:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
um uh so you know what um just before we
 
02:13:16.510 --> 02:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
we recess just to let everybody know we
 
02:13:19.030 --> 02:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
only have one other bill that we've
 
02:13:20.750 --> 02:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
received from the Senate uh that we
 
02:13:24.669 --> 02:13:24.679 align:start position:0%
haven't had had a hearing on um I would
 
02:13:26.709 --> 02:13:26.719 align:start position:0%
prop and we and we need to exact the two
 
02:13:28.350 --> 02:13:28.360 align:start position:0%
bills that we did have hearings on today
 
02:13:31.030 --> 02:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
I would propose that we not have a
 
02:13:34.350 --> 02:13:34.360 align:start position:0%
session next Wednesday for just that um
 
02:13:36.549 --> 02:13:36.559 align:start position:0%
that know another bill yeah we might I
 
02:13:38.310 --> 02:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
think we're probably we're GNA I think
 
02:13:39.390 --> 02:13:39.400 align:start position:0%
we're probably going to get at least
 
02:13:41.430 --> 02:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
maybe one and maybe two other bills for
 
02:13:43.589 --> 02:13:43.599 align:start position:0%
some reason we're we're pretty light uh
 
02:13:45.750 --> 02:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
on Senate bills um so I think we'll have
 
02:13:47.629 --> 02:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
plenty of time to you know hear those
 
02:13:50.430 --> 02:13:50.440 align:start position:0%
bills and execute and uh so the earliest
 
02:13:53.510 --> 02:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
you would plan for us to Mee the
 
02:13:55.069 --> 02:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
earliest would be right would be two
 
02:13:57.790 --> 02:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
weeks from today two weeks from today
 
02:13:59.990 --> 02:14:00.000 align:start position:0%

02:14:20.229 --> 02:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
from well you know if I I guess what I
 
02:14:22.629 --> 02:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
