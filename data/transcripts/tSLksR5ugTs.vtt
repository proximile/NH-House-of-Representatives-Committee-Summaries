and so we will need to look at that in
 
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:28.380 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so I'd be
 
00:10:30.949 --> 00:10:30.959 align:start position:0%
interested in finding out who will be
 
00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:33.240 align:start position:0%
who which of those committees you'd be
 
00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:35.220 align:start position:0%
interested in serving on if you have a
 
00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:36.740 align:start position:0%
strong preference
 
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
Representatives Simon lekka scrota and
 
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
shewitt will be the chairs of those
 
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.449 align:start position:0%
shewitt will be the chairs of those
subcommittees

00:10:44.449 --> 00:10:44.459 align:start position:0%
subcommittees
 
00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:46.740 align:start position:0%
um assignment for pensions Lexus for
 
00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.350 align:start position:0%
um assignment for pensions Lexus for
licensing

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:49.190 align:start position:0%
licensing
um

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:52.260 align:start position:0%
grotif for organization and chew it for
 
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
the other subcommittee which we'll be
 
00:10:57.889 --> 00:10:57.899 align:start position:0%
picking up wherever necessary
 
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
so if anyone has a strong preference I'd
 
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.490 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.889 align:start position:0%
 
wow

00:11:08.889 --> 00:11:08.899 align:start position:0%
wow
 
00:11:12.829 --> 00:11:12.839 align:start position:0%
applied what you get to choose yeah well
 
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
I I mean I've made a draft but if but
 
00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
I'm more than welcome deserves a lot of
 
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
people here I don't know well which is
 
00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:23.100 align:start position:0%
which is unusual last term well we had a
 
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
couple of newbies but I met most of them
 
00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:28.140 align:start position:0%
this term we've got a an assortment of
 
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
people and I don't know all of them
 
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:41.820 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:44.100 align:start position:0%
other than that I think
 
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:46.980 align:start position:0%
that's mostly what I had so if anyone
 
00:11:49.069 --> 00:11:49.079 align:start position:0%
would like to comment on why they chose
 
00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:51.300 align:start position:0%
Edna I'd
 
00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
I'd love to hear it or you have any
 
00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:56.150 align:start position:0%
I'd love to hear it or you have any
questions

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:59.630 --> 00:11:59.640 align:start position:0%
it was under Bailey you're uh
 
00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:01.100 align:start position:0%
be quiet yeah
 
00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:09.949 --> 00:12:09.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:13.310 --> 00:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
I am representative McGuire Miss
 
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
chairman I was very interested whereas I
 
00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:19.140 align:start position:0%
am a first-time representative to study
 
00:12:22.009 --> 00:12:22.019 align:start position:0%
under a chair that has experience and
 
00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:24.600 align:start position:0%
also keeps things very orderly
 
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
I was raised by an old Marine so I know
 
00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
how to be short and to the point and I
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
heard you are too so I wanted to study
 
00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:33.420 align:start position:0%
under you thank you all right thank you
 
00:12:35.449 --> 00:12:35.459 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
representative uh thank you I know we
 
00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily know all the bills we
 
00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:41.700 align:start position:0%
have but you have some uh a prediction
 
00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:43.260 align:start position:0%
for what the schedule's going to look
 
00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:44.820 align:start position:0%
like ah
 
00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:50.509 --> 00:12:50.519 align:start position:0%
days and Thursdays
 
00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
I believe we are going to be getting
 
00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
something like 70 bills there's only 19
 
00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
in our possession right now
 
00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:01.740 align:start position:0%
uh this Wednesday and Thursday I've
 
00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:03.720 align:start position:0%
scheduled some of the
 
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
what I hope will be less contentious
 
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.190 align:start position:0%
what I hope will be less contentious
ones

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
ones
 
00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:11.820 align:start position:0%
so we should be able to uh
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:17.700 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
um and then I don't know when the others
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
are coming other than that oplc
 
00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:25.380 align:start position:0%
reorganization bill which will be coming
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
probably toward
 
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
the end of the month
 
00:13:32.329 --> 00:13:32.339 align:start position:0%
I gave them a deadline of the 20th and I
 
00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:36.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:38.509 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:13:38.509 --> 00:13:38.519 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
as far as other things I'd like to
 
00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:44.660 align:start position:0%
schedule executive sessions
 
00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
relatively often
 
00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
if we have a hearing and it's obvious to
 
00:13:51.949 --> 00:13:51.959 align:start position:0%
most of us that we know what we want to
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
do with the bill I'll ask representative
 
00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:57.420 align:start position:0%
Crowder to make a motion and we can exec
 
00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
it right there
 
00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
if it turns out that it is not obvious
 
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
um we can stop the executive session go
 
00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
think about it some more but if if we
 
00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:11.700 align:start position:0%
can get through some bills on Wednesday
 
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:17.220 align:start position:0%
representative Gould
 
00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
hi sorry I was filling out the paperwork
 
00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
when you asked about why I asked to be
 
00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
on the committee so this is my first
 
00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:26.940 align:start position:0%
time I was asked by the Democratic party
 
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
to run for rep which wasn't anything I
 
00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:33.060 align:start position:0%
had thought about doing ever I'm an
 
00:14:35.389 --> 00:14:35.399 align:start position:0%
independent a lifelong independent and
 
00:14:37.610 --> 00:14:37.620 align:start position:0%
I'm an enrolled member of the Abernathy
 
00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:40.500 align:start position:0%
the Mohegan band of the Abenaki Nation
 
00:14:42.769 --> 00:14:42.779 align:start position:0%
so as I thought about it talked to my
 
00:14:46.129 --> 00:14:46.139 align:start position:0%
husband about it there are you know
 
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
frequently bills not frequently
 
00:14:50.329 --> 00:14:50.339 align:start position:0%
occasionally Bill's got me for this
 
00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:54.420 align:start position:0%
committee that um my observation has
 
00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:57.060 align:start position:0%
been that can be confusing and
 
00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:57.730 align:start position:0%
been that can be confusing and
um

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:57.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
perplexing for committee members the
 
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
public in general the Abenaki people
 
00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:07.380 align:start position:0%
and so I thought that I could do some
 
00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
good maybe that way to help
 
00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:11.820 align:start position:0%
um just to help move things along
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
whatever so here I am thank you very
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:19.199 --> 00:15:20.750 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:24.839 align:start position:0%
a large part of our work is totally
 
00:15:24.839 --> 00:15:26.389 align:start position:0%
a large part of our work is totally
nonpartisan

00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan
 
00:15:27.650 --> 00:15:27.660 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:30.839 align:start position:0%
how you organize things is not
 
00:15:30.839 --> 00:15:32.509 align:start position:0%
how you organize things is not
um

00:15:32.509 --> 00:15:32.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
 isn't or shouldn't be a partisan
 
00:15:37.490 --> 00:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
issue we sometimes get divided on
 
00:15:41.389 --> 00:15:41.399 align:start position:0%
licensing but more often it if we have a
 
00:15:45.050 --> 00:15:45.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:47.449 --> 00:15:47.459 align:start position:0%
on a totally different issue than than
 
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
political party which I think is nice
 
00:15:51.949 --> 00:15:51.959 align:start position:0%
there's some committees where
 
00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:54.839 align:start position:0%
partisan issues Dominate and I don't and
 
00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
that's hard to work with
 
00:15:56.639 --> 00:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
that's hard to work with
okay

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:57.850 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:02.449 align:start position:0%
okay
[Music]

00:16:02.449 --> 00:16:02.459 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
good I'm sorry yeah Wilhelm
 
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
thanks Madam chair
 
00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:08.389 align:start position:0%
thanks Madam chair
um

00:16:08.389 --> 00:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:10.610 --> 00:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
I got my master's degree in in public
 
00:16:13.009 --> 00:16:13.019 align:start position:0%
administration which is studying the
 
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
efficiency and effectiveness of of
 
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
government and so uh I'm excited to
 
00:16:20.449 --> 00:16:20.459 align:start position:0%
think about ways to put that to work and
 
00:16:21.949 --> 00:16:21.959 align:start position:0%
bring different perspectives to the
 
00:16:21.959 --> 00:16:23.269 align:start position:0%
bring different perspectives to the
table

00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
table
 
00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:25.620 align:start position:0%
excellent that's very useful my my own
 
00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
experience is entirely in private
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
business so I don't
 
00:16:31.189 --> 00:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
which has different issues than the
 
00:16:31.199 --> 00:16:32.689 align:start position:0%
which has different issues than the
public

00:16:32.689 --> 00:16:32.699 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:34.260 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:37.500 align:start position:0%
yes representative Schmidt
 
00:16:39.769 --> 00:16:39.779 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
um so I had already served on a couple
 
00:16:46.129 --> 00:16:46.139 align:start position:0%
of other committees in my first several
 
00:16:49.069 --> 00:16:49.079 align:start position:0%
years in the legislature and when Terry
 
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
narelli became the speaker about
 
00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.310 align:start position:0%
narelli became the speaker about
07

00:16:55.310 --> 00:16:55.320 align:start position:0%
07
 
00:16:56.749 --> 00:16:56.759 align:start position:0%
oh yeah
 
00:16:59.410 --> 00:16:59.420 align:start position:0%
yeah no a long time ago
 
00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:03.660 align:start position:0%
she I I didn't put down a preference uh
 
00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:05.220 align:start position:0%
because I didn't want to go back to the
 
00:17:08.809 --> 00:17:08.819 align:start position:0%
first committee I'd been on uh and I
 
00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
left it up to her and she wanted to put
 
00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:16.620 align:start position:0%
me on a special committee that this
 
00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
committee the new members will be
 
00:17:21.949 --> 00:17:21.959 align:start position:0%
unfamiliar with the name but it's an
 
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
important committee and it its work
 
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
comes up in this committee pretty often
 
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
in uh Terry narelli wanted to put me on
 
00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:32.940 align:start position:0%
gel cards we call it the joint
 
00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
legislative committee on administrative
 
00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:38.039 align:start position:0%
rules and it has a lot of overlap with
 
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
with issues that are dealt with by Edna
 
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
so she put me on both of them
 
00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:47.940 align:start position:0%
um and uh so representing McGuire is the
 
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
is the chair or will be shortly if she
 
00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:52.580 align:start position:0%
isn't already
 
00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:55.340 align:start position:0%
I think we elected you in your absence
 
00:17:59.510 --> 00:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
last meeting uh not not because uh the
 
00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:01.380 align:start position:0%
dominant rule is you know if the person
 
00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:04.020 align:start position:0%
is out of the room you elect them chair
 
00:18:06.169 --> 00:18:06.179 align:start position:0%
um but because she had been share of gel
 
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
car several times previously and it's
 
00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
The house's term so so so we we uh we
 
00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
serve on gel cry together already for
 
00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
about eight years together I think uh
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
along with uh representative shuitt was
 
00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:24.780 align:start position:0%
temporarily and maybe once again will be
 
00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
on I think you're you're an alternate
 
00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:31.500 align:start position:0%
you're on gilcar this term Diane
 
00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:35.810 align:start position:0%
you're on gilcar this term Diane
jelcar

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:44.940 align:start position:0%
okay representative groda I think is on
 
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
it's always a little bit of a scramble
 
00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:52.140 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of a new session
 
00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:53.930 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of a new session
because

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:56.100 align:start position:0%
new people come on all these standing
 
00:18:59.930 --> 00:18:59.940 align:start position:0%
committees but there's a few uh
 
00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:01.980 align:start position:0%
old war horses like representative
 
00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:03.660 align:start position:0%
Schmidt and myself that are pretty
 
00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
consistent on on that committee
 
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhard Madam chair I'm
 
00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
just gonna sound kind of
 
00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:11.940 align:start position:0%
um I'm serious though do we go on any
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
field trips in the sense of we're
 
00:19:15.529 --> 00:19:15.539 align:start position:0%
supposed to be monitoring executive
 
00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:16.860 align:start position:0%
departments and administration we
 
00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
actually engage in
 
00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:20.580 align:start position:0%
we have been known to
 
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
uh if you if something comes up that you
 
00:19:25.549 --> 00:19:25.559 align:start position:0%
think would be a worthwhile feed field
 
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
trip let me know we've been to peas
 
00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:32.580 align:start position:0%
we've been to the secure psychiatric
 
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
unit and
 
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
couple of other places it's not as good
 
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
as say Recreation
 
00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:41.210 align:start position:0%
as say Recreation
and

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:41.220 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
but but we do go to an occasional field
 
00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:44.810 align:start position:0%
but but we do go to an occasional field
trip

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:44.820 align:start position:0%
trip
 
00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:46.860 align:start position:0%
because I went to what the county
 
00:19:50.029 --> 00:19:50.039 align:start position:0%
orientation to the Merrimack Nursing
 
00:19:51.289 --> 00:19:51.299 align:start position:0%
Home in the county jail it was pretty
 
00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
interesting and informative so if that
 
00:19:55.789 --> 00:19:55.799 align:start position:0%
is an option I would sign up for okay
 
00:19:57.169 --> 00:19:57.179 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
Leo if you see something that you think
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
is merits a field trip will arrange for
 
00:20:01.919 --> 00:20:03.470 align:start position:0%
is merits a field trip will arrange for
it

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:20:04.970 --> 00:20:04.980 align:start position:0%
um we
 
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
we also have this room on Fridays in
 
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
case of of sessions which are on
 
00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:12.590 align:start position:0%
case of of sessions which are on
Thursday

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
Thursday
 
00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:16.020 align:start position:0%
but I hope not to schedule very much on
 
00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:17.590 align:start position:0%
but I hope not to schedule very much on
Fridays

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
Fridays
 
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
the committee the subcommittee chairs
 
00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:22.260 align:start position:0%
can use Fridays
 
00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
and uh mornings I don't believe starting
 
00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:28.260 align:start position:0%
too early because it's inconsiderate for
 
00:20:30.350 --> 00:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
people that have to come a long way
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
but the uh
 
00:20:34.669 --> 00:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
uh mornings and late afternoons are
 
00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:39.900 align:start position:0%
available even on days we have a pretty
 
00:20:43.549 --> 00:20:43.559 align:start position:0%
pretty hefty workload for uh
 
00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:46.860 align:start position:0%
Madam chairs yes ma'am if I can just put
 
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
my two cents worth in uh for the benefit
 
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
of the new members of the committee
 
00:20:54.529 --> 00:20:54.539 align:start position:0%
um I always describe Edna as a nuts and
 
00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:56.120 align:start position:0%
bolts committee
 
00:20:59.570 --> 00:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
we kind of look at all assets of state
 
00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:02.700 align:start position:0%
government and I guarantee you new
 
00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
members especially you will learn an
 
00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
awful lot about how our state works that
 
00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
you didn't know before thank you yes you
 
00:21:15.049 --> 00:21:15.059 align:start position:0%
will learn about obscure and
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
probably deservedly obscure sections of
 
00:21:21.409 --> 00:21:21.419 align:start position:0%
the State uh I've spent a lot of time
 
00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:24.419 align:start position:0%
working on specifications for wood
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
stoves slaughterhouse regulation and
 
00:21:32.270 --> 00:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
oh smoke alarms that was my first
 
00:21:34.909 --> 00:21:34.919 align:start position:0%
introduction representative and I spent
 
00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:36.780 align:start position:0%
way more time than I ever expected on
 
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
grease traps
 
00:21:41.270 --> 00:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
a whole subcommittee on them that's it
 
00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
yes we uh we get Oddball stuff
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
which is nice okay
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
um yes representative Schmidt
 
00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am chair uh and for those
 
00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:54.780 align:start position:0%
of you who don't know the secure
 
00:21:59.149 --> 00:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
psychiatric unit is located currently uh
 
00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
for a
 
00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
limited amount of time because the state
 
00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:05.780 align:start position:0%
is building a new uh forensic Hospital
 
00:22:08.870 --> 00:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh which will be available in a couple
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
of years but at the moment the secure
 
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
psychiatric unit is in the state prison
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh very unhappily for the last 35 or 36
 
00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:19.330 align:start position:0%
uh very unhappily for the last 35 or 36
years

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:19.340 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:23.580 align:start position:0%
and so a number of us have worked for
 
00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:25.260 align:start position:0%
quite some time on getting it out of
 
00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:26.460 align:start position:0%
there because it's not a good
 
00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:27.649 align:start position:0%
there because it's not a good
arrangement

00:22:27.649 --> 00:22:27.659 align:start position:0%
arrangement
 
00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:29.820 align:start position:0%
prevents it from being able to be
 
00:22:34.070 --> 00:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
accredited and inputs uh Corrections
 
00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:36.260 align:start position:0%
Officers in many cases
 
00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:39.980 align:start position:0%
as overseers of people who are
 
00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:41.960 align:start position:0%
mentally ill
 
00:22:45.049 --> 00:22:45.059 align:start position:0%
and sometimes that doesn't work out well
 
00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
so but
 
00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
so I hope we will never have to go back
 
00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:53.220 align:start position:0%
to the state prison again to to see the
 
00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
secure psychiatric unit will do a tour
 
00:22:59.149 --> 00:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire hospital where the
 
00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:02.940 align:start position:0%
forensic hospital will be built so but
 
00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:04.860 align:start position:0%
that won't be for a couple years
 
00:23:06.770 --> 00:23:06.780 align:start position:0%
so okay yeah
 
00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
represent gold
 
00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
I was being transparent and giving you
 
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
my most unique
 
00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
feature for the committee but I should
 
00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:17.460 align:start position:0%
say that my professional career was in
 
00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
child welfare and in what child welfare
 
00:23:23.570 --> 00:23:23.580 align:start position:0%
oh okay and I worked I ran residential
 
00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:26.940 align:start position:0%
programs under contract for dcyf but
 
00:23:30.169 --> 00:23:30.179 align:start position:0%
then I worked for dcyf in um
 
00:23:33.289 --> 00:23:33.299 align:start position:0%
on the information system I was the
 
00:23:36.409 --> 00:23:36.419 align:start position:0%
person who interpreted Social Work
 
00:23:39.169 --> 00:23:39.179 align:start position:0%
practice to the computer programmers for
 
00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:41.700 align:start position:0%
Bridges the hated bridges in fact on 911
 
00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
I was here at a hearing talking about
 
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:47.940 align:start position:0%
how we store data uh so in my role in
 
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
dcyf of course I'm working in the state
 
00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:53.700 align:start position:0%
office I was trained about the whole
 
00:23:57.289 --> 00:23:57.299 align:start position:0%
sausage making process and and um and
 
00:24:00.289 --> 00:24:00.299 align:start position:0%
how laws become policy and policy become
 
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
procedure and my role was most
 
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
frequently in working on the procedure
 
00:24:07.149 --> 00:24:07.159 align:start position:0%
for the dcyf component
 
00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:10.020 align:start position:0%
and um I really hope we do get to go to
 
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
the psychiatric secure unit to visit my
 
00:24:15.049 --> 00:24:15.059 align:start position:0%
grandson is there and I haven't been
 
00:24:18.289 --> 00:24:18.299 align:start position:0%
able to visit him so I'm very interested
 
00:24:21.049 --> 00:24:21.059 align:start position:0%
in in working on any of those issues
 
00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:23.220 align:start position:0%
Madam chair and I wanted you to under to
 
00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:25.860 align:start position:0%
know I had those kinds
 
00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
excellent well if you're familiar with
 
00:24:30.289 --> 00:24:30.299 align:start position:0%
it we're I've seen that we're going to

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:53.400 align:start position:0%
called nhos now you know which try to
 
00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:55.860 align:start position:0%
put in as plain English as we can some
 
00:26:58.190 --> 00:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
of the more complicated topics uh we
 
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
hear about from members and lawmakers
 
00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:02.220 align:start position:0%
and employers you know
 
00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:05.220 align:start position:0%
pension liability uh colas things like
 
00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:07.020 align:start position:0%
that so that's just the supplemental
 
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
information and it's also a fact sheet
 
00:27:10.789 --> 00:27:10.799 align:start position:0%
that we're also going to be dropping off
 
00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:11.940 align:start position:0%
at the house
 
00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:14.100 align:start position:0%

McGuire for welcoming us to your
 
00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
committee we look forward to
 
00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
um presenting a great deal of
 
00:27:36.769 --> 00:27:36.779 align:start position:0%
information about nhrs and how it works
 
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
before I do that though I would like to
 
00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:41.700 align:start position:0%
turn to two of my colleagues who have
 
00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:44.220 align:start position:0%
recently joined nhrs
 
00:27:47.090 --> 00:27:47.100 align:start position:0%
um Marie Mullen is our Director of
 
00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:49.380 align:start position:0%
Finance you may recognize her she used
 
00:27:51.169 --> 00:27:51.179 align:start position:0%
to be the Director of Finance for the
 
00:27:54.649 --> 00:27:54.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:56.990 --> 00:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
and then secondly on her right is
 
00:27:59.510 --> 00:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
Reynold Levesque he is our new Chief
 
00:28:01.789 --> 00:28:01.799 align:start position:0%
investment officer he's filling the very
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
large shoes that Larry Johansen left
 
00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:07.620 align:start position:0%
when he retired as our director of
 
00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
Investments and Reynold has been with
 
00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:14.220 align:start position:0%
with us since the beginning of October
 
00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:16.980 align:start position:0%
so we've got a lot of new faces um from
 
00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
nhrs but our mission and vision Remains
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
the Same
 
00:28:24.289 --> 00:28:24.299 align:start position:0%
we do have a formal presentation to give
 
00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:26.460 align:start position:0%
you but as Marty noted you know please
 
00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:28.860 align:start position:0%
feel free to jump in I'm sure to the
 
00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:31.140 align:start position:0%
newer members of the committee
 
00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:32.460 align:start position:0%
um you're going to be learning a lot of
 
00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:34.860 align:start position:0%
jargon which you haven't been exposed to
 
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
before and nhrs like every other entity
 
00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:41.340 align:start position:0%
in the state has a lot of its own jargon
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of it has to do with either
 
00:28:45.769 --> 00:28:45.779 align:start position:0%
Investments or Actuarial matters and so
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
if we're not doing a good job defining
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
things as we go along please just say
 
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
say you'd like some clarification
 
00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:59.470 --> 00:28:59.480 align:start position:0%
you can get a little bit closer
 
00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:01.860 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you very much for that
 
00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:03.710 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you very much for that
feedback

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
feedback
 
00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:07.980 align:start position:0%
so on page two of the presentation you
 
00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:09.900 align:start position:0%
will see the map of all the different
 
00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:11.340 align:start position:0%
areas we're going to be touching on
 
00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:12.350 align:start position:0%
areas we're going to be touching on
today

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:14.940 align:start position:0%
um brief overview Marty's going to walk
 
00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:16.860 align:start position:0%
through membership and benefits then
 
00:29:19.250 --> 00:29:19.260 align:start position:0%
I'll talk about Investments Marty will
 
00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
go back and discuss contributions and
 
00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
funding and legislation and then all
 
00:29:27.409 --> 00:29:27.419 align:start position:0%
providing a wrap-up summary at the end
 
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
and at the end of the materials there's
 
00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
a number of appendices that I'll be will
 
00:29:34.669 --> 00:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
be referring to during our presentation
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
which have a lot of good background
 
00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:40.140 align:start position:0%
information for you
 
00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
so let's jump in page three
 
00:29:48.169 --> 00:29:48.179 align:start position:0%
so nhrs is a contributory multi-employer
 
00:29:51.409 --> 00:29:51.419 align:start position:0%
defined benefit plan and was established
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
in 1967 contributory means that the
 
00:29:58.090 --> 00:29:58.100 align:start position:0%
members the employees make contributions
 
00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
and so our members make a substantial
 
00:30:03.769 --> 00:30:03.779 align:start position:0%
proportion of the total contributions
 
00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
that are received for their benefits
 
00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
so nhrs in addition to providing a
 
00:30:12.289 --> 00:30:12.299 align:start position:0%
retirement benefit also provides
 
00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:16.460 align:start position:0%
disability and death benefits as well as
 
00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
post-retirement medical subsidy to
 
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
eligible members and beneficiaries
 
00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:25.020 align:start position:0%
and once members attain eligibility
 
00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
which is referred to as vesting they can
 
00:30:32.029 --> 00:30:32.039 align:start position:0%
receive a guaranteed lifetime pension
 
00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:34.140 align:start position:0%
and the pension benefits are funded
 
00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
through the employee as well as the
 
00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
employer contributions and the
 
00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:40.860 align:start position:0%
investment income
 
00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:43.620 align:start position:0%
and traditionally the investment returns
 
00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:46.860 align:start position:0%
have been have provided the majority of
 
00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:50.039 align:start position:0%
the monies that go and pay our members
 
00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:53.039 align:start position:0%
their benefits and their beneficiaries
 
00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
so if you could turn to page
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
four of your
 
00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:01.549 align:start position:0%
four of your
packet

00:31:01.549 --> 00:31:01.559 align:start position:0%
packet
 
00:31:04.669 --> 00:31:04.679 align:start position:0%
it shows that nhrs is a component unit
 
00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
of state government overseen by a Board
 
00:31:09.649 --> 00:31:09.659 align:start position:0%
of Trustees
 
00:31:12.889 --> 00:31:12.899 align:start position:0%
and the Board of Trustees has a role and
 
00:31:15.049 --> 00:31:15.059 align:start position:0%
asked as the independent investment
 
00:31:17.269 --> 00:31:17.279 align:start position:0%
committee and they're both both groups
 
00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
are fiduciaries
 
00:31:22.010 --> 00:31:22.020 align:start position:0%
the legislature that is you you are our
 
00:31:24.049 --> 00:31:24.059 align:start position:0%
plan sponsor
 
00:31:27.169 --> 00:31:27.179 align:start position:0%
and our staff implements the statutes
 
00:31:30.289 --> 00:31:30.299 align:start position:0%
and rules and policies but in addition
 
00:31:32.269 --> 00:31:32.279 align:start position:0%
to state law we also have to be
 
00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
concerned with federal law that's where
 
00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:37.140 align:start position:0%
the Internal Revenue code comes in we
 
00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
are what's known as a qualified pension
 
00:31:43.130 --> 00:31:43.140 align:start position:0%
plan that means that the contributions
 
00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:46.860 align:start position:0%
that go into the plan are on a pre-tax
 
00:31:51.409 --> 00:31:51.419 align:start position:0%
basis to the to the members and the
 
00:31:54.049 --> 00:31:54.059 align:start position:0%
investment income that accrues on those
 
00:31:56.930 --> 00:31:56.940 align:start position:0%
earnings during the employees working
 
00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:01.620 align:start position:0%
career are not taxed until such time as
 
00:32:06.049 --> 00:32:06.059 align:start position:0%
the members retire and receive their
 
00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:08.700 align:start position:0%
pension benefits so being a qualified
 
00:32:12.769 --> 00:32:12.779 align:start position:0%
plan is a big deal and as serious tax
 
00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:14.820 align:start position:0%
consequences and that's why we always
 
00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:17.640 align:start position:0%
are concerned that we are following the
 
00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:20.220 align:start position:0%
Internal Revenue code as well as New
 
00:32:22.730 --> 00:32:22.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state law
 
00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:24.620 align:start position:0%
then there's also the New Hampshire
 
00:32:27.889 --> 00:32:27.899 align:start position:0%
Constitution Article 36a
 
00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:31.380 align:start position:0%
which states that the funds are for the
 
00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
exclusive purpose of providing benefits
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
for our members
 
00:32:38.149 --> 00:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
and it requires the board to certify
 
00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
employer rates based on sound Actuarial
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
practice the board just did that this
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
summer they just certified the rates for
 
00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:49.860 align:start position:0%
fiscal years 24 and 25 and Marty later
 
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
on in the presentation will be will be
 
00:32:54.649 --> 00:32:54.659 align:start position:0%
discussing what those rates are
 
00:32:57.289 --> 00:32:57.299 align:start position:0%
and it also requires and this is the
 
00:33:00.529 --> 00:33:00.539 align:start position:0%
hard part is that the employers have to
 
00:33:03.049 --> 00:33:03.059 align:start position:0%
pay the rates that have been certified
 
00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:04.980 align:start position:0%
you've probably heard
 
00:33:08.269 --> 00:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
um either as a legislator or even as a
 
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
citizen that there are many states in
 
00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:13.140 align:start position:0%
the country that in the in the U.S that
 
00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:15.860 align:start position:0%
have large unfunded pension liabilities
 
00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
the main reason why those states have
 
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
those liabilities is because they've
 
00:33:23.269 --> 00:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
never paid the contributions that were
 
00:33:26.269 --> 00:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
required so examples of that are New
 
00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
Jersey New Jersey is what New Jersey
 
00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
Illinois and Kentucky are the poster
 
00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:34.559 align:start position:0%
children for not paying contributions
 
00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:37.140 align:start position:0%
fortunately New Hampshire has been
 
00:33:38.450 --> 00:33:38.460 align:start position:0%
disciplined and makes those
 
00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:41.210 align:start position:0%
disciplined and makes those
contributions

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:41.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
the next slide is Slide Five
 
00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:47.820 align:start position:0%
and so one of the key fiduciary duties
 
00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
for our trustees is to make sure that
 
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
our plan is adequately funded
 
00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:56.220 align:start position:0%
and this equation is the Hallmark
 
00:34:00.409 --> 00:34:00.419 align:start position:0%
equation of pension plans contributions
 
00:34:03.649 --> 00:34:03.659 align:start position:0%
plus investment income
 
00:34:07.789 --> 00:34:07.799 align:start position:0%
over time must equal benefit payments
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
plus the expenses
 
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
and the reason why this all works is the
 
00:34:16.369 --> 00:34:16.379 align:start position:0%
compounding of interest income and
 
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
dividend income on the Investments
 
00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:21.599 align:start position:0%
Albert Einstein the famous mathematician
 
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
rightly said that compounding interest
 
00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
is the eighth wonder of the world and
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
that's what makes our pension plan and
 
00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:32.220 align:start position:0%
all other pension plans work it's
 
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
getting the money in on time
 
00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:36.899 align:start position:0%
having a good investment
 
00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
plan and executing that plan
 
00:34:44.990 --> 00:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
as of June 30 2022 our trust fund assets
 
00:34:50.329 --> 00:34:50.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
the next slide is slide six and this
 
00:34:57.650 --> 00:34:57.660 align:start position:0%
shows how our assets have grown steadily
 
00:34:59.150 --> 00:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
over time
 
00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
as you can see we did have a bit of a
 
00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:02.930 align:start position:0%
as you can see we did have a bit of a
dip

00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:02.940 align:start position:0%
dip
 
00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:05.220 align:start position:0%
um well actually before the slide with
 
00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:06.070 align:start position:0%
um well actually before the slide with
the

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:09.660 align:start position:0%
2008-2009 and we've been CL our assets
 
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
have been climbing steadily after that
 
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
and these assets that are reflected here
 
00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:17.940 align:start position:0%
these are the fair market value of the
 
00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
assets our actuaries when they present
 
00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:23.220 align:start position:0%
information and present different
 
00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:26.220 align:start position:0%
metrics they like to use a smoothed
 
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
value of our assets because as you can
 
00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:31.740 align:start position:0%
see on this Slide the numbers
 
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
can jump up and down a bit as you can
 
00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:36.900 align:start position:0%
see the precipitous
 
00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:39.780 align:start position:0%
um declined that we had in this past
 
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal year which was a very challenging
 
00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:45.180 align:start position:0%
year in Investments
 
00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
and at this point I will turn things
 
00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:53.870 align:start position:0%
thank you
again

00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:35:56.329 --> 00:35:56.339 align:start position:0%
um so slide seven just some some recent
 
00:35:58.609 --> 00:35:58.619 align:start position:0%
nhrs initiatives
 
00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:00.900 align:start position:0%
um we're the system is in the midst of a
 
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
multi-year project to upgrade its core
 
00:36:04.849 --> 00:36:04.859 align:start position:0%
pension Administration system basically
 
00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
the brain of the retirement system that
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
calculates all the benefits and and does
 
00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
all that our current system was put in
 
00:36:17.089 --> 00:36:17.099 align:start position:0%
in 2003 four so it you know anyone who
 
00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
deals with software or large
 
00:36:21.109 --> 00:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
applications realizes that that's
 
00:36:23.690 --> 00:36:23.700 align:start position:0%
extremely elderly so we're moving to a
 
00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:24.950 align:start position:0%
extremely elderly so we're moving to a
newer

00:36:24.950 --> 00:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
newer
 
00:36:27.410 --> 00:36:27.420 align:start position:0%
um you know more more secure web-based
 
00:36:29.329 --> 00:36:29.339 align:start position:0%
version of that that platform so that
 
00:36:32.569 --> 00:36:32.579 align:start position:0%
that's been a significant internal piece
 
00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:34.500 align:start position:0%
as we as we head towards the end of this
 
00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
year where I hope to be switching over
 
00:36:39.109 --> 00:36:39.119 align:start position:0%
um cyber security enhancements and
 
00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
training has have been a priority for a
 
00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
number of years and that that's ongoing
 
00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
again anybody who reads a headline
 
00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
realizes you know different security
 
00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
threats and and Bad actors out there in
 
00:36:52.250 --> 00:36:52.260 align:start position:0%
the world and we've got two things that
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of people people want a money and
 
00:36:56.510 --> 00:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
personal information so we work very
 
00:36:59.810 --> 00:36:59.820 align:start position:0%
hard to train the staff and also to
 
00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:01.980 align:start position:0%
protect us with technological solutions
 
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
and Human Solutions to to try to prevent
 
00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:08.220 align:start position:0%
uh something like that from affecting us
 
00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:08.930 align:start position:0%
uh something like that from affecting us
um

00:37:08.930 --> 00:37:08.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:11.089 --> 00:37:11.099 align:start position:0%
enhanced education and Outreach we've
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
always done member education we've been
 
00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:15.060 align:start position:0%
trying we've been adding uh different
 
00:37:16.849 --> 00:37:16.859 align:start position:0%
programs targeted for members in
 
00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:18.440 align:start position:0%
different stages of their careers
 
00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
additional employer
 
00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
presentations on different niches and
 
00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:26.820 align:start position:0%
public education typically what we do in
 
00:37:28.609 --> 00:37:28.619 align:start position:0%
the first year of a session is after we
 
00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:31.740 align:start position:0%
do this presentation for any committee
 
00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:34.380 align:start position:0%
who'll hear us in the house or Senate um
 
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
you know we open this up for you know
 
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
employers and members and retirees to
 
00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:39.540 align:start position:0%
come and we'll give them the same
 
00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
presentation over at the office in a few
 
00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:42.780 align:start position:0%
weeks so
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
um you know we try to we think that you
 
00:37:48.349 --> 00:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
know there's a lot of
 
00:37:50.109 --> 00:37:50.119 align:start position:0%
um maybe misconceptions or
 
00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding of how the retirement
 
00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
system works so we want to be out front
 
00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
you know defining what the facts are so
 
00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:57.720 align:start position:0%
people can at least have reasonable
 
00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:00.540 align:start position:0%
disagreements based on on the underlying
 
00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
facts uh and then uh two it's just
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
celebrated its second anniversary but we
 
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
created a contact center uh for incoming
 
00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
calls and emails a couple years ago uh
 
00:38:12.230 --> 00:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
that's been very successful in cutting
 
00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
down on people you know being left in
 
00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
voicemail and more on hold uh things
 
00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
like that
 
00:38:19.790 --> 00:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
um the folks there are trained to answer
 
00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:22.740 align:start position:0%
probably was about 80 ish or 90 of the
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
questions on the first call rather than
 
00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
having a transfer so that's that's some
 
00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:29.700 align:start position:0%
of the things we've been up to
 
00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
the next slide is a historical slide and
 
00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:35.460 align:start position:0%
you know one thing is you know the past
 
00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:37.740 align:start position:0%
is always close and there are a lot of
 
00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:39.300 align:start position:0%
decisions made in the past that are
 
00:38:41.569 --> 00:38:41.579 align:start position:0%
affecting where we are right now as a
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
um and honestly I could go back and do
 
00:38:47.569 --> 00:38:47.579 align:start position:0%
four slides going back to the 70s if
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
you'd like but I'm not going to do that
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
right now for this committee but since
 
00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:53.820 align:start position:0%
2007 over the last 15 or so years
 
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
there's been some major changes to nhrs
 
00:38:59.150 --> 00:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
uh beginning in 07 the legislature
 
00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
changed the way the actuaries calculate
 
00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:04.380 align:start position:0%
our funding and our liabilities and our
 
00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:07.380 align:start position:0%
rate I'll go into a little history about
 
00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:09.540 align:start position:0%
what happened in the 90s when we get
 
00:39:11.089 --> 00:39:11.099 align:start position:0%
into the employer rates but essentially
 
00:39:13.550 --> 00:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
this was a reset to the to the most
 
00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:15.660 align:start position:0%
commonly and currently only acceptable
 
00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:18.599 align:start position:0%
way to calculate our funding uh there
 
00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:21.780 align:start position:0%
was a sort of a method in place prior to
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
that that under charged employers
 
00:39:26.089 --> 00:39:26.099 align:start position:0%
essentially but that was corrected by
 
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
the legislature in 07.
 
00:39:30.829 --> 00:39:30.839 align:start position:0%
um through legislation the independent
 
00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:33.320 align:start position:0%
investment committee was created in 09
 
00:39:36.109 --> 00:39:36.119 align:start position:0%
previously the board had done uh you
 
00:39:38.089 --> 00:39:38.099 align:start position:0%
know the the investment nitty-gritty of
 
00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
you know hiring and firing and
 
00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:41.220 align:start position:0%
monitoring managers and we the
 
00:39:43.609 --> 00:39:43.619 align:start position:0%
legislature created a um
 
00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
separate committee that had non-trustee
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
members as well as a couple of trustees
 
00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
and all of the members have to have
 
00:39:52.849 --> 00:39:52.859 align:start position:0%
significant experience in uh Finance or
 
00:39:55.069 --> 00:39:55.079 align:start position:0%
institutional investment so we got a
 
00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:56.460 align:start position:0%
group of professionals together and
 
00:39:58.910 --> 00:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
they've actually grown the fund uh quite
 
00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
well over the uh the last 13 years and
 
00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:04.740 align:start position:0%
ngm's got a slide about that later on
 
00:40:08.329 --> 00:40:08.339 align:start position:0%
um 2010 this was enacted in 07 but a
 
00:40:10.490 --> 00:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
30-year closed amortization of our
 
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
pension liabilities and we'll talk about
 
00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:15.060 align:start position:0%
liabilities a lot throughout this
 
00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
presentation but
 
00:40:18.589 --> 00:40:18.599 align:start position:0%
um the legislature put a we're going to
 
00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:20.820 align:start position:0%
start paying this debt off now and it's
 
00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
going to be done by 2039 before it was a
 
00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
rolling amortization so you're really
 
00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:26.940 align:start position:0%
never paying it off you're almost
 
00:40:28.910 --> 00:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
refinancing every two years just rolling
 
00:40:31.130 --> 00:40:31.140 align:start position:0%
the debt forward and forward so the
 
00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:33.540 align:start position:0%
close the amortization was a big one
 
00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
um and in 2011 the board lowered our
 
00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:37.560 align:start position:0%
investment assumption
 
00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
from eight and a half to seven and three
 
00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
quarters uh there were subsequent
 
00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:43.560 align:start position:0%
reductions over the last 10 years to the
 
00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
current 6.75 this is a reflection both
 
00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:48.900 align:start position:0%
of you know sort of the reality of
 
00:40:50.810 --> 00:40:50.820 align:start position:0%
markets things were a lot more volatile
 
00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:52.740 align:start position:0%
than they were even 10 years ago
 
00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
investment wise and fixed income
 
00:40:57.109 --> 00:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
investing with interest rates
 
00:41:00.109 --> 00:41:00.119 align:start position:0%
historically low for so long uh you know
 
00:41:01.849 --> 00:41:01.859 align:start position:0%
there was there was rebalancing and you
 
00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
couldn't count on your fixed income to
 
00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
bring in you know five six percent like
 
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
you could uh you know in the 90s and the
 
00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
early 2000s so that was sort of a
 
00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:11.220 align:start position:0%
recognition of
 
00:41:13.069 --> 00:41:13.079 align:start position:0%
you know what a realistic number would
 
00:41:13.079 --> 00:41:14.210 align:start position:0%
you know what a realistic number would
be

00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:14.220 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
um 2011 hb2 there's a there's a there's
 
00:41:18.589 --> 00:41:18.599 align:start position:0%
a house bill too every two years it's
 
00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
the Budget Trailer bill but uh this 2011
 
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
hb2 and contained you know about 25
 
00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:26.820 align:start position:0%
pages of changes to nhrs
 
00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
um it was in a standalone Senate bill
 
00:41:30.589 --> 00:41:30.599 align:start position:0%
that was vetoed by the governor and
 
00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:33.540 align:start position:0%
reinserted into hb2 but essentially this
 
00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:36.300 align:start position:0%
increased member contributions reduced
 
00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
benefit accruals for some current and
 
00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:40.380 align:start position:0%
future members uh changing the
 
00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:43.140 align:start position:0%
composition of our board eliminated the
 
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
state subsidy for local employer
 
00:41:47.089 --> 00:41:47.099 align:start position:0%
retirement costs and and many other uh
 
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
changes that folks will be talking to
 
00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:52.380 align:start position:0%
about this this session with some
 
00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:54.180 align:start position:0%
legislation coming up
 
00:41:56.089 --> 00:41:56.099 align:start position:0%
um so that was by far the biggest change
 
00:41:58.310 --> 00:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
since the system was created back in the
 
00:42:02.089 --> 00:42:02.099 align:start position:0%
60s the the changes in uh 2011.
 
00:42:04.010 --> 00:42:04.020 align:start position:0%
um because of the significance of those
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
changes the number of
 
00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:08.700 align:start position:0%
court cases were brought by affected
 
00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
parties and the Supreme Court
 
00:42:12.829 --> 00:42:12.839 align:start position:0%
essentially uphold the legislature's
 
00:42:16.250 --> 00:42:16.260 align:start position:0%
purview to prospectively change you know
 
00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:19.380 align:start position:0%
benefit Provisions uh for members
 
00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
um you know uh in a series of decisions
 
00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:24.180 align:start position:0%
that were reduced uh released over
 
00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:27.180 align:start position:0%
between 14 and 16.
 
00:42:28.970 --> 00:42:28.980 align:start position:0%
again we talked about the changes to the
 
00:42:31.730 --> 00:42:31.740 align:start position:0%
assumed rate of return and in 2017 there
 
00:42:33.050 --> 00:42:33.060 align:start position:0%
was something called the decennial
 
00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:35.220 align:start position:0%
commission the first Commission of this
 
00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:36.900 align:start position:0%
type met in 07 there'll be another one
 
00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
in 2027 it's a statutory committee and
 
00:42:42.349 --> 00:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
chair Maguire was on it
 
00:42:42.359 --> 00:42:43.010 align:start position:0%
chair Maguire was on it
um

00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:43.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
it it it's charged with looking at the
 
00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
long-term viability of the retirement
 
00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
system and looking back at the last 10
 
00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:54.020 align:start position:0%
years and at where we are going forward
 
00:42:57.050 --> 00:42:57.060 align:start position:0%
uh that that is not just the legislative
 
00:42:59.510 --> 00:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
committee there were members retirees
 
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
members of the public and employer
 
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
Representatives on there as well and
 
00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:05.700 align:start position:0%
that that committee met through the fall
 
00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:08.040 align:start position:0%
of 17 and issued a fairly lengthy report
 
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
that is available on the general court
 
00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:12.660 align:start position:0%
website under special committees and we
 
00:43:14.089 --> 00:43:14.099 align:start position:0%
have a copy on our site if anybody's
 
00:43:15.829 --> 00:43:15.839 align:start position:0%
ever interested in a link
 
00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:18.180 align:start position:0%
representative I have a hard copy know
 
00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
how to get it to you
 
00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:22.140 align:start position:0%
um so that's sort of the lay of the land
 
00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
of where we've been over the last 10
 
00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:25.010 align:start position:0%
of where we've been over the last 10
years

00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:25.020 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:43:26.569 --> 00:43:26.579 align:start position:0%
um and I'm going to switch gears to
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
slide nine for brief this overview just
 
00:43:31.849 --> 00:43:31.859 align:start position:0%
a second are there uh any there aren't
 
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
any questions there will be a quiz yeah
 
00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:38.030 align:start position:0%
any questions there will be a quiz yeah
representative

00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
um going back to slide four I'm just
 
00:43:44.809 --> 00:43:44.819 align:start position:0%
curious about the makeup of both the
 
00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:46.740 align:start position:0%
Board of Trustees and the investment
 
00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:48.170 align:start position:0%
Board of Trustees and the investment
committee

00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:48.180 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:48.770 align:start position:0%
committee
um

00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:48.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
what how are those members appointed
 
00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:53.950 align:start position:0%
what how are those members appointed
um

00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:53.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
the um there's an actual in the appendix
 
00:43:58.490 --> 00:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
the appendices there's a list of the
 
00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
membership uh in the back
 
00:44:02.809 --> 00:44:02.819 align:start position:0%
um the Board of Trustees is four members
 
00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:04.980 align:start position:0%
of the public uh nominated by the
 
00:44:07.309 --> 00:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
governor confirmed by the council uh
 
00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:10.140 align:start position:0%
there's four active member employees one
 
00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
from each of the four member groups
 
00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:13.380 align:start position:0%
employee teach teacher police and fire
 
00:44:16.130 --> 00:44:16.140 align:start position:0%
and those are nominated by employee
 
00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:18.060 align:start position:0%
organizations and then they go through
 
00:44:20.089 --> 00:44:20.099 align:start position:0%
the governor and Council the employers
 
00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:22.140 align:start position:0%
have basically the same layout the
 
00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:24.900 align:start position:0%
counties the municipalities the school
 
00:44:27.349 --> 00:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
districts and the state has one employer
 
00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative and then the treasurer is
 
00:44:31.609 --> 00:44:31.619 align:start position:0%
ex-officio is the 13th member of the
 
00:44:35.569 --> 00:44:35.579 align:start position:0%
board the iic all are confirmed by um
 
00:44:38.569 --> 00:44:38.579 align:start position:0%
governor and Council uh the the board
 
00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:40.260 align:start position:0%
chair names of the trustee members of
 
00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:42.060 align:start position:0%
the investment committee and the others
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
um you know again are non-trustees so
 
00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:45.660 align:start position:0%
they come from outside and that's page
 
00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:48.300 align:start position:0%
35 and 36.
 
00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:52.140 align:start position:0%
thanks representative Aber
 
00:44:53.950 --> 00:44:53.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:44:57.650 --> 00:44:57.660 align:start position:0%
my question may be more nuts and bolts
 
00:44:59.809 --> 00:44:59.819 align:start position:0%
than it needs to be and if it is just uh
 
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
just let me know
 
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um so my question is with
 
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
regard to the plan
 
00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:11.700 align:start position:0%
is there a reason why there's more of a
 
00:45:15.370 --> 00:45:15.380 align:start position:0%
calf plan instead of an after-tax plan
 
00:45:18.050 --> 00:45:18.060 align:start position:0%
for our retirees
 
00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:21.060 align:start position:0%
in other words with tax rates going up
 
00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
higher and higher and higher these
 
00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
people are contributing after tax money
 
00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
sorry before tax money meaning that as
 
00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
it grows in as the tax base grows that
 
00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:35.720 align:start position:0%
they will be they won't be able to
 
00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative a bear employees pay a
 
00:45:46.430 --> 00:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
fixed percentage of salary toward the
 
00:45:49.609 --> 00:45:49.619 align:start position:0%
pension there are also
 
00:45:52.609 --> 00:45:52.619 align:start position:0%
other plans where they can make pre and
 
00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
post tax contributions if they wish
 
00:45:59.329 --> 00:45:59.339 align:start position:0%
those are all voluntary and
 
00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:01.500 align:start position:0%
not under the purview of the retirement
 
00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:04.160 align:start position:0%
system thank you
 
00:46:07.309 --> 00:46:07.319 align:start position:0%
in general terms too the pensions are
 
00:46:08.750 --> 00:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
lower than what they're making as an
 
00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:10.079 align:start position:0%
active employee so they may be in a
 
00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
lower bracket if they're taxed on the
 
00:46:14.750 --> 00:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
post retirement income yeah
 
00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
representative true
 
00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair on slide eight it
 
00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:24.420 align:start position:0%
shows uh the reduced rate of return
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
being lowered a number of times
 
00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
what does that how does that affect the
 
00:46:33.609 --> 00:46:33.619 align:start position:0%
retirement system the reduced rate
 
00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:36.300 align:start position:0%
basically the member contributions are a
 
00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
fixed amount coming in it's a statutory
 
00:46:40.430 --> 00:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
rate that the members pay in and the
 
00:46:42.349 --> 00:46:42.359 align:start position:0%
other two revenue streams are employer
 
00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:44.940 align:start position:0%
contributions and investment income so
 
00:46:47.569 --> 00:46:47.579 align:start position:0%
if the expectation is investment income
 
00:46:49.609 --> 00:46:49.619 align:start position:0%
is is decreasing that's going to
 
00:46:54.349 --> 00:46:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:58.370 --> 00:46:58.380 align:start position:0%
because we use that rate of return to
 
00:47:00.829 --> 00:47:00.839 align:start position:0%
calculate what our unfunded liability is
 
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
and so the lower the assumed rate of
 
00:47:06.050 --> 00:47:06.060 align:start position:0%
return the higher the unfunded liability
 
00:47:09.230 --> 00:47:09.240 align:start position:0%
and as Marty said that's what drives the
 
00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
need to increase the employer
 
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
contribution rates because they have to
 
00:47:17.450 --> 00:47:17.460 align:start position:0%
be paid we we are in the process of
 
00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
amortizing the bulk of our unfunded
 
00:47:24.170 --> 00:47:24.180 align:start position:0%
liability within a 30-year period
 
00:47:26.329 --> 00:47:26.339 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:29.750 --> 00:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
it also makes them more accurate and
 
00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
more likely to be achieved which is why
 
00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
they're being lowered representative
 
00:47:37.490 --> 00:47:37.500 align:start position:0%
Gerhart thank you madam chairman uh
 
00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:38.930 align:start position:0%
Gerhart thank you madam chairman uh
woman

00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:38.940 align:start position:0%
woman
 
00:47:40.790 --> 00:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
um just quick question I can research my
 
00:47:42.349 --> 00:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
own time but what was hap what happened
 
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
prior to 67 did the state not have
 
00:47:46.849 --> 00:47:46.859 align:start position:0%
retirement system it had four separate
 
00:47:48.890 --> 00:47:48.900 align:start position:0%
Retirement systems for police fire
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
teachers and state employees they had
 
00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:53.220 align:start position:0%
separate board separate funding methods
 
00:47:56.410 --> 00:47:56.420 align:start position:0%
they Consolidated them
 
00:47:58.849 --> 00:47:58.859 align:start position:0%
there is an assignment
 
00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:00.900 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
um just a quick question on the ual
 
00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
um where is that at the present moment
 
00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:16.370 --> 00:48:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:19.020 align:start position:0%
thank you um I'm wondering if this is
 
00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
the proper time for Mr Carlin to
 
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
describe uh why the municipalities are
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
involved in the retirement system
 
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
as a follow-on to representative
 
00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
gerhard's question yes that would be
 
00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:33.530 align:start position:0%
gerhard's question yes that would be
appropriate

00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
yeah the the in the the predecessor
 
00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
systems which were all set up probably
 
00:48:41.690 --> 00:48:41.700 align:start position:0%
in the sort of 1938 to 42 range
 
00:48:43.309 --> 00:48:43.319 align:start position:0%
um you know full they were referred to
 
00:48:46.010 --> 00:48:46.020 align:start position:0%
as permanent police men in permanent
 
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
firemen because back then that's what
 
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
they were but
 
00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
um so any municipality who had teachers
 
00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:54.900 align:start position:0%
police or fire you know could contribute
 
00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
for their full-time employees into this
 
00:48:58.970 --> 00:48:58.980 align:start position:0%
system the Employee Retirement System
 
00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:01.500 align:start position:0%
was more of a state Employee Retirement
 
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
System but municipalities had the option
 
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
to join and that carried over into uh
 
00:49:10.190 --> 00:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
when we were Consolidated I'm not sure
 
00:49:11.930 --> 00:49:11.940 align:start position:0%
how many municipalities were in the
 
00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:14.460 align:start position:0%
predecessor systems back in the 40s and
 
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
50s but it was originally a state
 
00:49:17.450 --> 00:49:17.460 align:start position:0%
employees retirement system I think
 
00:49:19.490 --> 00:49:19.500 align:start position:0%
that's what it was referred to
 
00:49:21.710 --> 00:49:21.720 align:start position:0%
um so so and that that's carried over in
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
in our our law RSA 100a if you uh
 
00:49:27.530 --> 00:49:27.540 align:start position:0%
participation in the retirement system
 
00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:30.060 align:start position:0%
is mandatory for full-time
 
00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
permanent police fire and teachers and
 
00:49:37.250 --> 00:49:37.260 align:start position:0%
for employees of the state and and for
 
00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:39.300 align:start position:0%
municipalities in which they've opted to
 
00:49:41.510 --> 00:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
join the retirement system
 
00:49:43.609 --> 00:49:43.619 align:start position:0%
um some communities the smaller towns up
 
00:49:44.809 --> 00:49:44.819 align:start position:0%
north may have never had full-time
 
00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:47.460 align:start position:0%
employees or maybe never joined uh some
 
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
may offer a supplemental retirement plan
 
00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
some may not the city of Manchester has
 
00:49:54.490 --> 00:49:54.500 align:start position:0%
its own city employees
 
00:49:56.750 --> 00:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
retirement system that's been around for
 
00:49:59.390 --> 00:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
a long time so Manchester teachers
 
00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:01.260 align:start position:0%
police and fire are in the system but
 
00:50:04.370 --> 00:50:04.380 align:start position:0%
employees are not Nashua DPW I know
 
00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
we've got a few natural folks on it have
 
00:50:08.450 --> 00:50:08.460 align:start position:0%
their own retirement plan as well but
 
00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
most of the other Municipal employers
 
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
that aren't in nhrs do more of like sort
 
00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:15.540 align:start position:0%
of the defined contribution route or
 
00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:16.430 align:start position:0%
of the defined contribution route or
nothing

00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
00:50:18.109 --> 00:50:18.119 align:start position:0%
with that does that answer your question
 
00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
representative or okay
 
00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative thank you
 
00:50:25.309 --> 00:50:25.319 align:start position:0%
um if you are going to address this
 
00:50:27.770 --> 00:50:27.780 align:start position:0%
later than presentation you can defer
 
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
answering it but uh could you explain
 
00:50:31.849 --> 00:50:31.859 align:start position:0%
how we ended up with an unfunded
 
00:50:34.309 --> 00:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
liability we'll defer that but that's
 
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:39.410 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:50:39.410 --> 00:50:39.420 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:50:42.170 --> 00:50:42.180 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair Mr Collins I
 
00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
wonder if you could in 1967 the
 
00:50:48.069 --> 00:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
enticement for uh all the municipalities
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
was you know you want them to buy into
 
00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:53.220 align:start position:0%
this particular system and it was
 
00:50:55.849 --> 00:50:55.859 align:start position:0%
theoretically a promise that the state
 
00:50:58.790 --> 00:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
would pay 35 percent and over the years
 
00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:01.140 align:start position:0%
from past legislators that has dropped
 
00:51:03.349 --> 00:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
down can you tell us the current amount
 
00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:06.180 align:start position:0%
amount that the state contributes to the
 
00:51:08.930 --> 00:51:08.940 align:start position:0%
municipalities and how in addition to
 
00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:13.380 align:start position:0%
that the uaal affects that to the
 
00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:14.809 align:start position:0%
that the uaal affects that to the
municipalities

00:51:14.809 --> 00:51:14.819 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:51:17.089 --> 00:51:17.099 align:start position:0%
well the the to answer your second
 
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
question first the uaal is part of the
 
00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
employer contribution rate and any of
 
00:51:23.569 --> 00:51:23.579 align:start position:0%
paying down the liability is is
 
00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:25.500 align:start position:0%
completely on the employer side the
 
00:51:26.930 --> 00:51:26.940 align:start position:0%
members are pre-funding their own
 
00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:29.220 align:start position:0%
benefit but that money is going towards
 
00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:30.900 align:start position:0%
their benefit so the employers pay the
 
00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
bulk of the UN pay all of the unfunded
 
00:51:34.069 --> 00:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
and we've got some slides that'll show
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
how larger percentage that is of the
 
00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
total rate later on in the presentation
 
00:51:42.829 --> 00:51:42.839 align:start position:0%
uh currently there is no State pre
 
00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:45.900 align:start position:0%
contribution offset for um teachers
 
00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:47.940 align:start position:0%
police and fire as representative Brian
 
00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
said it had been a a 35 percent for a
 
00:51:53.809 --> 00:51:53.819 align:start position:0%
number of decades last year there was a
 
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
bill for a one-time reimbursement of
 
00:51:58.250 --> 00:51:58.260 align:start position:0%
seven and a half percent of local
 
00:52:00.589 --> 00:52:00.599 align:start position:0%
teacher police and fire contributions
 
00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
out of the general fund
 
00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
um you know that but you know that was a
 
00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
one-time reimbursement representative
 
00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:08.700 align:start position:0%
O'Brien you will be pleased to know that
 
00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:11.220 align:start position:0%
there is a bill this year to resume that
 
00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
contribution and it has been vacated
 
00:52:16.190 --> 00:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
from this committee and sent directly to
 
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
finance it doesn't affect the retirement
 
00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
system because
 
00:52:23.230 --> 00:52:23.240 align:start position:0%
it just
 
00:52:26.089 --> 00:52:26.099 align:start position:0%
defines who pays the amount set by the
 
00:52:28.430 --> 00:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
retirement system so we're not going to
 
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
be dealing with it thank God
 
00:52:32.809 --> 00:52:32.819 align:start position:0%
although very disappointed but thank you
 
00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
madam chair I thought you'd like to know
 
00:52:37.910 --> 00:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
because you were you you won the I think
 
00:52:42.109 --> 00:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
it was six pis on that in 2020. Madam
 
00:52:44.809 --> 00:52:44.819 align:start position:0%
chair when you're good you're good
 
00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:47.220 align:start position:0%
anyway yes you're the expert on that one
 
00:52:51.290 --> 00:52:51.300 align:start position:0%
okay sorry about that any uh other
 
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
questions at this point
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
all right representative Gould
 
00:52:58.010 --> 00:52:58.020 align:start position:0%
I'm terrible with acronyms my husband's
 
00:53:00.049 --> 00:53:00.059 align:start position:0%
been quizzing me helping me with e-dna
 
00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
and I've got that one down can you tell
 
00:53:05.569 --> 00:53:05.579 align:start position:0%
me what ual stands for unfunded
 
00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:08.220 align:start position:0%
Actuarial accrued liability okay thank
 
00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
you or unfunded liability for short
 
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
all right so we'll jump into benefits
 
00:53:19.069 --> 00:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
which is a page slide nine and again as
 
00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of new members for the
 
00:53:22.010 --> 00:53:22.020 align:start position:0%
folks who are here they've had these
 
00:53:23.690 --> 00:53:23.700 align:start position:0%
some of these terms tattooed on their
 
00:53:26.089 --> 00:53:26.099 align:start position:0%
their wrists for many years but we have
 
00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:27.780 align:start position:0%
two membership groups in the retirement
 
00:53:30.589 --> 00:53:30.599 align:start position:0%
system group one consists of employees
 
00:53:33.530 --> 00:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
and teachers uh in group two consists of
 
00:53:36.170 --> 00:53:36.180 align:start position:0%
police and fire and under the police
 
00:53:38.450 --> 00:53:38.460 align:start position:0%
umbrella the definition definition also
 
00:53:40.130 --> 00:53:40.140 align:start position:0%
includes State and County correctional
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
employees uh generally speaking
 
00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:43.549 align:start position:0%
employees uh generally speaking
um

00:53:43.549 --> 00:53:43.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
so we have 461 participating employers
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire is is
 
00:53:50.450 --> 00:53:50.460 align:start position:0%
obviously the largest with about 22 or
 
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
23 percent of the total membership
 
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:55.680 align:start position:0%
um but we have uh large employees like
 
00:53:57.109 --> 00:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
you know Nashua or and very small
 
00:53:59.450 --> 00:53:59.460 align:start position:0%
employees like public libraries housing
 
00:54:02.089 --> 00:54:02.099 align:start position:0%
authorities water districts up north you
 
00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:03.720 align:start position:0%
know Mutual Aid compacts things like
 
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
that so there's a real gamut in the
 
00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
number of the size of our employers
 
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
um the next slide slide 10 just shows a
 
00:54:15.950 --> 00:54:15.960 align:start position:0%
breakdown of active and retired members
 
00:54:18.650 --> 00:54:18.660 align:start position:0%
and beneficiaries by group
 
00:54:21.049 --> 00:54:21.059 align:start position:0%
um as you'll see there on slide 10
 
00:54:24.309 --> 00:54:24.319 align:start position:0%
employees are about half of the active
 
00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
membership and a little bit less than
 
00:54:29.569 --> 00:54:29.579 align:start position:0%
half of the retired membership teachers
 
00:54:33.109 --> 00:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
make up 35 to 37 percent and police and
 
00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
fire combined make up about 12 percent
 
00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:37.140 align:start position:0%
of the actives in a slightly higher
 
00:54:39.410 --> 00:54:39.420 align:start position:0%
percentage of their retired uh
 
00:54:41.089 --> 00:54:41.099 align:start position:0%
population there are younger retirement
 
00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
ages for group two police and fire so
 
00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
that's why the the numbers are a little
 
00:54:48.829 --> 00:54:48.839 align:start position:0%
higher there and below the chart it just
 
00:54:52.450 --> 00:54:52.460 align:start position:0%
shows the active you divided those 48
 
00:54:56.690 --> 00:54:56.700 align:start position:0%
687 members together you'd get a 46 year
 
00:54:59.290 --> 00:54:59.300 align:start position:0%
old who make with 11.4 years of service
 
00:55:02.089 --> 00:55:02.099 align:start position:0%
and the average retiree and the
 
00:55:06.370 --> 00:55:06.380 align:start position:0%
aggregate is 71.7 average benefit of 21
 
00:55:09.410 --> 00:55:09.420 align:start position:0%
862 per year that's going to differ
 
00:55:11.210 --> 00:55:11.220 align:start position:0%
between the four member groups and we do
 
00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:12.900 align:start position:0%
have a slide coming up that will show
 
00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:19.930 --> 00:55:19.940 align:start position:0%
on slide 11
 
00:55:22.490 --> 00:55:22.500 align:start position:0%
you know last fiscal year our fiscal
 
00:55:24.589 --> 00:55:24.599 align:start position:0%
year ends June 30th like the state and
 
00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
we paid out 914 million dollars in
 
00:55:29.690 --> 00:55:29.700 align:start position:0%
pension benefits so we'll be able to
 
00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
boast a billion dollar payroll within a
 
00:55:33.049 --> 00:55:33.059 align:start position:0%
year or two
 
00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%
um the way we're tracking and in the
 
00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:37.260 align:start position:0%
same period we paid out 43.8 million in
 
00:55:39.530 --> 00:55:39.540 align:start position:0%
what's called a medical subsidy payment
 
00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
this is an insurance premium offset that
 
00:55:46.250 --> 00:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
goes um to reduce the out-of-pocket uh
 
00:55:48.109 --> 00:55:48.119 align:start position:0%
Insurance costs for eligible members
 
00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
getting insurance from the employer they
 
00:55:52.069 --> 00:55:52.079 align:start position:0%
retired from this is a closed program
 
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
and nobody's
 
00:55:55.609 --> 00:55:55.619 align:start position:0%
um you know there's only a handful of
 
00:55:56.809 --> 00:55:56.819 align:start position:0%
people who are working and still
 
00:55:59.150 --> 00:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
eligible in group two but it is it is
 
00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
another uh benefit that the legislature
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
granted uh back in the 80s and had and
 
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
closed down several years past and about
 
00:56:10.609 --> 00:56:10.619 align:start position:0%
80 percent of our retirees live in New
 
00:56:13.970 --> 00:56:13.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so that 914 million most of
 
00:56:16.010 --> 00:56:16.020 align:start position:0%
that money stays in the state economy
 
00:56:17.630 --> 00:56:17.640 align:start position:0%
they're paying their property taxes with
 
00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
it they're going out to eat and paying
 
00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:20.460 align:start position:0%
their rooms and meals tax you know
 
00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
they're hiring Somebody To You know
 
00:56:23.630 --> 00:56:23.640 align:start position:0%
clean their furnace whatever so so there
 
00:56:27.170 --> 00:56:27.180 align:start position:0%
is an economic you know besides the cost
 
00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
you threw municipality through property
 
00:56:31.569 --> 00:56:31.579 align:start position:0%
taxes for retirement there's also a
 
00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:33.900 align:start position:0%
positive economic impact from these
 
00:56:36.170 --> 00:56:36.180 align:start position:0%
benefits staying in New Hampshire uh the
 
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
next slide
 
00:56:40.970 --> 00:56:40.980 align:start position:0%
shows the benefits by County uh paid
 
00:56:43.250 --> 00:56:43.260 align:start position:0%
last year so obviously as you might
 
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
expect the southern Counties have the
 
00:56:47.829 --> 00:56:47.839 align:start position:0%
larger population of retirees but even
 
00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:50.940 align:start position:0%
co-ops you know retirees up there get
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
22.6 million dollars which is
 
00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:56.210 align:start position:0%
22.6 million dollars which is
um

00:56:56.210 --> 00:56:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
um slide 13. I'm talking about the how
 
00:57:06.290 --> 00:57:06.300 align:start position:0%
the benefits are determined we have four
 
00:57:08.210 --> 00:57:08.220 align:start position:0%
different types of retirement and
 
00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes when changes are proposed to
 
00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:11.030 align:start position:0%
sometimes when changes are proposed to
these

00:57:11.030 --> 00:57:11.040 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
um you know the committee will look at
 
00:57:14.329 --> 00:57:14.339 align:start position:0%
different different modifications but
 
00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
the four types are Service retirement
 
00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
which is the most common that's you know
 
00:57:19.309 --> 00:57:19.319 align:start position:0%
you're old enough you put in your
 
00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
paperwork and You Begin collecting your
 
00:57:23.930 --> 00:57:23.940 align:start position:0%
benefit most uh of our members go out on
 
00:57:25.549 --> 00:57:25.559 align:start position:0%
service retirement we also have
 
00:57:28.670 --> 00:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
disability benefits job related and
 
00:57:30.890 --> 00:57:30.900 align:start position:0%
non-job-related that people can qualify
 
00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:32.870 align:start position:0%
non-job-related that people can qualify
for

00:57:32.870 --> 00:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:35.990 align:start position:0%
for
oh

00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:38.329 --> 00:57:38.339 align:start position:0%
thank you Marty before we get away from
 
00:57:40.730 --> 00:57:40.740 align:start position:0%
it uh I want to come back to the thing
 
00:57:44.089 --> 00:57:44.099 align:start position:0%
about paid by County uh do I understand
 
00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
correctly that uh the the figures don't
 
00:57:51.349 --> 00:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
really have anything to do with anything
 
00:57:55.010 --> 00:57:55.020 align:start position:0%
other than where the people live or
 
00:57:56.930 --> 00:57:56.940 align:start position:0%
getting the benefit it doesn't say
 
00:57:58.849 --> 00:57:58.859 align:start position:0%
anything about where they ever worked
 
00:58:02.270 --> 00:58:02.280 align:start position:0%
it's where they live yes okay
 
00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:04.140 align:start position:0%
thank you I guess you'll notice that
 
00:58:06.890 --> 00:58:06.900 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County has less than one
 
00:58:08.210 --> 00:58:08.220 align:start position:0%
might expect
 
00:58:10.490 --> 00:58:10.500 align:start position:0%
probably because it's cheaper to move up
 
00:58:15.230 --> 00:58:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:18.890 --> 00:58:18.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:20.990 --> 00:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:58:25.130 --> 00:58:25.140 align:start position:0%
I see on slide number 12 that it's it's
 
00:58:27.530 --> 00:58:27.540 align:start position:0%
where everybody lives but
 
00:58:30.349 --> 00:58:30.359 align:start position:0%
and I did kind of preview through the
 
00:58:34.250 --> 00:58:34.260 align:start position:0%
slides is there any comparison where
 
00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:42.410 --> 00:58:42.420 align:start position:0%
firemen and police across the
 
00:58:45.170 --> 00:58:45.180 align:start position:0%
across the border because of some of our
 
00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
benefits uh is there any state
 
00:58:49.549 --> 00:58:49.559 align:start position:0%
comparison in your presentation today
 
00:58:52.910 --> 00:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
no uh we we just have our own data so we
 
00:58:54.829 --> 00:58:54.839 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to track that to how
 
00:58:56.329 --> 00:58:56.339 align:start position:0%
many New Hampshire residents are working
 
00:58:57.890 --> 00:58:57.900 align:start position:0%
in you know Methuen or wherever things
 
00:59:00.349 --> 00:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
like that we wouldn't have that data to
 
00:59:00.359 --> 00:59:02.329 align:start position:0%
like that we wouldn't have that data to
track

00:59:02.329 --> 00:59:02.339 align:start position:0%
track
 
00:59:04.910 --> 00:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
okay representative O'Brien thank you
 
00:59:11.569 --> 00:59:11.579 align:start position:0%
madam chip would I be in order to assist
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
the representative in answering her
 
00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:15.710 align:start position:0%
the representative in answering her
point

00:59:15.710 --> 00:59:15.720 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
oh sure
 
00:59:20.930 --> 00:59:20.940 align:start position:0%
so that you know I'm also a vice
 
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
president of the board of Baltimore and
 
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
the national we do have a hard time in
 
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
hiring and uh it is one of the old
 
00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:33.240 align:start position:0%
adages of you know the job May stink
 
00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:35.220 align:start position:0%
particularly being the copper or a
 
00:59:37.010 --> 00:59:37.020 align:start position:0%
fireman but the pennies were always good
 
00:59:39.530 --> 00:59:39.540 align:start position:0%
and there has been somewhat of a Down
 
00:59:42.829 --> 00:59:42.839 align:start position:0%
crease so there is some problems there's
 
00:59:45.109 --> 00:59:45.119 align:start position:0%
also many other different things that Mr
 
00:59:46.930 --> 00:59:46.940 align:start position:0%
Collins is not going to answer but
 
00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
today's generation is different too and
 
00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:52.260 align:start position:0%
don't really seek that type of work like
 
00:59:54.410 --> 00:59:54.420 align:start position:0%
they used to
 
01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:07.849 align:start position:0%
 
please

01:00:07.849 --> 01:00:07.859 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:10.020 align:start position:0%
maybe representative O'Brien we could
 
01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:12.540 align:start position:0%
take that conversation offline later we
 
01:00:14.450 --> 01:00:14.460 align:start position:0%
do have some challenges
 
01:00:17.210 --> 01:00:17.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:19.789 --> 01:00:19.799 align:start position:0%
yes there are many challenges in hiring
 
01:00:21.730 --> 01:00:21.740 align:start position:0%
public employees these days
 
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you so uh back to
 
01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:27.900 align:start position:0%
slide 13 I talked about service and
 
01:00:29.569 --> 01:00:29.579 align:start position:0%
disability retirement there's also an
 
01:00:32.329 --> 01:00:32.339 align:start position:0%
early retirement option folks can begin
 
01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
collecting before their full retirement
 
01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
age at a permanent permanently reduced
 
01:00:38.690 --> 01:00:38.700 align:start position:0%
amount not a lot of people do that but
 
01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
it is there invested deferred retirement
 
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
this is where someone has worked at
 
01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:45.839 align:start position:0%
least 10 years with a retirement system
 
01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:49.020 align:start position:0%
employer and they stop working for that
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
employer or for a participating employer
 
01:00:52.789 --> 01:00:52.799 align:start position:0%
before they reach their retirement age
 
01:00:54.890 --> 01:00:54.900 align:start position:0%
if they keep their contributions with
 
01:00:56.450 --> 01:00:56.460 align:start position:0%
the retirement system they can come back
 
01:00:58.670 --> 01:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
to us when they age into retirement
 
01:01:00.589 --> 01:01:00.599 align:start position:0%
eligibility and Collective benefit based
 
01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
on the prior service
 
01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
so those are the four types there are
 
01:01:07.250 --> 01:01:07.260 align:start position:0%
different benefit Provisions for group
 
01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:09.720 align:start position:0%
one and group two that's always been the
 
01:01:12.829 --> 01:01:12.839 align:start position:0%
case uh since the the plan was set up uh
 
01:01:15.950 --> 01:01:15.960 align:start position:0%
and since 2011 there have been different
 
01:01:18.650 --> 01:01:18.660 align:start position:0%
benefit Provisions based on the vested
 
01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
status and higher date of the member in
 
01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:23.940 align:start position:0%
each group for more than a decade now we
 
01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
would refer to people who are vested
 
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
prior to January 1st of 2012 members who
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
are in the system prior to July 1st of
 
01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:34.559 align:start position:0%
2011 but not yet vested on January 1st
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
of 12th and anyone hired on or after
 
01:01:40.849 --> 01:01:40.859 align:start position:0%
July 1st of 2011 as part of our pension
 
01:01:44.089 --> 01:01:44.099 align:start position:0%
upgrade and also because it no longer
 
01:01:45.890 --> 01:01:45.900 align:start position:0%
makes sense this far out to keep doing
 
01:01:47.809 --> 01:01:47.819 align:start position:0%
that we're actually going to be sort of
 
01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
renaming the benefits as tier a b and c
 
01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
um there so it may be an easier
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
shorthand way for people to save those
 
01:01:58.450 --> 01:01:58.460 align:start position:0%
mouthfuls going forward we roll that
 
01:02:00.289 --> 01:02:00.299 align:start position:0%
nominclature out to employers already
 
01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
and we're going to be sharing with the
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
membership and we will get at the
 
01:02:05.390 --> 01:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to delve into these
 
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
differences because I've seen at least
 
01:02:10.030 --> 01:02:10.040 align:start position:0%
three bills that appear to be
 
01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
affecting them
 
01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
and regardless of of what group you're
 
01:02:18.349 --> 01:02:18.359 align:start position:0%
in or what tier the most of the pension
 
01:02:20.450 --> 01:02:20.460 align:start position:0%
benefits are determined by statutory
 
01:02:22.069 --> 01:02:22.079 align:start position:0%
formulas so
 
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
um that look at creditable service how
 
01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
long someone has worked in months and
 
01:02:28.730 --> 01:02:28.740 align:start position:0%
years uh average final compensation
 
01:02:30.349 --> 01:02:30.359 align:start position:0%
which is going to be their highest three
 
01:02:33.230 --> 01:02:33.240 align:start position:0%
or their highest five years of
 
01:02:37.130 --> 01:02:37.140 align:start position:0%
um income depending on which tier
 
01:02:39.170 --> 01:02:39.180 align:start position:0%
they're in and then a benefit multiplier
 
01:02:41.450 --> 01:02:41.460 align:start position:0%
and that does seven different
 
01:02:43.069 --> 01:02:43.079 align:start position:0%
multipliers in group two and there's
 
01:02:44.990 --> 01:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
there's two in group one so you know
 
01:02:47.329 --> 01:02:47.339 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of distinctions in there I
 
01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
mean essentially what the um you know
 
01:02:52.010 --> 01:02:52.020 align:start position:0%
there's a lot there and as
 
01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire said there's
 
01:02:55.309 --> 01:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
several bills looking at tweaking some
 
01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:56.700 align:start position:0%
of that so
 
01:02:59.150 --> 01:02:59.160 align:start position:0%
I'll save you some time for the details
 
01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:00.420 align:start position:0%
there but we'll we certainly will
 
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
probably delve into them uh slide 14
 
01:03:04.430 --> 01:03:04.440 align:start position:0%
this is the the site I referenced a
 
01:03:07.849 --> 01:03:07.859 align:start position:0%
little earlier average benefit by group
 
01:03:07.859 --> 01:03:08.809 align:start position:0%
little earlier average benefit by group
um

01:03:08.809 --> 01:03:08.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
employee teacher police and fire
 
01:03:14.990 --> 01:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
um the benefit formulas are generate a
 
01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
higher benefit for police and fire but
 
01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:18.839 align:start position:0%
also these these members don't pay into
 
01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
Social Security nor does their employer
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
so that's part of the recognition for
 
01:03:26.329 --> 01:03:26.339 align:start position:0%
the benefit structure I think the job is
 
01:03:29.569 --> 01:03:29.579 align:start position:0%
also a recognition for uh the retirement
 
01:03:32.210 --> 01:03:32.220 align:start position:0%
eligibilities and things like that
 
01:03:34.490 --> 01:03:34.500 align:start position:0%
um one thing you see with oh this
 
01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
question no actually it's a comment one
 
01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
thing you'll notice is that nearly all
 
01:03:44.450 --> 01:03:44.460 align:start position:0%
police and fire have full careers a
 
01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
significant number of employees do not
 
01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:49.260 align:start position:0%
work full careers for a participating
 
01:03:49.260 --> 01:03:50.470 align:start position:0%
work full careers for a participating
employer

01:03:50.470 --> 01:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
employer
 
01:03:55.069 --> 01:03:55.079 align:start position:0%
they may work 10 well at least 10 and
 
01:03:57.589 --> 01:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
then go somewhere else or they may spend
 
01:03:59.809 --> 01:03:59.819 align:start position:0%
10 years working for the state and going
 
01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
on somewhere so there's a lot more
 
01:04:05.270 --> 01:04:05.280 align:start position:0%
turnover in group one than in group two
 
01:04:08.030 --> 01:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
where if they there is turnover
 
01:04:10.370 --> 01:04:10.380 align:start position:0%
they'll go from the
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
Epson Police Department to the
 
01:04:14.089 --> 01:04:14.099 align:start position:0%
Manchester Police Department where
 
01:04:15.890 --> 01:04:15.900 align:start position:0%
there's more opportunities or something
 
01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
like that
 
01:04:20.510 --> 01:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely those Public Safety and
 
01:04:22.010 --> 01:04:22.020 align:start position:0%
teaching jobs seem to be sort of
 
01:04:24.289 --> 01:04:24.299 align:start position:0%
callings their vocations you know and um
 
01:04:27.170 --> 01:04:27.180 align:start position:0%
you know we are we see at least half of
 
01:04:28.670 --> 01:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
our teachers retire with more than 25
 
01:04:31.490 --> 01:04:31.500 align:start position:0%
years many with 30 and um you know
 
01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:33.660 align:start position:0%
police and fire uh similarly that the
 
01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:35.220 align:start position:0%
firefighters tend to work a couple years
 
01:04:38.030 --> 01:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
longer on average uh in terms of years
 
01:04:40.190 --> 01:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
of service they retire with than police
 
01:04:43.730 --> 01:04:43.740 align:start position:0%
that that's been a trend for a while
 
01:04:46.609 --> 01:04:46.619 align:start position:0%
well I think everybody that's new to
 
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
this has to understand that
 
01:04:51.789 --> 01:04:51.799 align:start position:0%
um you can be a teacher until you're
 
01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
quite far along in age police and fire
 
01:04:58.430 --> 01:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
are a young man's game you really don't
 
01:05:00.650 --> 01:05:00.660 align:start position:0%
want to be a police officer chasing
 
01:05:03.289 --> 01:05:03.299 align:start position:0%
somebody down an alley at 55 years of
 
01:05:05.690 --> 01:05:05.700 align:start position:0%
age or running up and down a ladder at
 
01:05:07.690 --> 01:05:07.700 align:start position:0%
55 years of age
 
01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:10.980 align:start position:0%
so they they have much shorter careers
 
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
by physical necessity
 
01:05:16.549 --> 01:05:16.559 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Schmidt thank
 
01:05:19.250 --> 01:05:19.260 align:start position:0%
you uh slide 15 just shows sort of a
 
01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:20.329 align:start position:0%
you uh slide 15 just shows sort of a
breakdown

01:05:20.329 --> 01:05:20.339 align:start position:0%
breakdown
 
01:05:22.430 --> 01:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
um by amount
 
01:05:24.770 --> 01:05:24.780 align:start position:0%
um you know our average you know the
 
01:05:26.690 --> 01:05:26.700 align:start position:0%
average annual benefit is is a little
 
01:05:29.270 --> 01:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
bit under 22 but I'm more than a quarter
 
01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
of our folks receiving a benefit now get
 
01:05:33.849 --> 01:05:33.859 align:start position:0%
a benefit annual benefit of under 10 000
 
01:05:38.930 --> 01:05:38.940 align:start position:0%
64 under 25 and 93 under 50 000 a year
 
01:05:41.089 --> 01:05:41.099 align:start position:0%
so you know typically this is the time
 
01:05:43.130 --> 01:05:43.140 align:start position:0%
of year I we get requests for you know
 
01:05:44.510 --> 01:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
pension lists you know from different
 
01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:46.970 align:start position:0%
pension lists you know from different
Outlets

01:05:46.970 --> 01:05:46.980 align:start position:0%
Outlets
 
01:05:46.980 --> 01:05:55.370 align:start position:0%
Outlets
foreign

01:05:55.370 --> 01:05:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:57.710 --> 01:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
what's that
 
01:05:59.270 --> 01:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I didn't mean to interrupt I
 
01:06:01.849 --> 01:06:01.859 align:start position:0%
said is that a food bank contribution
 
01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:03.960 align:start position:0%
uh we don't know
 
01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:04.549 align:start position:0%
uh we don't know
um

01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:08.930 --> 01:06:08.940 align:start position:0%
yeah the other point is that the the
 
01:06:12.349 --> 01:06:12.359 align:start position:0%
SE averages also include people who
 
01:06:16.069 --> 01:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
retired 50 odd years ago yeah at that
 
01:06:18.049 --> 01:06:18.059 align:start position:0%
time a ten thousand dollar pension was
 
01:06:22.390 --> 01:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:25.309 --> 01:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
do you have the information on what the
 
01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
pensions of people currently retiring
 
01:06:27.599 --> 01:06:28.370 align:start position:0%
pensions of people currently retiring
are

01:06:28.370 --> 01:06:28.380 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
I yes I can I can I can follow up and
 
01:06:33.170 --> 01:06:33.180 align:start position:0%
send that chart to the committee we run
 
01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
that every year
 
01:06:37.970 --> 01:06:37.980 align:start position:0%
um for uh for finance so new it's new
 
01:06:39.529 --> 01:06:39.539 align:start position:0%
retirements over the past 10 years what
 
01:06:43.970 --> 01:06:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:47.210 --> 01:06:47.220 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I refer to through
 
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
you to uh Mr Colin would this be the
 
01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:52.799 align:start position:0%
proper time to discuss what a caller is
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
to new members or or is it yeah am I
 
01:06:59.510 --> 01:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
getting ahead of you you were right on
 
01:07:03.049 --> 01:07:03.059 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you so much perfect timing
 
01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
that that old segue in so again just on
 
01:07:07.789 --> 01:07:07.799 align:start position:0%
that slide 50 and the last point is less
 
01:07:10.370 --> 01:07:10.380 align:start position:0%
than two percent of our retirees see an
 
01:07:13.130 --> 01:07:13.140 align:start position:0%
average benefit of over 75 000 a year so
 
01:07:15.650 --> 01:07:15.660 align:start position:0%
that that's you know
 
01:07:17.329 --> 01:07:17.339 align:start position:0%
um you know that just just how that
 
01:07:17.339 --> 01:07:18.349 align:start position:0%
um you know that just just how that
breakdown

01:07:18.349 --> 01:07:18.359 align:start position:0%
breakdown
 
01:07:20.329 --> 01:07:20.339 align:start position:0%
what legislating for the minority
 
01:07:22.430 --> 01:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
sometimes can
 
01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
debates can center around that and it's
 
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
really a small amount of people
 
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
um so slide 16 uh cola's cost of living
 
01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:30.950 align:start position:0%
um so slide 16 uh cola's cost of living
adjustments

01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
adjustments
 
01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
um this is something that
 
01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
um is not automatic in New Hampshire the
 
01:07:38.089 --> 01:07:38.099 align:start position:0%
legislature has to Grant a cost of
 
01:07:39.770 --> 01:07:39.780 align:start position:0%
living adjustment either a permanent
 
01:07:43.370 --> 01:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
addition or a one-time retire repayment
 
01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
if if um they choose to do so the last
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
Cola which you know permanent addition
 
01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
to the pension was a one percent one and
 
01:07:53.690 --> 01:07:53.700 align:start position:0%
a half percent increase on the first
 
01:07:56.450 --> 01:07:56.460 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand of anyone's benefit that
 
01:07:58.910 --> 01:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
was granted in 2019 and took effect in
 
01:08:03.230 --> 01:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
FY 21 so July of 2020 so that was a
 
01:08:05.930 --> 01:08:05.940 align:start position:0%
permanent addition of a maximum of 450
 
01:08:07.849 --> 01:08:07.859 align:start position:0%
dollars you know or less depending on
 
01:08:11.210 --> 01:08:11.220 align:start position:0%
your pension up up to that first 50 last
 
01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:12.170 align:start position:0%
your pension up up to that first 50 last
year

01:08:12.170 --> 01:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
um there was a one-time 500 payment for
 
01:08:18.349 --> 01:08:18.359 align:start position:0%
anyone who was retired more than five
 
01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
years and I had a benefit of under
 
01:08:23.470 --> 01:08:23.480 align:start position:0%
thirty thousand so that that was about
 
01:08:26.809 --> 01:08:26.819 align:start position:0%
22 23 000 members it was about 11
 
01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
million that the state paid um from
 
01:08:33.289 --> 01:08:33.299 align:start position:0%
general fund to do that the Cola in 2019
 
01:08:33.299 --> 01:08:35.030 align:start position:0%
general fund to do that the Cola in 2019
was

01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
um not pre-funded so that was added to
 
01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:39.480 align:start position:0%
the employer contribution rates going
 
01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
forward for the next 20 years so uh yes
 
01:08:44.209 --> 01:08:44.219 align:start position:0%
we're praying for that every day every
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
uh time we get our tax bills
 
01:08:48.829 --> 01:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
representative schuette yes uh could you
 
01:08:51.289 --> 01:08:51.299 align:start position:0%
please tell the committee the last time
 
01:08:55.189 --> 01:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
prior to 2019 that employees got a a
 
01:08:58.490 --> 01:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
full Cola absolutely it was 2010.
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
and they're one of the handouts in the
 
01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
folder is about Kohl's and I think it
 
01:09:04.729 --> 01:09:04.739 align:start position:0%
has a chart going back either 20 or 25
 
01:09:07.309 --> 01:09:07.319 align:start position:0%
years on on colas so for reference
 
01:09:09.169 --> 01:09:09.179 align:start position:0%
that's there
 
01:09:10.669 --> 01:09:10.679 align:start position:0%
yeah so we have a cost of living
 
01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
increase Bill also so we'll get to dig
 
01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
into the nuts and bolts of that one
 
01:09:19.370 --> 01:09:19.380 align:start position:0%
okay and with that
 
01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:20.940 align:start position:0%
um it's Jan's turn again to talk about
 
01:09:24.530 --> 01:09:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Marty so if you
 
01:09:29.269 --> 01:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
could please turn to page 17
 
01:09:31.550 --> 01:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
um it discusses the Board of Trustees as
 
01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:33.179 align:start position:0%
well as the independent investment
 
01:09:33.179 --> 01:09:34.249 align:start position:0%
well as the independent investment
committee

01:09:34.249 --> 01:09:34.259 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
so the board has a couple of very
 
01:09:39.410 --> 01:09:39.420 align:start position:0%
important responsibilities in addition
 
01:09:41.809 --> 01:09:41.819 align:start position:0%
to the setting the employer contribution
 
01:09:44.150 --> 01:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
rates that we discussed earlier they
 
01:09:46.610 --> 01:09:46.620 align:start position:0%
also improved the investment policy
 
01:09:49.970 --> 01:09:49.980 align:start position:0%
which includes the asset allocation and
 
01:09:51.829 --> 01:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
for those of you who are involved in the
 
01:09:54.669 --> 01:09:54.679 align:start position:0%
investment world it's asset allocation
 
01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
is the single most important determinant
 
01:10:01.550 --> 01:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
of investment performance
 
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
and so our board as well as our
 
01:10:06.290 --> 01:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
independent investment committee spend a
 
01:10:08.030 --> 01:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
great deal of time on making these
 
01:10:09.950 --> 01:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
important decisions because they have
 
01:10:12.290 --> 01:10:12.300 align:start position:0%
such a strong impact on our investment
 
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
performance the board is also
 
01:10:16.790 --> 01:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
responsible for hiring the investment
 
01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:18.169 align:start position:0%
responsible for hiring the investment
consultant

01:10:18.169 --> 01:10:18.179 align:start position:0%
consultant
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
and on page 35 you can see all of the
 
01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
current members of our Board of Trustees
 
01:10:25.729 --> 01:10:25.739 align:start position:0%
all 13 of them
 
01:10:28.250 --> 01:10:28.260 align:start position:0%
and then we also have the independent
 
01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
investment committee which as Marty
 
01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
discussed earlier was created by the
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
legislature and became effective in
 
01:10:38.570 --> 01:10:38.580 align:start position:0%
January 1st of 2009 that is made up of
 
01:10:42.410 --> 01:10:42.420 align:start position:0%
six people there are five of them
 
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
um two of which are from directly from
 
01:10:47.570 --> 01:10:47.580 align:start position:0%
our board and then another three that
 
01:10:49.729 --> 01:10:49.739 align:start position:0%
are appointed by the governor with the
 
01:10:52.850 --> 01:10:52.860 align:start position:0%
consent of the the council and then
 
01:10:55.010 --> 01:10:55.020 align:start position:0%
there is a sixth member who is a
 
01:10:56.810 --> 01:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
non-voting member who is there to
 
01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:00.120 align:start position:0%
represent the plan members
 
01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
and those people the different committee
 
01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
members are shown on page 36 in the
 
01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:08.870 align:start position:0%
members are shown on page 36 in the
appendices

01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
appendices
 
01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:12.300 align:start position:0%
so the independent investment committee
 
01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
recommends investment policy to the
 
01:11:16.910 --> 01:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
board and they also oversee the
 
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
administration of the investment program
 
01:11:22.610 --> 01:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
within the board's policies
 
01:11:25.669 --> 01:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
so part of that includes hiring the
 
01:11:27.530 --> 01:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
investment service providers which are
 
01:11:29.770 --> 01:11:29.780 align:start position:0%
the different individual money managers
 
01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
as well as important service providers
 
01:11:37.790 --> 01:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
like the cus the custodial bank which is
 
01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
where the individual Securities actually
 
01:11:44.090 --> 01:11:44.100 align:start position:0%
live on electronic spreadsheets as well
 
01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
as the different investment managers
 
01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
that make the buy and sell decisions for
 
01:11:49.490 --> 01:11:49.500 align:start position:0%
the different
 
01:11:52.010 --> 01:11:52.020 align:start position:0%
stocks or bonds that are in our
 
01:11:54.110 --> 01:11:54.120 align:start position:0%
Investment Portfolio
 
01:11:56.750 --> 01:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
every year the independent investment
 
01:11:58.729 --> 01:11:58.739 align:start position:0%
committee with staff prepares a
 
01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:01.260 align:start position:0%
comprehensive annual investment report
 
01:12:06.290 --> 01:12:06.300 align:start position:0%
the care which is approved by the board
 
01:12:10.490 --> 01:12:10.500 align:start position:0%
so if you could turn to page 18 please
 
01:12:12.770 --> 01:12:12.780 align:start position:0%
and this gets it gets a bit more into
 
01:12:16.490 --> 01:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
the nitty-gritty on the Investments so
 
01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
as I said earlier the asset allocation
 
01:12:23.270 --> 01:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
is the pr the predominant determinant of
 
01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
investment performance and so we use
 
01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
different strategies to make our
 
01:12:31.669 --> 01:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
investments work and so the invest the
 
01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
iic the independent investment committee
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
regularly reviews strategy with our
 
01:12:39.490 --> 01:12:39.500 align:start position:0%
staff as well as our outside consultant
 
01:12:43.970 --> 01:12:43.980 align:start position:0%
and nhrs because we're a pension plan we
 
01:12:46.250 --> 01:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
are different than you all as
 
01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:48.010 align:start position:0%
are different than you all as
independent

01:12:48.010 --> 01:12:48.020 align:start position:0%
independent
 
01:12:51.649 --> 01:12:51.659 align:start position:0%
investors our time Horizon is this is
 
01:12:54.890 --> 01:12:54.900 align:start position:0%
more than 25 years if not actually in
 
01:12:58.550 --> 01:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
infinite because we are going we are a
 
01:13:01.189 --> 01:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
Perpetual organization and as long as
 
01:13:03.770 --> 01:13:03.780 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is here and has employees
 
01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
either for the state or the individual
 
01:13:08.689 --> 01:13:08.699 align:start position:0%
cities and counties we need to be
 
01:13:08.699 --> 01:13:10.910 align:start position:0%
cities and counties we need to be
providing

01:13:10.910 --> 01:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
providing
 
01:13:13.310 --> 01:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
retirement benefits for those employees
 
01:13:16.970 --> 01:13:16.980 align:start position:0%
so that means that our iic can have a
 
01:13:18.709 --> 01:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
very different time perspective on
 
01:13:20.810 --> 01:13:20.820 align:start position:0%
making Investments than you as an
 
01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
individual who is concerned about your
 
01:13:26.090 --> 01:13:26.100 align:start position:0%
own lifetime where can say there we
 
01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
consider the lifetimes of all of our
 
01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
members both current and future so that
 
01:13:34.130 --> 01:13:34.140 align:start position:0%
makes some Investments appropriate for
 
01:13:36.530 --> 01:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
us that might not be appropriate for
 
01:13:41.050 --> 01:13:41.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:45.229 --> 01:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
and part of that Balancing Act is met is
 
01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
managing our risk and liquidity we have
 
01:13:50.090 --> 01:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we always have enough
 
01:13:52.490 --> 01:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
cash on hand to make that monthly
 
01:13:54.610 --> 01:13:54.620 align:start position:0%
payroll to our
 
01:13:57.709 --> 01:13:57.719 align:start position:0%
retirees and the beneficiaries and we
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
also need to know how much cash we can
 
01:14:03.410 --> 01:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
afford to lock up in Investments that
 
01:14:05.570 --> 01:14:05.580 align:start position:0%
have a very long time Horizon and are
 
01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
not as liquid as Investments such as the
 
01:14:11.330 --> 01:14:11.340 align:start position:0%
S P 500 where we can have daily
 
01:14:11.340 --> 01:14:13.910 align:start position:0%
S P 500 where we can have daily
liquidity

01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
liquidity
 
01:14:16.610 --> 01:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
so our investment staff manages a
 
01:14:18.590 --> 01:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
diversified portfolio among different
 
01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:21.300 align:start position:0%
types of assets and so you can see on
 
01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
this chart the different broad
 
01:14:26.090 --> 01:14:26.100 align:start position:0%
categories of assets that we have both
 
01:14:28.189 --> 01:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
their target amounts as well as their
 
01:14:30.830 --> 01:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
actual allocations so we have starting
 
01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:14:35.090 --> 01:14:35.100 align:start position:0%
upper right hand quadrant of these
 
01:14:37.490 --> 01:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
circles we have domestic equities so
 
01:14:38.930 --> 01:14:38.940 align:start position:0%
these are the stocks that you're
 
01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
probably the most familiar with stocks
 
01:14:44.030 --> 01:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
such as the ones that are in the you
 
01:14:46.850 --> 01:14:46.860 align:start position:0%
know the the Dow Jones Industrial which
 
01:14:49.250 --> 01:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
is the 30 largest companies as well as
 
01:14:52.430 --> 01:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
the S P 500 the standard and Poor's 500
 
01:14:55.370 --> 01:14:55.380 align:start position:0%
largest companies by capitalization side
 
01:14:59.149 --> 01:14:59.159 align:start position:0%
as well as other smaller and mid-cap U.S
 
01:14:59.159 --> 01:15:00.169 align:start position:0%
as well as other smaller and mid-cap U.S
stocks

01:15:00.169 --> 01:15:00.179 align:start position:0%
stocks
 
01:15:03.770 --> 01:15:03.780 align:start position:0%
then going down clockwise on this chart
 
01:15:07.149 --> 01:15:07.159 align:start position:0%
we also have non-us equities so
 
01:15:11.630 --> 01:15:11.640 align:start position:0%
we have stocks in companies in all
 
01:15:13.250 --> 01:15:13.260 align:start position:0%
around the world
 
01:15:15.410 --> 01:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
so that we can find the best investment
 
01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
return for our members
 
01:15:21.530 --> 01:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
keeping going around clockwise the green
 
01:15:24.410 --> 01:15:24.420 align:start position:0%
area is fixed income also referred to as
 
01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
bonds so those are another important
 
01:15:30.050 --> 01:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
part of our Investment Portfolio and
 
01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
then we also have a sizable amount of
 
01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
our portfolio invested in real estate
 
01:15:39.229 --> 01:15:39.239 align:start position:0%
and then going all the way up to the top
 
01:15:42.110 --> 01:15:42.120 align:start position:0%
we also have alternative Investments
 
01:15:45.050 --> 01:15:45.060 align:start position:0%
that's the red area and the examples of
 
01:15:47.570 --> 01:15:47.580 align:start position:0%
that are private Equity Funds as well as
 
01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
private debt funds so we have a wide
 
01:15:52.630 --> 01:15:52.640 align:start position:0%
variety of assets because
 
01:15:55.370 --> 01:15:55.380 align:start position:0%
diversification is important because
 
01:15:57.590 --> 01:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
typically what happens when one part of
 
01:15:59.870 --> 01:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
the portfolio does very well in other
 
01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
part does not so we always have to
 
01:16:04.130 --> 01:16:04.140 align:start position:0%
balance that
 
01:16:07.550 --> 01:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
if you could please turn to page 19
 
01:16:13.189 --> 01:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:16.490 --> 01:16:16.500 align:start position:0%
do you have any INF pardon me do you
 
01:16:19.250 --> 01:16:19.260 align:start position:0%
have any information on
 
01:16:21.709 --> 01:16:21.719 align:start position:0%
the Retirement Systems investments in
 
01:16:21.719 --> 01:16:25.550 align:start position:0%
the Retirement Systems investments in
China

01:16:25.550 --> 01:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:28.610 --> 01:16:28.620 align:start position:0%
um we do have some investments in China
 
01:16:32.450 --> 01:16:32.460 align:start position:0%
but we do own some stocks in Chinese
 
01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
companies but I do not have the exact
 
01:16:38.330 --> 01:16:38.340 align:start position:0%
amount and but we can get that
 
01:16:40.010 --> 01:16:40.020 align:start position:0%
information for you I just finished
 
01:16:42.590 --> 01:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
reading the book uh the end of the world
 
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
is just
 
01:16:46.490 --> 01:16:46.500 align:start position:0%
Beginning by Peter Zahn and I highly
 
01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:47.649 align:start position:0%
Beginning by Peter Zahn and I highly
highly

01:16:47.649 --> 01:16:47.659 align:start position:0%
highly
 
01:16:51.189 --> 01:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
recommend it and I'm just concerned that
 
01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
investments in U.S firms with a large
 
01:16:59.149 --> 01:16:59.159 align:start position:0%
Market in China and also the Chinese
 
01:16:59.159 --> 01:17:00.550 align:start position:0%
Market in China and also the Chinese
companies

01:17:00.550 --> 01:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
companies
 
01:17:02.930 --> 01:17:02.940 align:start position:0%
which are really
 
01:17:05.810 --> 01:17:05.820 align:start position:0%
owned by the CCP that those in
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
Investments may become a very risky in
 
01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
the future going forward thank you madam
 
01:17:14.709 --> 01:17:14.719 align:start position:0%
chair yes the uh the
 
01:17:17.530 --> 01:17:17.540 align:start position:0%
retirement system investment committee
 
01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
evaluates Source risk and I know that
 
01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:24.550 align:start position:0%
evaluates Source risk and I know that
they

01:17:24.550 --> 01:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
divested a significant number of Russian
 
01:17:29.390 --> 01:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
stocks over the last couple of years
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
yeah there was a bill last year uh
 
01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:35.460 align:start position:0%
requiring any share nhrs to divest um
 
01:17:37.970 --> 01:17:37.980 align:start position:0%
directly held China Holdings and and we
 
01:17:37.980 --> 01:17:38.810 align:start position:0%
directly held China Holdings and and we
did

01:17:38.810 --> 01:17:38.820 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
um that was it directly held Investments
 
01:17:43.070 --> 01:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
was I think under a hundred thousand or
 
01:17:44.270 --> 01:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
right in that range it was a very small
 
01:17:46.010 --> 01:17:46.020 align:start position:0%
piece of the portfolio there's obviously
 
01:17:48.050 --> 01:17:48.060 align:start position:0%
if we're maybe in funds where they have
 
01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
exposure in China but direct Investments
 
01:17:52.970 --> 01:17:52.980 align:start position:0%
were very low at the time
 
01:17:58.970 --> 01:17:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
as I referred to earlier on page 19
 
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
um fiscal year 22 was a very challenging
 
01:18:08.810 --> 01:18:08.820 align:start position:0%
year to be in the investment world and
 
01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
our one-year return reflects that we had
 
01:18:16.910 --> 01:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
a net loss of 6.1 percent however it was
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
better than what our Benchmark was which
 
01:18:23.930 --> 01:18:23.940 align:start position:0%
was a loss of 9.3 percent
 
01:18:27.229 --> 01:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
the three-year return was 7.1 percent
 
01:18:30.649 --> 01:18:30.659 align:start position:0%
The Five-Year return was 7.2 percent and
 
01:18:34.490 --> 01:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
the longer year returns were were higher
 
01:18:37.370 --> 01:18:37.380 align:start position:0%
and the important thing is that what we
 
01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
as important as any one year is what
 
01:18:42.770 --> 01:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
we're always looking at is how does this
 
01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
compare to our assumed rate of return
 
01:18:48.490 --> 01:18:48.500 align:start position:0%
are we achieving that over the long term
 
01:18:51.470 --> 01:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
and with our long-term assumed rate of
 
01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
return of 6.75 percent you can see by
 
01:18:57.130 --> 01:18:57.140 align:start position:0%
looking at all of these different
 
01:19:00.050 --> 01:19:00.060 align:start position:0%
returns for different time periods we
 
01:19:04.209 --> 01:19:04.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:07.669 --> 01:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
and so far this fiscal year to date our
 
01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
annualized return through the end of
 
01:19:13.310 --> 01:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
November was 3.5 percent and I've asked
 
01:19:15.229 --> 01:19:15.239 align:start position:0%
Reynold if he can guarantee that we'll
 
01:19:17.870 --> 01:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
do similarly in the rest of the fiscal
 
01:19:22.850 --> 01:19:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:24.590 --> 01:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
actually I don't think you'd want to
 
01:19:26.570 --> 01:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
limit him to three and a half percent oh
 
01:19:28.490 --> 01:19:28.500 align:start position:0%
that was for the first six months I won
 
01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
another three and a half but you're
 
01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
right there's no upward
 
01:19:35.930 --> 01:19:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
and our performance relative to our
 
01:19:42.410 --> 01:19:42.420 align:start position:0%
peers has also been strong both last
 
01:19:44.990 --> 01:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
year as well as over
 
01:19:47.930 --> 01:19:47.940 align:start position:0%
um the past decade
 
01:19:52.750 --> 01:19:52.760 align:start position:0%
page 20. so I mentioned earlier about
 
01:19:55.669 --> 01:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
why our actuaries like to smooth
 
01:19:57.950 --> 01:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
everything over a five-year period
 
01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:59.330 align:start position:0%
everything over a five-year period
because

01:19:59.330 --> 01:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:20:03.530 --> 01:20:03.540 align:start position:0%
assets vary dramatic can vary year by
 
01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
year and investment return for any given
 
01:20:08.930 --> 01:20:08.940 align:start position:0%
year can show a great deal of ups and
 
01:20:11.450 --> 01:20:11.460 align:start position:0%
downs and that is exactly what you see
 
01:20:14.750 --> 01:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
on this slide you we see
 
01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:15.649 align:start position:0%
on this slide you we see
um

01:20:15.649 --> 01:20:15.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:20.990 --> 01:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
performance from 2007 through 2022 and
 
01:20:23.570 --> 01:20:23.580 align:start position:0%
we use on the left hand side of that
 
01:20:26.570 --> 01:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
chart you see that
 
01:20:29.689 --> 01:20:29.699 align:start position:0%
the lower performance that was caused
 
01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
during the great financial crisis that
 
01:20:35.209 --> 01:20:35.219 align:start position:0%
affected not just the United States but
 
01:20:38.570 --> 01:20:38.580 align:start position:0%
the entire world and as well as the
 
01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
bounce back after that in the next two
 
01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal years and then you see the ups
 
01:20:46.070 --> 01:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
and downs over time and so that's why
 
01:20:49.070 --> 01:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
our actuaries smooth things out
 
01:20:52.370 --> 01:20:52.380 align:start position:0%
over a five-year period and that's what
 
01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
that Gray Line is that's the smoothed
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
return on our investments and the reason
 
01:21:02.930 --> 01:21:02.940 align:start position:0%
why we want to do that is when we set
 
01:21:05.209 --> 01:21:05.219 align:start position:0%
the employer contribution rates when the
 
01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
board does that every two years the
 
01:21:11.209 --> 01:21:11.219 align:start position:0%
actuaries calculate everything based on
 
01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
the smoothed rates because otherwise you
 
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
could see how
 
01:21:19.669 --> 01:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
we would have wildly swinging employer
 
01:21:21.770 --> 01:21:21.780 align:start position:0%
contribution rates if they were just
 
01:21:24.530 --> 01:21:24.540 align:start position:0%
based on the last fiscal Year's
 
01:21:30.250 --> 01:21:30.260 align:start position:0%
investment performance and our employers
 
01:21:32.570 --> 01:21:32.580 align:start position:0%
prefer to have
 
01:21:35.209 --> 01:21:35.219 align:start position:0%
employer contributions rates that are
 
01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
steady over time rather than swinging
 
01:21:39.470 --> 01:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
dramatically up or down well they
 
01:21:41.530 --> 01:21:41.540 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mind dramatically swinging down
 
01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
but they do not like those big increases
 
01:21:51.290 --> 01:21:51.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:56.390 --> 01:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:59.810 --> 01:21:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:01.610 --> 01:22:01.620 align:start position:0%
just quick question two questions
 
01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:02.450 align:start position:0%
just quick question two questions
actually

01:22:02.450 --> 01:22:02.460 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:22:04.070 --> 01:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
um do you are you allowed to invest in
 
01:22:06.470 --> 01:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
like gold silver and crypto and do you
 
01:22:10.030 --> 01:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
that's first one okay um
 
01:22:14.149 --> 01:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
we our current investment policy does
 
01:22:17.630 --> 01:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
not allow us to invest in commodities
 
01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
we did have a very minor exposure to the
 
01:22:25.610 --> 01:22:25.620 align:start position:0%
crypto industry through some of our
 
01:22:27.950 --> 01:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
private Equity Funds it was a total of
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:34.010 --> 01:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
and then the second question would be
 
01:22:36.830 --> 01:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up I'm sorry can I please follow
 
01:22:38.330 --> 01:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
up please
 
01:22:40.189 --> 01:22:40.199 align:start position:0%
with the performance when you exceed
 
01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
performance expectations is there some
 
01:22:45.530 --> 01:22:45.540 align:start position:0%
kind of compensation or anything paid to
 
01:22:47.330 --> 01:22:47.340 align:start position:0%
State Employees for achieving these
 
01:22:50.050 --> 01:22:50.060 align:start position:0%
results doing it a plaquer I don't know
 
01:22:54.350 --> 01:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
we get a heartfelt thank you
 
01:22:56.630 --> 01:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
job well done thank you we have no
 
01:22:58.910 --> 01:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
incentive compensation okay
 
01:23:00.530 --> 01:23:00.540 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt you had a
 
01:23:00.540 --> 01:23:01.189 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt you had a
question

01:23:01.189 --> 01:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:23:04.430 --> 01:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
are we still using GRS as our actuars
 
01:23:07.850 --> 01:23:07.860 align:start position:0%
thank you yes we are still using GRS and
 
01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
they've done an excellent job
 
01:23:13.250 --> 01:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
and continue to do that
 
01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:14.270 align:start position:0%
and continue to do that
okay

01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:23:16.430 --> 01:23:16.440 align:start position:0%
representative a bear
 
01:23:18.470 --> 01:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
I I just had a couple of questions
 
01:23:26.990 --> 01:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
is is there a reason why this
 
01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:30.410 align:start position:0%
is is there a reason why this
retirement

01:23:30.410 --> 01:23:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:32.510 --> 01:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
why there's an independent investment
 
01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
committee it says it's appointed by who
 
01:23:36.239 --> 01:23:37.850 align:start position:0%
committee it says it's appointed by who
this

01:23:37.850 --> 01:23:37.860 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:23:41.330 --> 01:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
if you could please turn to page 36 I'm
 
01:23:43.370 --> 01:23:43.380 align:start position:0%
there I see it it says it's appointed by
 
01:23:45.590 --> 01:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
it says it's quoting an RSA law but who
 
01:23:48.290 --> 01:23:48.300 align:start position:0%
appoints this investment committee okay
 
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
um two of the members come directly from
 
01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
the board which
 
01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:56.570 align:start position:0%
the board which
um

01:23:56.570 --> 01:23:56.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:59.090 --> 01:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
in slide 35 the Board of Trustees right
 
01:24:01.610 --> 01:24:01.620 align:start position:0%
exactly and so there are the two members
 
01:24:03.370 --> 01:24:03.380 align:start position:0%
that are from the board
 
01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
and then which the governor as well as
 
01:24:09.890 --> 01:24:09.900 align:start position:0%
the executive council is is part of the
 
01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
decision making there the governor would
 
01:24:14.330 --> 01:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
appoint people and then the executive
 
01:24:15.890 --> 01:24:15.900 align:start position:0%
Council would agree with them some of
 
01:24:17.450 --> 01:24:17.460 align:start position:0%
them are appointed directly by the
 
01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
governor to the board and some of them
 
01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:22.149 align:start position:0%
governor to the board and some of them
are

01:24:22.149 --> 01:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
suggest nominated by the the employees
 
01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
themselves and some by the employers
 
01:24:32.330 --> 01:24:32.340 align:start position:0%
so those are the those are two of the
 
01:24:33.950 --> 01:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
people that are on the independent
 
01:24:35.810 --> 01:24:35.820 align:start position:0%
investment committee and then there are
 
01:24:37.850 --> 01:24:37.860 align:start position:0%
three people which as Marty discussed
 
01:24:37.860 --> 01:24:39.050 align:start position:0%
three people which as Marty discussed
earlier

01:24:39.050 --> 01:24:39.060 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
01:24:42.169 --> 01:24:42.179 align:start position:0%
um are required to be have extensive
 
01:24:44.630 --> 01:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
professional experience and finance and
 
01:24:47.930 --> 01:24:47.940 align:start position:0%
Investments the re reason I was not here
 
01:24:51.169 --> 01:24:51.179 align:start position:0%
in 2009 when the legislature made this
 
01:24:54.410 --> 01:24:54.420 align:start position:0%
decision but my understanding and Marty
 
01:24:55.970 --> 01:24:55.980 align:start position:0%
referred to it earlier was that there
 
01:24:57.610 --> 01:24:57.620 align:start position:0%
was a desire to have
 
01:25:01.250 --> 01:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
stronger knowledge of Investments for
 
01:25:02.750 --> 01:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
the group that makes the investment
 
01:25:05.570 --> 01:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
decisions for nhrs
 
01:25:07.790 --> 01:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
and so my follow-on question Madam chair
 
01:25:11.149 --> 01:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
with you that was why is this not
 
01:25:13.250 --> 01:25:13.260 align:start position:0%
privatized why are we depending on
 
01:25:16.070 --> 01:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
people who are nominated and appointed
 
01:25:18.169 --> 01:25:18.179 align:start position:0%
is that not a question representative a
 
01:25:20.330 --> 01:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
bearer is a policy decision that we the
 
01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
legislature have made thank you and we
 
01:25:25.790 --> 01:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
can can obviously reconsider it at any
 
01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:29.470 align:start position:0%
can can obviously reconsider it at any
time

01:25:29.470 --> 01:25:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:42.950 --> 01:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
yes I alluded to earlier our performance
 
01:25:48.890 --> 01:25:48.900 align:start position:0%
through June 30 2022 was better than 80
 
01:25:51.229 --> 01:25:51.239 align:start position:0%
percent of our peers over a 10-year
 
01:25:54.410 --> 01:25:54.420 align:start position:0%
period that put us in the top 18th
 
01:25:57.470 --> 01:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
percentile and for the 13 years that
 
01:26:01.610 --> 01:26:01.620 align:start position:0%
ended June 30 2022 that's the time for
 
01:26:03.649 --> 01:26:03.659 align:start position:0%
which the iic has been making the
 
01:26:05.810 --> 01:26:05.820 align:start position:0%
investment decisions the fund
 
01:26:09.169 --> 01:26:09.179 align:start position:0%
outperformed 81 percent of our peers
 
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
and this app performance relative to the
 
01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
other public pension plans
 
01:26:17.169 --> 01:26:17.179 align:start position:0%
the median of their performance for that
 
01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
13-year period added approximately 325
 
01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars in additional returns to
 
01:26:26.629 --> 01:26:26.639 align:start position:0%
our fund which is not an insignificant
 
01:26:26.639 --> 01:26:29.689 align:start position:0%
our fund which is not an insignificant
amount

01:26:29.689 --> 01:26:29.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:33.830 --> 01:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
the next slide is on page 22.
 
01:26:36.890 --> 01:26:36.900 align:start position:0%
and this Compares our assumed rate of
 
01:26:40.010 --> 01:26:40.020 align:start position:0%
return with the national average of
 
01:26:42.410 --> 01:26:42.420 align:start position:0%
other public pension plans
 
01:26:46.729 --> 01:26:46.739 align:start position:0%
so you can see looking over at the far
 
01:26:50.330 --> 01:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
left hand side of the slide nhrs
 
01:26:53.990 --> 01:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
has consistently had a lower assumed
 
01:26:56.090 --> 01:26:56.100 align:start position:0%
rate of return than many other pension
 
01:26:56.100 --> 01:26:57.890 align:start position:0%
rate of return than many other pension
plans

01:26:57.890 --> 01:26:57.900 align:start position:0%
plans
 
01:27:00.229 --> 01:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
and what determines the assumed rate of
 
01:27:04.669 --> 01:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
return is the plan's actual Investments
 
01:27:07.010 --> 01:27:07.020 align:start position:0%
the actuaries go through a very
 
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
complicated process of recommending an
 
01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
assumed rate of return what they do is
 
01:27:15.169 --> 01:27:15.179 align:start position:0%
they look at how what percent of our
 
01:27:18.530 --> 01:27:18.540 align:start position:0%
portfolio is in domestic equities what
 
01:27:20.590 --> 01:27:20.600 align:start position:0%
percent is in
 
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
foreign equities what percent is in
 
01:27:25.250 --> 01:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
fixed income what percent is in real
 
01:27:27.950 --> 01:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
estate and what percent is in different
 
01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
alternative Investments and then they
 
01:27:33.590 --> 01:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
pull a number of investment Consultants
 
01:27:36.530 --> 01:27:36.540 align:start position:0%
to ask them what do you think these
 
01:27:38.570 --> 01:27:38.580 align:start position:0%
different asset classes are going to
 
01:27:42.110 --> 01:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
earn over the next five to ten years
 
01:27:45.169 --> 01:27:45.179 align:start position:0%
and so the actuaries look at all of that
 
01:27:47.689 --> 01:27:47.699 align:start position:0%
input and then apply that to the actual
 
01:27:50.629 --> 01:27:50.639 align:start position:0%
weightings an hour
 
01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
Investment Portfolio
 
01:27:55.189 --> 01:27:55.199 align:start position:0%
and they come up with a number that they
 
01:27:58.070 --> 01:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
think is reasonable based on that
 
01:28:01.490 --> 01:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
and then our and then our board has this
 
01:28:04.970 --> 01:28:04.980 align:start position:0%
and then our the iic signs off on that
 
01:28:07.669 --> 01:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
and then the board votes on that so two
 
01:28:09.530 --> 01:28:09.540 align:start position:0%
different pension plans may have very
 
01:28:11.990 --> 01:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
different assumed rates of returns and
 
01:28:13.610 --> 01:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean that one is right and
 
01:28:15.950 --> 01:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
the other one is wrong it just often
 
01:28:18.229 --> 01:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
means that they have different Assets in
 
01:28:20.570 --> 01:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
their portfolio and some states
 
01:28:23.209 --> 01:28:23.219 align:start position:0%
Minneapolis com Minnesota comes to mind
 
01:28:26.450 --> 01:28:26.460 align:start position:0%
it's a set in statute which is not a
 
01:28:28.370 --> 01:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
good place to be and I think that used
 
01:28:34.189 --> 01:28:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:36.050 --> 01:28:36.060 align:start position:0%
so you can see that
 
01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's a it's a difficult balance
 
01:28:40.129 --> 01:28:40.139 align:start position:0%
coming up with something that is
 
01:28:43.729 --> 01:28:43.739 align:start position:0%
realistic but is conservative and is
 
01:28:46.430 --> 01:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
achievable and the board works hard to
 
01:28:49.070 --> 01:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
get that balance right
 
01:28:50.930 --> 01:28:50.940 align:start position:0%
and at this point I will turn things
 
01:28:52.910 --> 01:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
over to Marty to talk more about
 
01:28:56.709 --> 01:28:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:59.450 --> 01:28:59.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Jan um we've we've kept here
 
01:29:01.910 --> 01:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
for a while I hope it's been interesting
 
01:29:03.470 --> 01:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
um and we will try to get you out of
 
01:29:05.510 --> 01:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
here in time for lunch
 
01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
um so you can get back for the the
 
01:29:09.169 --> 01:29:09.179 align:start position:0%
dental stuff in the afternoon
 
01:29:11.149 --> 01:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
um contributions and funding and this is
 
01:29:13.370 --> 01:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
this is the slides I uh referred to when
 
01:29:15.169 --> 01:29:15.179 align:start position:0%
representative leckis asked about some
 
01:29:17.030 --> 01:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
of the history of the unfunded liability
 
01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
so we're just going to start out member
 
01:29:21.770 --> 01:29:21.780 align:start position:0%
contributions are set in statured as we
 
01:29:23.689 --> 01:29:23.699 align:start position:0%
had previously mentioned and those are
 
01:29:25.850 --> 01:29:25.860 align:start position:0%
the contribution rates for each of the
 
01:29:29.090 --> 01:29:29.100 align:start position:0%
four member groups on Slide 23. the
 
01:29:30.770 --> 01:29:30.780 align:start position:0%
police and fire pay and more that's
 
01:29:32.570 --> 01:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
again a part of partially recognition of
 
01:29:35.149 --> 01:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
the Social Security non not contributing
 
01:29:38.209 --> 01:29:38.219 align:start position:0%
to that plan uh employer contributions
 
01:29:39.950 --> 01:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
aren't set in statute those are
 
01:29:42.050 --> 01:29:42.060 align:start position:0%
determined by the actuary and then
 
01:29:44.090 --> 01:29:44.100 align:start position:0%
certified by the Board of Trustees every
 
01:29:47.330 --> 01:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
two years our process not surprisingly
 
01:29:50.030 --> 01:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
since we're created by Statute has our
 
01:29:52.750 --> 01:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
rates set no later than October 1st
 
01:29:55.669 --> 01:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
so that we can get numbers to the state
 
01:29:57.169 --> 01:29:57.179 align:start position:0%
when they're doing their next two-year
 
01:30:00.770 --> 01:30:00.780 align:start position:0%
budget you know we have moved that up to
 
01:30:02.209 --> 01:30:02.219 align:start position:0%
help employers and we certified the
 
01:30:05.950 --> 01:30:05.960 align:start position:0%
rates this this past summer in July
 
01:30:08.510 --> 01:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
local employers pay 100 of those
 
01:30:10.430 --> 01:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
contributions as we talked about earlier
 
01:30:12.770 --> 01:30:12.780 align:start position:0%
and we also referenced the the one-time
 
01:30:14.570 --> 01:30:14.580 align:start position:0%
payment last for last year's
 
01:30:16.490 --> 01:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
contribution so
 
01:30:19.970 --> 01:30:19.980 align:start position:0%
um slide 24 talks about oh yeah on that
 
01:30:22.850 --> 01:30:22.860 align:start position:0%
point right now the employees pay the
 
01:30:24.770 --> 01:30:24.780 align:start position:0%
bulk of their own retirement for the
 
01:30:26.450 --> 01:30:26.460 align:start position:0%
active employees
 
01:30:29.390 --> 01:30:29.400 align:start position:0%
the there is in statute of formula that
 
01:30:33.050 --> 01:30:33.060 align:start position:0%
once the unfunded liability becomes
 
01:30:36.590 --> 01:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
more manageable the employee rate will
 
01:30:39.770 --> 01:30:39.780 align:start position:0%
go down until the employer and the
 
01:30:42.830 --> 01:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
employee are paying equally toward their
 
01:30:44.810 --> 01:30:44.820 align:start position:0%
uh tour of the retirement which is the
 
01:30:47.570 --> 01:30:47.580 align:start position:0%
goal uh I don't it won't be happening
 
01:30:49.490 --> 01:30:49.500 align:start position:0%
this year I'm afraid but that is the
 
01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
plan yeah
 
01:30:52.970 --> 01:30:52.980 align:start position:0%
Senator Schmidt
 
01:30:57.050 --> 01:30:57.060 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so you were saying
 
01:31:00.530 --> 01:31:00.540 align:start position:0%
a few moments ago that something is was
 
01:31:03.110 --> 01:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh not in statute and that's a good
 
01:31:05.689 --> 01:31:05.699 align:start position:0%
thing for new people they may not
 
01:31:08.390 --> 01:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
realize that anything that's in statute
 
01:31:10.970 --> 01:31:10.980 align:start position:0%
is not that easy to change because you
 
01:31:12.590 --> 01:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
have to get the legislature on board
 
01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
that's all time consuming and the
 
01:31:18.169 --> 01:31:18.179 align:start position:0%
governor and so forth so it's a terrible
 
01:31:20.570 --> 01:31:20.580 align:start position:0%
situation in some respects to have
 
01:31:22.250 --> 01:31:22.260 align:start position:0%
something in statute
 
01:31:22.260 --> 01:31:23.930 align:start position:0%
something in statute
here

01:31:23.930 --> 01:31:23.940 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:31:26.810 --> 01:31:26.820 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the rates being set
 
01:31:29.510 --> 01:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
in statute is that really working as
 
01:31:32.930 --> 01:31:32.940 align:start position:0%
well as as an alternative method is that
 
01:31:35.870 --> 01:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
what other states do as well they set
 
01:31:38.750 --> 01:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
that in statute or are we an outlier
 
01:31:41.209 --> 01:31:41.219 align:start position:0%
there on the member contribution side
 
01:31:43.729 --> 01:31:43.739 align:start position:0%
Most states do set that in statute and
 
01:31:45.470 --> 01:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
that you know that's sort of a give
 
01:31:47.750 --> 01:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
gives the members a certainty uh you
 
01:31:49.070 --> 01:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
know for what when they when they accept
 
01:31:50.390 --> 01:31:50.400 align:start position:0%
positions what they're going to be
 
01:31:52.669 --> 01:31:52.679 align:start position:0%
paying in that that's not uncommon on
 
01:31:54.590 --> 01:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
the members member contributions to be
 
01:31:56.930 --> 01:31:56.940 align:start position:0%
set in statute okay
 
01:31:58.910 --> 01:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
and not everything is bad that's in
 
01:32:00.410 --> 01:32:00.420 align:start position:0%
statute those were those were last
 
01:32:02.510 --> 01:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
changed in 2011 in the house bill too
 
01:32:04.790 --> 01:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
that I referred to earlier so you know
 
01:32:06.890 --> 01:32:06.900 align:start position:0%
how does the actuary crunch the numbers
 
01:32:08.810 --> 01:32:08.820 align:start position:0%
to come up with the rates
 
01:32:10.729 --> 01:32:10.739 align:start position:0%
um this on slide 24. what they do is
 
01:32:13.490 --> 01:32:13.500 align:start position:0%
it's called an Actuarial valuation and
 
01:32:15.410 --> 01:32:15.420 align:start position:0%
they do one of those every two years for
 
01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
us so it looks you know on on cycle so
 
01:32:20.510 --> 01:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
it would there'll be evaluation for FY
 
01:32:23.149 --> 01:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
2223 that we'll be seeing
 
01:32:23.159 --> 01:32:24.050 align:start position:0%
2223 that we'll be seeing
um

01:32:24.050 --> 01:32:24.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:27.470 --> 01:32:27.480 align:start position:0%
no for 23 24 that we'll be seeing uh
 
01:32:27.480 --> 01:32:28.490 align:start position:0%
no for 23 24 that we'll be seeing uh
then

01:32:28.490 --> 01:32:28.500 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:32:30.649 --> 01:32:30.659 align:start position:0%
um and they calculate the funding status
 
01:32:33.290 --> 01:32:33.300 align:start position:0%
of the plan and set the employer rates
 
01:32:35.090 --> 01:32:35.100 align:start position:0%
and those rates consist of three pieces
 
01:32:36.950 --> 01:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
the normal cost and we'll talk about
 
01:32:38.570 --> 01:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
each of these in detail on the next
 
01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
Slide the unfunded liability or ual and
 
01:32:44.510 --> 01:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
the medical subsidy rate each member
 
01:32:46.550 --> 01:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
group has a separate rate based on the
 
01:32:49.610 --> 01:32:49.620 align:start position:0%
demographics of that plan and there's a
 
01:32:51.169 --> 01:32:51.179 align:start position:0%
number of assumptions that the actuary
 
01:32:54.110 --> 01:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
uses in deriving these rates how long
 
01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
are people going to live how old are
 
01:32:57.050 --> 01:32:57.060 align:start position:0%
they going to be when they choose to
 
01:32:59.390 --> 01:32:59.400 align:start position:0%
retire how many people I can invest and
 
01:33:01.850 --> 01:33:01.860 align:start position:0%
you know walk away and not earn a
 
01:33:03.470 --> 01:33:03.480 align:start position:0%
benefit from us how much are we going to
 
01:33:05.149 --> 01:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
make in the markets are there all kinds
 
01:33:07.610 --> 01:33:07.620 align:start position:0%
of assumptions that are based on a lot
 
01:33:10.010 --> 01:33:10.020 align:start position:0%
of complex statistical models but they
 
01:33:12.290 --> 01:33:12.300 align:start position:0%
are assumptions they're not facts so
 
01:33:15.169 --> 01:33:15.179 align:start position:0%
every four years they do what's called
 
01:33:17.870 --> 01:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
an Actuarial experience study where they
 
01:33:19.970 --> 01:33:19.980 align:start position:0%
do two things they look back at the last
 
01:33:21.709 --> 01:33:21.719 align:start position:0%
four years of experience and you know
 
01:33:23.450 --> 01:33:23.460 align:start position:0%
other retirement rates
 
01:33:25.669 --> 01:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
similar to what they they what they
 
01:33:27.229 --> 01:33:27.239 align:start position:0%
expected them to be or the more where
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
the brutality rates moving things like
 
01:33:31.010 --> 01:33:31.020 align:start position:0%
that and they also look forward it
 
01:33:33.350 --> 01:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
Trends you know sort of nationally and
 
01:33:35.930 --> 01:33:35.940 align:start position:0%
globally uh you know about things like
 
01:33:38.450 --> 01:33:38.460 align:start position:0%
mortality and investment so so basically
 
01:33:40.250 --> 01:33:40.260 align:start position:0%
there there's sort of constantly
 
01:33:42.110 --> 01:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
resetting the assumptions as needed
 
01:33:45.110 --> 01:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
because you can't get you
 
01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
nothing nothing is going to turn out
 
01:33:48.350 --> 01:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
exactly has anyone planned for anything
 
01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:49.800 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of moving Parts
 
01:33:52.250 --> 01:33:52.260 align:start position:0%
involved in this so you want them to
 
01:33:54.169 --> 01:33:54.179 align:start position:0%
sort of average out to where you want to
 
01:33:54.179 --> 01:33:54.950 align:start position:0%
sort of average out to where you want to
be

01:33:54.950 --> 01:33:54.960 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:33:55.970 --> 01:33:55.980 align:start position:0%
um type of thing so they're always
 
01:33:58.910 --> 01:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
reviewing uh those and part of that is
 
01:34:00.709 --> 01:34:00.719 align:start position:0%
the demographic so then the the other
 
01:34:02.689 --> 01:34:02.699 align:start position:0%
piece is the economics which Jan spoke
 
01:34:04.310 --> 01:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
to which is primarily the assumed rate
 
01:34:06.890 --> 01:34:06.900 align:start position:0%
of return but also the wage inflation
 
01:34:09.470 --> 01:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
rate is part of that as well as a is an
 
01:34:11.149 --> 01:34:11.159 align:start position:0%
important piece
 
01:34:13.490 --> 01:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
so we'll be getting another
 
01:34:16.669 --> 01:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
um fiscal 23 will be the the end of the
 
01:34:18.410 --> 01:34:18.420 align:start position:0%
last the next four year period will be
 
01:34:19.910 --> 01:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
the board will be getting an experience
 
01:34:25.189 --> 01:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:27.350 --> 01:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
um so the the pieces of the employer
 
01:34:29.810 --> 01:34:29.820 align:start position:0%
rate the the normal of the rate the
 
01:34:31.790 --> 01:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
total rate is the normal cost and this
 
01:34:33.709 --> 01:34:33.719 align:start position:0%
is the estimated annual cost of pension
 
01:34:36.350 --> 01:34:36.360 align:start position:0%
benefits as they're earned this is how
 
01:34:38.090 --> 01:34:38.100 align:start position:0%
the actuary basically projects out
 
01:34:40.010 --> 01:34:40.020 align:start position:0%
everybody's individual
 
01:34:43.610 --> 01:34:43.620 align:start position:0%
benefit scenarios based on on the um the
 
01:34:45.350 --> 01:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
assumptions in place and then averages
 
01:34:47.209 --> 01:34:47.219 align:start position:0%
them back together to get a normal cost
 
01:34:49.669 --> 01:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
how much as a percentage of pain needs
 
01:34:52.430 --> 01:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
to be set aside in a given year to fund
 
01:34:54.290 --> 01:34:54.300 align:start position:0%
that person's benefit you know down the
 
01:34:56.930 --> 01:34:56.940 align:start position:0%
road all of the member contributions go
 
01:34:58.910 --> 01:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
towards the normal cost so to that
 
01:35:01.550 --> 01:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
extent they're pre-funding their benefit
 
01:35:04.669 --> 01:35:04.679 align:start position:0%
um by 65 to 70 percent of what their of
 
01:35:06.709 --> 01:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
their ultimate benefit
 
01:35:07.850 --> 01:35:07.860 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to jump to the bottom of
 
01:35:09.410 --> 01:35:09.420 align:start position:0%
the slide for the medical subsidy
 
01:35:11.450 --> 01:35:11.460 align:start position:0%
because it's a little bit shorter
 
01:35:13.070 --> 01:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
um you know that's a pay-as-you-go rate
 
01:35:15.890 --> 01:35:15.900 align:start position:0%
basically there's a finite pool that
 
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
tends to decline every year of people
 
01:35:19.550 --> 01:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
receiving the medical subsidy this was
 
01:35:21.890 --> 01:35:21.900 align:start position:0%
closed for teachers in 2009 for
 
01:35:24.830 --> 01:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
employees back in the early 2000s
 
01:35:26.450 --> 01:35:26.460 align:start position:0%
um anybody in group two had to be
 
01:35:29.330 --> 01:35:29.340 align:start position:0%
working on June 30th of 2000 to qualify
 
01:35:31.790 --> 01:35:31.800 align:start position:0%
so it's a finite pool for this insurance
 
01:35:34.790 --> 01:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
premium offset and it's they fund it as
 
01:35:36.050 --> 01:35:36.060 align:start position:0%
a pay as you go the actual real
 
01:35:37.669 --> 01:35:37.679 align:start position:0%
calculate how many people are getting it
 
01:35:39.470 --> 01:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
how much is the subsidy and how much do
 
01:35:42.050 --> 01:35:42.060 align:start position:0%
we need for two years to keep it solvent
 
01:35:45.530 --> 01:35:45.540 align:start position:0%
so there's no future projections on that
 
01:35:48.110 --> 01:35:48.120 align:start position:0%
and the subsidy amounts are set in
 
01:35:51.890 --> 01:35:51.900 align:start position:0%
statute they've been flat since 2008 and
 
01:35:51.900 --> 01:35:52.669 align:start position:0%
statute they've been flat since 2008 and
um

01:35:52.669 --> 01:35:52.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:54.770 --> 01:35:54.780 align:start position:0%
there's a lower subsidy for people who
 
01:35:57.050 --> 01:35:57.060 align:start position:0%
are Medicare eligible post 65 and that's
 
01:35:59.510 --> 01:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
where most of the subsidy recipients are
 
01:36:01.790 --> 01:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
now so it'll eventually go away as a
 
01:36:03.290 --> 01:36:03.300 align:start position:0%
component of the rate but not for
 
01:36:06.410 --> 01:36:06.420 align:start position:0%
several decades and then the middle the
 
01:36:08.450 --> 01:36:08.460 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability this is this is sort
 
01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
of the you know the big the origin story
 
01:36:12.770 --> 01:36:12.780 align:start position:0%
for the retirement system so much is
 
01:36:15.229 --> 01:36:15.239 align:start position:0%
packed into this this is the estimated
 
01:36:17.810 --> 01:36:17.820 align:start position:0%
value of accrued nhrs benefits not yet
 
01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
funded so this is future benefits
 
01:36:22.270 --> 01:36:22.280 align:start position:0%
projected to be paid out to members
 
01:36:25.010 --> 01:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
retirees and active members uh that we
 
01:36:26.750 --> 01:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
don't have the funding in the trust fund
 
01:36:30.229 --> 01:36:30.239 align:start position:0%
right now for uh it was 5.69 billion at
 
01:36:32.450 --> 01:36:32.460 align:start position:0%
the close of the last fiscal year and
 
01:36:35.390 --> 01:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
that's a funded ratio of 65.6 so we have
 
01:36:37.610 --> 01:36:37.620 align:start position:0%
a little bit less than two-thirds
 
01:36:40.129 --> 01:36:40.139 align:start position:0%
of all of the funds needed to meet our
 
01:36:42.890 --> 01:36:42.900 align:start position:0%
future obligations and you know the
 
01:36:45.470 --> 01:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
first thing you may jump to is well that
 
01:36:47.149 --> 01:36:47.159 align:start position:0%
what happens if everybody wants their
 
01:36:49.550 --> 01:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
money but it we pay out monthly benefits
 
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
over people's lifetimes so it's not like
 
01:36:53.930 --> 01:36:53.940 align:start position:0%
people can go to the building and Loan
 
01:36:55.310 --> 01:36:55.320 align:start position:0%
and ask for all their money back when
 
01:36:57.110 --> 01:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
there's Iran on the bank you know we're
 
01:36:59.570 --> 01:36:59.580 align:start position:0%
paying these out in orderly trashes over
 
01:37:02.209 --> 01:37:02.219 align:start position:0%
decades so we have that time to rebuild
 
01:37:04.010 --> 01:37:04.020 align:start position:0%
our funding and get get to where we want
 
01:37:05.930 --> 01:37:05.940 align:start position:0%
to be on a funded level
 
01:37:08.930 --> 01:37:08.940 align:start position:0%
um so so it's not you know um so
 
01:37:10.910 --> 01:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
you know some states you know
 
01:37:13.129 --> 01:37:13.139 align:start position:0%
liabilities aren't uncommon there are
 
01:37:14.510 --> 01:37:14.520 align:start position:0%
some states that are fully funded 100
 
01:37:17.330 --> 01:37:17.340 align:start position:0%
there are some that are in the 30s and
 
01:37:20.030 --> 01:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
40s for funding a lot of those are more
 
01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
policy decisions in those States than
 
01:37:25.250 --> 01:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
economic decisions but in nhrs's case if
 
01:37:26.990 --> 01:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
we have a constitutional amendment that
 
01:37:29.030 --> 01:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
employees employers pay the full rate
 
01:37:32.090 --> 01:37:32.100 align:start position:0%
and other other protections how come we
 
01:37:34.850 --> 01:37:34.860 align:start position:0%
have this unfunded liability
 
01:37:37.490 --> 01:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
and there are three main factors that
 
01:37:40.370 --> 01:37:40.380 align:start position:0%
went into growing this liability uh in
 
01:37:43.189 --> 01:37:43.199 align:start position:0%
the first and most dramatic was um the
 
01:37:45.290 --> 01:37:45.300 align:start position:0%
sort of charging of artificially low
 
01:37:48.830 --> 01:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
employer contributions from 1991 uh
 
01:37:53.450 --> 01:37:53.460 align:start position:0%
through 2000 um and nine and what that
 
01:37:55.490 --> 01:37:55.500 align:start position:0%
was was back in the early 90s there was
 
01:37:57.770 --> 01:37:57.780 align:start position:0%
a a recession New Hampshire was
 
01:37:59.570 --> 01:37:59.580 align:start position:0%
particularly hardly hit with real estate
 
01:38:01.790 --> 01:38:01.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of the banks folded
 
01:38:03.290 --> 01:38:03.300 align:start position:0%
um you know it was you know a lot of
 
01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
people were losing jobs and they were
 
01:38:07.070 --> 01:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
the retirement system rates were going
 
01:38:11.629 --> 01:38:11.639 align:start position:0%
up uh in that 92 91 92 period because
 
01:38:13.250 --> 01:38:13.260 align:start position:0%
the benefit increases that the
 
01:38:17.629 --> 01:38:17.639 align:start position:0%
legislature granted in 88.89 so there
 
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
was pressure
 
01:38:20.570 --> 01:38:20.580 align:start position:0%
um from local employers from the
 
01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
governor's office you know what can be
 
01:38:26.149 --> 01:38:26.159 align:start position:0%
done and the nhrs asked the actuary at
 
01:38:28.070 --> 01:38:28.080 align:start position:0%
the time a firm called Buck you know
 
01:38:30.950 --> 01:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
what was the best way to actually fund
 
01:38:33.410 --> 01:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
the plan and they did a lengthy report
 
01:38:35.330 --> 01:38:35.340 align:start position:0%
you know in the executive summer very
 
01:38:37.430 --> 01:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
the first page recommended to close
 
01:38:39.890 --> 01:38:39.900 align:start position:0%
30-year amortization using the entry age
 
01:38:42.470 --> 01:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
normal method uh you know and then the
 
01:38:44.390 --> 01:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
second page of the summary said but
 
01:38:45.709 --> 01:38:45.719 align:start position:0%
there's three other ways you can do it
 
01:38:47.450 --> 01:38:47.460 align:start position:0%
too that are acceptable under current
 
01:38:50.590 --> 01:38:50.600 align:start position:0%
practice and you give a sort of a menu
 
01:38:53.810 --> 01:38:53.820 align:start position:0%
to a decision maker in a tight budget
 
01:38:54.890 --> 01:38:54.900 align:start position:0%
time they're going to pick the cheapest
 
01:38:57.110 --> 01:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
option and that's what happened the
 
01:39:00.590 --> 01:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
legislature uh passed the bill back in
 
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
91 that changed the funding the way we
 
01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
calculate the funding of the retirement
 
01:39:08.090 --> 01:39:08.100 align:start position:0%
system to something called a open group
 
01:39:10.729 --> 01:39:10.739 align:start position:0%
aggregate which is no longer an accepted
 
01:39:13.250 --> 01:39:13.260 align:start position:0%
method they also mandated that the board
 
01:39:14.930 --> 01:39:14.940 align:start position:0%
set the assume rate of return for the
 
01:39:17.510 --> 01:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
next year at 9.75
 
01:39:19.370 --> 01:39:19.380 align:start position:0%
um you know which again the higher the
 
01:39:20.330 --> 01:39:20.340 align:start position:0%
rate the lower the employer
 
01:39:22.629 --> 01:39:22.639 align:start position:0%
contributions and this was a temper
 
01:39:25.490 --> 01:39:25.500 align:start position:0%
build as a temporary solution to a
 
01:39:27.649 --> 01:39:27.659 align:start position:0%
short-term crisis you know economic
 
01:39:29.870 --> 01:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
issues in New Hampshire and that they
 
01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
did give the board back uh the setting
 
01:39:34.189 --> 01:39:34.199 align:start position:0%
of The assumed rate of return a year
 
01:39:35.689 --> 01:39:35.699 align:start position:0%
later and they we've never should have
 
01:39:37.729 --> 01:39:37.739 align:start position:0%
taken it away from fiduciary perspective
 
01:39:40.790 --> 01:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
but this funding methodology stayed on
 
01:39:43.310 --> 01:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
the books until it was repealed in 2007.
 
01:39:46.910 --> 01:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
so what you have is you know you drilled
 
01:39:48.290 --> 01:39:48.300 align:start position:0%
a hole in the bottom of your boat you
 
01:39:49.910 --> 01:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
forgot about it for 15 years and then
 
01:39:51.169 --> 01:39:51.179 align:start position:0%
your ankle started getting damp
 
01:39:52.669 --> 01:39:52.679 align:start position:0%
eventually and you realize there was a
 
01:39:55.370 --> 01:39:55.380 align:start position:0%
hole there so that was that was one of
 
01:39:56.930 --> 01:39:56.940 align:start position:0%
the reasons why the liability was
 
01:39:59.090 --> 01:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
growing and the way the funding was
 
01:40:01.070 --> 01:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
calculated didn't really show up in the
 
01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
reports on top of that there was
 
01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
something that started in the 80s
 
01:40:09.669 --> 01:40:09.679 align:start position:0%
called gain sharing and this was a a
 
01:40:11.870 --> 01:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhart had a question
 
01:40:14.090 --> 01:40:14.100 align:start position:0%
about performance over and above the
 
01:40:16.129 --> 01:40:16.139 align:start position:0%
assumed rate of return and
 
01:40:17.689 --> 01:40:17.699 align:start position:0%
um back in the 80s and 90s the
 
01:40:20.510 --> 01:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
legislature set a ceiling where if we
 
01:40:22.310 --> 01:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
exceeded our assumed rate of return in a
 
01:40:24.169 --> 01:40:24.179 align:start position:0%
given year by a certain amount usually
 
01:40:24.179 --> 01:40:24.890 align:start position:0%
given year by a certain amount usually
about

01:40:24.890 --> 01:40:24.900 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:40:27.890 --> 01:40:27.900 align:start position:0%
um a half a percentage Point any funds
 
01:40:30.709 --> 01:40:30.719 align:start position:0%
any investment income over that over and
 
01:40:32.090 --> 01:40:32.100 align:start position:0%
above the assumed rate of return was
 
01:40:35.209 --> 01:40:35.219 align:start position:0%
segregated to pay for other benefits so
 
01:40:37.370 --> 01:40:37.380 align:start position:0%
that was primarily colas and the medical
 
01:40:41.330 --> 01:40:41.340 align:start position:0%
subsidy and if you consistently exceed
 
01:40:43.610 --> 01:40:43.620 align:start position:0%
your assume rate of return it's great
 
01:40:45.950 --> 01:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
because you've got money you flush with
 
01:40:47.810 --> 01:40:47.820 align:start position:0%
money but if you have a year where you
 
01:40:49.070 --> 01:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
have a down year and you don't have that
 
01:40:50.450 --> 01:40:50.460 align:start position:0%
assume rate of return you also don't
 
01:40:52.430 --> 01:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
have that cushion anymore because the
 
01:40:55.070 --> 01:40:55.080 align:start position:0%
funds are dedicated to something else so
 
01:40:57.350 --> 01:40:57.360 align:start position:0%
so that was sort of a structural issue
 
01:40:59.890 --> 01:40:59.900 align:start position:0%
with what was called the special account
 
01:41:03.470 --> 01:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
and that with the great the.com bubble
 
01:41:06.410 --> 01:41:06.420 align:start position:0%
in o102 we had negative investment years
 
01:41:06.420 --> 01:41:07.790 align:start position:0%
in o102 we had negative investment years
there

01:41:07.790 --> 01:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:41:09.770 --> 01:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
um in the legislature and and some of
 
01:41:10.970 --> 01:41:10.980 align:start position:0%
the member and employer groups got
 
01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
together and they recognized there was
 
01:41:14.629 --> 01:41:14.639 align:start position:0%
some issues structurally with the way
 
01:41:17.090 --> 01:41:17.100 align:start position:0%
that the plan was funded and you know
 
01:41:19.669 --> 01:41:19.679 align:start position:0%
that took about four or five years of
 
01:41:21.470 --> 01:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
Genesis and discussions to get a bill
 
01:41:26.810 --> 01:41:26.820 align:start position:0%
passed in 27 2007 that went back to
 
01:41:29.149 --> 01:41:29.159 align:start position:0%
close 30-year amortization entry age
 
01:41:29.159 --> 01:41:30.410 align:start position:0%
close 30-year amortization entry age
normal

01:41:30.410 --> 01:41:30.420 align:start position:0%
normal
 
01:41:32.110 --> 01:41:32.120 align:start position:0%
um for the funding and made some other
 
01:41:36.290 --> 01:41:36.300 align:start position:0%
structural changes that fix those leaks
 
01:41:37.970 --> 01:41:37.980 align:start position:0%
um you know in the basement but you know
 
01:41:40.010 --> 01:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
2007 what happened almost
 
01:41:41.990 --> 01:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
contemporaneously with those changes the
 
01:41:44.090 --> 01:41:44.100 align:start position:0%
Great Recession that you know
 
01:41:46.370 --> 01:41:46.380 align:start position:0%
um so that really exacerbated you know
 
01:41:48.410 --> 01:41:48.420 align:start position:0%
we had this whole you know it was two
 
01:41:50.689 --> 01:41:50.699 align:start position:0%
two billion plus and then the markets
 
01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
collapsed you know and we lost a billion
 
01:41:54.109 --> 01:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
that year and that just made the
 
01:41:56.209 --> 01:41:56.219 align:start position:0%
unfunded all that much more challenging
 
01:41:58.790 --> 01:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
so so that's kind of how we got here and
 
01:42:01.010 --> 01:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
we've been digging out of that for the
 
01:42:03.890 --> 01:42:03.900 align:start position:0%
past 13 years and making slow but steady
 
01:42:03.900 --> 01:42:08.689 align:start position:0%
past 13 years and making slow but steady
progress

01:42:08.689 --> 01:42:08.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:12.290 --> 01:42:12.300 align:start position:0%
uh let's see so um next slide slide 26
 
01:42:13.850 --> 01:42:13.860 align:start position:0%
this just shows the employer
 
01:42:16.689 --> 01:42:16.699 align:start position:0%
contribution rates for fiscal 24 25
 
01:42:20.229 --> 01:42:20.239 align:start position:0%
which is uh taking effect this July 1st
 
01:42:23.330 --> 01:42:23.340 align:start position:0%
uh the gray column in the middle shows
 
01:42:25.310 --> 01:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability as a portion of
 
01:42:27.790 --> 01:42:27.800 align:start position:0%
the total pension cost so employers
 
01:42:30.709 --> 01:42:30.719 align:start position:0%
77 to 85 percent of what they're paying
 
01:42:33.310 --> 01:42:33.320 align:start position:0%
in HRS are for these
 
01:42:35.870 --> 01:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
decisions made in the past that you know
 
01:42:37.910 --> 01:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
we're paying for now
 
01:42:40.250 --> 01:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
um without the unfunded liability and it
 
01:42:42.109 --> 01:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
you can't wipe it away you know it is
 
01:42:44.450 --> 01:42:44.460 align:start position:0%
already Adept that it's accrued
 
01:42:46.490 --> 01:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
um the normal cost of the pension you
 
01:42:48.410 --> 01:42:48.420 align:start position:0%
know for employees it's under 10 the
 
01:42:49.609 --> 01:42:49.619 align:start position:0%
employ the members are paying seven
 
01:42:51.709 --> 01:42:51.719 align:start position:0%
percent of that themselves so the the
 
01:42:54.290 --> 01:42:54.300 align:start position:0%
normal cost for for the employer are is
 
01:42:57.109 --> 01:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
relatively low and once the liability
 
01:42:59.629 --> 01:42:59.639 align:start position:0%
generally gets reduced to a more
 
01:43:01.490 --> 01:43:01.500 align:start position:0%
manageable level
 
01:43:03.830 --> 01:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
um you know the total employer rates are
 
01:43:05.570 --> 01:43:05.580 align:start position:0%
going to stabilize as well lower and as
 
01:43:07.490 --> 01:43:07.500 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire
 
01:43:08.990 --> 01:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
um reference there is some statutory
 
01:43:12.050 --> 01:43:12.060 align:start position:0%
language to when they Bounce Down they
 
01:43:13.850 --> 01:43:13.860 align:start position:0%
can't go below the member rate and when
 
01:43:15.950 --> 01:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
they get to that level they'll both go
 
01:43:18.709 --> 01:43:18.719 align:start position:0%
up and down together uh after that so
 
01:43:21.590 --> 01:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
but that's again probably talking 2040s
 
01:43:24.770 --> 01:43:24.780 align:start position:0%
at best on that uh and the the footnote
 
01:43:27.229 --> 01:43:27.239 align:start position:0%
on slide 26 just shows the member share
 
01:43:29.090 --> 01:43:29.100 align:start position:0%
of the employer cost so that's what
 
01:43:32.390 --> 01:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
their contributions represent uh as to
 
01:43:33.770 --> 01:43:33.780 align:start position:0%
how much their pre-framed their own
 
01:43:33.780 --> 01:43:38.450 align:start position:0%
how much their pre-framed their own
benefit

01:43:38.450 --> 01:43:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:42.530 --> 01:43:42.540 align:start position:0%
the next slide 27 just shows that the
 
01:43:46.870 --> 01:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
current FY 2223 rates versus 2425
 
01:43:49.430 --> 01:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
they're all going down this is the first
 
01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
time all four rates have gone down uh in
 
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
anyone's memory we had a little bit of a
 
01:43:58.189 --> 01:43:58.199 align:start position:0%
dip with employees and and the group two
 
01:44:01.070 --> 01:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
rates back in 2018 but that this is
 
01:44:03.050 --> 01:44:03.060 align:start position:0%
larger this is because of the five-year
 
01:44:05.090 --> 01:44:05.100 align:start position:0%
investment performance through June 30th
 
01:44:08.030 --> 01:44:08.040 align:start position:0%
of 21 was strong enough to to lower
 
01:44:10.189 --> 01:44:10.199 align:start position:0%
these rates a little
 
01:44:12.590 --> 01:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
um you know the expectation is that the
 
01:44:13.729 --> 01:44:13.739 align:start position:0%
rates aren't going to go down
 
01:44:15.830 --> 01:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
dramatically over the next 15 years
 
01:44:18.050 --> 01:44:18.060 align:start position:0%
they're going to hopefully stay around
 
01:44:20.330 --> 01:44:20.340 align:start position:0%
this level you know with a little bit of
 
01:44:22.189 --> 01:44:22.199 align:start position:0%
variation so let's get give employers
 
01:44:24.050 --> 01:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
more certainty
 
01:44:27.770 --> 01:44:27.780 align:start position:0%
um you know and that's in 2039 is when
 
01:44:30.169 --> 01:44:30.179 align:start position:0%
five of the 5.7 billion unfunded
 
01:44:31.970 --> 01:44:31.980 align:start position:0%
liability is scheduled to be paid down
 
01:44:31.980 --> 01:44:33.530 align:start position:0%
liability is scheduled to be paid down
so

01:44:33.530 --> 01:44:33.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:44:34.910 --> 01:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
um so that's where we're looking at is
 
01:44:43.070 --> 01:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:49.370 --> 01:44:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:51.709 --> 01:44:51.719 align:start position:0%
yes I I just
 
01:44:51.719 --> 01:44:52.310 align:start position:0%
yes I I just
um

01:44:52.310 --> 01:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:54.649 --> 01:44:54.659 align:start position:0%
in response to the question about the
 
01:44:56.930 --> 01:44:56.940 align:start position:0%
invest uh independent investment
 
01:44:59.510 --> 01:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
committee uh am I remembering correctly
 
01:45:02.770 --> 01:45:02.780 align:start position:0%
that that was recommended by the
 
01:45:06.950 --> 01:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
2007 decennial Commission
 
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
yes and and just for information of new
 
01:45:13.850 --> 01:45:13.860 align:start position:0%
members that group that meets every 10
 
01:45:17.870 --> 01:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
years does a very deep dive into all
 
01:45:21.290 --> 01:45:21.300 align:start position:0%
aspects of the system and looks at
 
01:45:24.950 --> 01:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
things such as the effectiveness of the
 
01:45:27.590 --> 01:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
investment committee and so forth thank
 
01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:28.310 align:start position:0%
investment committee and so forth thank
you

01:45:28.310 --> 01:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:45:30.590 --> 01:45:30.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative yeah but both
 
01:45:33.950 --> 01:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
uh the 2007 and 17 commission led to a
 
01:45:36.109 --> 01:45:36.119 align:start position:0%
number of legislative and enactments
 
01:45:37.270 --> 01:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
they weren't the exact rep
 
01:45:39.290 --> 01:45:39.300 align:start position:0%
recommendations of the committee in
 
01:45:41.629 --> 01:45:41.639 align:start position:0%
every sense but you know they were along
 
01:45:43.370 --> 01:45:43.380 align:start position:0%
the general theme and
 
01:45:45.770 --> 01:45:45.780 align:start position:0%
um you know they were pretty pretty
 
01:45:47.629 --> 01:45:47.639 align:start position:0%
positive improvements uh generally
 
01:45:47.639 --> 01:45:49.490 align:start position:0%
positive improvements uh generally
speaking

01:45:49.490 --> 01:45:49.500 align:start position:0%
speaking
 
01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:50.629 align:start position:0%
speaking
um

01:45:50.629 --> 01:45:50.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:50.639 --> 01:45:51.649 align:start position:0%
um
see

01:45:51.649 --> 01:45:51.659 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:45:54.109 --> 01:45:54.119 align:start position:0%
um Egypt just as a follow-up reference
 
01:45:55.729 --> 01:45:55.739 align:start position:0%
to the investment committee all of the
 
01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
folks that we have now on the investment
 
01:46:00.470 --> 01:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
are volunteers in our compensated
 
01:46:02.750 --> 01:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
um for that other than for mileage uh
 
01:46:04.970 --> 01:46:04.980 align:start position:0%
you know in lunch when they meet so
 
01:46:09.229 --> 01:46:09.239 align:start position:0%
um we're um you know and they're all in
 
01:46:11.030 --> 01:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
wealth management or Investments are
 
01:46:13.669 --> 01:46:13.679 align:start position:0%
retired from those fields
 
01:46:15.649 --> 01:46:15.659 align:start position:0%
um so I only have a couple slides left
 
01:46:17.450 --> 01:46:17.460 align:start position:0%
and then Jane only has a few as well but
 
01:46:19.970 --> 01:46:19.980 align:start position:0%
legislation obviously what we're here
 
01:46:19.980 --> 01:46:21.350 align:start position:0%
legislation obviously what we're here
for

01:46:21.350 --> 01:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
um last year uh well the last three
 
01:46:25.669 --> 01:46:25.679 align:start position:0%
years 2021 there were 11 bills
 
01:46:27.890 --> 01:46:27.900 align:start position:0%
introduced related to nhrs in some way
 
01:46:31.129 --> 01:46:31.139 align:start position:0%
and one uh was enacted uh last year they
 
01:46:33.709 --> 01:46:33.719 align:start position:0%
were 13 and seven were enacted including
 
01:46:37.490 --> 01:46:37.500 align:start position:0%
one that was retained from 2021 uh this
 
01:46:39.169 --> 01:46:39.179 align:start position:0%
year last day I checked this morning
 
01:46:42.350 --> 01:46:42.360 align:start position:0%
there were 20 lsrs listed relating to
 
01:46:44.629 --> 01:46:44.639 align:start position:0%
nhrs so that's when I say you're going
 
01:46:46.729 --> 01:46:46.739 align:start position:0%
to be sick of me in two or three weeks
 
01:46:48.350 --> 01:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
um you will because it'll be here quite
 
01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
a bit uh testifying or answering
 
01:46:53.689 --> 01:46:53.699 align:start position:0%
questions on those bills since 2007 that
 
01:46:56.090 --> 01:46:56.100 align:start position:0%
that magical year again we've tracked
 
01:46:57.830 --> 01:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
more than 100 changes to the statute
 
01:47:01.729 --> 01:47:01.739 align:start position:0%
since 2007 some extremely significant
 
01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
member contributions employer
 
01:47:06.410 --> 01:47:06.420 align:start position:0%
contributions benefits and some more
 
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
um cleanup or clarification things like
 
01:47:11.689 --> 01:47:11.699 align:start position:0%
that but you know cumulatively you know
 
01:47:14.209 --> 01:47:14.219 align:start position:0%
that those who keep us hopping typically
 
01:47:15.950 --> 01:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of these are
 
01:47:17.990 --> 01:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
represent the need to reprogram our
 
01:47:20.209 --> 01:47:20.219 align:start position:0%
systems change some of our materials
 
01:47:22.729 --> 01:47:22.739 align:start position:0%
things like that so so we we work hard
 
01:47:24.590 --> 01:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
to to get all that information out there
 
01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:26.209 align:start position:0%
to to get all that information out there
and

01:47:26.209 --> 01:47:26.219 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:28.189 --> 01:47:28.199 align:start position:0%
as a as a component unit of state
 
01:47:30.109 --> 01:47:30.119 align:start position:0%
government you know
 
01:47:32.450 --> 01:47:32.460 align:start position:0%
um nhrs isn't here to lie before or
 
01:47:35.090 --> 01:47:35.100 align:start position:0%
against any outcomes we feel that as you
 
01:47:37.370 --> 01:47:37.380 align:start position:0%
know as the plan sponsor the legislature
 
01:47:40.490 --> 01:47:40.500 align:start position:0%
makes policy decisions and we really
 
01:47:42.530 --> 01:47:42.540 align:start position:0%
just want to get the relevant facts in
 
01:47:45.050 --> 01:47:45.060 align:start position:0%
front of you so you have information to
 
01:47:48.290 --> 01:47:48.300 align:start position:0%
make sound reasonable decisions
 
01:47:50.090 --> 01:47:50.100 align:start position:0%
um you know the only time nhrs would
 
01:47:53.209 --> 01:47:53.219 align:start position:0%
take a position on a bill is if there's
 
01:47:55.669 --> 01:47:55.679 align:start position:0%
a concern that it violates the Internal
 
01:47:59.510 --> 01:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
Revenue code or would be challenged our
 
01:48:02.090 --> 01:48:02.100 align:start position:0%
fiduciary duty to act in solely in the
 
01:48:03.410 --> 01:48:03.420 align:start position:0%
best interests of the members and
 
01:48:03.420 --> 01:48:04.729 align:start position:0%
best interests of the members and
beneficiaries

01:48:04.729 --> 01:48:04.739 align:start position:0%
beneficiaries
 
01:48:06.590 --> 01:48:06.600 align:start position:0%
um as I mentioned last year briefly
 
01:48:08.750 --> 01:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
there was a bill about China divestment
 
01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
and the board actually opposed that on
 
01:48:14.209 --> 01:48:14.219 align:start position:0%
fiduciary grounds not so much on the
 
01:48:16.430 --> 01:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
merits or or certainly not on the merits
 
01:48:18.050 --> 01:48:18.060 align:start position:0%
of the Chinese government and the way
 
01:48:19.729 --> 01:48:19.739 align:start position:0%
they treat their people but on the
 
01:48:22.570 --> 01:48:22.580 align:start position:0%
provision that you know we want to
 
01:48:25.070 --> 01:48:25.080 align:start position:0%
de-politicize or you know our investment
 
01:48:27.709 --> 01:48:27.719 align:start position:0%
decisions or keep them apolitical and
 
01:48:29.330 --> 01:48:29.340 align:start position:0%
just looking at you know what are the
 
01:48:31.729 --> 01:48:31.739 align:start position:0%
best investments for our
 
01:48:34.129 --> 01:48:34.139 align:start position:0%
um our membership in the universe of
 
01:48:35.810 --> 01:48:35.820 align:start position:0%
allowable you know investment
 
01:48:37.430 --> 01:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
performance because you know if you
 
01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:38.810 align:start position:0%
performance because you know if you
start

01:48:38.810 --> 01:48:38.820 align:start position:0%
start
 
01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
um sort of adding mandates on investing
 
01:48:43.250 --> 01:48:43.260 align:start position:0%
or divesting in different places you
 
01:48:45.350 --> 01:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
know legislatures change from session to
 
01:48:46.910 --> 01:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
session and you could be
 
01:48:49.310 --> 01:48:49.320 align:start position:0%
all of your um you know your long-term
 
01:48:51.050 --> 01:48:51.060 align:start position:0%
Investments could get get kind of tossed
 
01:48:52.970 --> 01:48:52.980 align:start position:0%
in a hopper so there's been sort of a
 
01:48:55.010 --> 01:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
steady those one of the few things that
 
01:48:56.930 --> 01:48:56.940 align:start position:0%
the boards have tended to consistently
 
01:48:59.209 --> 01:48:59.219 align:start position:0%
oppose there was a bill a few years back
 
01:49:01.310 --> 01:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
to stretch out paying off the liability
 
01:49:03.950 --> 01:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
longer that exposes us more with the
 
01:49:05.810 --> 01:49:05.820 align:start position:0%
board of pose that but generally I'm
 
01:49:07.609 --> 01:49:07.619 align:start position:0%
going to try to be you know Switzerland
 
01:49:09.290 --> 01:49:09.300 align:start position:0%
you know Joe Friday here when I'm
 
01:49:09.300 --> 01:49:10.790 align:start position:0%
you know Joe Friday here when I'm
testifying

01:49:10.790 --> 01:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
01:49:13.010 --> 01:49:13.020 align:start position:0%
um so that that's how we work we do have
 
01:49:14.930 --> 01:49:14.940 align:start position:0%
handouts on more of the complicated
 
01:49:16.609 --> 01:49:16.619 align:start position:0%
bills that we try to provide to the
 
01:49:18.290 --> 01:49:18.300 align:start position:0%
committee to supplement the fiscal note
 
01:49:19.910 --> 01:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
with a little bit of history and
 
01:49:21.109 --> 01:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
background those we call those Bill
 
01:49:24.470 --> 01:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
briefs so you'll see those from me as
 
01:49:28.250 --> 01:49:28.260 align:start position:0%
well and that's that's um yeah well one
 
01:49:30.830 --> 01:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
thing you'll notice is that we made some
 
01:49:33.830 --> 01:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
bad decisions in 1991 that we're still
 
01:49:36.530 --> 01:49:36.540 align:start position:0%
paying for because
 
01:49:38.990 --> 01:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
we didn't go back and look at them so
 
01:49:42.169 --> 01:49:42.179 align:start position:0%
that's one very good reason to Deep dive
 
01:49:45.109 --> 01:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
every now and then and if we did go to
 
01:49:47.689 --> 01:49:47.699 align:start position:0%
that Actuarial method I'm sure the board
 
01:49:50.270 --> 01:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
would be opposing it yeah there's a lot
 
01:49:52.250 --> 01:49:52.260 align:start position:0%
of if we knew now if we knew then what
 
01:49:53.510 --> 01:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
we knew now
 
01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:54.350 align:start position:0%
we knew now
um

01:49:54.350 --> 01:49:54.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:58.250 --> 01:49:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:00.350 --> 01:50:00.360 align:start position:0%
and I'll turn it back over to Gian shoes
 
01:50:02.209 --> 01:50:02.219 align:start position:0%
it has a couple of summary slides to tie
 
01:50:04.010 --> 01:50:04.020 align:start position:0%
it all up and and then we'll stay as
 
01:50:06.590 --> 01:50:06.600 align:start position:0%
long as you want for questions
 
01:50:08.750 --> 01:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Marty and I've been
 
01:50:10.070 --> 01:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
able to get the answer to the question
 
01:50:13.550 --> 01:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
on the Chinese Investments at this point
 
01:50:16.250 --> 01:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
um it we have a total of 47 million
 
01:50:19.189 --> 01:50:19.199 align:start position:0%
dollars in market value and that
 
01:50:19.199 --> 01:50:20.410 align:start position:0%
dollars in market value and that
represents

01:50:20.410 --> 01:50:20.420 align:start position:0%
represents
 
01:50:23.870 --> 01:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
2.57 percent of our non-us Equity
 
01:50:26.810 --> 01:50:26.820 align:start position:0%
Holdings which are 1.8 billion dollars
 
01:50:29.390 --> 01:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
so it's a very small fraction of our
 
01:50:31.850 --> 01:50:31.860 align:start position:0%
overall portfolio yes representative
 
01:50:33.890 --> 01:50:33.900 align:start position:0%
Fitzpatrick I'd just like to clarify
 
01:50:38.149 --> 01:50:38.159 align:start position:0%
that my question about investing in
 
01:50:38.159 --> 01:50:38.930 align:start position:0%
that my question about investing in
China

01:50:38.930 --> 01:50:38.940 align:start position:0%
China
 
01:50:42.530 --> 01:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
wasn't about politics it's just
 
01:50:45.830 --> 01:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
I I think that the current climate that
 
01:50:48.830 --> 01:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
we're in makes it a very risky
 
01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:50.270 align:start position:0%
we're in makes it a very risky
investment

01:50:50.270 --> 01:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
investment
 
01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:51.350 align:start position:0%
investment
so

01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:50:55.010 --> 01:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
well thank you for that concern and
 
01:50:57.709 --> 01:50:57.719 align:start position:0%
I'm very glad in that case that it's a
 
01:51:02.990 --> 01:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:05.149 --> 01:51:05.159 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um continue on
 
01:51:07.310 --> 01:51:07.320 align:start position:0%
page 30. and asmari said I'll try to do
 
01:51:09.649 --> 01:51:09.659 align:start position:0%
a very brief summary
 
01:51:11.629 --> 01:51:11.639 align:start position:0%
um as we've tried to show you today that
 
01:51:14.030 --> 01:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
we do provide a very modest pension
 
01:51:15.950 --> 01:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
benefit and the majority of those
 
01:51:18.470 --> 01:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
benefits that we pay stay in state and
 
01:51:21.229 --> 01:51:21.239 align:start position:0%
support our local economies we have a
 
01:51:23.450 --> 01:51:23.460 align:start position:0%
plan in place thanks to the legislature
 
01:51:26.030 --> 01:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
to pay down our unfunded liability so
 
01:51:28.129 --> 01:51:28.139 align:start position:0%
we're eating the spinach as are our
 
01:51:31.609 --> 01:51:31.619 align:start position:0%
employers and it's it's working
 
01:51:33.649 --> 01:51:33.659 align:start position:0%
um the board has taken responsible steps
 
01:51:36.950 --> 01:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
to assure that the proper plan funding
 
01:51:39.850 --> 01:51:39.860 align:start position:0%
um by having a reasonable rate of return
 
01:51:43.010 --> 01:51:43.020 align:start position:0%
and continue to improve our funded ratio
 
01:51:46.310 --> 01:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:50.209 --> 01:51:50.219 align:start position:0%
page 31 this shows how our funded ratio
 
01:51:53.090 --> 01:51:53.100 align:start position:0%
compares to our peers we
 
01:51:55.189 --> 01:51:55.199 align:start position:0%
we have not yet received sufficient
 
01:51:57.590 --> 01:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
information to have this updated for FY
 
01:52:00.890 --> 01:52:00.900 align:start position:0%
22 but as you can see that we have been
 
01:52:03.169 --> 01:52:03.179 align:start position:0%
closely tracking although we have been
 
01:52:06.410 --> 01:52:06.420 align:start position:0%
below that of our peers but we are
 
01:52:07.850 --> 01:52:07.860 align:start position:0%
definitely trending in the right
 
01:52:10.669 --> 01:52:10.679 align:start position:0%
direction you can see that on page 31
 
01:52:13.189 --> 01:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
and then page 32
 
01:52:15.229 --> 01:52:15.239 align:start position:0%
um this to me is an incredibly
 
01:52:18.109 --> 01:52:18.119 align:start position:0%
fascinating slide because Maine our
 
01:52:21.229 --> 01:52:21.239 align:start position:0%
neighbor to the North and the East they
 
01:52:23.750 --> 01:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
were at the same place we were 10 years
 
01:52:26.090 --> 01:52:26.100 align:start position:0%
prior to when we started to deal with
 
01:52:28.609 --> 01:52:28.619 align:start position:0%
our unfunded liability and they have
 
01:52:31.850 --> 01:52:31.860 align:start position:0%
made enormous strides while having very
 
01:52:36.590 --> 01:52:36.600 align:start position:0%
similar demographics that we do similar
 
01:52:39.290 --> 01:52:39.300 align:start position:0%
number of active and retirees very
 
01:52:41.470 --> 01:52:41.480 align:start position:0%
similar average pension
 
01:52:45.129 --> 01:52:45.139 align:start position:0%
have similar constitutional requirements
 
01:52:48.229 --> 01:52:48.239 align:start position:0%
and also having a plan to fully pay off
 
01:52:50.270 --> 01:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability
 
01:52:54.530 --> 01:52:54.540 align:start position:0%
so you can see that there FY 22 funded
 
01:52:57.950 --> 01:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
ratio was just under 84 percent so I'm
 
01:52:59.570 --> 01:52:59.580 align:start position:0%
hoping in 10 years we're going to look a
 
01:53:02.390 --> 01:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
lot like this if not better
 
01:53:04.490 --> 01:53:04.500 align:start position:0%
page 33
 
01:53:07.490 --> 01:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
nhrs is a constitutional and statutory
 
01:53:09.470 --> 01:53:09.480 align:start position:0%
Foundation to protect its financial
 
01:53:12.410 --> 01:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
future we just need to keep staying on
 
01:53:14.390 --> 01:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
the path and going in the right
 
01:53:14.400 --> 01:53:16.850 align:start position:0%
the path and going in the right
direction

01:53:16.850 --> 01:53:16.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:19.370 --> 01:53:19.380 align:start position:0%
we are fortunate that our state has a
 
01:53:19.380 --> 01:53:21.890 align:start position:0%
we are fortunate that our state has a
constitutional

01:53:21.890 --> 01:53:21.900 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
01:53:23.990 --> 01:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
language that requires that the
 
01:53:26.870 --> 01:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
contribution rates be paid be paid by
 
01:53:28.910 --> 01:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
the employers and be actuarially sound
 
01:53:32.149 --> 01:53:32.159 align:start position:0%
most other states do not have this we're
 
01:53:34.310 --> 01:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
very fortunate here in New Hampshire
 
01:53:38.390 --> 01:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
and that our we periodically make
 
01:53:43.550 --> 01:53:43.560 align:start position:0%
changes to our retirement statutes as
 
01:53:46.689 --> 01:53:46.699 align:start position:0%
passed and enacted by the legislature
 
01:53:49.609 --> 01:53:49.619 align:start position:0%
and the because we've those changes have
 
01:53:51.229 --> 01:53:51.239 align:start position:0%
been made we're able to address the
 
01:53:52.850 --> 01:53:52.860 align:start position:0%
structural issues that Marty talked
 
01:53:53.990 --> 01:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
about earlier
 
01:53:57.050 --> 01:53:57.060 align:start position:0%
and just like any other serious Endeavor
 
01:53:59.629 --> 01:53:59.639 align:start position:0%
in life this is not going to be fixed in
 
01:54:01.490 --> 01:54:01.500 align:start position:0%
a week or a month this is truly a
 
01:54:04.189 --> 01:54:04.199 align:start position:0%
marathon but we have the stamina and the
 
01:54:07.609 --> 01:54:07.619 align:start position:0%
capacity to get us to 100 funding and so
 
01:54:09.470 --> 01:54:09.480 align:start position:0%
we thank you for your support in helping
 
01:54:10.669 --> 01:54:10.679 align:start position:0%
us get there
 
01:54:13.010 --> 01:54:13.020 align:start position:0%
and I apologize if we've gone over our
 
01:54:15.109 --> 01:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
allotted time but we appreciate all the
 
01:54:16.669 --> 01:54:16.679 align:start position:0%
questions and would be happy to answer
 
01:54:19.669 --> 01:54:19.679 align:start position:0%
any others well thank you the the
 
01:54:21.890 --> 01:54:21.900 align:start position:0%
questions are are important because we
 
01:54:23.390 --> 01:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
need to understand the system yes
 
01:54:26.629 --> 01:54:26.639 align:start position:0%
representative leckis thank you um so
 
01:54:28.310 --> 01:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
some of the slides are basically
 
01:54:29.870 --> 01:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
illegible due to the size I was
 
01:54:31.310 --> 01:54:31.320 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could send us like an
 
01:54:32.870 --> 01:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
electronic maybe a PDF or something
 
01:54:34.910 --> 01:54:34.920 align:start position:0%
format so if we want to zoom in on
 
01:54:37.430 --> 01:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
individual items thank you
 
01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:39.470 align:start position:0%
individual items thank you
yes

01:54:39.470 --> 01:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:41.810 align:start position:0%
yes
okay

01:54:41.810 --> 01:54:41.820 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:54:44.149 --> 01:54:44.159 align:start position:0%
all right I think we will close the
 
01:54:46.310 --> 01:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
formal part of the meeting if you have
 
01:54:49.010 --> 01:54:49.020 align:start position:0%
immediate questions I'm sure they'll be
 
01:54:51.530 --> 01:54:51.540 align:start position:0%
able to answer them we'll resume at one
 
01:54:54.050 --> 01:54:54.060 align:start position:0%
o'clock on the performance audit of the
 
01:54:55.970 --> 01:54:55.980 align:start position:0%
Dental Board
 
01:54:57.950 --> 01:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
and thank you all
 
01:54:57.960 --> 03:07:48.769 align:start position:0%
and thank you all
foreign

03:07:48.769 --> 03:07:48.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:51.050 --> 03:07:51.060 align:start position:0%
I think nearly everybody's back from
 
03:07:54.790 --> 03:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:57.290 --> 03:07:57.300 align:start position:0%
exactly representative Schmidt you're
 
03:08:00.969 --> 03:08:00.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:03.769 --> 03:08:03.779 align:start position:0%
I saw him walking out of the cafeteria
 
03:08:04.910 --> 03:08:04.920 align:start position:0%
so yes
 
03:08:04.920 --> 03:08:05.929 align:start position:0%
so yes
okay

03:08:05.929 --> 03:08:05.939 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:08:19.250 --> 03:08:19.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:20.870 --> 03:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
well good afternoon Madam chair members
 
03:08:22.130 --> 03:08:22.140 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record I'm
 
03:08:23.929 --> 03:08:23.939 align:start position:0%
Steve Smith I'm the director of audits
 
03:08:25.849 --> 03:08:25.859 align:start position:0%
for the office of legislative budget
 
03:08:25.859 --> 03:08:26.750 align:start position:0%
for the office of legislative budget
assistant

03:08:26.750 --> 03:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
assistant
 
03:08:30.410 --> 03:08:30.420 align:start position:0%
and with me is uh Steve Grady he was the
 
03:08:32.870 --> 03:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
senior in charge manager on the
 
03:08:35.750 --> 03:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
Dental examination report that he and he
 
03:08:37.910 --> 03:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
will present that but for the benefit of
 
03:08:39.469 --> 03:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
the committee just very quickly I'm just
 
03:08:42.290 --> 03:08:42.300 align:start position:0%
going to go over a quick overview of
 
03:08:44.030 --> 03:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
what a performance audit is and how we
 
03:08:48.110 --> 03:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
go about conducting a performance audit
 
03:08:48.120 --> 03:08:57.190 align:start position:0%
go about conducting a performance audit
um

03:08:57.190 --> 03:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:01.010 --> 03:09:01.020 align:start position:0%
how many people don't have
 
03:09:03.830 --> 03:09:03.840 align:start position:0%
do you have them we also brought some
 
03:09:06.610 --> 03:09:06.620 align:start position:0%
full box in the in the committee office
 
03:09:09.590 --> 03:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
and some people uh browse through them
 
03:09:17.690 --> 03:09:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:17.700 --> 03:09:22.969 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:09:22.969 --> 03:09:22.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:25.610 --> 03:09:25.620 align:start position:0%
thank you for for waiting
 
03:09:26.990 --> 03:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:09:27.000 --> 03:09:29.510 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

03:09:29.510 --> 03:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:31.370 --> 03:09:31.380 align:start position:0%
so when we talk about performance audits
 
03:09:33.429 --> 03:09:33.439 align:start position:0%
as the name
 
03:09:36.110 --> 03:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
indicates we're assessing the
 
03:09:38.030 --> 03:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
performance of a department or an agency
 
03:09:40.790 --> 03:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
or program it differs from a financial
 
03:09:42.950 --> 03:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
audit which our office also does where
 
03:09:44.330 --> 03:09:44.340 align:start position:0%
we are auditing a set of financial
 
03:09:46.730 --> 03:09:46.740 align:start position:0%
statements or a set a set of financial
 
03:09:49.190 --> 03:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
transactions or the controls around
 
03:09:51.349 --> 03:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
Financial transactions
 
03:09:53.750 --> 03:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
so this focuses on a performance audit
 
03:09:56.269 --> 03:09:56.279 align:start position:0%
which is the report before you so
 
03:10:00.230 --> 03:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
performance audits we you know things
 
03:10:01.670 --> 03:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
that we consider the extent to which
 
03:10:04.610 --> 03:10:04.620 align:start position:0%
expected results established by you the
 
03:10:07.610 --> 03:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
legislature were achieved the
 
03:10:09.769 --> 03:10:09.779 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of agencies or programs or
 
03:10:09.779 --> 03:10:10.969 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of agencies or programs or
functions

03:10:10.969 --> 03:10:10.979 align:start position:0%
functions
 
03:10:13.969 --> 03:10:13.979 align:start position:0%
and whether the The Entity under audit
 
03:10:16.910 --> 03:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
complied with laws and regulations
 
03:10:16.920 --> 03:10:17.929 align:start position:0%
complied with laws and regulations
um

03:10:17.929 --> 03:10:17.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:19.610 --> 03:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
typically we
 
03:10:22.250 --> 03:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
if I could sum it up the Effectiveness
 
03:10:25.070 --> 03:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
and efficiency of what the Oddity is
 
03:10:26.570 --> 03:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
doing and are they doing what they're
 
03:10:27.889 --> 03:10:27.899 align:start position:0%
supposed to be doing or could they be
 
03:10:29.870 --> 03:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
doing it better
 
03:10:33.110 --> 03:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
um the topics are provided to us by The
 
03:10:34.790 --> 03:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
Joint legislative
 
03:10:34.800 --> 03:10:35.510 align:start position:0%
Joint legislative
um

03:10:35.510 --> 03:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:37.010 --> 03:10:37.020 align:start position:0%
Performance Auto oversight committee
 
03:10:37.020 --> 03:10:38.870 align:start position:0%
Performance Auto oversight committee
lpaoc

03:10:38.870 --> 03:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
lpaoc
 
03:10:41.090 --> 03:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
so they give us the topics and we put
 
03:10:44.389 --> 03:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
them in our queue and as as uh staff and
 
03:10:49.790 --> 03:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
jobs cycle we We Begin an audit
 
03:10:51.349 --> 03:10:51.359 align:start position:0%
um usually an audit begins with an
 
03:10:53.210 --> 03:10:53.220 align:start position:0%
entrance meeting with the with the
 
03:10:55.490 --> 03:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
agency where we talk about the as we
 
03:10:58.849 --> 03:10:58.859 align:start position:0%
proceed the scope to be of the audit
 
03:10:58.859 --> 03:10:59.630 align:start position:0%
proceed the scope to be of the audit
um

03:10:59.630 --> 03:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:02.269 --> 03:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
logistical information and usually an
 
03:11:04.370 --> 03:11:04.380 align:start position:0%
initial request of information that we
 
03:11:07.210 --> 03:11:07.220 align:start position:0%
to allow us to begin to
 
03:11:09.590 --> 03:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine depending upon the
 
03:11:11.269 --> 03:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
topic there's a lot of Education that we
 
03:11:12.830 --> 03:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
have to go through we're not experts in
 
03:11:12.840 --> 03:11:13.670 align:start position:0%
have to go through we're not experts in
everything

03:11:13.670 --> 03:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
everything
 
03:11:15.410 --> 03:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
so depending upon what the department or
 
03:11:17.809 --> 03:11:17.819 align:start position:0%
or the The Entity under audit is we have
 
03:11:19.730 --> 03:11:19.740 align:start position:0%
to learn about what they do what the
 
03:11:21.290 --> 03:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
laws are around them things of that
 
03:11:21.300 --> 03:11:22.429 align:start position:0%
laws are around them things of that
nature

03:11:22.429 --> 03:11:22.439 align:start position:0%
nature
 
03:11:25.130 --> 03:11:25.140 align:start position:0%
and once once we do that we prepare
 
03:11:27.110 --> 03:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
what's called a scope statement which
 
03:11:29.389 --> 03:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
kind of outlines what we're going to
 
03:11:32.269 --> 03:11:32.279 align:start position:0%
look at kind of assemble a question you
 
03:11:34.670 --> 03:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
know how efficient how effective did
 
03:11:37.250 --> 03:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
ex-agency do this
 
03:11:38.630 --> 03:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:11:41.809 --> 03:11:41.819 align:start position:0%
um looking to kind of the methodology as
 
03:11:43.070 --> 03:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
to how we're going to go about doing
 
03:11:45.590 --> 03:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
that and we go back before the lpoc
 
03:11:48.230 --> 03:11:48.240 align:start position:0%
committee to make sure that what we
 
03:11:50.450 --> 03:11:50.460 align:start position:0%
intend to do is what they had envisioned
 
03:11:52.010 --> 03:11:52.020 align:start position:0%
so they approved that scope statement
 
03:11:54.830 --> 03:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
and then we take it from there and that
 
03:11:57.349 --> 03:11:57.359 align:start position:0%
allows us to develop an audit plan which
 
03:12:01.190 --> 03:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
is an internal document to us which sets
 
03:12:03.469 --> 03:12:03.479 align:start position:0%
out the audit objectives we refine the
 
03:12:06.889 --> 03:12:06.899 align:start position:0%
methodologies and assess risks things of
 
03:12:08.690 --> 03:12:08.700 align:start position:0%
that nature
 
03:12:10.429 --> 03:12:10.439 align:start position:0%
um so that's our planning document of
 
03:12:13.849 --> 03:12:13.859 align:start position:0%
how and what we plan to do on the topic
 
03:12:15.950 --> 03:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
and then we begin our our work our field
 
03:12:18.110 --> 03:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
work as we call it which can involve
 
03:12:21.250 --> 03:12:21.260 align:start position:0%
several interviews surveys
 
03:12:24.650 --> 03:12:24.660 align:start position:0%
examination of of information files
 
03:12:26.889 --> 03:12:26.899 align:start position:0%
documents things that the that the
 
03:12:31.190 --> 03:12:31.200 align:start position:0%
Oddity has to allow us to assess what
 
03:12:32.510 --> 03:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
they're doing
 
03:12:35.870 --> 03:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
and um and then based on the evidence
 
03:12:39.050 --> 03:12:39.060 align:start position:0%
and based on what we learn we if if we
 
03:12:41.210 --> 03:12:41.220 align:start position:0%
discover things that aren't happening
 
03:12:42.410 --> 03:12:42.420 align:start position:0%
the way they should or things are
 
03:12:44.389 --> 03:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
happening that shouldn't be happening
 
03:12:47.450 --> 03:12:47.460 align:start position:0%
out of compliance or or areas of
 
03:12:49.370 --> 03:12:49.380 align:start position:0%
improvement best practice things of that
 
03:12:51.349 --> 03:12:51.359 align:start position:0%
nature we develop what's called
 
03:12:53.030 --> 03:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
observations some people call them
 
03:12:54.889 --> 03:12:54.899 align:start position:0%
findings we prefer to call them
 
03:12:54.899 --> 03:12:56.210 align:start position:0%
findings we prefer to call them
observations

03:12:56.210 --> 03:12:56.220 align:start position:0%
observations
 
03:12:58.429 --> 03:12:58.439 align:start position:0%
and so there's a criteria that we follow
 
03:13:00.290 --> 03:13:00.300 align:start position:0%
to develop those
 
03:13:04.730 --> 03:13:04.740 align:start position:0%
and they all get put into a report along
 
03:13:07.550 --> 03:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
with background information to allow the
 
03:13:10.250 --> 03:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
reader to know about the the Oddity
 
03:13:11.870 --> 03:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
under audit
 
03:13:14.570 --> 03:13:14.580 align:start position:0%
and then we would draft that report we
 
03:13:16.790 --> 03:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
would give it to the Oddity and we
 
03:13:19.010 --> 03:13:19.020 align:start position:0%
request responses to our observations
 
03:13:20.990 --> 03:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
and responses to our recommendations
 
03:13:22.790 --> 03:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
that we're making
 
03:13:24.950 --> 03:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
and that
 
03:13:27.170 --> 03:13:27.180 align:start position:0%
can go from anywhere from three weeks to
 
03:13:29.450 --> 03:13:29.460 align:start position:0%
several months depending upon the the
 
03:13:32.570 --> 03:13:32.580 align:start position:0%
agency under under audit
 
03:13:34.730 --> 03:13:34.740 align:start position:0%
um and then once we get those responses
 
03:13:38.929 --> 03:13:38.939 align:start position:0%
back we assess them make sure that
 
03:13:41.030 --> 03:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
they uh
 
03:13:42.769 --> 03:13:42.779 align:start position:0%
depending upon the level of concurrence
 
03:13:44.510 --> 03:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
if they totally disagree or they don't
 
03:13:46.849 --> 03:13:46.859 align:start position:0%
concur the observation we try to
 
03:13:48.950 --> 03:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
work with them to bring some level of
 
03:13:50.570 --> 03:13:50.580 align:start position:0%
concurrence there because sometimes
 
03:13:53.809 --> 03:13:53.819 align:start position:0%
they're just reading it wrong whatever
 
03:13:57.050 --> 03:13:57.060 align:start position:0%
and then once once we're comfortable
 
03:13:58.490 --> 03:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
with that we have what's called an exit
 
03:14:00.110 --> 03:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
meeting which is the final go through of
 
03:14:01.190 --> 03:14:01.200 align:start position:0%
the report
 
03:14:02.990 --> 03:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
and then the report is goes into
 
03:14:04.969 --> 03:14:04.979 align:start position:0%
production goes through our QC process
 
03:14:06.769 --> 03:14:06.779 align:start position:0%
and then eventually gets presented at
 
03:14:08.210 --> 03:14:08.220 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee
 
03:14:09.710 --> 03:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
and that's what we did with this report
 
03:14:13.550 --> 03:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
back in November and um
 
03:14:15.349 --> 03:14:15.359 align:start position:0%
after we presented the fiscal committees
 
03:14:17.210 --> 03:14:17.220 align:start position:0%
the report gets distributed to a variety
 
03:14:18.769 --> 03:14:18.779 align:start position:0%
of different people the chair gets one
 
03:14:22.550 --> 03:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
of Edna for example and after that
 
03:14:24.710 --> 03:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
if we could call back to like for
 
03:14:26.150 --> 03:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
example today to a committee to present
 
03:14:28.610 --> 03:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
it we're more than happy to do that so
 
03:14:30.950 --> 03:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
that's a very quick overview of the
 
03:14:32.690 --> 03:14:32.700 align:start position:0%
process hopefully that was
 
03:14:35.750 --> 03:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
um but but certainly as topics you
 
03:14:37.969 --> 03:14:37.979 align:start position:0%
become aware or have concerns our
 
03:14:40.370 --> 03:14:40.380 align:start position:0%
preferences as you go through the lpoc
 
03:14:43.010 --> 03:14:43.020 align:start position:0%
contact a member they have senators and
 
03:14:45.950 --> 03:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
representatives there and occasionally
 
03:14:48.230 --> 03:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
we get an audit that shows up in
 
03:14:50.389 --> 03:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
legislation for example the freedom
 
03:14:52.910 --> 03:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
accounts is on our to-do list but that
 
03:14:55.429 --> 03:14:55.439 align:start position:0%
won't happen until the fall because it's
 
03:14:56.809 --> 03:14:56.819 align:start position:0%
a fairly new
 
03:14:58.610 --> 03:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
new program
 
03:15:01.849 --> 03:15:01.859 align:start position:0%
but our preference is is not to have it
 
03:15:04.130 --> 03:15:04.140 align:start position:0%
in legislation because if it's in
 
03:15:06.290 --> 03:15:06.300 align:start position:0%
legislation now we're Bound by timelines
 
03:15:08.269 --> 03:15:08.279 align:start position:0%
and things of that nature and we don't
 
03:15:09.650 --> 03:15:09.660 align:start position:0%
the nature of what we do we don't like
 
03:15:11.630 --> 03:15:11.640 align:start position:0%
to be bound by a timeline or a deadline
 
03:15:13.910 --> 03:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
because once we begin an audit you never
 
03:15:15.830 --> 03:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
know where it's going to lead you and we
 
03:15:17.929 --> 03:15:17.939 align:start position:0%
want to be able to be as thorough and as
 
03:15:20.389 --> 03:15:20.399 align:start position:0%
as informative as we can be
 
03:15:24.590 --> 03:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
to to you folks our audience so any
 
03:15:26.510 --> 03:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
questions on that before I turn it over
 
03:15:29.150 --> 03:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:34.490 --> 03:15:34.500 align:start position:0%

performance audit the audit assessed how
 
03:15:44.990 --> 03:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
efficiently and effectively the board
 
03:15:46.790 --> 03:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
administered the regulation of dentistry
 
03:15:48.530 --> 03:15:48.540 align:start position:0%

03:15:53.330 --> 03:15:53.340 align:start position:0%
we also examined matters outside that

03:16:26.090 --> 03:16:26.100 align:start position:0%
our executive summary begins on page one
 
03:16:27.769 --> 03:16:27.779 align:start position:0%
there we conclude the board lacked
 
03:16:29.269 --> 03:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
adequate controls to ensure a
 
03:16:31.070 --> 03:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
consistently achieved expected outcomes
 
03:16:33.110 --> 03:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
and that it complied with requirements
 
03:16:34.969 --> 03:16:34.979 align:start position:0%
while doing so
 
03:16:36.830 --> 03:16:36.840 align:start position:0%
the board was expected to protect the
 
03:16:38.809 --> 03:16:38.819 align:start position:0%
public health safety and Welfare from
 
03:16:41.090 --> 03:16:41.100 align:start position:0%

however the board did not monitor its

achieve expected outcomes its regulatory
 
03:16:57.290 --> 03:16:57.300 align:start position:0%
program was largely subjective
 
03:16:58.790 --> 03:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
credentials were issued that did not
 
03:17:01.370 --> 03:17:01.380 align:start position:0%
meet statutory and other requirements
 
03:17:03.410 --> 03:17:03.420 align:start position:0%
credential holder qualification was
 
03:17:06.349 --> 03:17:06.359 align:start position:0%
ineffectively controlled and monitored
 
03:17:08.210 --> 03:17:08.220 align:start position:0%
Enforcement cases were inconsistently

managed and resolved
 
03:17:12.410 --> 03:17:12.420 align:start position:0%
the board lacked controls over its own

structured relationship between the two
 
03:17:38.630 --> 03:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
agencies limited effectiveness
 
03:17:40.250 --> 03:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
furthermore there was no accountability

delivery delivery was remedied
 
03:17:51.950 --> 03:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
records are poorly managed and controls

were poorly understood
 
03:17:55.570 --> 03:17:55.580 align:start position:0%
many board actions were unauditable
 
03:17:57.469 --> 03:17:57.479 align:start position:0%
consequently we were compelled to

engaged in ad hoc rulemaking
 
03:20:37.370 --> 03:20:37.380 align:start position:0%
an ad hoc rule was a requirement imposed
 
03:20:39.290 --> 03:20:39.300 align:start position:0%
on someone outside the board but which
 
03:20:41.269 --> 03:20:41.279 align:start position:0%
was not properly adopted and was
 
03:20:43.730 --> 03:20:43.740 align:start position:0%
consequently not legally enforceable
 
03:20:46.070 --> 03:20:46.080 align:start position:0%

03:21:15.590 --> 03:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
the board's only statutory subordinate
 
03:21:17.809 --> 03:21:17.819 align:start position:0%
entity had outlived its purpose and
 
03:21:20.750 --> 03:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
acted outside its statutory scope
 
03:21:22.670 --> 03:21:22.680 align:start position:0%
the board fabricated subordinate
 
03:21:24.590 --> 03:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
entities and improperly delegated
 
03:21:26.870 --> 03:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
substantive duties to them including
 
03:21:28.969 --> 03:21:28.979 align:start position:0%
regulating segments of the dental care
 
03:21:28.979 --> 03:21:30.349 align:start position:0%
regulating segments of the dental care
industry

03:21:30.349 --> 03:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
industry
 
03:21:32.389 --> 03:21:32.399 align:start position:0%
these extra legal entities were not
 
03:21:34.370 --> 03:21:34.380 align:start position:0%
actively controlled by the board
 
03:21:36.170 --> 03:21:36.180 align:start position:0%
they operated outside of State control
 
03:21:38.990 --> 03:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
and legislative and public oversight
 
03:21:40.550 --> 03:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
they inconsistently complied with
 
03:21:42.410 --> 03:21:42.420 align:start position:0%
transparency ethics and other
 
03:21:42.420 --> 03:21:44.450 align:start position:0%

03:21:46.070 --> 03:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
legislative suggestions include
 
03:21:48.050 --> 03:21:48.060 align:start position:0%
increasing the number of public board
 
03:21:49.610 --> 03:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
members while holding steady or
 
03:21:51.290 --> 03:21:51.300 align:start position:0%
decreasing the number of prudentialed
 
03:21:51.300 --> 03:21:52.130 align:start position:0%
decreasing the number of prudentialed

03:21:52.130 --> 03:21:52.140 align:start position:0%
members
 
03:21:54.410 --> 03:21:54.420 align:start position:0%
and ensuring authorized subordinate
 
03:21:56.150 --> 03:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
entities have an adequate number of
 
03:21:57.830 --> 03:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
public members
 
03:21:59.269 --> 03:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
board recommendations include
 
03:22:00.889 --> 03:22:00.899 align:start position:0%
discontinuing the operation of extra
 
03:22:03.290 --> 03:22:03.300 align:start position:0%
legal subordinate entities and actively
 
03:22:05.330 --> 03:22:05.340 align:start position:0%
controlling authorized subordinate
 
03:22:05.340 --> 03:22:09.110 align:start position:0%
controlling authorized subordinate
entities

03:22:09.110 --> 03:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:10.910 --> 03:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
the board routinely but improperly
 
03:22:12.769 --> 03:22:12.779 align:start position:0%
delegated its Collective discretionary
 
03:22:14.510 --> 03:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
decision-making Authority
 
03:22:18.469 --> 03:22:18.479 align:start position:0%
consequently yes ma'am excuse me when do
 
03:22:21.349 --> 03:22:21.359 align:start position:0%
you want questions at any time okay I
 
03:22:23.809 --> 03:22:23.819 align:start position:0%
believe we have one at least sorry
 
03:22:25.910 --> 03:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
no worries um can you give me an example
 
03:22:28.490 --> 03:22:28.500 align:start position:0%
of one of their subordinate entities uh
 
03:22:30.710 --> 03:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
what they do specifically they created
 
03:22:32.450 --> 03:22:32.460 align:start position:0%
what they called the Anastasia
 
03:22:34.070 --> 03:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
anesthesia and sedation evaluation
 
03:22:35.630 --> 03:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
committee and that committee was
 
03:22:37.250 --> 03:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
responsible for a number of things to
 
03:22:39.530 --> 03:22:39.540 align:start position:0%
include from developing Draft rules to
 
03:22:40.910 --> 03:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
propose to the board to regulate
 
03:22:43.070 --> 03:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
dentists anesthesia and sedation permits
 
03:22:45.790 --> 03:22:45.800 align:start position:0%
as well as the members conducting
 
03:22:48.349 --> 03:22:48.359 align:start position:0%
inspections and evaluation of applicants
 
03:22:48.359 --> 03:22:50.090 align:start position:0%
inspections and evaluation of applicants
and

03:22:50.090 --> 03:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:22:52.429 --> 03:22:52.439 align:start position:0%
consequently substantively regulating
 
03:22:55.010 --> 03:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
their behavior
 
03:22:58.130 --> 03:22:58.140 align:start position:0%
so ASAC isn't something that we approved
 
03:22:59.690 --> 03:22:59.700 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay thank you so they
 
03:23:03.950 --> 03:23:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:03.960 --> 03:23:04.910 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:23:04.910 --> 03:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:23:07.429 --> 03:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
and by rules in that context are these
 
03:23:09.410 --> 03:23:09.420 align:start position:0%
rules that were properly created through
 
03:23:11.510 --> 03:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
541a or did they just create their own
 
03:23:13.250 --> 03:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
rules and Implement them on their own
 
03:23:14.450 --> 03:23:14.460 align:start position:0%
without that
 
03:23:16.550 --> 03:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
they so there are a number of
 
03:23:19.130 --> 03:23:19.140 align:start position:0%
subordinated entities the asec itself
 
03:23:23.630 --> 03:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
was created via RSA 541a adopted rule a
 
03:23:26.210 --> 03:23:26.220 align:start position:0%
long time ago uh they also created
 
03:23:28.490 --> 03:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
without any rules uh an advisory
 
03:23:30.530 --> 03:23:30.540 align:start position:0%
subcommittee of that body so the board
 
03:23:32.570 --> 03:23:32.580 align:start position:0%
had engaged in creating these extra
 
03:23:34.429 --> 03:23:34.439 align:start position:0%
legal entities in a couple of different
 
03:23:34.439 --> 03:23:37.130 align:start position:0%
legal entities in a couple of different
ways

03:23:37.130 --> 03:23:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:38.690 --> 03:23:38.700 align:start position:0%
um did they
 
03:23:40.849 --> 03:23:40.859 align:start position:0%
and either the board itself or some of
 
03:23:43.250 --> 03:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
these entities created they actually put
 
03:23:45.889 --> 03:23:45.899 align:start position:0%
in place and enforce rules that were not
 
03:23:47.809 --> 03:23:47.819 align:start position:0%
did not go through the proper rulemaking
 
03:23:50.530 --> 03:23:50.540 align:start position:0%
process that's correct yes thank you
 
03:23:54.969 --> 03:23:54.979 align:start position:0%
represent Gerhard uh Madam chairman
 
03:23:58.370 --> 03:23:58.380 align:start position:0%
is the usual term sure
 
03:24:00.050 --> 03:24:00.060 align:start position:0%
um can you tell us what page you're
 
03:24:01.550 --> 03:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
going to only because I see you you're
 
03:24:03.229 --> 03:24:03.239 align:start position:0%
going through I have this black box with
 
03:24:05.690 --> 03:24:05.700 align:start position:0%
your face is no it's fine I'm just if
 
03:24:07.010 --> 03:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
you're just saying it was you know just
 
03:24:07.969 --> 03:24:07.979 align:start position:0%
I don't know just I can follow along
 
03:24:09.349 --> 03:24:09.359 align:start position:0%
better instead of just having it listen
 
03:24:10.729 --> 03:24:10.739 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:24:13.429 --> 03:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
okay represent goalie
 
03:24:16.130 --> 03:24:16.140 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair quick question
 
03:24:18.229 --> 03:24:18.239 align:start position:0%
does what happens
 
03:24:20.030 --> 03:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
or is there any recourse when these
 
03:24:21.710 --> 03:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
boards do this and go outside their
 
03:24:24.530 --> 03:24:24.540 align:start position:0%
scope of what they're there to do
 
03:24:26.090 --> 03:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
or is it something we should be looking
 
03:24:28.550 --> 03:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
into going further down the road it's
 
03:24:31.070 --> 03:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
something we should be looking into
 
03:24:33.530 --> 03:24:33.540 align:start position:0%
um I'd also while we're talking about it
 
03:24:35.330 --> 03:24:35.340 align:start position:0%
I'd like to mention that performance
 
03:24:39.309 --> 03:24:39.319 align:start position:0%
audits are not always well followed up
 
03:24:42.650 --> 03:24:42.660 align:start position:0%
and this one in particular
 
03:24:48.530 --> 03:24:48.540 align:start position:0%
I know that we are revising the statutes
 
03:24:50.750 --> 03:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
controlling the Dental Board and their
 
03:24:55.729 --> 03:24:55.739 align:start position:0%
relationship with the oplc so I wouldn't
 
03:24:57.969 --> 03:24:57.979 align:start position:0%
be worried about some of the issues
 
03:25:01.729 --> 03:25:01.739 align:start position:0%
creating subordinate entities is not a
 
03:25:05.269 --> 03:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
statutory problem but
 
03:25:08.090 --> 03:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
I don't expect us to take major action
 
03:25:11.269 --> 03:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
because we have statutory changes in
 
03:25:11.279 --> 03:25:12.769 align:start position:0%
because we have statutory changes in
process

03:25:12.769 --> 03:25:12.779 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:25:14.809 --> 03:25:14.819 align:start position:0%
but I think we should be aware of what's
 
03:25:18.050 --> 03:25:18.060 align:start position:0%
going on and what the board and the oplc
 
03:25:20.210 --> 03:25:20.220 align:start position:0%
are doing about it
 
03:25:23.630 --> 03:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
they may yeah I I mean I'm just going by
 
03:25:25.010 --> 03:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
listening to and it's troubling
 
03:25:26.870 --> 03:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
listening some of these ethics stuff
 
03:25:27.950 --> 03:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
that we're in here and there's some
 
03:25:29.450 --> 03:25:29.460 align:start position:0%
examples and a lot of other things in
 
03:25:31.250 --> 03:25:31.260 align:start position:0%
there that are very troubling to hear
 
03:25:34.190 --> 03:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
from that is going on in a board uh yes
 
03:25:35.929 --> 03:25:35.939 align:start position:0%
I agree
 
03:25:38.570 --> 03:25:38.580 align:start position:0%
um I think we will ask
 
03:25:41.510 --> 03:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
so PLC what we can do about board
 
03:25:44.690 --> 03:25:44.700 align:start position:0%
members who will are in that situation I
 
03:25:48.650 --> 03:25:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:50.750 --> 03:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
thank you another quick representative
 
03:25:50.760 --> 03:25:52.250 align:start position:0%
thank you another quick representative
Schmidt

03:25:52.250 --> 03:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
Schmidt
 
03:25:54.290 --> 03:25:54.300 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:25:56.929 --> 03:25:56.939 align:start position:0%
so do we have anybody from the boat here
 
03:25:56.939 --> 03:25:58.130 align:start position:0%
so do we have anybody from the boat here
today

03:25:58.130 --> 03:25:58.140 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:25:59.870 --> 03:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
board has been invited and they are
 
03:26:01.790 --> 03:26:01.800 align:start position:0%
expected to show up approximately 2 p.m
 
03:26:05.269 --> 03:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:07.510 --> 03:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
03:26:09.710 --> 03:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
and a lot of the stuff you're talking
 
03:26:12.410 --> 03:26:12.420 align:start position:0%
about is outside the scope of practice
 
03:26:17.630 --> 03:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:20.750 --> 03:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
yes when we draw conclusions about
 
03:26:22.610 --> 03:26:22.620 align:start position:0%
something being extra legal or extra
 
03:26:24.469 --> 03:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional and it is outside what
 
03:26:26.510 --> 03:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
has clearly been delineated in statute
 
03:26:28.309 --> 03:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
as something that the Dental Board in
 
03:26:30.769 --> 03:26:30.779 align:start position:0%
this case should be engaging in and did
 
03:26:32.809 --> 03:26:32.819 align:start position:0%
you compare the things that they were
 
03:26:34.610 --> 03:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
doing aside from the fact whether what
 
03:26:36.769 --> 03:26:36.779 align:start position:0%
they're doing is legal or not I'm
 
03:26:39.950 --> 03:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
suspending any judgment about that but
 
03:26:42.650 --> 03:26:42.660 align:start position:0%
but is what they were doing is this in
 
03:26:45.830 --> 03:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
line with what's Dental practices doings
 
03:26:48.710 --> 03:26:48.720 align:start position:0%
Nationwide or in in New England or
 
03:26:51.290 --> 03:26:51.300 align:start position:0%
something like that this is whole cloth
 
03:26:53.210 --> 03:26:53.220 align:start position:0%
on their part
 
03:26:57.050 --> 03:26:57.060 align:start position:0%
um but it is it consistent with
 
03:26:59.870 --> 03:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
um any Dental trends that you're aware
 
03:27:01.670 --> 03:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
of that you could compare
 
03:27:04.429 --> 03:27:04.439 align:start position:0%
some of the things that we observed for
 
03:27:06.349 --> 03:27:06.359 align:start position:0%
example some of the credentials that
 
03:27:08.450 --> 03:27:08.460 align:start position:0%
lack statutory basis in New Hampshire
 
03:27:12.349 --> 03:27:12.359 align:start position:0%
law are something that other states will
 
03:27:15.650 --> 03:27:15.660 align:start position:0%
allow for in statute for their board to
 
03:27:18.110 --> 03:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
regulate so it's not beyond the realm of
 
03:27:18.120 --> 03:27:19.510 align:start position:0%
regulate so it's not beyond the realm of
plausibility

03:27:19.510 --> 03:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
plausibility
 
03:27:22.670 --> 03:27:22.680 align:start position:0%
however the concerns that we number one
 
03:27:24.830 --> 03:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
arrive at are that they'd lack statutory
 
03:27:27.349 --> 03:27:27.359 align:start position:0%
authority to do it in many cases for
 
03:27:29.450 --> 03:27:29.460 align:start position:0%
example creating a credential on their
 
03:27:31.370 --> 03:27:31.380 align:start position:0%
own the board is actually prohibited
 
03:27:34.670 --> 03:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
from doing that in RSA 541a uh and other
 
03:27:36.410 --> 03:27:36.420 align:start position:0%
things as well as creating you know
 
03:27:38.269 --> 03:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
their own subordinate entities out of
 
03:27:41.330 --> 03:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
out of thin air if you will um is also a
 
03:27:42.590 --> 03:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
Prohibition that they're they're not
 
03:27:44.269 --> 03:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
allowed to do so
 
03:27:46.190 --> 03:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
um that some of the things are plausibly
 
03:27:49.849 --> 03:27:49.859 align:start position:0%
useful uh we don't question that but
 
03:27:51.650 --> 03:27:51.660 align:start position:0%
they certainly did not follow proper
 
03:27:53.809 --> 03:27:53.819 align:start position:0%
procedures nor did they typically
 
03:27:56.750 --> 03:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
objectively establish that those
 
03:27:58.670 --> 03:27:58.680 align:start position:0%
credentials or those entities were
 
03:28:00.830 --> 03:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
needed in order for them to successfully
 
03:28:02.990 --> 03:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
regulate dentistry in the state a
 
03:28:05.929 --> 03:28:05.939 align:start position:0%
follow-up question follow up so and
 
03:28:08.630 --> 03:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
during this time frame speaking as a
 
03:28:11.150 --> 03:28:11.160 align:start position:0%
member of the gel car for the last 16
 
03:28:14.150 --> 03:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
years and representative McGuire the
 
03:28:17.809 --> 03:28:17.819 align:start position:0%
chair has been on the jail car for eight
 
03:28:21.170 --> 03:28:21.180 align:start position:0%
or ten of those years so so did they did
 
03:28:22.910 --> 03:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
the boat appear before the jail card
 
03:28:25.610 --> 03:28:25.620 align:start position:0%
during this time frame at all and
 
03:28:27.710 --> 03:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
present any of these
 
03:28:30.469 --> 03:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
so changes right so the last major
 
03:28:33.010 --> 03:28:33.020 align:start position:0%
update to the board's rules were in 2017
 
03:28:36.349 --> 03:28:36.359 align:start position:0%
there were some updates in 2018 and 2020
 
03:28:39.349 --> 03:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
they do not directly affect the things
 
03:28:40.969 --> 03:28:40.979 align:start position:0%
that we're discussing and expressing
 
03:28:42.590 --> 03:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
concerns with respect to being extra
 
03:28:44.210 --> 03:28:44.220 align:start position:0%
legal or extra jurisdiction although
 
03:28:45.729 --> 03:28:45.739 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:28:47.510 --> 03:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:28:51.530 --> 03:28:51.540 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much absolutely
 
03:28:53.750 --> 03:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
picking up on page 57 the board
 
03:28:55.969 --> 03:28:55.979 align:start position:0%
routinely but improperly delegated his
 
03:28:57.469 --> 03:28:57.479 align:start position:0%
Collective discretionary decision-making
 
03:29:00.349 --> 03:29:00.359 align:start position:0%
Authority consequently over 97 percent
 
03:29:02.030 --> 03:29:02.040 align:start position:0%
of initial licenses were issued either
 
03:29:04.630 --> 03:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
before or without board action
 
03:29:07.070 --> 03:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
99.9 percent of credentials were renewed
 
03:29:09.349 --> 03:29:09.359 align:start position:0%
without board action some complaints
 
03:29:11.929 --> 03:29:11.939 align:start position:0%
were acted upon without board control
 
03:29:13.790 --> 03:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
and some investigations were conducted
 
03:29:16.190 --> 03:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
and some cases closes without a record
 
03:29:18.410 --> 03:29:18.420 align:start position:0%
of board Direction
 
03:29:20.269 --> 03:29:20.279 align:start position:0%
also the board lacked a performance
 
03:29:22.610 --> 03:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
management system to help evaluate its
 
03:29:24.349 --> 03:29:24.359 align:start position:0%
performance or objectively demonstrate
 
03:29:26.929 --> 03:29:26.939 align:start position:0%
it achieved expected outcomes
 
03:29:28.550 --> 03:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
our recommendations here include the
 
03:29:30.889 --> 03:29:30.899 align:start position:0%
board and oplc detailing their
 
03:29:32.570 --> 03:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
relationship in rules
 
03:29:34.849 --> 03:29:34.859 align:start position:0%
if they cannot or will not do so timely
 
03:29:37.010 --> 03:29:37.020 align:start position:0%
we suggest the legislature consider
 
03:29:38.990 --> 03:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
either requiring adoption of integrated
 
03:29:42.110 --> 03:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
Rules by a specific date or detailing
 
03:29:45.170 --> 03:29:45.180 align:start position:0%
their interrelationship in statute
 
03:29:47.870 --> 03:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
I I will I will mention there was a
 
03:29:50.330 --> 03:29:50.340 align:start position:0%
study committee on the relationship of
 
03:29:54.769 --> 03:29:54.779 align:start position:0%
oplc to boards in general and there is a
 
03:29:57.349 --> 03:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
major rewrite of the statutory
 
03:30:01.370 --> 03:30:01.380 align:start position:0%
connection between boards and oplc that
 
03:30:03.170 --> 03:30:03.180 align:start position:0%
we will be considering later this term
 
03:30:03.180 --> 03:30:04.849 align:start position:0%
we will be considering later this term
so

03:30:04.849 --> 03:30:04.859 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:30:08.090 --> 03:30:08.100 align:start position:0%
we that issue is understood and maybe
 
03:30:10.370 --> 03:30:10.380 align:start position:0%
not solved but didn't work
 
03:30:12.229 --> 03:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
very good
 
03:30:14.110 --> 03:30:14.120 align:start position:0%
other board recommendations include
 
03:30:15.950 --> 03:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
discontinuing the delegation of
 
03:30:18.410 --> 03:30:18.420 align:start position:0%
discretionary Authority discontinuing
 
03:30:20.030 --> 03:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
the delegation of other authority
 
03:30:22.490 --> 03:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
without effective controls ensuring
 
03:30:23.990 --> 03:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
delegated tasks are properly
 
03:30:26.150 --> 03:30:26.160 align:start position:0%
accomplished and improving performance
 
03:30:29.450 --> 03:30:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:32.809 --> 03:30:32.819 align:start position:0%
the oplc beginning on page 75 describes
 
03:30:35.389 --> 03:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
oplc control's adversely affecting board
 
03:30:35.399 --> 03:30:37.130 align:start position:0%
oplc control's adversely affecting board
operations

03:30:37.130 --> 03:30:37.140 align:start position:0%
operations
 
03:30:39.889 --> 03:30:39.899 align:start position:0%
the oplc's organization and controls
 
03:30:41.809 --> 03:30:41.819 align:start position:0%
have been in flux since its Creation in
 
03:30:41.819 --> 03:30:43.910 align:start position:0%
have been in flux since its Creation in
2015.

03:30:43.910 --> 03:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
2015.
 
03:30:46.309 --> 03:30:46.319 align:start position:0%
no cohesive control framework existed to
 
03:30:49.370 --> 03:30:49.380 align:start position:0%
ensure duties delegated to the oplc were
 
03:30:52.130 --> 03:30:52.140 align:start position:0%
only administrative in nature oplc
 
03:30:53.990 --> 03:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
provided Services met assigned agencies
 
03:30:56.750 --> 03:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
needs and the oplc was accountable for
 
03:30:56.760 --> 03:30:58.250 align:start position:0%
needs and the oplc was accountable for
performance

03:30:58.250 --> 03:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
performance
 
03:31:00.469 --> 03:31:00.479 align:start position:0%
no Performance Management System existed
 
03:31:02.389 --> 03:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate the oplc achieved
 
03:31:04.309 --> 03:31:04.319 align:start position:0%
expected outcomes
 
03:31:06.530 --> 03:31:06.540 align:start position:0%
cost accounting was inadequate and the
 
03:31:08.510 --> 03:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
actual costs of services provided to
 
03:31:09.950 --> 03:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
assigned agencies could not be
 
03:31:09.960 --> 03:31:11.330 align:start position:0%
assigned agencies could not be
established

03:31:11.330 --> 03:31:11.340 align:start position:0%
established
 
03:31:13.070 --> 03:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
fee setting and administration were
 
03:31:13.080 --> 03:31:14.210 align:start position:0%
fee setting and administration were
inadequate

03:31:14.210 --> 03:31:14.220 align:start position:0%
inadequate
 
03:31:16.389 --> 03:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
leading to unrecovered costs
 
03:31:18.530 --> 03:31:18.540 align:start position:0%
unauthorized and gratuitous fees being
 
03:31:20.690 --> 03:31:20.700 align:start position:0%
charged and non-compliance with the
 
03:31:22.670 --> 03:31:22.680 align:start position:0%
requirement the board collect 125
 
03:31:25.750 --> 03:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
percent of its direct costs
 
03:31:28.130 --> 03:31:28.140 align:start position:0%
unresolved untimely resolved and
 
03:31:30.469 --> 03:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
temporarily resolved control defects
 
03:31:32.809 --> 03:31:32.819 align:start position:0%
identified in Prior audits contributed
 
03:31:34.790 --> 03:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
to ongoing and in some cases worsening
 
03:31:34.800 --> 03:31:36.769 align:start position:0%
to ongoing and in some cases worsening
deficiencies

03:31:36.769 --> 03:31:36.779 align:start position:0%
deficiencies
 
03:31:39.050 --> 03:31:39.060 align:start position:0%
many control defects we identified may
 
03:31:41.389 --> 03:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
also affect the other 50 odd agencies
 
03:31:45.050 --> 03:31:45.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:46.729 --> 03:31:46.739 align:start position:0%
legislative suggestions include
 
03:31:48.769 --> 03:31:48.779 align:start position:0%
clarifying oplc roles and
 
03:31:51.349 --> 03:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
responsibilities structuring interagency
 
03:31:53.750 --> 03:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
accountability and either continuing to
 
03:31:55.670 --> 03:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
regulate occupations using bodies like
 
03:31:57.950 --> 03:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
the board or migrating regulatory
 
03:31:59.990 --> 03:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
authority to administrative agency like
 
03:32:02.210 --> 03:32:02.220 align:start position:0%
the oplc
 
03:32:05.330 --> 03:32:05.340 align:start position:0%
oplc recommendations include developing
 
03:32:07.130 --> 03:32:07.140 align:start position:0%
a well-designed system of controls to
 
03:32:09.410 --> 03:32:09.420 align:start position:0%
optimize performance ensuring it
 
03:32:11.990 --> 03:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
complies with requirements stabilizing
 
03:32:13.490 --> 03:32:13.500 align:start position:0%
its organization
 
03:32:14.990 --> 03:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
implementing an effective cost
 
03:32:16.550 --> 03:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
accounting system
 
03:32:18.229 --> 03:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
improving customer service and
 
03:32:18.239 --> 03:32:19.610 align:start position:0%
improving customer service and
accountability

03:32:19.610 --> 03:32:19.620 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
03:32:21.889 --> 03:32:21.899 align:start position:0%
and ensuring audit findings are timely
 
03:32:24.530 --> 03:32:24.540 align:start position:0%
and durably remediated
 
03:32:26.330 --> 03:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
board recommendations include improving
 
03:32:32.450 --> 03:32:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:35.750 --> 03:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
chapter 2 starting on page 117 addresses
 
03:32:41.510 --> 03:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:43.670 --> 03:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
the regulatory program encompassed the
 
03:32:46.490 --> 03:32:46.500 align:start position:0%
board's three functions however it
 
03:32:48.290 --> 03:32:48.300 align:start position:0%
lacked a structured evidence and
 
03:32:50.630 --> 03:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
risk-based approach to rationalizing
 
03:32:52.250 --> 03:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
implementing and administering State
 
03:32:54.830 --> 03:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
policy and structuring its regulatory
 
03:32:54.840 --> 03:32:55.849 align:start position:0%
policy and structuring its regulatory
program

03:32:55.849 --> 03:32:55.859 align:start position:0%
program

consequently its regulatory program was
 
03:32:59.990 --> 03:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
largely subjective and contained
 
03:33:00.000 --> 03:33:01.969 align:start position:0%
largely subjective and contained
inconsistencies

03:33:01.969 --> 03:33:01.979 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies
 
03:33:04.130 --> 03:33:04.140 align:start position:0%
there were several potential barriers to
 
03:33:06.110 --> 03:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
entry and credential portability was
 
03:33:06.120 --> 03:33:07.790 align:start position:0%
entry and credential portability was
inadequate

03:33:07.790 --> 03:33:07.800 align:start position:0%
inadequate
 
03:33:10.250 --> 03:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
participation in certain occupations was
 
03:33:12.170 --> 03:33:12.180 align:start position:0%
inappropriately Limited
 
03:33:14.150 --> 03:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
licensees of other boards were
 
03:33:16.250 --> 03:33:16.260 align:start position:0%
improperly regulated
 
03:33:18.290 --> 03:33:18.300 align:start position:0%
aspects of dental practice were not
 
03:33:21.290 --> 03:33:21.300 align:start position:0%
regulated as required by Statute
 
03:33:23.510 --> 03:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
controls are often Reliant upon ad hoc
 
03:33:27.469 --> 03:33:27.479 align:start position:0%
rules and extra legal credentials
 
03:33:30.110 --> 03:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
board recommendations include developing
 
03:33:32.269 --> 03:33:32.279 align:start position:0%

03:33:39.469 --> 03:33:39.479 align:start position:0%
effectively regulated
 
03:33:41.389 --> 03:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
in discontinuing regulations without
 
03:33:43.969 --> 03:33:43.979 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority and perfunctory
 
03:33:49.070 --> 03:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:53.030 --> 03:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
chapter 3 begins on page 141.
 
03:33:54.889 --> 03:33:54.899 align:start position:0%
credentialing was intended to ensure
 
03:33:56.630 --> 03:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
individuals wishing wishing to practice
 
03:33:58.729 --> 03:33:58.739 align:start position:0%
in the state were qualified however
 
03:34:00.650 --> 03:34:00.660 align:start position:0%
controls were inadequate and practices
 
03:34:03.650 --> 03:34:03.660 align:start position:0%
were inconsistent with requirements
 
03:34:05.450 --> 03:34:05.460 align:start position:0%
before issuing a credential the board
 
03:34:07.309 --> 03:34:07.319 align:start position:0%
was required to make a finding each
 
03:34:09.170 --> 03:34:09.180 align:start position:0%
applicant was qualified and that there
 
03:34:10.610 --> 03:34:10.620 align:start position:0%
were no circumstances that could be
 
03:34:12.229 --> 03:34:12.239 align:start position:0%
grounds for discipline
 
03:34:14.570 --> 03:34:14.580 align:start position:0%
however over 97 percent of initial
 
03:34:16.790 --> 03:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
licenses were issued before or without a
 
03:34:18.469 --> 03:34:18.479 align:start position:0%
board Act
 
03:34:20.450 --> 03:34:20.460 align:start position:0%
some credentials were issued based upon
 
03:34:22.070 --> 03:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
applications that did not comply with
 
03:34:22.080 --> 03:34:23.750 align:start position:0%

the scope and scale of dental assistant
 
03:34:52.370 --> 03:34:52.380 align:start position:0%
regulation was similar to licensure but
 
03:34:56.030 --> 03:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
lacked underpinning statutory Authority
 
03:34:58.490 --> 03:34:58.500 align:start position:0%
board recommendations include reviewing
 
03:34:59.929 --> 03:34:59.939 align:start position:0%
and approving applications before
 
03:35:03.110 --> 03:35:03.120 align:start position:0%

can demonstrate they if cost effectively
 
03:35:16.250 --> 03:35:16.260 align:start position:0%
achieve outcomes
 
03:35:17.750 --> 03:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
we also recommend they substantially
 
03:35:19.969 --> 03:35:19.979 align:start position:0%
revise dental assistant regulation to
 
03:35:25.429 --> 03:35:25.439 align:start position:0%

I'm sorry

madam chair
 
03:35:41.090 --> 03:35:41.100 align:start position:0%
just to let you know this is my first
 
03:35:44.030 --> 03:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
day on this committee
 
03:35:44.040 --> 03:35:47.990 align:start position:0%
day on this committee
licensure

03:35:47.990 --> 03:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:49.910 --> 03:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
somebody from out of state or in-state
 
03:35:54.410 --> 03:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
goes to the board and says I'm a dentist
 
03:35:57.170 --> 03:35:57.180 align:start position:0%
so they have licensure is them
 
03:35:59.809 --> 03:35:59.819 align:start position:0%
is somebody proving that like going back
 
03:36:01.910 --> 03:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
to their college or whatever
 
03:36:04.790 --> 03:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
proving all the steps that yes he's a
 
03:36:08.269 --> 03:36:08.279 align:start position:0%
dentist that and that's what wasn't done
 
03:36:10.910 --> 03:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
so yes credentialing is establishing
 
03:36:12.889 --> 03:36:12.899 align:start position:0%
that the applicant has the underpinning
 
03:36:15.370 --> 03:36:15.380 align:start position:0%
educational experience Etc
 
03:36:17.630 --> 03:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
under their belt so that they are
 
03:36:20.150 --> 03:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
reasonably qualified to engage in
 
03:36:23.710 --> 03:36:23.720 align:start position:0%
dentistry or dental hygiene and it was
 
03:36:27.769 --> 03:36:27.779 align:start position:0%
done but the board did not actually make
 
03:36:29.870 --> 03:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
the findings that it was required to by
 
03:36:32.450 --> 03:36:32.460 align:start position:0%
Statute so it was done perhaps it was
 
03:36:34.490 --> 03:36:34.500 align:start position:0%
done by an individual member of the
 
03:36:34.500 --> 03:36:35.210 align:start position:0%
done by an individual member of the
board

03:36:35.210 --> 03:36:35.220 align:start position:0%
board
 
03:36:36.950 --> 03:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
but not the whole board it may have been
 
03:36:39.769 --> 03:36:39.779 align:start position:0%
done by staff and referred over to the
 
03:36:43.490 --> 03:36:43.500 align:start position:0%
board just for approval or in some cases
 
03:36:45.469 --> 03:36:45.479 align:start position:0%
credentials were just issued without any
 
03:36:47.450 --> 03:36:47.460 align:start position:0%
board involvement whatsoever
 
03:36:53.570 --> 03:36:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:57.170 --> 03:36:57.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:58.849 --> 03:36:58.859 align:start position:0%
systematic compliance monitoring can
 
03:37:00.469 --> 03:37:00.479 align:start position:0%
help ensure ongoing qualification to
 
03:37:03.229 --> 03:37:03.239 align:start position:0%
practice however the board designed few
 
03:37:05.030 --> 03:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
proactive controls to help prevent
 
03:37:06.769 --> 03:37:06.779 align:start position:0%
adverse effects on the public
 
03:37:08.990 --> 03:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
instead it primarily relied upon
 
03:37:11.210 --> 03:37:11.220 align:start position:0%
reactive complaint-based controls that
 
03:37:14.690 --> 03:37:14.700 align:start position:0%
inherently followed an adverse effect
 
03:37:16.250 --> 03:37:16.260 align:start position:0%
board requirements that could have
 
03:37:18.050 --> 03:37:18.060 align:start position:0%
helped proactively achieve outcomes were
 
03:37:20.750 --> 03:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
ineffective and often perfunctory this
 
03:37:23.269 --> 03:37:23.279 align:start position:0%
included credential renewals 99.9
 
03:37:25.070 --> 03:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
percent of which occurred without a
 
03:37:26.510 --> 03:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
board action
 
03:37:28.309 --> 03:37:28.319 align:start position:0%
criminal history records checks which
 
03:37:30.410 --> 03:37:30.420 align:start position:0%
were not conducted for any of the 430
 
03:37:32.690 --> 03:37:32.700 align:start position:0%
initial licenses issued
 
03:37:34.729 --> 03:37:34.739 align:start position:0%
continuing education requirements which
 
03:37:37.550 --> 03:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
inconsistently ensured credential holder

03:37:45.650 --> 03:37:45.660 align:start position:0%
thank you um I'm not sure what you're
 
03:37:47.870 --> 03:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
reading I'm I can kind of follow where
 
03:37:50.150 --> 03:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
you are but is this something that's
 
03:37:51.530 --> 03:37:51.540 align:start position:0%
actually in here you're reading or do
 
03:37:52.849 --> 03:37:52.859 align:start position:0%
you have written testimony you could
 
03:37:54.429 --> 03:37:54.439 align:start position:0%
send to the committee
 
03:37:56.690 --> 03:37:56.700 align:start position:0%
I can provide the script that I'm
 
03:37:59.269 --> 03:37:59.279 align:start position:0%
reading from right I am not please yes
 
03:38:04.969 --> 03:38:04.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:06.769 --> 03:38:06.779 align:start position:0%

verification of compliance with other
 
03:38:10.309 --> 03:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
requirements typically rested solely
 
03:38:13.130 --> 03:38:13.140 align:start position:0%
upon credential holder attestations
 
03:38:15.050 --> 03:38:15.060 align:start position:0%
complaints were inconsistently resolved
 
03:38:16.670 --> 03:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
and record keeping was so poor that we
 
03:38:18.170 --> 03:38:18.180 align:start position:0%
could not reliably establish the board
 
03:38:20.510 --> 03:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
addressed all 109 complaints that it
 
03:38:20.520 --> 03:38:22.550 align:start position:0%
addressed all 109 complaints that it
received

03:38:22.550 --> 03:38:22.560 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair
 
03:39:13.550 --> 03:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
my question as I go through this is
 
03:39:15.290 --> 03:39:15.300 align:start position:0%
if you were to do a word check in here
 
03:39:20.150 --> 03:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:23.150 --> 03:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
in the report do you have any idea do I
 
03:39:26.630 --> 03:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
have any idea I do not have any idea on
 
03:39:28.190 --> 03:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
how many times an adequate appears in
 
03:39:31.130 --> 03:39:31.140 align:start position:0%
this report or words like it and then
 
03:39:34.190 --> 03:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
um follow on follow-up follow-up
 
03:39:34.200 --> 03:39:35.929 align:start position:0%
um follow on follow-up follow-up
question

03:39:35.929 --> 03:39:35.939 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:39:35.939 --> 03:39:37.070 align:start position:0%
question
um

03:39:37.070 --> 03:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:41.570 --> 03:39:41.580 align:start position:0%
when I was reviewing the report and the
 
03:39:44.630 --> 03:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
the response to the audit
 
03:39:47.090 --> 03:39:47.100 align:start position:0%
I was
 
03:39:49.370 --> 03:39:49.380 align:start position:0%
coming from in Aerospace and defense
 
03:39:51.170 --> 03:39:51.180 align:start position:0%
background when we go through any kind
 
03:39:54.349 --> 03:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
of audit you claim responsibility and
 
03:39:58.790 --> 03:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
you you take it and you fix it as I was
 
03:40:02.269 --> 03:40:02.279 align:start position:0%
reading through here there was just no
 
03:40:02.279 --> 03:40:04.130 align:start position:0%
reading through here there was just no
no

03:40:04.130 --> 03:40:04.140 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:40:04.140 --> 03:40:05.290 align:start position:0%
no
um

03:40:05.290 --> 03:40:05.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:07.670 --> 03:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility taken really in
 
03:40:12.769 --> 03:40:12.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:16.910 --> 03:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
on uh page B1 which is
 
03:40:16.920 --> 03:40:18.050 align:start position:0%
on uh page B1 which is
um

03:40:18.050 --> 03:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:20.510 --> 03:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
in the um in the
 
03:40:23.630 --> 03:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
addendums at the back of it so appendix
 
03:40:27.349 --> 03:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
B so I just wanted to make that comment
 
03:40:29.510 --> 03:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:40:33.410 --> 03:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
thank you any other question
 
03:40:36.590 --> 03:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:38.570 --> 03:40:38.580 align:start position:0%
some matters were not investigated but
 
03:40:40.309 --> 03:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
nonetheless dismissed
 
03:40:42.910 --> 03:40:42.920 align:start position:0%
some investigations were incomplete
 
03:40:44.750 --> 03:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
adjudicatory proceedings and hearings
 
03:40:47.870 --> 03:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
were inconsistently held or even pursued
 
03:40:50.030 --> 03:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
disciplinary processes and sanctions
 
03:40:52.370 --> 03:40:52.380 align:start position:0%
were inconsistent some sanctions were
 
03:40:54.650 --> 03:40:54.660 align:start position:0%
informal or unpublished
 
03:40:56.030 --> 03:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
compliance with sanctions was
 
03:40:58.429 --> 03:40:58.439 align:start position:0%
inconsistently monitored
 
03:41:00.290 --> 03:41:00.300 align:start position:0%
inadequate support contributed to many
 
03:41:02.030 --> 03:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
deficiencies as the board was largely
 
03:41:03.830 --> 03:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
relying upon other agencies to carry out
 
03:41:06.229 --> 03:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
enforcement related activities
 
03:41:08.389 --> 03:41:08.399 align:start position:0%
some matters were dismissed because of
 
03:41:10.309 --> 03:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
insufficient support not because the
 
03:41:11.990 --> 03:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
board had objectively established that
 
03:41:14.809 --> 03:41:14.819 align:start position:0%
non-compliance did not occur
 
03:41:16.849 --> 03:41:16.859 align:start position:0%
board recommendations include conducting
 
03:41:19.070 --> 03:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
required investigations holding required
 
03:41:21.349 --> 03:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
hearings monitoring case progress and
 
03:41:23.450 --> 03:41:23.460 align:start position:0%
timeliness and monitoring compliance
 
03:41:25.010 --> 03:41:25.020 align:start position:0%
with sanctions
 
03:41:27.229 --> 03:41:27.239 align:start position:0%
oplc recommendations include revising
 
03:41:32.330 --> 03:41:32.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:34.370 --> 03:41:34.380 align:start position:0%
current board members and oplc
 
03:41:35.870 --> 03:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
management did not create all the
 
03:41:38.150 --> 03:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
defective controls we identified
 
03:41:40.429 --> 03:41:40.439 align:start position:0%
many defects were long-standing
 
03:41:42.290 --> 03:41:42.300 align:start position:0%
neither were many of the defects unique
 
03:41:44.210 --> 03:41:44.220 align:start position:0%
to the board several prior audits
 
03:41:46.190 --> 03:41:46.200 align:start position:0%
identified similar inadequacies in the
 
03:41:47.870 --> 03:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
operations of other Regulatory Agencies
 
03:41:49.969 --> 03:41:49.979 align:start position:0%
before and after the creation of the
 
03:41:49.979 --> 03:41:51.530 align:start position:0%
before and after the creation of the
oplc

03:41:51.530 --> 03:41:51.540 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
03:41:53.150 --> 03:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
nonetheless current members and
 
03:41:54.290 --> 03:41:54.300 align:start position:0%
management were responsible for
 
03:41:56.570 --> 03:41:56.580 align:start position:0%
efficiency and effectiveness it will
 
03:41:57.769 --> 03:41:57.779 align:start position:0%
likely take several years to address
 
03:41:59.809 --> 03:41:59.819 align:start position:0%
this audit's recommendations and develop
 
03:42:01.550 --> 03:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
and Implement an effective regulatory
 
03:42:03.889 --> 03:42:03.899 align:start position:0%
program objectively shown to efficiently
 
03:42:06.290 --> 03:42:06.300 align:start position:0%
achieve expected results
 
03:42:08.570 --> 03:42:08.580 align:start position:0%
integration of border and oplc controls
 
03:42:10.370 --> 03:42:10.380 align:start position:0%
has reportedly begun
 
03:42:12.469 --> 03:42:12.479 align:start position:0%
however whether how and when the board
 
03:42:13.910 --> 03:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
will remediate other defects was
 
03:42:15.769 --> 03:42:15.779 align:start position:0%
inconsistently clear
 
03:42:18.170 --> 03:42:18.180 align:start position:0%
no relevant plans have been published
 
03:42:20.030 --> 03:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
the board inconsistently recognized
 
03:42:22.429 --> 03:42:22.439 align:start position:0%
limitations on its Authority it
 
03:42:23.750 --> 03:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
disagreed with the need to follow some
 
03:42:25.969 --> 03:42:25.979 align:start position:0%
fundamental State policy requirements
 
03:42:27.410 --> 03:42:27.420 align:start position:0%
consequently we suggest the general
 
03:42:29.030 --> 03:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
court consider how expanded oversight
 
03:42:30.530 --> 03:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
could help ensure the board effectively
 
03:42:32.750 --> 03:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
carries out State policy and complies
 
03:42:34.370 --> 03:42:34.380 align:start position:0%
with the limitations imposed upon it
 
03:42:36.290 --> 03:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
while doing so
 
03:42:38.030 --> 03:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
I want to thank you for the taking the
 
03:42:39.590 --> 03:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
time to allow us to speak here today if
 
03:42:40.790 --> 03:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
there are any further questions I'd be
 
03:42:50.030 --> 03:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:51.710 --> 03:42:51.720 align:start position:0%
I don't have a question I just want to
 
03:42:54.229 --> 03:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for an excellent report it was
 
03:42:56.990 --> 03:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
concise it was clear thank you for
 
03:43:01.190 --> 03:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
asking for the page numbers and
 
03:43:04.010 --> 03:43:04.020 align:start position:0%
thank you more than welcome
 
03:43:06.830 --> 03:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
yes I'm I'm sure that this is not going
 
03:43:09.889 --> 03:43:09.899 align:start position:0%
to be solved instantaneously
 
03:43:14.389 --> 03:43:14.399 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the auditors
 
03:43:17.510 --> 03:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much we
 
03:43:20.750 --> 03:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
we have both the oplc and a member of
 
03:43:25.010 --> 03:43:25.020 align:start position:0%
the dental board with us uh
 
03:43:26.929 --> 03:43:26.939 align:start position:0%
I think
 
03:43:29.630 --> 03:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
let's see what perhaps we'll hear from
 
03:43:31.010 --> 03:43:31.020 align:start position:0%
the board first
 
03:43:51.229 --> 03:43:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:53.030 --> 03:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair and members
 
03:43:55.790 --> 03:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
of the committee uh I'm Dr Punit kocher
 
03:43:57.050 --> 03:43:57.060 align:start position:0%
I'm the president of the New Hampshire
 
03:43:59.330 --> 03:43:59.340 align:start position:0%
Board of dental examiners and I'm joined
 
03:44:01.490 --> 03:44:01.500 align:start position:0%
by my fellow board member Dr Howard
 
03:44:01.500 --> 03:44:03.530 align:start position:0%
by my fellow board member Dr Howard
Ludington

03:44:03.530 --> 03:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
Ludington
 
03:44:07.070 --> 03:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
so you already had the report we'll take
 
03:44:07.080 --> 03:44:08.150 align:start position:0%
so you already had the report we'll take
questions

03:44:08.150 --> 03:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:44:12.110 --> 03:44:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:14.269 --> 03:44:14.279 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there will be questions I'm
 
03:44:17.389 --> 03:44:17.399 align:start position:0%
just curious what your plan is
 
03:44:19.670 --> 03:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
to address the I mean there's a large
 
03:44:21.469 --> 03:44:21.479 align:start position:0%
number of issues what's your plan to
 
03:44:23.570 --> 03:44:23.580 align:start position:0%
address the
 
03:44:25.969 --> 03:44:25.979 align:start position:0%
these concerns
 
03:44:29.450 --> 03:44:29.460 align:start position:0%
so we have already started uh We've
 
03:44:30.889 --> 03:44:30.899 align:start position:0%
started working on the recommendations
 
03:44:33.710 --> 03:44:33.720 align:start position:0%
regarding the anesthesia there is a bill
 
03:44:35.809 --> 03:44:35.819 align:start position:0%
that has already been proposed so that's
 
03:44:38.690 --> 03:44:38.700 align:start position:0%
I think in the yellow star stages
 
03:44:42.110 --> 03:44:42.120 align:start position:0%
so that's there we have this as a
 
03:44:43.849 --> 03:44:43.859 align:start position:0%
standing line item for every meeting
 
03:44:46.130 --> 03:44:46.140 align:start position:0%
this this report was just accepted in
 
03:44:48.530 --> 03:44:48.540 align:start position:0%
December so our first meeting was this
 
03:44:50.809 --> 03:44:50.819 align:start position:0%
morning we've identified issues that the
 
03:44:53.210 --> 03:44:53.220 align:start position:0%
board is already working on the hygiene
 
03:44:55.250 --> 03:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
committee has already been transferred
 
03:44:57.769 --> 03:44:57.779 align:start position:0%
the issues concerning the hygiene rules
 
03:44:58.969 --> 03:44:58.979 align:start position:0%
so they're going to start looking on
 
03:45:00.769 --> 03:45:00.779 align:start position:0%
that and then every month we're going to
 
03:45:01.610 --> 03:45:01.620 align:start position:0%
start working through the
 
03:45:02.929 --> 03:45:02.939 align:start position:0%
recommendations that have been brought
 
03:45:05.510 --> 03:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
forth by the audit committee
 
03:45:08.570 --> 03:45:08.580 align:start position:0%
go that sounds like a good start uh
 
03:45:11.330 --> 03:45:11.340 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhard and the neighbor
 
03:45:14.090 --> 03:45:14.100 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair
 
03:45:16.550 --> 03:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
quick question as to the necessity and
 
03:45:18.410 --> 03:45:18.420 align:start position:0%
all of all this how many issues have
 
03:45:21.410 --> 03:45:21.420 align:start position:0%
there been with dentists improperly
 
03:45:22.910 --> 03:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
conducted like you know what I mean how
 
03:45:24.290 --> 03:45:24.300 align:start position:0%
many times have as a dentist has really
 
03:45:26.269 --> 03:45:26.279 align:start position:0%
been sanctioned to the point of
 
03:45:29.450 --> 03:45:29.460 align:start position:0%
felony conviction or how serious is how
 
03:45:31.010 --> 03:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
serious are the
 
03:45:33.469 --> 03:45:33.479 align:start position:0%
concerns they're bringing forth so most
 
03:45:35.150 --> 03:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
of the Committees most of the audit
 
03:45:37.070 --> 03:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
committee's report works on is
 
03:45:40.150 --> 03:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
identified you can say functional issues
 
03:45:43.429 --> 03:45:43.439 align:start position:0%
so the way the board has been conducting
 
03:45:45.469 --> 03:45:45.479 align:start position:0%
business in the past so like as board
 
03:45:47.210 --> 03:45:47.220 align:start position:0%
members as the faces around the table
 
03:45:49.729 --> 03:45:49.739 align:start position:0%
change everybody inherits the operating
 
03:45:52.010 --> 03:45:52.020 align:start position:0%
environment of the board and that's
 
03:45:54.530 --> 03:45:54.540 align:start position:0%
what's been inherited and we've now had
 
03:45:56.090 --> 03:45:56.100 align:start position:0%
this opportunity from the audit
 
03:45:57.710 --> 03:45:57.720 align:start position:0%
committee to report back to say hey okay
 
03:45:59.990 --> 03:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
you're doing this but you got to justify
 
03:46:02.690 --> 03:46:02.700 align:start position:0%
the action why you're doing this or
 
03:46:04.910 --> 03:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
rules need to be made clearer so that
 
03:46:06.229 --> 03:46:06.239 align:start position:0%
people are not interpreting rules
 
03:46:07.550 --> 03:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
themselves that's what they're talking
 
03:46:10.670 --> 03:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
about the ad hoc rules so that is what
 
03:46:13.010 --> 03:46:13.020 align:start position:0%
we are working on as far as the dentist
 
03:46:16.130 --> 03:46:16.140 align:start position:0%
being is disciplined it depends on Case
 
03:46:18.229 --> 03:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
by case as the case comes up it goes
 
03:46:19.790 --> 03:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
through now the enforcement division
 
03:46:22.550 --> 03:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
which was not there before previously
 
03:46:25.969 --> 03:46:25.979 align:start position:0%
doj used to run the investigation and
 
03:46:27.650 --> 03:46:27.660 align:start position:0%
that was the time when we did not have
 
03:46:29.750 --> 03:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
support doj would say we have too many
 
03:46:31.670 --> 03:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
cases pending we just can't take this on
 
03:46:33.950 --> 03:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
so they would want a board member to be
 
03:46:36.710 --> 03:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
the investigator as well as be the judge
 
03:46:40.309 --> 03:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:40.319 --> 03:46:41.030 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:46:41.030 --> 03:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:46:43.670 --> 03:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
I think the the question was more a
 
03:46:44.690 --> 03:46:44.700 align:start position:0%
matter of
 
03:46:47.630 --> 03:46:47.640 align:start position:0%
how many substantiated complaints do you
 
03:46:49.729 --> 03:46:49.739 align:start position:0%
get relative to the number of dentists
 
03:46:51.950 --> 03:46:51.960 align:start position:0%
and hygienists in the state so I would
 
03:46:53.990 --> 03:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
say on a monthly basis we would probably
 
03:46:55.910 --> 03:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
get two to three complaints
 
03:46:58.550 --> 03:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
so we meet once a month
 
03:47:01.130 --> 03:47:01.140 align:start position:0%
and then those cases get complaint
 
03:47:02.809 --> 03:47:02.819 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that that's a warranted
 
03:47:04.910 --> 03:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
complaint that that has any Merit to it
 
03:47:06.769 --> 03:47:06.779 align:start position:0%
when the complaint comes to the board
 
03:47:08.750 --> 03:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
the board will see fit to say okay
 
03:47:10.370 --> 03:47:10.380 align:start position:0%
whether it needs to be investigated or
 
03:47:12.170 --> 03:47:12.180 align:start position:0%
not and then if we're getting two to
 
03:47:13.729 --> 03:47:13.739 align:start position:0%
three complaints a month maybe one is
 
03:47:15.290 --> 03:47:15.300 align:start position:0%
being referred out for investigation to
 
03:47:16.790 --> 03:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement where we say okay there is
 
03:47:18.490 --> 03:47:18.500 align:start position:0%
Merit to that complaint
 
03:47:21.290 --> 03:47:21.300 align:start position:0%
yeah one one of the things that I think
 
03:47:23.929 --> 03:47:23.939 align:start position:0%
you're getting at is we our complaints
 
03:47:26.450 --> 03:47:26.460 align:start position:0%
our job is Public Safety that's all we
 
03:47:28.550 --> 03:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
think about a lot of the complaints we
 
03:47:31.429 --> 03:47:31.439 align:start position:0%
get are insurance claims billing
 
03:47:33.650 --> 03:47:33.660 align:start position:0%
components the public is confused about
 
03:47:37.070 --> 03:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
our role in regards to Public Safety so
 
03:47:38.630 --> 03:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
we deal with just Public Safety
 
03:47:40.130 --> 03:47:40.140 align:start position:0%
complaints and there's not a lot of
 
03:47:41.389 --> 03:47:41.399 align:start position:0%
those but they're dealt with very
 
03:47:41.399 --> 03:47:44.030 align:start position:0%
those but they're dealt with very
quickly

03:47:44.030 --> 03:47:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:46.990 --> 03:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you any other
 
03:47:49.610 --> 03:47:49.620 align:start position:0%
whoever some goalie oh somewhere a bear
 
03:47:51.950 --> 03:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
and mangoli
 
03:47:54.110 --> 03:47:54.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:47:58.309 --> 03:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
um my question to the board is
 
03:48:00.830 --> 03:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
following this audit what was your first
 
03:48:02.630 --> 03:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
board meeting like did you guys get to
 
03:48:05.090 --> 03:48:05.100 align:start position:0%
root cause what was the conversation
 
03:48:08.269 --> 03:48:08.279 align:start position:0%
around this audit and
 
03:48:12.110 --> 03:48:12.120 align:start position:0%
and why I mean there's a lot here a lot
 
03:48:13.570 --> 03:48:13.580 align:start position:0%
of falling down
 
03:48:16.790 --> 03:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
so we would have a monthly meeting with
 
03:48:18.889 --> 03:48:18.899 align:start position:0%
Steve and his committee and so the board
 
03:48:20.990 --> 03:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
would meet monthly it was not that all
 
03:48:22.910 --> 03:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
the report came back as one and we met
 
03:48:26.210 --> 03:48:26.220 align:start position:0%
only once so entire over the entire
 
03:48:27.889 --> 03:48:27.899 align:start position:0%
period the audit was happening the board
 
03:48:30.490 --> 03:48:30.500 align:start position:0%
was meeting every time some of the
 
03:48:33.110 --> 03:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
observations were eye-opening
 
03:48:36.590 --> 03:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
and some of them I think Steve and we
 
03:48:38.809 --> 03:48:38.819 align:start position:0%
were on opposite ends we understand it
 
03:48:41.330 --> 03:48:41.340 align:start position:0%
the reasoning behind so like you know
 
03:48:43.729 --> 03:48:43.739 align:start position:0%
whether the observation could be what
 
03:48:45.830 --> 03:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
Steve was saying okay you are not
 
03:48:48.650 --> 03:48:48.660 align:start position:0%
controlling this committee and we would
 
03:48:49.910 --> 03:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
say the way we are controlling a
 
03:48:51.950 --> 03:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
committee is by having one board member
 
03:48:53.570 --> 03:48:53.580 align:start position:0%
be part of the committee but those were
 
03:48:55.190 --> 03:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
conversations we had
 
03:48:57.830 --> 03:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
but in the end obviously as we learned
 
03:48:59.510 --> 03:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
on how the operating environment was
 
03:49:01.729 --> 03:49:01.739 align:start position:0%
functioning that okay certain certain
 
03:49:04.670 --> 03:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
credentials are there where uh just to
 
03:49:06.410 --> 03:49:06.420 align:start position:0%
name one we were talking about this this
 
03:49:08.090 --> 03:49:08.100 align:start position:0%
morning certified public health Channel
 
03:49:09.830 --> 03:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
hygienist okay that credential was
 
03:49:12.410 --> 03:49:12.420 align:start position:0%
created the person gets that credential
 
03:49:14.450 --> 03:49:14.460 align:start position:0%
that okay once that person has been
 
03:49:17.030 --> 03:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
given that credential why is there not a
 
03:49:18.170 --> 03:49:18.180 align:start position:0%
separate containing education
 
03:49:20.750 --> 03:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
requirement for that credential
 
03:49:23.150 --> 03:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
but because we are dentists in the field
 
03:49:24.830 --> 03:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
we understand the person who can get
 
03:49:26.929 --> 03:49:26.939 align:start position:0%
that credential is already a dental
 
03:49:30.050 --> 03:49:30.060 align:start position:0%
hygienist who needs to sell to satisfy
 
03:49:31.550 --> 03:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
CA requirements for being a dental
 
03:49:33.290 --> 03:49:33.300 align:start position:0%
hygienist till the time the northern
 
03:49:34.670 --> 03:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
dental hygienist they cannot become a
 
03:49:36.710 --> 03:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
certified public health General agent so
 
03:49:38.210 --> 03:49:38.220 align:start position:0%
those were the conversations we've had
 
03:49:41.030 --> 03:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
but I think it comes down basically to
 
03:49:43.790 --> 03:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
making sure that our rules are exactly
 
03:49:46.790 --> 03:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
what the RSA States and making it simple
 
03:49:48.349 --> 03:49:48.359 align:start position:0%
so that people can understand that hey
 
03:49:54.769 --> 03:49:54.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:56.809 --> 03:49:56.819 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
03:49:58.030 --> 03:49:58.040 align:start position:0%
coming here
 
03:50:01.130 --> 03:50:01.140 align:start position:0%
my question goes to I mean I heard some
 
03:50:02.150 --> 03:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
of the issues you're addressing
 
03:50:02.160 --> 03:50:03.590 align:start position:0%
of the issues you're addressing
currently

03:50:03.590 --> 03:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
currently
 
03:50:05.690 --> 03:50:05.700 align:start position:0%
but I think one of the biggest issues I
 
03:50:07.010 --> 03:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
heard was
 
03:50:09.710 --> 03:50:09.720 align:start position:0%
folks being credentialed
 
03:50:12.290 --> 03:50:12.300 align:start position:0%
without even being reviewed
 
03:50:16.130 --> 03:50:16.140 align:start position:0%
or without a proper background check you
 
03:50:18.110 --> 03:50:18.120 align:start position:0%
want to talk about Public Safety that's
 
03:50:19.610 --> 03:50:19.620 align:start position:0%
where it starts is to making sure that
 
03:50:22.790 --> 03:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
happens and I don't know if some of this
 
03:50:25.790 --> 03:50:25.800 align:start position:0%
might be taken care of with now the
 
03:50:27.170 --> 03:50:27.180 align:start position:0%
office of professional licensure being
 
03:50:28.670 --> 03:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
able to review some of those where they
 
03:50:29.570 --> 03:50:29.580 align:start position:0%
couldn't in the past it was
 
03:50:31.849 --> 03:50:31.859 align:start position:0%
automatically licensed granted after so
 
03:50:34.010 --> 03:50:34.020 align:start position:0%
many days if it hadn't been reviewed
 
03:50:34.020 --> 03:50:35.750 align:start position:0%
many days if it hadn't been reviewed
but

03:50:35.750 --> 03:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:50:37.250 --> 03:50:37.260 align:start position:0%
what are you doing to make sure that
 
03:50:39.050 --> 03:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen again because it was a
 
03:50:40.670 --> 03:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
substantial number of credentials that
 
03:50:42.469 --> 03:50:42.479 align:start position:0%
were authorized without even being
 
03:50:45.650 --> 03:50:45.660 align:start position:0%
reviewed so I'll make a correction to
 
03:50:47.510 --> 03:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
that not that it wasn't being reviewed
 
03:50:50.510 --> 03:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
every applicant gets reviewed the
 
03:50:53.809 --> 03:50:53.819 align:start position:0%
background check so the state the New
 
03:50:55.370 --> 03:50:55.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Board of dental examiners are
 
03:50:56.510 --> 03:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
actually approached the state
 
03:50:58.370 --> 03:50:58.380 align:start position:0%
legislators to have a background check
 
03:51:01.490 --> 03:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
for every new license he put forth even
 
03:51:05.510 --> 03:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
though that RSA was passed the oplc or
 
03:51:08.210 --> 03:51:08.220 align:start position:0%
the division prior to the oplc had not
 
03:51:10.070 --> 03:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
set up the resources for a background
 
03:51:13.190 --> 03:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
check to be done that has now been put
 
03:51:16.130 --> 03:51:16.140 align:start position:0%
put forth so starting this year every
 
03:51:17.809 --> 03:51:17.819 align:start position:0%
everybody who's applying for a new
 
03:51:19.250 --> 03:51:19.260 align:start position:0%
credential goes through a background
 
03:51:19.260 --> 03:51:22.250 align:start position:0%
credential goes through a background
check

03:51:22.250 --> 03:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:25.250 --> 03:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
so what do I understand you correctly to
 
03:51:27.170 --> 03:51:27.180 align:start position:0%
say that the criminal background check
 
03:51:29.750 --> 03:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
was a new requirement that was
 
03:51:31.790 --> 03:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
implemented sometime after it was
 
03:51:33.650 --> 03:51:33.660 align:start position:0%
imposed as a requirement
 
03:51:33.660 --> 03:51:35.450 align:start position:0%
imposed as a requirement
correct

03:51:35.450 --> 03:51:35.460 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:51:36.849 --> 03:51:36.859 align:start position:0%
thank you that's a little better
 
03:51:36.859 --> 03:51:38.410 align:start position:0%
thank you that's a little better
representative

03:51:38.410 --> 03:51:38.420 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:51:40.190 --> 03:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:51:40.200 --> 03:51:41.330 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

03:51:41.330 --> 03:51:41.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:44.330 --> 03:51:44.340 align:start position:0%
so I I read through a chunk of this uh
 
03:51:45.830 --> 03:51:45.840 align:start position:0%
in particular some of the ones where the
 
03:51:48.349 --> 03:51:48.359 align:start position:0%
board concurred in part and kind of my
 
03:51:50.450 --> 03:51:50.460 align:start position:0%
takeaway and I'd like your response to
 
03:51:52.070 --> 03:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
this is that
 
03:51:53.990 --> 03:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
I mean the folks on the board are Dennis
 
03:51:54.000 --> 03:51:55.490 align:start position:0%
I mean the folks on the board are Dennis
and

03:51:55.490 --> 03:51:55.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:51:57.590 --> 03:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
they're not necessarily in a position to
 
03:51:59.210 --> 03:51:59.220 align:start position:0%
operate in effect this whole
 
03:52:01.610 --> 03:52:01.620 align:start position:0%
administrative structure
 
03:52:04.729 --> 03:52:04.739 align:start position:0%
and um I'm wondering if you know if you
 
03:52:06.830 --> 03:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
agree to that and
 
03:52:08.570 --> 03:52:08.580 align:start position:0%
I sort of had a vision and I don't know
 
03:52:10.370 --> 03:52:10.380 align:start position:0%
I wasn't around when oplc was originally
 
03:52:11.929 --> 03:52:11.939 align:start position:0%
created but
 
03:52:14.990 --> 03:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
it would seem that uh you know any fixed
 
03:52:16.969 --> 03:52:16.979 align:start position:0%
requirements should be handled by oplc
 
03:52:18.710 --> 03:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
and things should only be brought to the
 
03:52:20.570 --> 03:52:20.580 align:start position:0%
board if there's something that really
 
03:52:23.690 --> 03:52:23.700 align:start position:0%
requires the Judgment of a practicing
 
03:52:26.870 --> 03:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
dentist and and that would I would think
 
03:52:28.969 --> 03:52:28.979 align:start position:0%
would greatly reduce the workload of the
 
03:52:31.550 --> 03:52:31.560 align:start position:0%
board and you know take some of that
 
03:52:33.590 --> 03:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
stuff off your shoulders I mean what do
 
03:52:35.389 --> 03:52:35.399 align:start position:0%
you think about that
 
03:52:39.050 --> 03:52:39.060 align:start position:0%
so I think the issue is
 
03:52:41.170 --> 03:52:41.180 align:start position:0%
the reason we have so many observations
 
03:52:43.910 --> 03:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
is the lack of administrative support
 
03:52:46.190 --> 03:52:46.200 align:start position:0%
that the board has had in the last four
 
03:52:47.929 --> 03:52:47.939 align:start position:0%
to five years
 
03:52:51.290 --> 03:52:51.300 align:start position:0%
we've had meetings and hearings without
 
03:52:53.570 --> 03:52:53.580 align:start position:0%
having a board counsel
 
03:52:55.490 --> 03:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
even when we would ask for a board
 
03:52:57.590 --> 03:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
Council to be present they could not doj
 
03:53:00.110 --> 03:53:00.120 align:start position:0%
could not support Supply us one
 
03:53:02.870 --> 03:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
once oplc was created obviously it was
 
03:53:04.790 --> 03:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
created all the rules for oplc were not
 
03:53:08.210 --> 03:53:08.220 align:start position:0%
in place there is no like even the audit
 
03:53:09.650 --> 03:53:09.660 align:start position:0%
committee has said that the board should
 
03:53:12.290 --> 03:53:12.300 align:start position:0%
have a written agreement regarding how
 
03:53:14.630 --> 03:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
oplc would would satisfy administrative
 
03:53:17.929 --> 03:53:17.939 align:start position:0%
functions and are always pushback is the
 
03:53:19.550 --> 03:53:19.560 align:start position:0%
only way we can have a written agreement
 
03:53:22.370 --> 03:53:22.380 align:start position:0%
is if the board can enforce it right we
 
03:53:25.610 --> 03:53:25.620 align:start position:0%
are dependent on the oplc for all our
 
03:53:27.229 --> 03:53:27.239 align:start position:0%
administrative functions
 
03:53:30.170 --> 03:53:30.180 align:start position:0%
and if the board has a written agreement
 
03:53:32.870 --> 03:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
with the with oplc and if that does not
 
03:53:34.429 --> 03:53:34.439 align:start position:0%
happen the board should be able to
 
03:53:35.990 --> 03:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
enforce it I don't know how so there's
 
03:53:37.670 --> 03:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
been discussion about should that be a
 
03:53:40.010 --> 03:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
legislative process so I'm not sure when
 
03:53:42.650 --> 03:53:42.660 align:start position:0%
you say things that can be given to oplc
 
03:53:44.269 --> 03:53:44.279 align:start position:0%
yes the administrative functions are
 
03:53:46.250 --> 03:53:46.260 align:start position:0%
already done by oplc
 
03:53:47.990 --> 03:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
so we're still there it's just a matter
 
03:53:49.969 --> 03:53:49.979 align:start position:0%
of resources whether the board gets the
 
03:53:52.490 --> 03:53:52.500 align:start position:0%
resources via oplc or whether oplc gets
 
03:53:55.910 --> 03:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
those resources that's that's the debate
 
03:53:59.210 --> 03:53:59.220 align:start position:0%
so we we will be bringing forth a lot a
 
03:54:01.130 --> 03:54:01.140 align:start position:0%
lot of bills which we would be asking
 
03:54:03.530 --> 03:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
your support to to make sure that this
 
03:54:05.210 --> 03:54:05.220 align:start position:0%
happens all this time and effort that's
 
03:54:07.130 --> 03:54:07.140 align:start position:0%
been put in the audit we want to make
 
03:54:09.290 --> 03:54:09.300 align:start position:0%
sure that the next round of board
 
03:54:11.570 --> 03:54:11.580 align:start position:0%
members who come on have a clean slate
 
03:54:13.190 --> 03:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
and know that okay operationally they're
 
03:54:15.849 --> 03:54:15.859 align:start position:0%
working fine foreign
 
03:54:21.290 --> 03:54:21.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:25.189 --> 03:54:25.199 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair okay so it it the
 
03:54:28.670 --> 03:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
questions are all interesting but uh I
 
03:54:30.229 --> 03:54:30.239 align:start position:0%
think there's kind of a disconnect in
 
03:54:31.790 --> 03:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
terms of the reality of how this all
 
03:54:33.830 --> 03:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
works first of all you're the board
 
03:54:37.070 --> 03:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
you're in responsible for oversight for
 
03:54:39.349 --> 03:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
suggesting legislation and so forth and
 
03:54:41.510 --> 03:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
so on blessing certain things and so
 
03:54:44.510 --> 03:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
forth but you don't in many cases except
 
03:54:47.929 --> 03:54:47.939 align:start position:0%
for conducting hearings on some kind of
 
03:54:52.010 --> 03:54:52.020 align:start position:0%
a misconduct uh or uh personal feeling
 
03:54:54.550 --> 03:54:54.560 align:start position:0%
like alcoholism or something like that
 
03:54:57.189 --> 03:54:57.199 align:start position:0%
you're not involved in the day-to-day
 
03:54:59.269 --> 03:54:59.279 align:start position:0%
credentialing and so forth and so on
 
03:55:02.510 --> 03:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
that's a an administrative function that
 
03:55:05.570 --> 03:55:05.580 align:start position:0%
must be carried out by staff right how
 
03:55:06.710 --> 03:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
many people
 
03:55:08.870 --> 03:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
how many people do you have that are
 
03:55:11.150 --> 03:55:11.160 align:start position:0%
doing the credentialing you're not doing
 
03:55:12.790 --> 03:55:12.800 align:start position:0%
the credentialing yourself
 
03:55:15.410 --> 03:55:15.420 align:start position:0%
it's being done by staff members right
 
03:55:18.469 --> 03:55:18.479 align:start position:0%
and this the criticisms here are mostly
 
03:55:21.889 --> 03:55:21.899 align:start position:0%
about inadequate oversight or proceeding
 
03:55:24.710 --> 03:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
without sufficient uh legal Authority
 
03:55:27.110 --> 03:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
and so forth but most of the work is
 
03:55:30.830 --> 03:55:30.840 align:start position:0%
done by staff no yes and no so
 
03:55:33.290 --> 03:55:33.300 align:start position:0%
the staff receives the application for
 
03:55:35.870 --> 03:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
any licensure how many my first question
 
03:55:39.410 --> 03:55:39.420 align:start position:0%
doctor how many staff do you have so we
 
03:55:42.110 --> 03:55:42.120 align:start position:0%
have one administrator and One support
 
03:55:43.910 --> 03:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
staff and I don't know how many oplc
 
03:55:45.110 --> 03:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
would be able to answer how many people
 
03:55:47.630 --> 03:55:47.640 align:start position:0%
process the applications that comes in
 
03:55:47.640 --> 03:55:51.130 align:start position:0%
process the applications that comes in
six

03:55:51.130 --> 03:55:51.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:54.650 --> 03:55:54.660 align:start position:0%
stop but I think there's a
 
03:55:56.870 --> 03:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
there's a period of time in which opot
 
03:55:58.130 --> 03:55:58.140 align:start position:0%
and the board have gone through a
 
03:56:00.969 --> 03:56:00.979 align:start position:0%
transition the audit identified that the
 
03:56:03.889 --> 03:56:03.899 align:start position:0%
board itself is not examining all
 
03:56:07.010 --> 03:56:07.020 align:start position:0%
applications and that is that's the
 
03:56:09.170 --> 03:56:09.180 align:start position:0%
intent I think that's what the intent is
 
03:56:11.630 --> 03:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
of the statute is to have the Board
 
03:56:13.790 --> 03:56:13.800 align:start position:0%
review all licensing applications but
 
03:56:15.650 --> 03:56:15.660 align:start position:0%
they identified as licensing
 
03:56:17.870 --> 03:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
applications are being reviewed by
 
03:56:19.429 --> 03:56:19.439 align:start position:0%
advice and I think the open question
 
03:56:21.469 --> 03:56:21.479 align:start position:0%
from a policy standpoint that you may
 
03:56:23.210 --> 03:56:23.220 align:start position:0%
see in some legislation is whether or
 
03:56:25.550 --> 03:56:25.560 align:start position:0%
not the board should be reviewing all
 
03:56:28.010 --> 03:56:28.020 align:start position:0%
applications or whether or not that
 
03:56:30.349 --> 03:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
should be a staff function I think
 
03:56:32.330 --> 03:56:32.340 align:start position:0%
that's still
 
03:56:35.389 --> 03:56:35.399 align:start position:0%
okay so then follow up my follow-up
 
03:56:38.150 --> 03:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
question is uh do you you believe
 
03:56:41.269 --> 03:56:41.279 align:start position:0%
Lindsay do you believe that you and the
 
03:56:43.670 --> 03:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
the board together have adequate staff
 
03:56:46.010 --> 03:56:46.020 align:start position:0%
to process all the things because if the
 
03:56:47.510 --> 03:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
board is going to be reviewing things
 
03:56:49.729 --> 03:56:49.739 align:start position:0%
either they're just looking over
 
03:56:51.410 --> 03:56:51.420 align:start position:0%
something that the staff has already
 
03:56:51.420 --> 03:56:53.090 align:start position:0%
something that the staff has already
done

03:56:53.090 --> 03:56:53.100 align:start position:0%
done
 
03:56:56.330 --> 03:56:56.340 align:start position:0%
that's what review means somebody's
 
03:56:58.389 --> 03:56:58.399 align:start position:0%
already seen it the oversight person
 
03:57:00.889 --> 03:57:00.899 align:start position:0%
looks at it again but they're not going
 
03:57:03.650 --> 03:57:03.660 align:start position:0%
to do all the grunt work of seeing
 
03:57:06.050 --> 03:57:06.060 align:start position:0%
whether this this document is there
 
03:57:08.150 --> 03:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
whether it's up to date whether it's
 
03:57:11.389 --> 03:57:11.399 align:start position:0%
factual or fictitious or whatever
 
03:57:14.150 --> 03:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
but you have an adequate staff to do the
 
03:57:17.530 --> 03:57:17.540 align:start position:0%
kind of work that audit is is uh
 
03:57:27.469 --> 03:57:27.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:29.870 --> 03:57:29.880 align:start position:0%
if you have an effective control design
 
03:57:31.969 --> 03:57:31.979 align:start position:0%
process with effective policies and
 
03:57:33.650 --> 03:57:33.660 align:start position:0%
procedures you probably don't need as
 
03:57:35.570 --> 03:57:35.580 align:start position:0%
many actual staff on the ground to
 
03:57:38.030 --> 03:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
actually process the application the
 
03:57:40.849 --> 03:57:40.859 align:start position:0%
issue and I can talk about it when I
 
03:57:43.610 --> 03:57:43.620 align:start position:0%
speak about PLC generally is that
 
03:57:45.290 --> 03:57:45.300 align:start position:0%
there's been a complete lack of
 
03:57:47.570 --> 03:57:47.580 align:start position:0%
consistent policy procedures like a hot
 
03:57:49.250 --> 03:57:49.260 align:start position:0%
body approach to licensing not just with
 
03:57:50.750 --> 03:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
board essential examiners with everybody
 
03:57:54.469 --> 03:57:54.479 align:start position:0%
and that kind of chaos if you know
 
03:57:56.030 --> 03:57:56.040 align:start position:0%
people automatically think I gotta I
 
03:57:58.010 --> 03:57:58.020 align:start position:0%
gotta put more people at this I think we
 
03:57:59.750 --> 03:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
need to look at the procedures and the
 
03:58:02.030 --> 03:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
processes first before we're able to
 
03:58:05.330 --> 03:58:05.340 align:start position:0%
assess how much we actually need it
 
03:58:07.729 --> 03:58:07.739 align:start position:0%
I'm not suggesting that you need more
 
03:58:09.710 --> 03:58:09.720 align:start position:0%
staff my question is do you have enough
 
03:58:14.689 --> 03:58:14.699 align:start position:0%
staff to do the day-to-day procedures I
 
03:58:16.070 --> 03:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
think she's answered the question as
 
03:58:18.410 --> 03:58:18.420 align:start position:0%
well as she can but I'm I'm speaking to
 
03:58:20.570 --> 03:58:20.580 align:start position:0%
the committee several a number of these
 
03:58:22.250 --> 03:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
people have never done one of these
 
03:58:24.889 --> 03:58:24.899 align:start position:0%
performance reviews before and this kind
 
03:58:28.790 --> 03:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
of criticism sounds scathing uh but it
 
03:58:31.070 --> 03:58:31.080 align:start position:0%
may be there may be a disconnect in
 
03:58:33.769 --> 03:58:33.779 align:start position:0%
terms of what your actual function is as
 
03:58:37.550 --> 03:58:37.560 align:start position:0%
a board as professional dentists or a
 
03:58:40.849 --> 03:58:40.859 align:start position:0%
public member and what is nitty-gritty
 
03:58:44.210 --> 03:58:44.220 align:start position:0%
of receiving applications
 
03:58:46.610 --> 03:58:46.620 align:start position:0%
yes representative Schmidt one of the
 
03:58:50.510 --> 03:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
problems is that when you have a mess
 
03:58:53.210 --> 03:58:53.220 align:start position:0%
adding more people to it just makes a
 
03:58:55.849 --> 03:58:55.859 align:start position:0%
bigger mess I'm not I'm not suggesting
 
03:58:58.130 --> 03:58:58.140 align:start position:0%
you need more staff my question was do
 
03:59:00.349 --> 03:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
you have adequate staff because if you
 
03:59:04.490 --> 03:59:04.500 align:start position:0%
do then procedures are what are are what
 
03:59:07.610 --> 03:59:07.620 align:start position:0%
are at fault or deficient not how many
 
03:59:10.689 --> 03:59:10.699 align:start position:0%
people you have doing that
 
03:59:13.610 --> 03:59:13.620 align:start position:0%
yes I am more more concerned actually
 
03:59:17.990 --> 03:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
that the invest the complaints not so
 
03:59:20.090 --> 03:59:20.100 align:start position:0%
much that some of them were dismissed as
 
03:59:22.610 --> 03:59:22.620 align:start position:0%
not in your jurisdiction or whatever
 
03:59:25.729 --> 03:59:25.739 align:start position:0%
that happens but I'm somewhat concerned
 
03:59:27.769 --> 03:59:27.779 align:start position:0%
that you can't keep track of the
 
03:59:27.779 --> 03:59:30.110 align:start position:0%
that you can't keep track of the
complaints

03:59:30.110 --> 03:59:30.120 align:start position:0%
complaints
 
03:59:32.809 --> 03:59:32.819 align:start position:0%
not anymore not not with the enforcement
 
03:59:36.229 --> 03:59:36.239 align:start position:0%
now so now we get monthly updates so now
 
03:59:38.210 --> 03:59:38.220 align:start position:0%
we have where our board administrator
 
03:59:40.010 --> 03:59:40.020 align:start position:0%
has a list that okay this has been sent
 
03:59:41.870 --> 03:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
out what has not come back in
 
03:59:43.370 --> 03:59:43.380 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm glad to hear that
 
03:59:45.349 --> 03:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
representative Gerhart
 
03:59:48.050 --> 03:59:48.060 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:59:50.450 --> 03:59:50.460 align:start position:0%
as far as complaints go are these public
 
03:59:53.689 --> 03:59:53.699 align:start position:0%
information or this is all internal
 
03:59:56.389 --> 03:59:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:59.150 --> 03:59:59.160 align:start position:0%
uh the complaint itself comes in in the
 
04:00:01.429 --> 04:00:01.439 align:start position:0%
non-public session but the hearing is
 
04:00:03.910 --> 04:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
public so once it's once it's
 
04:00:06.410 --> 04:00:06.420 align:start position:0%
investigated we find there is Merit to
 
04:00:08.090 --> 04:00:08.100 align:start position:0%
it and there is a hearing then that
 
04:00:09.590 --> 04:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
becomes a public thing
 
04:00:12.110 --> 04:00:12.120 align:start position:0%
okay and then the discipline is public
 
04:00:12.120 --> 04:00:16.250 align:start position:0%
okay and then the discipline is public
yeah

04:00:16.250 --> 04:00:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:18.530 --> 04:00:18.540 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much thank you
 
04:00:22.250 --> 04:00:22.260 align:start position:0%
any other uh any other things you want
 
04:00:25.309 --> 04:00:25.319 align:start position:0%
to tell us about that we need to know
 
04:00:27.590 --> 04:00:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh I think you'll be hearing a lot from
 
04:00:31.490 --> 04:00:31.500 align:start position:0%
us so stay tuned all right yes excuse me
 
04:00:34.130 --> 04:00:34.140 align:start position:0%
representative Gould has a question sure
 
04:00:37.189 --> 04:00:37.199 align:start position:0%
more common but I I just this is
 
04:00:39.889 --> 04:00:39.899 align:start position:0%
extremely alarming and
 
04:00:42.769 --> 04:00:42.779 align:start position:0%
dental health is really important and
 
04:00:45.590 --> 04:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
the health of the people in our state is
 
04:00:49.189 --> 04:00:49.199 align:start position:0%
got to be the focus and it seems like
 
04:00:52.490 --> 04:00:52.500 align:start position:0%
I don't know I haven't really heard
 
04:00:56.389 --> 04:00:56.399 align:start position:0%
a sincerity in the responsibility of the
 
04:00:58.910 --> 04:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
board in the issues that have happened I
 
04:01:02.570 --> 04:01:02.580 align:start position:0%
hope that that is a part of your process
 
04:01:04.790 --> 04:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
and I I hope that you can express that
 
04:01:07.490 --> 04:01:07.500 align:start position:0%
to the people in New Hampshire who need
 
04:01:10.070 --> 04:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
you to ensure their safety the women and
 
04:01:14.030 --> 04:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
the children who could be at risk from
 
04:01:18.170 --> 04:01:18.180 align:start position:0%
the lack of oversight it's alarming
 
04:01:20.990 --> 04:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
I I agree because even the report to the
 
04:01:23.150 --> 04:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
board itself was alarming
 
04:01:25.610 --> 04:01:25.620 align:start position:0%
and every single board member who sits
 
04:01:28.849 --> 04:01:28.859 align:start position:0%
on the board their basic basic aim is
 
04:01:30.769 --> 04:01:30.779 align:start position:0%
protection of the public so we look at
 
04:01:33.530 --> 04:01:33.540 align:start position:0%
it numerous times everything that has
 
04:01:36.349 --> 04:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
come up and because I said we have this
 
04:01:37.969 --> 04:01:37.979 align:start position:0%
now as a standing agenda item we've
 
04:01:40.010 --> 04:01:40.020 align:start position:0%
already started okay let's deal with the
 
04:01:41.570 --> 04:01:41.580 align:start position:0%
sedation thing first that's the biggest
 
04:01:44.210 --> 04:01:44.220 align:start position:0%
thing that that affects standard of care
 
04:01:46.130 --> 04:01:46.140 align:start position:0%
that affects access to care then that
 
04:01:48.170 --> 04:01:48.180 align:start position:0%
affects safety of the public so we had
 
04:01:49.610 --> 04:01:49.620 align:start position:0%
this discussion this morning that our
 
04:01:52.910 --> 04:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
priority is safety access to care
 
04:01:55.070 --> 04:01:55.080 align:start position:0%
becomes a second priority but there
 
04:01:56.929 --> 04:01:56.939 align:start position:0%
could be unintended consequences of
 
04:01:58.790 --> 04:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
whatever we do but that's still our
 
04:02:01.070 --> 04:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
primary job is safety of the public so
 
04:02:02.870 --> 04:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
we do take that seriously no question
 
04:02:03.910 --> 04:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
about it
 
04:02:06.469 --> 04:02:06.479 align:start position:0%
of course so I've only been on the board
 
04:02:08.929 --> 04:02:08.939 align:start position:0%
a year and a couple months
 
04:02:13.189 --> 04:02:13.199 align:start position:0%
and I volunteer to get on the board for
 
04:02:14.870 --> 04:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
Public Safety I've been practicing for
 
04:02:16.910 --> 04:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
42 years
 
04:02:19.370 --> 04:02:19.380 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately a lot of this stuff
 
04:02:21.590 --> 04:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
happened before a lot of the board
 
04:02:23.689 --> 04:02:23.699 align:start position:0%
members are there and it's going to give
 
04:02:25.250 --> 04:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
us great Direction
 
04:02:27.889 --> 04:02:27.899 align:start position:0%
but it's really tough to give up a day
 
04:02:30.710 --> 04:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
at work and come in and work so hard
 
04:02:33.469 --> 04:02:33.479 align:start position:0%
hours looking through all this stuff on
 
04:02:36.530 --> 04:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
the weekends away from your family and
 
04:02:38.090 --> 04:02:38.100 align:start position:0%
and be The Whipping Boy it really is
 
04:02:39.349 --> 04:02:39.359 align:start position:0%
very tough and a lot of the board
 
04:02:41.809 --> 04:02:41.819 align:start position:0%
members are getting very discouraged and
 
04:02:43.610 --> 04:02:43.620 align:start position:0%
this is a voluntary thing and they all
 
04:02:46.250 --> 04:02:46.260 align:start position:0%
have their heart in the right place they
 
04:02:49.010 --> 04:02:49.020 align:start position:0%
all care about their patience so I just
 
04:02:50.809 --> 04:02:50.819 align:start position:0%
want to leave you with that no we we
 
04:02:53.090 --> 04:02:53.100 align:start position:0%
would definitely have safety in mind we
 
04:02:55.610 --> 04:02:55.620 align:start position:0%
just would need resources to do what we
 
04:02:58.670 --> 04:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
are tasked to do so that we can we also
 
04:03:00.349 --> 04:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
want to go home feeling that we've
 
04:03:02.210 --> 04:03:02.220 align:start position:0%
accomplished something rather than just
 
04:03:04.849 --> 04:03:04.859 align:start position:0%
sit around the table so thank you for
 
04:03:06.410 --> 04:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
your time that you put into it having
 
04:03:09.229 --> 04:03:09.239 align:start position:0%
worked in child welfare I get it I get
 
04:03:12.590 --> 04:03:12.600 align:start position:0%
the problems but take responsibility
 
04:03:15.229 --> 04:03:15.239 align:start position:0%
show the public that you are going to
 
04:03:17.330 --> 04:03:17.340 align:start position:0%
follow through and then you won't be The
 
04:03:18.590 --> 04:03:18.600 align:start position:0%
Whipping Boy
 
04:03:20.809 --> 04:03:20.819 align:start position:0%
absolutely yes thank you representative
 
04:03:20.819 --> 04:03:22.490 align:start position:0%
absolutely yes thank you representative
true

04:03:22.490 --> 04:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
true
 
04:03:25.189 --> 04:03:25.199 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:03:28.010 --> 04:03:28.020 align:start position:0%
could you tell me I I think I heard you
 
04:03:29.809 --> 04:03:29.819 align:start position:0%
say you you meet like once a month
 
04:03:31.510 --> 04:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
04:03:34.910 --> 04:03:34.920 align:start position:0%
why are you meeting once a month and
 
04:03:36.290 --> 04:03:36.300 align:start position:0%
when you do meet
 
04:03:37.849 --> 04:03:37.859 align:start position:0%
what are you doing
 
04:03:41.590 --> 04:03:41.600 align:start position:0%
there must be a reason somebody called
 
04:03:45.349 --> 04:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
you're bored to meet or was it
 
04:03:48.229 --> 04:03:48.239 align:start position:0%
do it every month so we're meeting once
 
04:03:51.229 --> 04:03:51.239 align:start position:0%
a month to address either the complaints
 
04:03:54.050 --> 04:03:54.060 align:start position:0%
that are coming through or the board
 
04:03:56.990 --> 04:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
audit report or the new dentist or the
 
04:03:59.389 --> 04:03:59.399 align:start position:0%
new hygienist or any other rule change
 
04:04:01.729 --> 04:04:01.739 align:start position:0%
we're constantly working on rule changes
 
04:04:03.830 --> 04:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
because we all know it takes a while you
 
04:04:05.330 --> 04:04:05.340 align:start position:0%
initiate something today it takes almost
 
04:04:07.490 --> 04:04:07.500 align:start position:0%
a year for it to come around so we're
 
04:04:10.429 --> 04:04:10.439 align:start position:0%
we're meeting constantly to either make
 
04:04:12.229 --> 04:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
things better or deal with anything
 
04:04:13.630 --> 04:04:13.640 align:start position:0%
that's coming up
 
04:04:16.849 --> 04:04:16.859 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Schmidt you had
 
04:04:20.750 --> 04:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
another question I do so the one of the
 
04:04:23.349 --> 04:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
things I'm most concerned about is the
 
04:04:25.670 --> 04:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
repetitive statement that you're doing
 
04:04:27.650 --> 04:04:27.660 align:start position:0%
things without statutory Authority
 
04:04:30.170 --> 04:04:30.180 align:start position:0%
you're creating new entities you're
 
04:04:32.090 --> 04:04:32.100 align:start position:0%
creating new procedures and so forth and
 
04:04:34.250 --> 04:04:34.260 align:start position:0%
so on where you have no statutory
 
04:04:36.769 --> 04:04:36.779 align:start position:0%
Authority that should be the concern
 
04:04:40.790 --> 04:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
major concern of this committee uh so my
 
04:04:44.870 --> 04:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
question is uh in those cases where that
 
04:04:47.510 --> 04:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
has been criticized what are you doing
 
04:04:51.050 --> 04:04:51.060 align:start position:0%
in terms of proposals to the legislature
 
04:04:53.809 --> 04:04:53.819 align:start position:0%
for statutory Authority so what the
 
04:04:55.849 --> 04:04:55.859 align:start position:0%
board committee is identifying the board
 
04:04:58.250 --> 04:04:58.260 align:start position:0%
audit report is identifying as a
 
04:05:00.110 --> 04:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
as a body that we've created without
 
04:05:02.510 --> 04:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
having statutory Authority is the ASAC
 
04:05:05.570 --> 04:05:05.580 align:start position:0%
these the sedation guideline committee
 
04:05:07.849 --> 04:05:07.859 align:start position:0%
and that was stated on the board's rules
 
04:05:10.429 --> 04:05:10.439 align:start position:0%
and that's why how it was created we
 
04:05:12.889 --> 04:05:12.899 align:start position:0%
dissolved that once audit committee said
 
04:05:14.630 --> 04:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
you should have a legislatively created
 
04:05:16.070 --> 04:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
committee so that committee has been
 
04:05:18.050 --> 04:05:18.060 align:start position:0%
dissolved for a long time now since the
 
04:05:19.849 --> 04:05:19.859 align:start position:0%
time the board since the time the audit
 
04:05:21.950 --> 04:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
committee has identified and the
 
04:05:24.110 --> 04:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
legislation that the board is asking is
 
04:05:25.790 --> 04:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
putting forth is to create that
 
04:05:28.670 --> 04:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
committee through a legislative process
 
04:05:31.250 --> 04:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
is there a bill to do so yeah it's in
 
04:05:34.010 --> 04:05:34.020 align:start position:0%
the LSR stages yes it's in the it's in
 
04:05:36.550 --> 04:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
the LSR stage it is basically
 
04:05:40.429 --> 04:05:40.439 align:start position:0%
lsrs file it's a Senate bill okay so
 
04:05:42.530 --> 04:05:42.540 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm sure we'll we'll be seeing
 
04:05:43.849 --> 04:05:43.859 align:start position:0%
it once the Senate's through with it
 
04:05:46.670 --> 04:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Aber
 
04:05:48.530 --> 04:05:48.540 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just one last
 
04:05:50.389 --> 04:05:50.399 align:start position:0%
question for you thank you for coming in
 
04:05:52.729 --> 04:05:52.739 align:start position:0%
today thank you I would assume that you
 
04:05:56.210 --> 04:05:56.220 align:start position:0%
have a list of closeouts and some sort
 
04:05:58.250 --> 04:05:58.260 align:start position:0%
of plan what is your time frame to have
 
04:06:00.229 --> 04:06:00.239 align:start position:0%
all of these complaints completely
 
04:06:03.469 --> 04:06:03.479 align:start position:0%
closed out and reported back I don't
 
04:06:05.330 --> 04:06:05.340 align:start position:0%
have a deadline as yet because we've
 
04:06:06.710 --> 04:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
just started working on this starting
 
04:06:09.650 --> 04:06:09.660 align:start position:0%
our first meeting today I would say it
 
04:06:11.510 --> 04:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
will probably take five years before
 
04:06:12.889 --> 04:06:12.899 align:start position:0%
we're ready
 
04:06:17.269 --> 04:06:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:19.550 --> 04:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
did you say five years to fix these
 
04:06:22.969 --> 04:06:22.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:24.969 --> 04:06:24.979 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:06:27.769 --> 04:06:27.779 align:start position:0%

04:06:44.750 --> 04:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
as far as the timeline one of the things
 
04:06:46.729 --> 04:06:46.739 align:start position:0%
that is something that none of us can
 
04:06:51.530 --> 04:06:51.540 align:start position:0%
change is just getting the our bill in
 
04:06:53.870 --> 04:06:53.880 align:start position:0%
front of the Senate we had to wait till
 
04:06:56.510 --> 04:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
November I had to make phone calls to
 
04:06:58.670 --> 04:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
get it placed and we were talking about
 
04:07:00.889 --> 04:07:00.899 align:start position:0%
build some changes for the legislature
 
04:07:02.990 --> 04:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
for different things and we now we have
 
04:07:05.389 --> 04:07:05.399 align:start position:0%
to wait till next November so the
 
04:07:07.370 --> 04:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
legislative process is all-encompassing
 
04:07:09.710 --> 04:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
as you guys know for us and that's why
 
04:07:12.349 --> 04:07:12.359 align:start position:0%
he said five years is because it's taken
 
04:07:13.790 --> 04:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
us a while we're not familiar with
 
04:07:16.729 --> 04:07:16.739 align:start position:0%
legislative part and getting bills you
 
04:07:19.729 --> 04:07:19.739 align:start position:0%
know uh into the Senate and we're
 
04:07:21.889 --> 04:07:21.899 align:start position:0%
working hard to do that but we've got
 
04:07:23.570 --> 04:07:23.580 align:start position:0%
two bills in and there's some other ones
 
04:07:24.769 --> 04:07:24.779 align:start position:0%
we'd like to get in we're gonna have to
 
04:07:27.110 --> 04:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
wait till next November representative
 
04:07:29.450 --> 04:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
blackis thank you
 
04:07:30.950 --> 04:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
um May I understand trying to get
 
04:07:33.349 --> 04:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
everything resolved can take a while but
 
04:07:35.090 --> 04:07:35.100 align:start position:0%
uh Courtney the audit report there's a
 
04:07:36.050 --> 04:07:36.060 align:start position:0%
number of things you're doing without
 
04:07:38.750 --> 04:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority and ad hoc rules and
 
04:07:40.309 --> 04:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
those are just not legal
 
04:07:42.710 --> 04:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
and I'd like you to assure me that that
 
04:07:46.849 --> 04:07:46.859 align:start position:0%
stuff is going to stop really darn quick
 
04:07:48.469 --> 04:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
that already has
 
04:07:50.870 --> 04:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
all of that the rules and the uh all
 
04:07:52.370 --> 04:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
right thank you
 
04:07:55.490 --> 04:07:55.500 align:start position:0%
glad to hear it representative a bear
 
04:07:57.650 --> 04:07:57.660 align:start position:0%
if you were to put a percentage thank
 
04:07:58.910 --> 04:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
04:08:02.030 --> 04:08:02.040 align:start position:0%
if you were to put a percentage of the
 
04:08:02.040 --> 04:08:04.070 align:start position:0%
if you were to put a percentage of the
inadequacies

04:08:04.070 --> 04:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
inadequacies
 
04:08:07.130 --> 04:08:07.140 align:start position:0%
that would be closed out what would that
 
04:08:09.530 --> 04:08:09.540 align:start position:0%
percentage be you've read the report you
 
04:08:11.870 --> 04:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
have you know in your minds you've met
 
04:08:14.570 --> 04:08:14.580 align:start position:0%
with your board this was type November
 
04:08:16.969 --> 04:08:16.979 align:start position:0%
7th by you guys after review of the
 
04:08:16.979 --> 04:08:18.229 align:start position:0%
7th by you guys after review of the
audit

04:08:18.229 --> 04:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
audit
 
04:08:22.550 --> 04:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
so you've met with your team twice
 
04:08:24.710 --> 04:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
what percentage will be closed out
 
04:08:28.550 --> 04:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
without additional legislation
 
04:08:31.070 --> 04:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
if you see most of the recommendations
 
04:08:33.410 --> 04:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
are to have legislative changes
 
04:08:35.750 --> 04:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
once the legislative changes go in we
 
04:08:37.070 --> 04:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
would have to write rules about it
 
04:08:38.210 --> 04:08:38.220 align:start position:0%
because we don't know when the
 
04:08:39.889 --> 04:08:39.899 align:start position:0%
legislation is proposed it goes in one
 
04:08:41.269 --> 04:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
way and comes out the other way so I
 
04:08:42.590 --> 04:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
don't know what's going to happen
 
04:08:44.570 --> 04:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
but we are hoping that the rules part
 
04:08:45.950 --> 04:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
would be done sooner than the
 
04:08:47.929 --> 04:08:47.939 align:start position:0%
legislative part we would probably aim
 
04:08:50.090 --> 04:08:50.100 align:start position:0%
to do 100 or whatever can be done
 
04:08:52.130 --> 04:08:52.140 align:start position:0%
through rules that do it sooner than
 
04:08:52.140 --> 04:08:53.269 align:start position:0%
through rules that do it sooner than
later

04:08:53.269 --> 04:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
later
 
04:08:56.150 --> 04:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative Simon has a
 
04:08:56.160 --> 04:08:56.809 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative Simon has a
question

04:08:56.809 --> 04:08:56.819 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:08:58.370 --> 04:08:58.380 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
04:09:00.650 --> 04:09:00.660 align:start position:0%
um recognizing that the board
 
04:09:02.510 --> 04:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
changes frequently and you guys are
 
04:09:05.689 --> 04:09:05.699 align:start position:0%
inheriting a great deal of uh the issues
 
04:09:08.570 --> 04:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
that you're facing when it comes to
 
04:09:10.790 --> 04:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
interfacing with us and the legislation
 
04:09:12.889 --> 04:09:12.899 align:start position:0%
component of it are you basically
 
04:09:16.429 --> 04:09:16.439 align:start position:0%
relying on oplc to keep you abreast of
 
04:09:18.950 --> 04:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
legislative changes and updates that you
 
04:09:20.929 --> 04:09:20.939 align:start position:0%
need to comply with or do you have your
 
04:09:23.510 --> 04:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
own systems for that no so we rely on
 
04:09:26.570 --> 04:09:26.580 align:start position:0%
oplc that's one of the points we have we
 
04:09:28.550 --> 04:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
only find out about legislation that has
 
04:09:30.170 --> 04:09:30.180 align:start position:0%
been enacted that's going to affect the
 
04:09:32.750 --> 04:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
practice of Dentistry later
 
04:09:35.210 --> 04:09:35.220 align:start position:0%
so we we don't even know that we could
 
04:09:36.769 --> 04:09:36.779 align:start position:0%
have come and offered if we knew there
 
04:09:38.450 --> 04:09:38.460 align:start position:0%
was a legislation pending and we had a
 
04:09:39.790 --> 04:09:39.800 align:start position:0%
thought we could have come and offered
 
04:09:42.410 --> 04:09:42.420 align:start position:0%
testimony to that but sometimes we only
 
04:09:44.630 --> 04:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
find I shouldn't say sometimes 100 of
 
04:09:46.309 --> 04:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
the time we only find out once it's gone
 
04:09:48.769 --> 04:09:48.779 align:start position:0%
through so we rely totally on oplc now
 
04:09:51.229 --> 04:09:51.239 align:start position:0%
the oplc sends us every month or every
 
04:09:53.030 --> 04:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
six weeks we get a report of okay this
 
04:09:54.530 --> 04:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
is the pending legislation that's coming
 
04:09:56.570 --> 04:09:56.580 align:start position:0%
up but in the past that was not the case
 
04:09:59.689 --> 04:09:59.699 align:start position:0%
yeah oh excellent follow-up thank you
 
04:10:01.550 --> 04:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
madam chair um yeah I just wanted to
 
04:10:02.990 --> 04:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
mention that because I'm assuming moving
 
04:10:04.910 --> 04:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
forward that you guys will keep much
 
04:10:06.290 --> 04:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
closer abreast of this stuff and make
 
04:10:07.729 --> 04:10:07.739 align:start position:0%
the changes and I would be more
 
04:10:09.530 --> 04:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
concerned that you went straight from
 
04:10:10.969 --> 04:10:10.979 align:start position:0%
this point forward than that you had
 
04:10:13.070 --> 04:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
gone this way before just from an
 
04:10:15.050 --> 04:10:15.060 align:start position:0%
informational standpoint thank you thank
 
04:10:17.210 --> 04:10:17.220 align:start position:0%
you yes
 
04:10:17.220 --> 04:10:18.729 align:start position:0%
you yes
foreign

04:10:18.729 --> 04:10:18.739 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:10:21.290 --> 04:10:21.300 align:start position:0%
ER you have a final question
 
04:10:23.630 --> 04:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
yes I do have one final question is for
 
04:10:27.710 --> 04:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
the auditing team as to their opinion of
 
04:10:29.450 --> 04:10:29.460 align:start position:0%
that percentage
 
04:10:31.729 --> 04:10:31.739 align:start position:0%
that could be fixed without legislation
 
04:10:34.790 --> 04:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
this is a pretty thick binder thank you
 
04:10:36.410 --> 04:10:36.420 align:start position:0%
and it is my final question Madam chair
 
04:10:44.870 --> 04:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:44.880 --> 04:10:56.389 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:10:56.389 --> 04:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:59.269 --> 04:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
all right excellent uh
 
04:11:01.790 --> 04:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for for showing up
 
04:11:04.670 --> 04:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
and taking our questions
 
04:11:07.070 --> 04:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
I would appreciate it if you could send
 
04:11:10.309 --> 04:11:10.319 align:start position:0%
us after your board meeting what your
 
04:11:13.309 --> 04:11:13.319 align:start position:0%
progress is that from that the minutes
 
04:11:15.170 --> 04:11:15.180 align:start position:0%
from that section of the of the board
 
04:11:17.210 --> 04:11:17.220 align:start position:0%
meeting or even just the whole set and
 
04:11:20.090 --> 04:11:20.100 align:start position:0%
we'll clip it because we are concerned
 
04:11:21.830 --> 04:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
and we know you're working on it we just
 
04:11:23.750 --> 04:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
like to let you know that somebody's
 
04:11:26.030 --> 04:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
looking at your progress so can I just
 
04:11:27.410 --> 04:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
voice say one thing to this gentleman
 
04:11:27.420 --> 04:11:28.849 align:start position:0%
voice say one thing to this gentleman
yes

04:11:28.849 --> 04:11:28.859 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:11:32.630 --> 04:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
so since we have stopped asex
 
04:11:35.210 --> 04:11:35.220 align:start position:0%
we're dead in the water
 
04:11:38.290 --> 04:11:38.300 align:start position:0%
we have not been able to inspect any
 
04:11:42.769 --> 04:11:42.779 align:start position:0%
anesthesia a facility or provider
 
04:11:46.070 --> 04:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
to me that seems extremely dangerous
 
04:11:47.929 --> 04:11:47.939 align:start position:0%
and we are literally dead in the water
 
04:11:49.849 --> 04:11:49.859 align:start position:0%
we cannot do any inspections or anything
 
04:11:53.090 --> 04:11:53.100 align:start position:0%
else without this per going forward
 
04:11:53.100 --> 04:11:54.410 align:start position:0%
else without this per going forward
so

04:11:54.410 --> 04:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:11:56.750 --> 04:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
I realize what you're saying but what's
 
04:11:59.510 --> 04:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
happened in the interim is there and I'm
 
04:12:01.630 --> 04:12:01.640 align:start position:0%
very right now very sensitive to the
 
04:12:04.630 --> 04:12:04.640 align:start position:0%
general anesthesia in the dental office
 
04:12:08.210 --> 04:12:08.220 align:start position:0%
that is at a standstill right now
 
04:12:10.070 --> 04:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
just so you know there's no inspections
 
04:12:11.929 --> 04:12:11.939 align:start position:0%
being done and none of the people that
 
04:12:15.410 --> 04:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
are providing and are being inspected uh
 
04:12:17.269 --> 04:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
that's interesting
 
04:12:20.330 --> 04:12:20.340 align:start position:0%
I don't understand does the board have
 
04:12:22.790 --> 04:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
the authority to
 
04:12:24.889 --> 04:12:24.899 align:start position:0%
to the board has the authority to
 
04:12:26.809 --> 04:12:26.819 align:start position:0%
supervise the practice of Dentistry
 
04:12:26.819 --> 04:12:28.969 align:start position:0%
supervise the practice of Dentistry
correct

04:12:28.969 --> 04:12:28.979 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:12:30.889 --> 04:12:30.899 align:start position:0%
do you need specific legislative
 
04:12:33.349 --> 04:12:33.359 align:start position:0%
authority to deal with
 
04:12:35.630 --> 04:12:35.640 align:start position:0%
it the ad hoc committee is what took
 
04:12:37.309 --> 04:12:37.319 align:start position:0%
they took that away from us well I
 
04:12:38.809 --> 04:12:38.819 align:start position:0%
understand they took away the committee
 
04:12:41.990 --> 04:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
but doesn't don't you have you the board
 
04:12:43.969 --> 04:12:43.979 align:start position:0%
as a whole have that responsibility
 
04:12:43.979 --> 04:12:45.670 align:start position:0%
as a whole have that responsibility
already

04:12:45.670 --> 04:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
already
 
04:12:48.650 --> 04:12:48.660 align:start position:0%
so then it may be harder to do I'm sure
 
04:12:50.929 --> 04:12:50.939 align:start position:0%
so the Asic committee was the committee
 
04:12:54.229 --> 04:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
that was inspecting the dental offices
 
04:12:57.170 --> 04:12:57.180 align:start position:0%
once the asec was disbanded
 
04:12:59.750 --> 04:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
there was we were told that there should
 
04:13:02.269 --> 04:13:02.279 align:start position:0%
be a RFA floated out to hire independent
 
04:13:03.950 --> 04:13:03.960 align:start position:0%
investigators who would go out and
 
04:13:06.229 --> 04:13:06.239 align:start position:0%
conduct those investigations
 
04:13:08.269 --> 04:13:08.279 align:start position:0%
that took a while to be done that was
 
04:13:08.279 --> 04:13:09.050 align:start position:0%
that took a while to be done that was
done

04:13:09.050 --> 04:13:09.060 align:start position:0%
done
 
04:13:11.510 --> 04:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
the investigators have been hired
 
04:13:15.050 --> 04:13:15.060 align:start position:0%
but now oplc is writing rules for their
 
04:13:16.849 --> 04:13:16.859 align:start position:0%
procedures about how will the submit
 
04:13:19.189 --> 04:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
paper work how will they they get paid
 
04:13:21.290 --> 04:13:21.300 align:start position:0%
so that is taking time everything takes
 
04:13:23.210 --> 04:13:23.220 align:start position:0%
time and that's the situation we are in
 
04:13:26.330 --> 04:13:26.340 align:start position:0%
now that okay we can't do what we were
 
04:13:26.340 --> 04:13:27.229 align:start position:0%
now that okay we can't do what we were
doing

04:13:27.229 --> 04:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
doing
 
04:13:29.150 --> 04:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
and so it's an unintended consequence
 
04:13:30.950 --> 04:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
not that somebody intended it to happen
 
04:13:32.269 --> 04:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
that way but that's an unintended
 
04:13:34.130 --> 04:13:34.140 align:start position:0%
consequence until the time those that
 
04:13:36.170 --> 04:13:36.180 align:start position:0%
rule is not in place they can't go out
 
04:13:39.229 --> 04:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
and do the inspection I may interpret it
 
04:13:41.510 --> 04:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
you do have the responsibility and you
 
04:13:44.510 --> 04:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
accept it you are just working out the
 
04:13:46.309 --> 04:13:46.319 align:start position:0%
details of how to accomplish it correct
 
04:13:47.990 --> 04:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
we just we're not there yet but that's
 
04:13:50.330 --> 04:13:50.340 align:start position:0%
what's happening
 
04:13:52.130 --> 04:13:52.140 align:start position:0%
of course the things always take longer
 
04:13:54.670 --> 04:13:54.680 align:start position:0%
than planned it's
 
04:13:56.929 --> 04:13:56.939 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
04:13:59.809 --> 04:13:59.819 align:start position:0%
all right we will uh thank you again and
 
04:14:02.330 --> 04:14:02.340 align:start position:0%
we will appreciate getting your uh your
 
04:14:03.889 --> 04:14:03.899 align:start position:0%
reports on how you're doing on this
 
04:14:06.050 --> 04:14:06.060 align:start position:0%
because we'll make sure it comes through
 
04:14:08.330 --> 04:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you
 
04:14:10.849 --> 04:14:10.859 align:start position:0%
thank you committee
 
04:14:17.330 --> 04:14:17.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:19.370 --> 04:14:19.380 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:14:23.030 --> 04:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
it's right it's your turn
 
04:14:25.309 --> 04:14:25.319 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:14:27.349 --> 04:14:27.359 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon Madam chair members of
 
04:14:28.969 --> 04:14:28.979 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record I'm Lindsey
 
04:14:30.769 --> 04:14:30.779 align:start position:0%
Corney I'm the executive director of The
 
04:14:32.030 --> 04:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
Office of professional Ace insurance
 
04:14:32.040 --> 04:14:34.429 align:start position:0%
Office of professional Ace insurance
certification

04:14:34.429 --> 04:14:34.439 align:start position:0%
certification
 
04:14:36.110 --> 04:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
um I thought I'd just start by giving
 
04:14:38.750 --> 04:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
kind of a bird's-eye view of my
 
04:14:41.389 --> 04:14:41.399 align:start position:0%
perspective on the agency for those of
 
04:14:43.550 --> 04:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
you who are not familiar with the agency
 
04:14:46.429 --> 04:14:46.439 align:start position:0%
uh the agency was created in 2015 for
 
04:14:48.170 --> 04:14:48.180 align:start position:0%
the Budget Trailer
 
04:14:51.290 --> 04:14:51.300 align:start position:0%
um and I am the fifth executive director
 
04:14:54.710 --> 04:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
of the agency that in and of itself has
 
04:14:57.349 --> 04:14:57.359 align:start position:0%
certainly created some turmoil I think
 
04:15:00.250 --> 04:15:00.260 align:start position:0%
over the years and has certainly not
 
04:15:02.830 --> 04:15:02.840 align:start position:0%
helped the situation
 
04:15:05.389 --> 04:15:05.399 align:start position:0%
but generally speaking occupational
 
04:15:07.189 --> 04:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
licensure in New Hampshire has
 
04:15:11.689 --> 04:15:11.699 align:start position:0%
historically been managed by independent
 
04:15:14.210 --> 04:15:14.220 align:start position:0%
regulatory bodies or boards
 
04:15:17.870 --> 04:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
before 2015 all of all of these boards
 
04:15:19.429 --> 04:15:19.439 align:start position:0%
uh well
 
04:15:20.990 --> 04:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to speak very generally
 
04:15:23.769 --> 04:15:23.779 align:start position:0%
all of the boards operated independently
 
04:15:27.229 --> 04:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
kind of typically all over Concord
 
04:15:29.210 --> 04:15:29.220 align:start position:0%
um often in their own lease space with
 
04:15:31.790 --> 04:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
their own staff the staff reported
 
04:15:34.250 --> 04:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
directly to these boards who may or may
 
04:15:37.309 --> 04:15:37.319 align:start position:0%
not have convened a monthly meeting some
 
04:15:39.110 --> 04:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
boards don't meet monthly some boards
 
04:15:40.969 --> 04:15:40.979 align:start position:0%
meet quarterly some words meet once a
 
04:15:43.070 --> 04:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
year some you know you can't ever get
 
04:15:44.870 --> 04:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
them to meet so
 
04:15:47.030 --> 04:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
um in any event uh
 
04:15:49.610 --> 04:15:49.620 align:start position:0%
it it was not
 
04:15:49.620 --> 04:15:51.530 align:start position:0%
it it was not
um

04:15:51.530 --> 04:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:53.870 --> 04:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
it was not a welcomed event I'll just
 
04:15:56.150 --> 04:15:56.160 align:start position:0%
put that way when oplc was created at
 
04:15:58.250 --> 04:15:58.260 align:start position:0%
least from the regulatory side that's my
 
04:16:00.170 --> 04:16:00.180 align:start position:0%
perspective is that particularly on the
 
04:16:04.189 --> 04:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
health side boards and most importantly
 
04:16:06.889 --> 04:16:06.899 align:start position:0%
the staff were not thrilled about being
 
04:16:10.010 --> 04:16:10.020 align:start position:0%
lumped together under one umbrella
 
04:16:12.889 --> 04:16:12.899 align:start position:0%
agency and if you recall that year that
 
04:16:15.229 --> 04:16:15.239 align:start position:0%
year the budget was passed in September
 
04:16:18.170 --> 04:16:18.180 align:start position:0%
retroactive to July so sometime in
 
04:16:19.910 --> 04:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
December everybody was supposed to be in
 
04:16:22.610 --> 04:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
the same building together and it was
 
04:16:22.620 --> 04:16:24.130 align:start position:0%
the same building together and it was
chaos

04:16:24.130 --> 04:16:24.140 align:start position:0%
chaos
 
04:16:27.469 --> 04:16:27.479 align:start position:0%
just from a staffing standpoint as well
 
04:16:27.479 --> 04:16:28.929 align:start position:0%
just from a staffing standpoint as well
as

04:16:28.929 --> 04:16:28.939 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:16:32.630 --> 04:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
people did not understand what the oplc
 
04:16:34.670 --> 04:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
was supposed to be doing versus what the
 
04:16:36.469 --> 04:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
boards were supposed to be doing
 
04:16:38.269 --> 04:16:38.279 align:start position:0%
and they really lacked a clear
 
04:16:38.279 --> 04:16:39.769 align:start position:0%
and they really lacked a clear
management

04:16:39.769 --> 04:16:39.779 align:start position:0%
management
 
04:16:39.779 --> 04:16:42.349 align:start position:0%
management
um

04:16:42.349 --> 04:16:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:45.410 --> 04:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
structure as well as internal controls
 
04:16:49.370 --> 04:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
of course so for many years and by many
 
04:16:51.710 --> 04:16:51.720 align:start position:0%
I mean about four or five they continue
 
04:16:55.010 --> 04:16:55.020 align:start position:0%
to do what they continue to do the staff
 
04:16:56.870 --> 04:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
all worked together with their
 
04:16:59.110 --> 04:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
individual boards there were no changes
 
04:17:02.450 --> 04:17:02.460 align:start position:0%
a few changes in terms of oplc having
 
04:17:04.010 --> 04:17:04.020 align:start position:0%
you know two division directors and
 
04:17:06.950 --> 04:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
executive director we had one one
 
04:17:09.729 --> 04:17:09.739 align:start position:0%
attorney throughout the agency for all
 
04:17:12.889 --> 04:17:12.899 align:start position:0%
50-ish boards at the time
 
04:17:12.899 --> 04:17:14.330 align:start position:0%
50-ish boards at the time
and

04:17:14.330 --> 04:17:14.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:17:18.290 --> 04:17:18.300 align:start position:0%
um really not a lot changed in 2019 I
 
04:17:21.170 --> 04:17:21.180 align:start position:0%
started I had the health division
 
04:17:21.180 --> 04:17:22.849 align:start position:0%
started I had the health division
and

04:17:22.849 --> 04:17:22.859 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:17:25.189 --> 04:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
um that had 34 boards including the
 
04:17:27.889 --> 04:17:27.899 align:start position:0%
board of dental examiners I became
 
04:17:30.410 --> 04:17:30.420 align:start position:0%
interim Ed in February of 2020 right
 
04:17:32.750 --> 04:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
around the time that obviously covet
 
04:17:32.760 --> 04:17:33.790 align:start position:0%
around the time that obviously covet
happened

04:17:33.790 --> 04:17:33.800 align:start position:0%
happened
 
04:17:37.490 --> 04:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
but in early 2020 you know it took us
 
04:17:39.050 --> 04:17:39.060 align:start position:0%
about six months to really understand
 
04:17:39.060 --> 04:17:40.790 align:start position:0%
about six months to really understand
that

04:17:40.790 --> 04:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:17:43.189 --> 04:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
um that that the place was not working
 
04:17:45.590 --> 04:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
well obviously the audit team had
 
04:17:47.809 --> 04:17:47.819 align:start position:0%
identified numerous issues throughout
 
04:17:50.689 --> 04:17:50.699 align:start position:0%
several audits of things that just
 
04:17:52.309 --> 04:17:52.319 align:start position:0%
weren't working well namely the fact
 
04:17:54.349 --> 04:17:54.359 align:start position:0%
that there weren't any internal controls
 
04:17:56.689 --> 04:17:56.699 align:start position:0%
from my perspective it was hard to
 
04:18:00.229 --> 04:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
assess whether boards particularly staff
 
04:18:02.330 --> 04:18:02.340 align:start position:0%
were performing
 
04:18:05.050 --> 04:18:05.060 align:start position:0%
um well there was no data
 
04:18:07.490 --> 04:18:07.500 align:start position:0%
there were you know I mean I could tell
 
04:18:08.809 --> 04:18:08.819 align:start position:0%
you nightmares there were checks being
 
04:18:10.790 --> 04:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
left in drawers I mean it
 
04:18:13.070 --> 04:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of bad things that were
 
04:18:15.050 --> 04:18:15.060 align:start position:0%
not that were happening
 
04:18:17.389 --> 04:18:17.399 align:start position:0%
um so uh working with the governor's
 
04:18:19.250 --> 04:18:19.260 align:start position:0%
office we decided to do an internal
 
04:18:23.210 --> 04:18:23.220 align:start position:0%
restructuring of the staff right around
 
04:18:24.830 --> 04:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
the time of covid
 
04:18:27.889 --> 04:18:27.899 align:start position:0%
so I tell you all of this so that you
 
04:18:31.849 --> 04:18:31.859 align:start position:0%
understand that there with oplc and the
 
04:18:33.229 --> 04:18:33.239 align:start position:0%
boards have been through a lot of
 
04:18:33.239 --> 04:18:34.510 align:start position:0%
boards have been through a lot of
transition

04:18:34.510 --> 04:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
transition
 
04:18:38.210 --> 04:18:38.220 align:start position:0%
we are not the same agency that we were
 
04:18:40.550 --> 04:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
even at the time at the time period that
 
04:18:43.790 --> 04:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
the audit is intended to address
 
04:18:47.090 --> 04:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
and there has been a significant lack of
 
04:18:49.490 --> 04:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
consensus I think across the years over
 
04:18:52.130 --> 04:18:52.140 align:start position:0%
what oplc's role should be versus what
 
04:18:54.170 --> 04:18:54.180 align:start position:0%
the board's rules should be and I think
 
04:18:56.150 --> 04:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
that lack of clarity has certainly
 
04:18:57.769 --> 04:18:57.779 align:start position:0%
contributed to some of the problems
 
04:19:00.469 --> 04:19:00.479 align:start position:0%
identified in the audit
 
04:19:03.410 --> 04:19:03.420 align:start position:0%
um but what are we going to do to
 
04:19:06.229 --> 04:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
address uh the audit findings and I
 
04:19:08.210 --> 04:19:08.220 align:start position:0%
apologize I have my phone here because I
 
04:19:10.490 --> 04:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
was at a medical appointment all evening
 
04:19:13.849 --> 04:19:13.859 align:start position:0%
so I didn't have time to print it plus
 
04:19:16.070 --> 04:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
I'm told there's a toner shortage so
 
04:19:17.510 --> 04:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
trying to be
 
04:19:17.520 --> 04:19:19.370 align:start position:0%
trying to be
economical

04:19:19.370 --> 04:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
economical
 
04:19:19.380 --> 04:19:19.910 align:start position:0%
economical
um

04:19:19.910 --> 04:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:19:23.389 --> 04:19:23.399 align:start position:0%
but in any event what we've done is we
 
04:19:24.889 --> 04:19:24.899 align:start position:0%
have a strategic plan which I'll forward
 
04:19:27.830 --> 04:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
all of you which really is intended to
 
04:19:30.170 --> 04:19:30.180 align:start position:0%
address all of these audit findings in
 
04:19:31.550 --> 04:19:31.560 align:start position:0%
addition to all of the other audit
 
04:19:33.889 --> 04:19:33.899 align:start position:0%
findings and really fix a lot of the
 
04:19:36.290 --> 04:19:36.300 align:start position:0%
major problems impacting oplc and the
 
04:19:38.210 --> 04:19:38.220 align:start position:0%
boards because what you've seen in the
 
04:19:40.309 --> 04:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
Dental Board audit you would see in
 
04:19:43.309 --> 04:19:43.319 align:start position:0%
every other audit of every other board I
 
04:19:46.429 --> 04:19:46.439 align:start position:0%
mean I can they they are not unique and
 
04:19:49.670 --> 04:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
I think part of that is because they are
 
04:19:51.349 --> 04:19:51.359 align:start position:0%
experts in their fields they're not
 
04:19:53.570 --> 04:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
expert regulators and I think as time
 
04:19:57.229 --> 04:19:57.239 align:start position:0%
has gone on and as administration of an
 
04:19:59.570 --> 04:19:59.580 align:start position:0%
agency has become more complex we are
 
04:20:02.269 --> 04:20:02.279 align:start position:0%
asking a lot of our experts in the
 
04:20:05.510 --> 04:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
fields and those things really should be
 
04:20:09.530 --> 04:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
performed by oplc pursuant to rules and
 
04:20:12.110 --> 04:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
regulations and policies and procedures
 
04:20:14.809 --> 04:20:14.819 align:start position:0%
so our primary one of the primary
 
04:20:16.490 --> 04:20:16.500 align:start position:0%
findings obviously who is a complete
 
04:20:19.070 --> 04:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
lack of internal controls which I I 100
 
04:20:21.170 --> 04:20:21.180 align:start position:0%
percent concur with
 
04:20:23.450 --> 04:20:23.460 align:start position:0%
um and so that is definitely our
 
04:20:25.670 --> 04:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
strategic goal our first strategic goal
 
04:20:27.550 --> 04:20:27.560 align:start position:0%
is to fulfill our statutory regular
 
04:20:30.889 --> 04:20:30.899 align:start position:0%
regulatory requirements and some of the
 
04:20:33.290 --> 04:20:33.300 align:start position:0%
strategies that we're utilizing is first
 
04:20:36.110 --> 04:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
we created a position of internal
 
04:20:39.469 --> 04:20:39.479 align:start position:0%
controls and contracts administrator
 
04:20:43.330 --> 04:20:43.340 align:start position:0%
um who who is essentially at first just
 
04:20:46.370 --> 04:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
inventorying all of the requirements
 
04:20:49.010 --> 04:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
that we have to meet in order to comply
 
04:20:51.050 --> 04:20:51.060 align:start position:0%
with the audit recommendations for all
 
04:20:52.849 --> 04:20:52.859 align:start position:0%
of the audits dating back to I think
 
04:20:56.450 --> 04:20:56.460 align:start position:0%
it's 2012 we have outstanding audits
 
04:20:58.910 --> 04:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
um and she is going to be utilizing the
 
04:21:00.830 --> 04:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
guideline established by Das Department
 
04:21:03.710 --> 04:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
of admin services in order to
 
04:21:03.720 --> 04:21:04.550 align:start position:0%
of admin services in order to
um

04:21:04.550 --> 04:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:04.560 --> 04:21:05.889 align:start position:0%
um
to

04:21:05.889 --> 04:21:05.899 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:21:09.110 --> 04:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
document our progress and help us put
 
04:21:11.090 --> 04:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
into place a plan in order to meet the
 
04:21:11.100 --> 04:21:13.429 align:start position:0%
into place a plan in order to meet the
recommendations

04:21:13.429 --> 04:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
04:21:16.309 --> 04:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
um but what we're doing now is
 
04:21:18.769 --> 04:21:18.779 align:start position:0%
inventorying all statutory and
 
04:21:22.070 --> 04:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
regulatory requirements and
 
04:21:24.530 --> 04:21:24.540 align:start position:0%
um so far we've done it for a handful of
 
04:21:27.349 --> 04:21:27.359 align:start position:0%
boards and I can tell you we have not
 
04:21:28.969 --> 04:21:28.979 align:start position:0%
been doing everything that we need to be
 
04:21:28.979 --> 04:21:29.870 align:start position:0%
been doing everything that we need to be
doing

04:21:29.870 --> 04:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
doing
 
04:21:31.849 --> 04:21:31.859 align:start position:0%
um and so we're going through each one
 
04:21:34.250 --> 04:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
of the boards in order to First identify
 
04:21:37.189 --> 04:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
what are the statutory requirements
 
04:21:39.530 --> 04:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
um do we have rules in place that
 
04:21:41.210 --> 04:21:41.220 align:start position:0%
Implement those statutory requirements
 
04:21:43.429 --> 04:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
and do we have policies and procedures
 
04:21:45.410 --> 04:21:45.420 align:start position:0%
um and so that's what we're doing and I
 
04:21:48.710 --> 04:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
estimate across the agency
 
04:21:53.150 --> 04:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
it will likely take us through 2024. I'm
 
04:21:55.729 --> 04:21:55.739 align:start position:0%
really trying to do it as expeditiously
 
04:21:57.590 --> 04:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
as possible because at the same time
 
04:21:59.210 --> 04:21:59.220 align:start position:0%
we're working on a procurement of a new
 
04:22:01.250 --> 04:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
licensing portal and I want to make sure
 
04:22:04.849 --> 04:22:04.859 align:start position:0%
what goes in is is is accurate and that
 
04:22:07.969 --> 04:22:07.979 align:start position:0%
we're not putting items or requirements
 
04:22:10.070 --> 04:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
into the new licensing portal that's not
 
04:22:12.950 --> 04:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
actually required okay excuse me we have
 
04:22:15.710 --> 04:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
a question yeah let's do it
 
04:22:17.870 --> 04:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I didn't want to
 
04:22:17.880 --> 04:22:19.910 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I didn't want to
interrupt

04:22:19.910 --> 04:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
interrupt
 
04:22:22.189 --> 04:22:22.199 align:start position:0%
um I just recall
 
04:22:25.130 --> 04:22:25.140 align:start position:0%
going through the report I saw a few
 
04:22:28.309 --> 04:22:28.319 align:start position:0%
instances where the board stated or I'm
 
04:22:30.889 --> 04:22:30.899 align:start position:0%
sorry where the auditor stated that the
 
04:22:35.030 --> 04:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
board needed more public members and I
 
04:22:35.040 --> 04:22:36.349 align:start position:0%
board needed more public members and I
recall

04:22:36.349 --> 04:22:36.359 align:start position:0%
recall
 
04:22:39.170 --> 04:22:39.180 align:start position:0%
over the pandemic particularly you
 
04:22:41.990 --> 04:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
testifying that many boards were having
 
04:22:44.750 --> 04:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
that difficulty and I was just curious
 
04:22:48.469 --> 04:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
if that has eased any have you seen more
 
04:22:50.990 --> 04:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
people from the public being willing to
 
04:22:54.590 --> 04:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
serve on this and other boards I think
 
04:22:56.929 --> 04:22:56.939 align:start position:0%
we've seen greater increase in the
 
04:22:58.969 --> 04:22:58.979 align:start position:0%
number of professionals seeking board
 
04:23:01.130 --> 04:23:01.140 align:start position:0%
membership because we've changed our
 
04:23:03.769 --> 04:23:03.779 align:start position:0%
process for um
 
04:23:06.710 --> 04:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
trying to Market uh in a team but public
 
04:23:08.389 --> 04:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
members are often difficult to find
 
04:23:11.389 --> 04:23:11.399 align:start position:0%
because our the base the people that we
 
04:23:13.130 --> 04:23:13.140 align:start position:0%
have to communicate with are
 
04:23:13.140 --> 04:23:14.809 align:start position:0%
have to communicate with are
professionals

04:23:14.809 --> 04:23:14.819 align:start position:0%
professionals
 
04:23:16.849 --> 04:23:16.859 align:start position:0%
um so we rely often on Word of Mouth and
 
04:23:18.469 --> 04:23:18.479 align:start position:0%
we have not seen an increase in the
 
04:23:20.050 --> 04:23:20.060 align:start position:0%
interest in public participation
 
04:23:24.050 --> 04:23:24.060 align:start position:0%
unfortunately yes I do hope uh director
 
04:23:26.210 --> 04:23:26.220 align:start position:0%
that while you're looking at all these
 
04:23:29.030 --> 04:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
requirements if you find a bunch of them
 
04:23:31.070 --> 04:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
that have not been implemented for years
 
04:23:33.710 --> 04:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
you suggest we get rid of them oh of
 
04:23:36.170 --> 04:23:36.180 align:start position:0%
course thank you because I'm sure there
 
04:23:38.630 --> 04:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
are some representative Fitzpatrick
 
04:23:41.809 --> 04:23:41.819 align:start position:0%
um please please uh
 
04:23:46.490 --> 04:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
bear with a new one new person here does
 
04:23:50.750 --> 04:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
your office handle licensure for all of
 
04:23:53.870 --> 04:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
the medical professions from Physicians
 
04:23:57.410 --> 04:23:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:59.689 --> 04:23:59.699 align:start position:0%
Department pardon me nurses yes we have
 
04:24:02.030 --> 04:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
all of them with the exception of EMTs
 
04:24:04.510 --> 04:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
that's with Department of Safety
 
04:24:07.189 --> 04:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
there is health facility licensure
 
04:24:08.570 --> 04:24:08.580 align:start position:0%
that's with Department of Health and
 
04:24:10.969 --> 04:24:10.979 align:start position:0%
Human Services but for the most part we
 
04:24:13.370 --> 04:24:13.380 align:start position:0%
have all of them and did I understand
 
04:24:15.650 --> 04:24:15.660 align:start position:0%
that I heard earlier you have a staff of
 
04:24:19.670 --> 04:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
five no that's just for the group that
 
04:24:22.429 --> 04:24:22.439 align:start position:0%
Dental's in so right now
 
04:24:28.130 --> 04:24:28.140 align:start position:0%
um we have 20 24 licensing staff I have
 
04:24:30.469 --> 04:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
several open positions because I just
 
04:24:33.290 --> 04:24:33.300 align:start position:0%
created new temporary positions
 
04:24:36.170 --> 04:24:36.180 align:start position:0%
um we have a total authorized Workforce
 
04:24:40.070 --> 04:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
of 126. thank you
 
04:24:41.750 --> 04:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
so we're working on inventorying
 
04:24:43.610 --> 04:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
requirements and that's that's the
 
04:24:45.590 --> 04:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
initial stage and we're we're taking it
 
04:24:47.750 --> 04:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
in chunks because of our need to prepare
 
04:24:49.250 --> 04:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
a new licensing portal so we're really
 
04:24:51.889 --> 04:24:51.899 align:start position:0%
focusing on both the renewal and the
 
04:24:54.050 --> 04:24:54.060 align:start position:0%
initial licensure requirements trying to
 
04:24:57.590 --> 04:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
get that inventoried prior to the
 
04:25:00.050 --> 04:25:00.060 align:start position:0%
inventory of other requirements but that
 
04:25:02.330 --> 04:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
is our focus and I anticipate it'll take
 
04:25:06.830 --> 04:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
a couple of years just because it it's a
 
04:25:09.590 --> 04:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
lot of work and unfortunately
 
04:25:11.809 --> 04:25:11.819 align:start position:0%
um because unfortunately or fortunately
 
04:25:13.429 --> 04:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
because I want to get it accurate I have
 
04:25:14.990 --> 04:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
our attorneys working on doing that
 
04:25:16.969 --> 04:25:16.979 align:start position:0%
initial assessment as to what's required
 
04:25:19.010 --> 04:25:19.020 align:start position:0%
and what's not required because a lot of
 
04:25:21.050 --> 04:25:21.060 align:start position:0%
the issues that have
 
04:25:23.870 --> 04:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
um that exist are because
 
04:25:25.550 --> 04:25:25.560 align:start position:0%
people didn't know any better and they
 
04:25:27.110 --> 04:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
just created processes or they
 
04:25:30.110 --> 04:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
interpreted the law incorrectly and they
 
04:25:32.090 --> 04:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
just created a procedure or did
 
04:25:34.490 --> 04:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
something and so on so we're relying on
 
04:25:36.290 --> 04:25:36.300 align:start position:0%
our legal staff to do that initial
 
04:25:36.300 --> 04:25:37.490 align:start position:0%
our legal staff to do that initial
inventory

04:25:37.490 --> 04:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
inventory
 
04:25:39.290 --> 04:25:39.300 align:start position:0%
um to determine what we have to do and
 
04:25:41.689 --> 04:25:41.699 align:start position:0%
what we don't have to do
 
04:25:44.990 --> 04:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
so our second strategic goal is to
 
04:25:47.710 --> 04:25:47.720 align:start position:0%
enhance customer service
 
04:25:50.630 --> 04:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
obviously I consider that to fall within
 
04:25:51.769 --> 04:25:51.779 align:start position:0%
the scope of what we're supposed to be
 
04:25:54.469 --> 04:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
doing as a state agency and our Focus
 
04:25:56.269 --> 04:25:56.279 align:start position:0%
here is to really procure new licensing
 
04:25:57.649 --> 04:25:57.659 align:start position:0%
solution that will enable customer
 
04:26:02.570 --> 04:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
service and I think what this gets to is
 
04:26:05.389 --> 04:26:05.399 align:start position:0%
it all it's all intertwined so we need
 
04:26:07.309 --> 04:26:07.319 align:start position:0%
to have internal controls in place to
 
04:26:11.090 --> 04:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
ensure that we are asking people to to
 
04:26:13.070 --> 04:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
perform tasks that they are required to
 
04:26:15.889 --> 04:26:15.899 align:start position:0%
perform in order to obtain a license and
 
04:26:17.450 --> 04:26:17.460 align:start position:0%
for example I personally just
 
04:26:19.189 --> 04:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
inventoried uh the Board of Medicine
 
04:26:21.349 --> 04:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
requirements licensure requirements I
 
04:26:22.910 --> 04:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
can tell you
 
04:26:25.490 --> 04:26:25.500 align:start position:0%
um there was that was a 27 step process
 
04:26:25.500 --> 04:26:26.740 align:start position:0%
um there was that was a 27 step process
and

04:26:26.740 --> 04:26:26.750 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:26:26.750 --> 04:26:27.950 align:start position:0%
and
[Music]

04:26:27.950 --> 04:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:26:30.110 --> 04:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
that took almost a year for a physician
 
04:26:32.269 --> 04:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
to get licensed
 
04:26:35.030 --> 04:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
um they were asking for over 50 percent
 
04:26:37.070 --> 04:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
of the requirements were not called for
 
04:26:39.229 --> 04:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
in statute or rule so we got rid of that
 
04:26:42.590 --> 04:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
we got it down to five steps and with
 
04:26:44.630 --> 04:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
documented policies and procedures now
 
04:26:47.450 --> 04:26:47.460 align:start position:0%
we're seeing applications go through in
 
04:26:48.889 --> 04:26:48.899 align:start position:0%
a reasonable time frame of what's
 
04:26:53.630 --> 04:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
required by 541 a so that's great but
 
04:26:56.210 --> 04:26:56.220 align:start position:0%
we're going to be working with doit we
 
04:26:58.189 --> 04:26:58.199 align:start position:0%
received some marpa funding in order to
 
04:27:00.590 --> 04:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
procure a new licensing solution
 
04:27:03.170 --> 04:27:03.180 align:start position:0%
um that'll that'll hope that will I
 
04:27:05.570 --> 04:27:05.580 align:start position:0%
think address some of the I.T concerns
 
04:27:07.429 --> 04:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
particularly the auditing capabilities
 
04:27:09.610 --> 04:27:09.620 align:start position:0%
that you may notice in the report
 
04:27:12.889 --> 04:27:12.899 align:start position:0%
that's an Enterprise solution that was
 
04:27:16.250 --> 04:27:16.260 align:start position:0%
prepared by doit so you we will see that
 
04:27:18.349 --> 04:27:18.359 align:start position:0%
on the horizon over the next
 
04:27:21.649 --> 04:27:21.659 align:start position:0%
um the next year or so we'll be
 
04:27:23.330 --> 04:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
implementing a new licensing solution
 
04:27:25.910 --> 04:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
04:27:27.649 --> 04:27:27.659 align:start position:0%
um you say you're doing it board by
 
04:27:31.070 --> 04:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
board essentially yes
 
04:27:34.010 --> 04:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
could I ask what your priority is or how
 
04:27:35.990 --> 04:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
you're choosing which ones to do next
 
04:27:36.000 --> 04:27:37.370 align:start position:0%
you're choosing which ones to do next
yes

04:27:37.370 --> 04:27:37.380 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:27:40.670 --> 04:27:40.680 align:start position:0%
um we are prioritizing based on impact
 
04:27:42.590 --> 04:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
to the public
 
04:27:42.600 --> 04:27:43.849 align:start position:0%
to the public
so

04:27:43.849 --> 04:27:43.859 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:27:46.969 --> 04:27:46.979 align:start position:0%
um for example physician licensure has
 
04:27:50.330 --> 04:27:50.340 align:start position:0%
been taking upwards of a year we have a
 
04:27:52.610 --> 04:27:52.620 align:start position:0%
large number of physician applications
 
04:27:55.370 --> 04:27:55.380 align:start position:0%
given the workforce issues we decided to
 
04:27:57.889 --> 04:27:57.899 align:start position:0%
focus on physician I personally focus on
 
04:27:59.630 --> 04:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
physician licensure I have somebody else
 
04:28:02.510 --> 04:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
working on nursing licensure and then
 
04:28:03.830 --> 04:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
I'm separately working on funeral
 
04:28:06.590 --> 04:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
because well that doesn't impact the
 
04:28:06.600 --> 04:28:08.090 align:start position:0%
because well that doesn't impact the
public

04:28:08.090 --> 04:28:08.100 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:28:09.769 --> 04:28:09.779 align:start position:0%
I think Steve would have a field day
 
04:28:11.929 --> 04:28:11.939 align:start position:0%
over here with that one so we're trying
 
04:28:14.090 --> 04:28:14.100 align:start position:0%
to get ahead of that situation and make
 
04:28:16.130 --> 04:28:16.140 align:start position:0%
sure that um they're following the rules
 
04:28:18.170 --> 04:28:18.180 align:start position:0%
but it's generally
 
04:28:21.229 --> 04:28:21.239 align:start position:0%
the impact to the public okay I hope the
 
04:28:22.910 --> 04:28:22.920 align:start position:0%
board of mental health practice is high
 
04:28:25.910 --> 04:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
on the list because I remember we you
 
04:28:28.070 --> 04:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
were you saying that a large percentage
 
04:28:32.870 --> 04:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
of their licenses are emergency licenses
 
04:28:37.849 --> 04:28:37.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:40.010 --> 04:28:40.020 align:start position:0%
um Madam chair can you uh could you
 
04:28:41.689 --> 04:28:41.699 align:start position:0%
please repeat what you said just
 
04:28:43.189 --> 04:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
previously which one was a total mess
 
04:28:45.530 --> 04:28:45.540 align:start position:0%
you said once total Mexican have a field
 
04:28:48.229 --> 04:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
day well what was that uh there was the
 
04:28:49.309 --> 04:28:49.319 align:start position:0%
board of registration of funeral
 
04:28:52.990 --> 04:28:53.000 align:start position:0%
directors and embalmers and they are um
 
04:28:55.429 --> 04:28:55.439 align:start position:0%
they're they're collaborating with us
 
04:28:57.349 --> 04:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
they're coming to the table
 
04:28:58.790 --> 04:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
um one of the issues that we identified
 
04:29:00.349 --> 04:29:00.359 align:start position:0%
was that they don't have a renewal
 
04:29:03.170 --> 04:29:03.180 align:start position:0%
application so in the past in order to
 
04:29:05.450 --> 04:29:05.460 align:start position:0%
renew a board member would just call
 
04:29:05.460 --> 04:29:06.469 align:start position:0%
renew a board member would just call
somebody

04:29:06.469 --> 04:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
04:29:09.170 --> 04:29:09.180 align:start position:0%
and go and do an inspection and
 
04:29:10.969 --> 04:29:10.979 align:start position:0%
oftentimes their license had already
 
04:29:13.309 --> 04:29:13.319 align:start position:0%
expired but it was fine because the
 
04:29:14.929 --> 04:29:14.939 align:start position:0%
board member couldn't get to it and the
 
04:29:16.130 --> 04:29:16.140 align:start position:0%
board member was collecting the money
 
04:29:18.349 --> 04:29:18.359 align:start position:0%
and then holding on to them I mean so
 
04:29:20.090 --> 04:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
we're remedying those issues but those
 
04:29:22.729 --> 04:29:22.739 align:start position:0%
are the issues that we're finding when
 
04:29:25.550 --> 04:29:25.560 align:start position:0%
we're conducting this inventory both of
 
04:29:28.670 --> 04:29:28.680 align:start position:0%
Statute rule but also existing process
 
04:29:31.670 --> 04:29:31.680 align:start position:0%
and I do want to mention that
 
04:29:35.389 --> 04:29:35.399 align:start position:0%
unlike creating other agencies where you
 
04:29:36.769 --> 04:29:36.779 align:start position:0%
can start fresh
 
04:29:39.950 --> 04:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
creating oplc was had a different
 
04:29:42.050 --> 04:29:42.060 align:start position:0%
challenge in the sense that we inherited
 
04:29:44.030 --> 04:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of workflows and the staff at
 
04:29:47.090 --> 04:29:47.100 align:start position:0%
times were hostile to having oversight
 
04:29:49.429 --> 04:29:49.439 align:start position:0%
and there was some information hoarding
 
04:29:52.969 --> 04:29:52.979 align:start position:0%
going on so we we
 
04:29:55.309 --> 04:29:55.319 align:start position:0%
um you know we asked the questions and
 
04:29:56.929 --> 04:29:56.939 align:start position:0%
we asked the questions again and then
 
04:29:58.429 --> 04:29:58.439 align:start position:0%
maybe on the fifth time we actually
 
04:30:00.769 --> 04:30:00.779 align:start position:0%
understand what's actually going on so
 
04:30:03.830 --> 04:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
that is part of the challenge but I will
 
04:30:06.309 --> 04:30:06.319 align:start position:0%
say that we've turned the staff over
 
04:30:09.170 --> 04:30:09.180 align:start position:0%
which has been pretty positive
 
04:30:12.170 --> 04:30:12.180 align:start position:0%
um about 80 percent since I started and
 
04:30:14.689 --> 04:30:14.699 align:start position:0%
it and everybody's you know very excited
 
04:30:14.699 --> 04:30:15.649 align:start position:0%
it and everybody's you know very excited
to

04:30:15.649 --> 04:30:15.659 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:30:18.410 --> 04:30:18.420 align:start position:0%
um to really comply with the law which
 
04:30:20.750 --> 04:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
is the goal right so
 
04:30:20.760 --> 04:30:23.149 align:start position:0%
is the goal right so
laughs

04:30:23.149 --> 04:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
laughs
 
04:30:25.550 --> 04:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
senator blackis of that neighbor
 
04:30:27.830 --> 04:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
04:30:29.330 --> 04:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
so I can kind of see how you got where
 
04:30:30.469 --> 04:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
you are
 
04:30:32.750 --> 04:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
um I wasn't involved you know when oplc
 
04:30:34.429 --> 04:30:34.439 align:start position:0%
got created and I have to admit I have
 
04:30:36.469 --> 04:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
not read all the statutes on this
 
04:30:36.479 --> 04:30:37.070 align:start position:0%
not read all the statutes on this
um

04:30:37.070 --> 04:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:40.610 --> 04:30:40.620 align:start position:0%
but let me Express kind of my vision of
 
04:30:42.950 --> 04:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
where it should end up and tell me if
 
04:30:45.830 --> 04:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
this is in fact what you're trying to do
 
04:30:48.769 --> 04:30:48.779 align:start position:0%
and that is that I mean all the
 
04:30:51.110 --> 04:30:51.120 align:start position:0%
processing applications for new things
 
04:30:54.469 --> 04:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
and renewals and reports of complaints
 
04:30:57.469 --> 04:30:57.479 align:start position:0%
and all that we go through oplc and I
 
04:30:58.790 --> 04:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
would think you'd have staff working for
 
04:31:01.550 --> 04:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
oplc that would you know package up a
 
04:31:03.830 --> 04:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
set of agenda items for a board only for
 
04:31:06.710 --> 04:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
the decisions that need the
 
04:31:09.530 --> 04:31:09.540 align:start position:0%
professionals expertise and that any
 
04:31:11.570 --> 04:31:11.580 align:start position:0%
licensing renewal requirements which are
 
04:31:13.670 --> 04:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
laid out clearly in statute and don't
 
04:31:15.950 --> 04:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
require that kind of analysis would
 
04:31:18.710 --> 04:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
happen automatically and that the only
 
04:31:21.429 --> 04:31:21.439 align:start position:0%
thing the licensing boards would do
 
04:31:24.410 --> 04:31:24.420 align:start position:0%
would be to be presented with these
 
04:31:26.030 --> 04:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
decisions to make that require their
 
04:31:28.550 --> 04:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
expertise and maybe you know do planning
 
04:31:31.070 --> 04:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
for as the profession changes and you
 
04:31:32.330 --> 04:31:32.340 align:start position:0%
know what might be needed in the future
 
04:31:35.389 --> 04:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
is that reasonable or am I off base
 
04:31:38.030 --> 04:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
yes that's precisely what I think the
 
04:31:39.649 --> 04:31:39.659 align:start position:0%
difference in rules should be I would
 
04:31:41.149 --> 04:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
like the board members to spend more
 
04:31:43.969 --> 04:31:43.979 align:start position:0%
time engaging in forward-thinking policy
 
04:31:46.429 --> 04:31:46.439 align:start position:0%
analysis as opposed to the day-to-day
 
04:31:48.290 --> 04:31:48.300 align:start position:0%
stuff that is required of them by
 
04:31:51.550 --> 04:31:51.560 align:start position:0%
Statute additionally my position is that
 
04:31:54.170 --> 04:31:54.180 align:start position:0%
licensing should should not contain
 
04:31:56.689 --> 04:31:56.699 align:start position:0%
subjective elements you know they're
 
04:31:58.490 --> 04:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
always going to be those one-offs with
 
04:32:00.050 --> 04:32:00.060 align:start position:0%
criminal history checks that requires
 
04:32:03.649 --> 04:32:03.659 align:start position:0%
judgment that certainly Beyond a matrix
 
04:32:05.389 --> 04:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
you know the board can take a look at
 
04:32:07.969 --> 04:32:07.979 align:start position:0%
that but from a Workforce standpoint we
 
04:32:10.189 --> 04:32:10.199 align:start position:0%
we just can't wait you know 30 60 days
 
04:32:11.990 --> 04:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
for people to convene meetings so that
 
04:32:13.910 --> 04:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
structure doesn't make sense
 
04:32:17.510 --> 04:32:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:19.790 --> 04:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
04:32:21.910 --> 04:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
being here
 
04:32:26.090 --> 04:32:26.100 align:start position:0%
my question is that
 
04:32:28.969 --> 04:32:28.979 align:start position:0%
you have a number of boards that you are
 
04:32:31.429 --> 04:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
reviewing and looking at as a result of
 
04:32:34.490 --> 04:32:34.500 align:start position:0%
this one audit is that correct I
 
04:32:35.809 --> 04:32:35.819 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say it's a result of the one
 
04:32:37.790 --> 04:32:37.800 align:start position:0%
audit I would say that the audit has
 
04:32:39.410 --> 04:32:39.420 align:start position:0%
helped inform
 
04:32:41.929 --> 04:32:41.939 align:start position:0%
um provide a path forward but to be
 
04:32:43.729 --> 04:32:43.739 align:start position:0%
honest with you a lot of the issues that
 
04:32:46.010 --> 04:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
were identified were issues that we
 
04:32:48.170 --> 04:32:48.180 align:start position:0%
already had already identified and were
 
04:32:49.969 --> 04:32:49.979 align:start position:0%
already working on
 
04:32:52.969 --> 04:32:52.979 align:start position:0%
um this is just providing us with a
 
04:32:54.229 --> 04:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
clear roadmap
 
04:32:56.689 --> 04:32:56.699 align:start position:0%
understood follow-on question
 
04:33:00.950 --> 04:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:02.689 --> 04:33:02.699 align:start position:0%
the um
 
04:33:05.869 --> 04:33:05.879 align:start position:0%
just more of a comment hearing that
 
04:33:08.869 --> 04:33:08.879 align:start position:0%
we're creating positions we're getting
 
04:33:12.349 --> 04:33:12.359 align:start position:0%
temporary attorney help this will be a
 
04:33:15.349 --> 04:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
cost to the taxpayers for something that
 
04:33:16.970 --> 04:33:16.980 align:start position:0%
should have been
 
04:33:21.289 --> 04:33:21.299 align:start position:0%
done all along is that correct no oplc
 
04:33:24.709 --> 04:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
is self-funded by licensure fees so we
 
04:33:27.970 --> 04:33:27.980 align:start position:0%
don't rely on the general fund or taxes
 
04:33:31.131 --> 04:33:31.141 align:start position:0%
and we're required to spend our our
 
04:33:34.310 --> 04:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
funding on licensure you know agency
 
04:33:37.250 --> 04:33:37.260 align:start position:0%
activities we have not
 
04:33:39.709 --> 04:33:39.719 align:start position:0%
um we have been able to utilize existing
 
04:33:41.750 --> 04:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
funds historically we've lapsed a
 
04:33:43.970 --> 04:33:43.980 align:start position:0%
substantial sum to the general fund so
 
04:33:45.830 --> 04:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
I'm creating these additional temporary
 
04:33:47.929 --> 04:33:47.939 align:start position:0%
positions did not impact anything other
 
04:33:50.209 --> 04:33:50.219 align:start position:0%
than our lapse to the general fund
 
04:33:52.189 --> 04:33:52.199 align:start position:0%
I was just confused by the arpa thank
 
04:33:52.199 --> 04:33:54.189 align:start position:0%
I was just confused by the arpa thank
you

04:33:54.189 --> 04:33:54.199 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:33:56.869 --> 04:33:56.879 align:start position:0%
Madam chair thank you now this if this
 
04:33:58.910 --> 04:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
is totally outside I'm just ignorant of
 
04:34:01.189 --> 04:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
this I'm concerned I know some nurses
 
04:34:02.869 --> 04:34:02.879 align:start position:0%
and I know doctors were put under
 
04:34:04.789 --> 04:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
pressure not to prescribe certain
 
04:34:06.170 --> 04:34:06.180 align:start position:0%
treatments and all that and the boards
 
04:34:07.250 --> 04:34:07.260 align:start position:0%
came after them and now we're hearing
 
04:34:09.051 --> 04:34:09.061 align:start position:0%
that well I'm hearing at least that the
 
04:34:10.849 --> 04:34:10.859 align:start position:0%
boards have some issues to begin with
 
04:34:13.189 --> 04:34:13.199 align:start position:0%
internally is there anything to check
 
04:34:15.051 --> 04:34:15.061 align:start position:0%
the power of the boards as far as you're
 
04:34:17.029 --> 04:34:17.039 align:start position:0%
concerned or their decisions are gold
 
04:34:19.189 --> 04:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
and then everything else is
 
04:34:23.929 --> 04:34:23.939 align:start position:0%
do you follow so yes I well I think we
 
04:34:26.689 --> 04:34:26.699 align:start position:0%
are both independent agencies
 
04:34:29.269 --> 04:34:29.279 align:start position:0%
um there's a question I'm I'm waiting on
 
04:34:31.250 --> 04:34:31.260 align:start position:0%
a legal opinion for there's one part of
 
04:34:33.890 --> 04:34:33.900 align:start position:0%
our RSA that talks about supervision and
 
04:34:37.369 --> 04:34:37.379 align:start position:0%
rulemaking activities but beyond that
 
04:34:38.990 --> 04:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
um we are just Independent Regulatory
 
04:34:41.349 --> 04:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
Agencies but we're both subject to
 
04:34:45.410 --> 04:34:45.420 align:start position:0%
oversight legal oversight of doj and one
 
04:34:47.150 --> 04:34:47.160 align:start position:0%
of the things that we've done is ensure
 
04:34:49.250 --> 04:34:49.260 align:start position:0%
that an attorney is present in every
 
04:34:51.189 --> 04:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
board meeting because we'd rather
 
04:34:55.189 --> 04:34:55.199 align:start position:0%
proactively prevent things from
 
04:34:58.730 --> 04:34:58.740 align:start position:0%
going the wrong way rather than cleaning
 
04:35:02.269 --> 04:35:02.279 align:start position:0%
up a mess and so our expectation is that
 
04:35:05.330 --> 04:35:05.340 align:start position:0%
if those concerns arose that
 
04:35:06.830 --> 04:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
um that the Attorney General's office
 
04:35:08.689 --> 04:35:08.699 align:start position:0%
would provide that oversight that's the
 
04:35:11.029 --> 04:35:11.039 align:start position:0%
only mechanism that I'm aware of for
 
04:35:13.551 --> 04:35:13.561 align:start position:0%
oversight of either agency all right
 
04:35:16.131 --> 04:35:16.141 align:start position:0%
thank you well in some cases the scope
 
04:35:20.990 --> 04:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:25.189 --> 04:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:27.529 --> 04:35:27.539 align:start position:0%
government what they can do and can't do
 
04:35:30.769 --> 04:35:30.779 align:start position:0%
so yes the scope of practice what they
 
04:35:33.470 --> 04:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
could do and can't do the find it fine
 
04:35:35.150 --> 04:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
interpretation you're talking about
 
04:35:37.369 --> 04:35:37.379 align:start position:0%
though is not something that probably
 
04:35:42.310 --> 04:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:44.750 --> 04:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
I assume uh correct me if I'm wrong but
 
04:35:46.609 --> 04:35:46.619 align:start position:0%
ultimately if somebody has a dispute
 
04:35:48.230 --> 04:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
with what the board's doing it's a
 
04:35:50.390 --> 04:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
matter of taking them to court
 
04:35:53.449 --> 04:35:53.459 align:start position:0%
right yes
 
04:35:55.070 --> 04:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
um you can always appeal to the Supreme
 
04:35:57.410 --> 04:35:57.420 align:start position:0%
Court if you have an adverse decision or
 
04:35:59.449 --> 04:35:59.459 align:start position:0%
certainly seek a declaratory ruling or
 
04:36:04.449 --> 04:36:04.459 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:04.459 --> 04:36:06.051 align:start position:0%
 
excellent

04:36:06.051 --> 04:36:06.061 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
04:36:08.631 --> 04:36:08.641 align:start position:0%
um so then our third strategic goal and
 
04:36:10.429 --> 04:36:10.439 align:start position:0%
again I'll circulate this as well as our
 
04:36:11.810 --> 04:36:11.820 align:start position:0%
annual report I think there was a
 
04:36:13.310 --> 04:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
question earlier about the number of
 
04:36:14.990 --> 04:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
complaints that had gone to adjudication
 
04:36:17.990 --> 04:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
that's captured on our annual report so
 
04:36:20.269 --> 04:36:20.279 align:start position:0%
I'll circulate that as well but our
 
04:36:21.650 --> 04:36:21.660 align:start position:0%
third strategical would be to increase
 
04:36:23.349 --> 04:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
licensure portability
 
04:36:25.849 --> 04:36:25.859 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to highlight because we're
 
04:36:28.310 --> 04:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the audit is that we
 
04:36:29.929 --> 04:36:29.939 align:start position:0%
are looking to collaborate with and
 
04:36:31.730 --> 04:36:31.740 align:start position:0%
assist boards to reduce and streamline
 
04:36:31.740 --> 04:36:33.369 align:start position:0%
assist boards to reduce and streamline
regulations

04:36:33.369 --> 04:36:33.379 align:start position:0%
regulations
 
04:36:35.750 --> 04:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
a couple of boards come to mind not
 
04:36:37.730 --> 04:36:37.740 align:start position:0%
necessarily Dental but where there's
 
04:36:40.070 --> 04:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
just a lot of regulations and it's very
 
04:36:42.051 --> 04:36:42.061 align:start position:0%
difficult I think even for attorneys to
 
04:36:44.029 --> 04:36:44.039 align:start position:0%
navigate through so it's not necessarily
 
04:36:46.789 --> 04:36:46.799 align:start position:0%
what's written but how it's written
 
04:36:48.949 --> 04:36:48.959 align:start position:0%
um that we're we're hoping to
 
04:36:52.250 --> 04:36:52.260 align:start position:0%
collaborate with the boards on and in
 
04:36:54.170 --> 04:36:54.180 align:start position:0%
particular to help them redraft all of
 
04:36:56.269 --> 04:36:56.279 align:start position:0%
their rules back in the day a lot of the
 
04:36:59.631 --> 04:36:59.641 align:start position:0%
rules were drafted by their staff who
 
04:37:02.631 --> 04:37:02.641 align:start position:0%
may have been you know mid label labor
 
04:37:06.349 --> 04:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
grade level person and and or board
 
04:37:10.189 --> 04:37:10.199 align:start position:0%
member and maybe there's a better way to
 
04:37:13.849 --> 04:37:13.859 align:start position:0%
articulate what they're looking to do
 
04:37:17.090 --> 04:37:17.100 align:start position:0%
and then finally for our fourth
 
04:37:19.670 --> 04:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
strategic goal is we'd like to help the
 
04:37:22.429 --> 04:37:22.439 align:start position:0%
boards promote public protection and we
 
04:37:25.010 --> 04:37:25.020 align:start position:0%
are we have been trying to procure an
 
04:37:27.051 --> 04:37:27.061 align:start position:0%
enforcement case management system to
 
04:37:29.029 --> 04:37:29.039 align:start position:0%
track enforcement Trends promote timely
 
04:37:31.849 --> 04:37:31.859 align:start position:0%
processing of Enforcement cases and
 
04:37:34.369 --> 04:37:34.379 align:start position:0%
ensure consistent consistency and
 
04:37:37.789 --> 04:37:37.799 align:start position:0%
outcome since I started in 2019 we have
 
04:37:40.010 --> 04:37:40.020 align:start position:0%
a path forward we're going to work that
 
04:37:42.830 --> 04:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
into our procurement of our licensing
 
04:37:44.810 --> 04:37:44.820 align:start position:0%
portal so that all information is
 
04:37:47.810 --> 04:37:47.820 align:start position:0%
captured in the same database the goal
 
04:37:50.109 --> 04:37:50.119 align:start position:0%
being that obviously
 
04:37:52.910 --> 04:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
it's completely unacceptable for an
 
04:37:55.429 --> 04:37:55.439 align:start position:0%
agency to lose track of cases that is
 
04:37:57.709 --> 04:37:57.719 align:start position:0%
the sole purpose really of a regulatory
 
04:37:59.390 --> 04:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
board is to promote public protection
 
04:38:02.750 --> 04:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
and respond to complaints so we have it
 
04:38:05.029 --> 04:38:05.039 align:start position:0%
we have a system in place now but it's
 
04:38:06.709 --> 04:38:06.719 align:start position:0%
quite rudimentary with our Excel
 
04:38:08.390 --> 04:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet so we'd like to migrate to
 
04:38:10.131 --> 04:38:10.141 align:start position:0%
something that allows for a little bit
 
04:38:13.189 --> 04:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
more robust analysis so that the boards
 
04:38:15.410 --> 04:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
can see trend you know if they are
 
04:38:18.070 --> 04:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
seeing Trends in let's say opioid
 
04:38:18.080 --> 04:38:19.631 align:start position:0%
seeing Trends in let's say opioid
prescription

04:38:19.631 --> 04:38:19.641 align:start position:0%
prescription
 
04:38:22.070 --> 04:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
are too high or something to that effect
 
04:38:23.750 --> 04:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
then maybe they can be proactive about
 
04:38:25.609 --> 04:38:25.619 align:start position:0%
continuing education and really be
 
04:38:27.709 --> 04:38:27.719 align:start position:0%
proactive instead of reactive in their
 
04:38:27.719 --> 04:38:29.150 align:start position:0%
proactive instead of reactive in their
regulation

04:38:29.150 --> 04:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
04:38:32.689 --> 04:38:32.699 align:start position:0%
so again I expect the internal controls
 
04:38:36.289 --> 04:38:36.299 align:start position:0%
piece to take up approximately two years
 
04:38:39.109 --> 04:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
through 2024 at least on the licensing
 
04:38:42.310 --> 04:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
side because we're hoping to have
 
04:38:45.349 --> 04:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
our system migrated at that point in
 
04:38:47.390 --> 04:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
time and therefore when we need to have
 
04:38:49.789 --> 04:38:49.799 align:start position:0%
internal controls in place but it's
 
04:38:52.570 --> 04:38:52.580 align:start position:0%
going to be an ongoing process of really
 
04:38:55.250 --> 04:38:55.260 align:start position:0%
evaluating conducting risk assessments
 
04:38:56.810 --> 04:38:56.820 align:start position:0%
making sure that we have the appropriate
 
04:38:58.330 --> 04:38:58.340 align:start position:0%
staff in place
 
04:39:02.810 --> 04:39:02.820 align:start position:0%
and I think you know if we had adequate
 
04:39:04.670 --> 04:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
internal controls in place we probably
 
04:39:07.490 --> 04:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
could reduce the size of our staff I
 
04:39:10.429 --> 04:39:10.439 align:start position:0%
think the the issue that we have right
 
04:39:13.429 --> 04:39:13.439 align:start position:0%
now is just that we don't have one
 
04:39:15.650 --> 04:39:15.660 align:start position:0%
streamlined approach and that's that's
 
04:39:18.170 --> 04:39:18.180 align:start position:0%
our goal so with that I'm happy to
 
04:39:19.670 --> 04:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you may have
 
04:39:21.410 --> 04:39:21.420 align:start position:0%
regarding the oplc the audit or anything
 
04:39:21.420 --> 04:39:26.209 align:start position:0%
regarding the oplc the audit or anything
else

04:39:26.209 --> 04:39:26.219 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:27.890 --> 04:39:27.900 align:start position:0%
all right last one let's just uh thank
 
04:39:29.449 --> 04:39:29.459 align:start position:0%
you madam chair you said you want to
 
04:39:31.070 --> 04:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
reduce the size of your staff
 
04:39:32.750 --> 04:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
I didn't say I wanted to well it could
 
04:39:35.390 --> 04:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
be done I said I yes I just want to be
 
04:39:38.510 --> 04:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
clear okay so the staff is paid for by
 
04:39:41.330 --> 04:39:41.340 align:start position:0%
licensing fees yes so that would re that
 
04:39:43.310 --> 04:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
would be a reduction licensing fee so
 
04:39:45.590 --> 04:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
that money would go elsewhere for it
 
04:39:47.690 --> 04:39:47.700 align:start position:0%
could be reallocated
 
04:39:50.750 --> 04:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
um it depends on a lot of our staff are
 
04:39:53.208 --> 04:39:53.218 align:start position:0%
performing very basic manual you know
 
04:39:55.788 --> 04:39:55.798 align:start position:0%
data entry for example
 
04:39:55.798 --> 04:39:56.390 align:start position:0%
data entry for example
um

04:39:56.390 --> 04:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:57.830 --> 04:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
so there are some things that we're
 
04:39:59.990 --> 04:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
exploring software robots that sort of
 
04:40:01.750 --> 04:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
thing that that you know ensure 100
 
04:40:05.030 --> 04:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
accuracy that actually would be so there
 
04:40:07.610 --> 04:40:07.620 align:start position:0%
there are you know and obviously this
 
04:40:09.110 --> 04:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
would be done through attrition but as
 
04:40:10.910 --> 04:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
you all know that it's very difficult
 
04:40:13.310 --> 04:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
right now for the state to find um
 
04:40:15.288 --> 04:40:15.298 align:start position:0%
individuals well interested in working
 
04:40:17.570 --> 04:40:17.580 align:start position:0%
for the state every agency has about a
 
04:40:20.810 --> 04:40:20.820 align:start position:0%
20 vacancy rate so if we can fill those
 
04:40:23.990 --> 04:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
gaps uh with technology and streamline
 
04:40:25.970 --> 04:40:25.980 align:start position:0%
processes and procedures
 
04:40:28.430 --> 04:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
and I'll give you this example
 
04:40:31.610 --> 04:40:31.620 align:start position:0%
um so for complaints we just oplc just
 
04:40:34.310 --> 04:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
promulgated a set of rules to govern the
 
04:40:36.530 --> 04:40:36.540 align:start position:0%
administration of complaints
 
04:40:40.190 --> 04:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
prior to that every board had their own
 
04:40:42.730 --> 04:40:42.740 align:start position:0%
set of rules and they were all different
 
04:40:46.070 --> 04:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
and so the three attorneys that
 
04:40:48.708 --> 04:40:48.718 align:start position:0%
litigated before all of those boards had
 
04:40:51.708 --> 04:40:51.718 align:start position:0%
to know 50 something sets of rules and
 
04:40:54.350 --> 04:40:54.360 align:start position:0%
that obviously takes them a lot more
 
04:40:58.130 --> 04:40:58.140 align:start position:0%
time so by streamlining that process we
 
04:40:59.930 --> 04:40:59.940 align:start position:0%
could reduce administrative burden we
 
04:41:01.910 --> 04:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
may not need to hire a fourth attorney
 
04:41:03.590 --> 04:41:03.600 align:start position:0%
for example because they're not focusing
 
04:41:06.830 --> 04:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
on that administrative task thank you
 
04:41:10.430 --> 04:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
representative thank you madam chair is
 
04:41:12.170 --> 04:41:12.180 align:start position:0%
it not true that a lot of your staff
 
04:41:16.250 --> 04:41:16.260 align:start position:0%
would be shared between boards so that
 
04:41:18.170 --> 04:41:18.180 align:start position:0%
you would particularly in the health
 
04:41:20.590 --> 04:41:20.600 align:start position:0%
field so that if
 
04:41:23.390 --> 04:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
you you would not need an extra staff
 
04:41:25.788 --> 04:41:25.798 align:start position:0%
person for the Dental Board perhaps they
 
04:41:28.610 --> 04:41:28.620 align:start position:0%
might be needed on the nursing board
 
04:41:30.288 --> 04:41:30.298 align:start position:0%
yes all of our staffers shared
 
04:41:32.868 --> 04:41:32.878 align:start position:0%
previously they were not and um we felt
 
04:41:34.368 --> 04:41:34.378 align:start position:0%
that was uh
 
04:41:37.368 --> 04:41:37.378 align:start position:0%
you know we would have some boards were
 
04:41:40.010 --> 04:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
new in let's say June
 
04:41:41.690 --> 04:41:41.700 align:start position:0%
um in August the staff would be
 
04:41:43.670 --> 04:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
twiddling their thumbs meanwhile the
 
04:41:45.948 --> 04:41:45.958 align:start position:0%
people renewing nursing would be you
 
04:41:47.930 --> 04:41:47.940 align:start position:0%
know running around trying to get things
 
04:41:49.970 --> 04:41:49.980 align:start position:0%
done we didn't find that to be the best
 
04:41:52.510 --> 04:41:52.520 align:start position:0%
use of resources so all staff are shared
 
04:41:56.690 --> 04:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
so that we can make sure that people are
 
04:41:58.550 --> 04:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
being productive but we're meeting the
 
04:42:00.050 --> 04:42:00.060 align:start position:0%
needs of but certainly yes
 
04:42:04.128 --> 04:42:04.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:05.510 --> 04:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:42:08.208 --> 04:42:08.218 align:start position:0%
yes representative Gould
 
04:42:10.310 --> 04:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:42:12.590 --> 04:42:12.600 align:start position:0%
I had a question regarding about what
 
04:42:14.690 --> 04:42:14.700 align:start position:0%
percentage of complaints that come in
 
04:42:18.350 --> 04:42:18.360 align:start position:0%
would you say are for abuse of clients
 
04:42:21.708 --> 04:42:21.718 align:start position:0%
not many I would say we typically see
 
04:42:25.430 --> 04:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
that more in the mental health uh
 
04:42:28.250 --> 04:42:28.260 align:start position:0%
category and it's usually boundaries
 
04:42:30.890 --> 04:42:30.900 align:start position:0%
issues sexual related conduct we also
 
04:42:32.628 --> 04:42:32.638 align:start position:0%
see that in massage therapy actually
 
04:42:34.368 --> 04:42:34.378 align:start position:0%
quite frequently
 
04:42:34.378 --> 04:42:35.208 align:start position:0%
quite frequently
um

04:42:35.208 --> 04:42:35.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:37.910 --> 04:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
and occasionally with body art but those
 
04:42:41.390 --> 04:42:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:43.550 --> 04:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
um Dr coachar is absolutely correct that
 
04:42:45.770 --> 04:42:45.780 align:start position:0%
for dental complaints it's often you
 
04:42:48.530 --> 04:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
know disputes between patient and um
 
04:42:50.690 --> 04:42:50.700 align:start position:0%
like contract disputes
 
04:42:54.110 --> 04:42:54.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so if
 
04:42:56.448 --> 04:42:56.458 align:start position:0%
in the case there was an Abu oh
 
04:42:56.458 --> 04:42:58.550 align:start position:0%
in the case there was an Abu oh
follow-up

04:42:58.550 --> 04:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:43:02.868 --> 04:43:02.878 align:start position:0%
I'm new I'm learning the process here uh
 
04:43:04.910 --> 04:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
in the in the case there was an abuse
 
04:43:04.920 --> 04:43:05.990 align:start position:0%
in the in the case there was an abuse
complaint

04:43:05.990 --> 04:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
04:43:08.990 --> 04:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
whether it was with the dental border
 
04:43:11.628 --> 04:43:11.638 align:start position:0%
other aspects of your office
 
04:43:14.628 --> 04:43:14.638 align:start position:0%
if what would happen in the event you
 
04:43:15.770 --> 04:43:15.780 align:start position:0%
had to wait
 
04:43:17.990 --> 04:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
a month
 
04:43:20.150 --> 04:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
I heard you talk about the concern and
 
04:43:22.850 --> 04:43:22.860 align:start position:0%
that was my concern when we when we were
 
04:43:25.628 --> 04:43:25.638 align:start position:0%
hearing but I'm a hammer I worked in
 
04:43:28.490 --> 04:43:28.500 align:start position:0%
abuse and neglect so that's why I'm
 
04:43:30.708 --> 04:43:30.718 align:start position:0%
asking these questions thank you yes
 
04:43:33.050 --> 04:43:33.060 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so I would I
 
04:43:35.628 --> 04:43:35.638 align:start position:0%
during the audit period
 
04:43:39.050 --> 04:43:39.060 align:start position:0%
um that was surveyed there was not a
 
04:43:41.510 --> 04:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
good process for review of complaints
 
04:43:43.368 --> 04:43:43.378 align:start position:0%
and investigations Dr coachar touched
 
04:43:46.190 --> 04:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
upon that it was done through doj I
 
04:43:48.050 --> 04:43:48.060 align:start position:0%
would like to say that our process has
 
04:43:50.390 --> 04:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
significantly improved we have the
 
04:43:52.190 --> 04:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
division of enforcement at oplc that
 
04:43:54.590 --> 04:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
handles all of these and per the new
 
04:43:56.810 --> 04:43:56.820 align:start position:0%
rules that were in place when we receive
 
04:43:59.288 --> 04:43:59.298 align:start position:0%
a complaint we look at it the same day
 
04:44:01.970 --> 04:44:01.980 align:start position:0%
and if it's something alleging abuse or
 
04:44:03.708 --> 04:44:03.718 align:start position:0%
neglect it's immediately flagged as a
 
04:44:07.070 --> 04:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
potential emergency our staff conduct
 
04:44:07.080 --> 04:44:08.750 align:start position:0%
potential emergency our staff conduct
um

04:44:08.750 --> 04:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:44:11.570 --> 04:44:11.580 align:start position:0%
a mini investigation just to
 
04:44:14.030 --> 04:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
substantiate the allegation often within
 
04:44:17.330 --> 04:44:17.340 align:start position:0%
24 hours and if it is deemed to be
 
04:44:19.310 --> 04:44:19.320 align:start position:0%
substantiated there are all you know
 
04:44:21.230 --> 04:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
they send a memo to the board admin who
 
04:44:22.430 --> 04:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
gets on the phone with the board chair
 
04:44:24.288 --> 04:44:24.298 align:start position:0%
who calls an emergency meeting which can
 
04:44:26.570 --> 04:44:26.580 align:start position:0%
be conducted pursuant to 90 when I I
 
04:44:28.730 --> 04:44:28.740 align:start position:0%
would say that emergency meetings occur
 
04:44:31.610 --> 04:44:31.620 align:start position:0%
most often in nursing with the diversion
 
04:44:38.208 --> 04:44:38.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:40.368 --> 04:44:40.378 align:start position:0%
all right well thank you very much I
 
04:44:42.050 --> 04:44:42.060 align:start position:0%
think you've managed to exhaust us
 
04:44:44.990 --> 04:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
Excellence knowledge thank you we
 
04:44:46.910 --> 04:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate you resting up to attack you
 
04:44:49.550 --> 04:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
in the later meetings I look forward to
 
04:44:49.560 --> 04:44:50.390 align:start position:0%
in the later meetings I look forward to
it

04:44:50.390 --> 04:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:44:53.448 --> 04:44:53.458 align:start position:0%
um and also if any of you have questions
 
04:44:56.090 --> 04:44:56.100 align:start position:0%
or would like to know more I'll
 
04:44:57.650 --> 04:44:57.660 align:start position:0%
circulate my contact information feel
 
04:44:59.030 --> 04:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
free to reach out to me directly thank
 
04:45:00.948 --> 04:45:00.958 align:start position:0%
you I appreciate your time thank you yes
 
04:45:03.830 --> 04:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
yes we will be uh seeing uh director
 
04:45:07.730 --> 04:45:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:09.830 --> 04:45:09.840 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:45:12.050 --> 04:45:12.060 align:start position:0%
Madam chair yes yes I don't know if you
 
04:45:14.750 --> 04:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
think this is the appropriate time but
 
04:45:16.550 --> 04:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
um perhaps you and representative
 
04:45:19.670 --> 04:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
Schmidt could uh give particularly the
 
04:45:22.250 --> 04:45:22.260 align:start position:0%
new members a little overview of the
 
04:45:24.708 --> 04:45:24.718 align:start position:0%
administrative rules process and how
 
04:45:27.430 --> 04:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
long it can take
 
04:45:31.010 --> 04:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
uh longer than most sensible people
 
04:45:34.750 --> 04:45:34.760 align:start position:0%
think it ought to as the usual answer
 
04:45:38.930 --> 04:45:38.940 align:start position:0%
the thing is we we as a legislature
 
04:45:42.770 --> 04:45:42.780 align:start position:0%
delegate to many of our agencies our
 
04:45:42.780 --> 04:45:44.390 align:start position:0%
delegate to many of our agencies our
lawmaking

04:45:44.390 --> 04:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
lawmaking
 
04:45:48.170 --> 04:45:48.180 align:start position:0%
Authority by telling them to write rules
 
04:45:50.810 --> 04:45:50.820 align:start position:0%
which have the effect of law
 
04:45:54.288 --> 04:45:54.298 align:start position:0%
it turns out that what when we think of
 
04:45:57.110 --> 04:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
it we think that yes we'll tell you what
 
04:45:59.208 --> 04:45:59.218 align:start position:0%
the requirements are and you'll fill out
 
04:46:02.090 --> 04:46:02.100 align:start position:0%
the petty fogging little details needed
 
04:46:06.708 --> 04:46:06.718 align:start position:0%
to do it but sometimes
 
04:46:09.470 --> 04:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
we leave them a lot of scope and they
 
04:46:11.628 --> 04:46:11.638 align:start position:0%
get creative
 
04:46:15.770 --> 04:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
the rules when written are reviewed by
 
04:46:19.128 --> 04:46:19.138 align:start position:0%
the administrative rules office which is
 
04:46:21.650 --> 04:46:21.660 align:start position:0%
a set of attorneys which verifies that
 
04:46:25.190 --> 04:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
they do not exceed their
 
04:46:28.730 --> 04:46:28.740 align:start position:0%
um their authority to write rules and
 
04:46:30.890 --> 04:46:30.900 align:start position:0%
that they comply with the rule writing
 
04:46:34.070 --> 04:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
process which is exhaustively detailed
 
04:46:37.550 --> 04:46:37.560 align:start position:0%
in RSA 541a
 
04:46:39.350 --> 04:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
you can read it sometime if you have
 
04:46:39.360 --> 04:46:41.350 align:start position:0%
you can read it sometime if you have
insomnia

04:46:41.350 --> 04:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
insomnia
 
04:46:45.230 --> 04:46:45.240 align:start position:0%
all rules are then go before a committee
 
04:46:47.930 --> 04:46:47.940 align:start position:0%
that is a joint legislative committee on
 
04:46:49.850 --> 04:46:49.860 align:start position:0%
administrative rules
 
04:46:53.628 --> 04:46:53.638 align:start position:0%
which looks at all the rules and
 
04:46:56.628 --> 04:46:56.638 align:start position:0%
determines that they are not only
 
04:46:56.638 --> 04:46:59.510 align:start position:0%
determines that they are not only
legal

04:46:59.510 --> 04:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:01.850 --> 04:47:01.860 align:start position:0%
don't cost too much and are in the
 
04:47:06.310 --> 04:47:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:08.410 --> 04:47:08.420 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
04:47:11.448 --> 04:47:11.458 align:start position:0%
exhaustive process but it needs to be
 
04:47:13.610 --> 04:47:13.620 align:start position:0%
done because as I said it's Our
 
04:47:16.550 --> 04:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
obligation to make the laws and when we
 
04:47:18.470 --> 04:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
delegate it we have to
 
04:47:20.990 --> 04:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
oversee the people who are who are
 
04:47:23.868 --> 04:47:23.878 align:start position:0%
making it on our behalf
 
04:47:23.878 --> 04:47:25.550 align:start position:0%
making it on our behalf
um

04:47:25.550 --> 04:47:25.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:29.448 --> 04:47:29.458 align:start position:0%
so the that's the gel car meets it has
 
04:47:31.850 --> 04:47:31.860 align:start position:0%
10 members five Senators five
 
04:47:34.310 --> 04:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
representatives and the number of
 
04:47:37.190 --> 04:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
alternates it meets every month in this
 
04:47:39.490 --> 04:47:39.500 align:start position:0%
room usually on Fridays
 
04:47:43.868 --> 04:47:43.878 align:start position:0%
and it looks looks at these these rules
 
04:47:47.530 --> 04:47:47.540 align:start position:0%
and normally approves them
 
04:47:50.530 --> 04:47:50.540 align:start position:0%
the rules can be
 
04:47:53.868 --> 04:47:53.878 align:start position:0%
objected to but only on the grounds that
 
04:47:55.970 --> 04:47:55.980 align:start position:0%
they exceed their Authority
 
04:47:58.670 --> 04:47:58.680 align:start position:0%
cost too much
 
04:48:00.830 --> 04:48:00.840 align:start position:0%
or are not in the public interest I
 
04:48:03.770 --> 04:48:03.780 align:start position:0%
think that's the main one right Peter we
 
04:48:07.010 --> 04:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
say the two primary things for the cost
 
04:48:08.750 --> 04:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
aspect of the public interest are
 
04:48:12.230 --> 04:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
they're all there but that that show
 
04:48:15.470 --> 04:48:15.480 align:start position:0%
them the two main criteria pillars are
 
04:48:18.470 --> 04:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
can exceed legislative Authority
 
04:48:20.330 --> 04:48:20.340 align:start position:0%
in other words they can't go off on
 
04:48:22.490 --> 04:48:22.500 align:start position:0%
their own just didn't decide whatever
 
04:48:25.128 --> 04:48:25.138 align:start position:0%
they would like to do has to be to
 
04:48:27.530 --> 04:48:27.540 align:start position:0%
implement the statute and the second
 
04:48:30.470 --> 04:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
thing is it can cannot be contrary to
 
04:48:32.868 --> 04:48:32.878 align:start position:0%
legislative intent
 
04:48:37.430 --> 04:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
yes so so we will We that committee
 
04:48:40.670 --> 04:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
looks at the rules and if they believe
 
04:48:43.610 --> 04:48:43.620 align:start position:0%
it does not meet legislative intent they
 
04:48:45.410 --> 04:48:45.420 align:start position:0%
can object to it
 
04:48:49.910 --> 04:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
which will either induce the agency to
 
04:48:51.050 --> 04:48:51.060 align:start position:0%
make a change
 
04:48:53.690 --> 04:48:53.700 align:start position:0%
or if they don't want to make a change
 
04:48:56.150 --> 04:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
it means they do not
 
04:48:58.310 --> 04:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
have the
 
04:49:00.708 --> 04:49:00.718 align:start position:0%
uh they have the burden of proof of
 
04:49:02.510 --> 04:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
proving that the rule is worthwhile
 
04:49:04.850 --> 04:49:04.860 align:start position:0%
rather than having it being assumed that
 
04:49:06.050 --> 04:49:06.060 align:start position:0%
they're correct
 
04:49:09.170 --> 04:49:09.180 align:start position:0%
uh if it's really objected to
 
04:49:11.270 --> 04:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
that committee can bring forth a
 
04:49:13.670 --> 04:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
resolution to to
 
04:49:17.090 --> 04:49:17.100 align:start position:0%
the house usually first and ban the rule
 
04:49:20.510 --> 04:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
from going and going into effect
 
04:49:24.050 --> 04:49:24.060 align:start position:0%
so yeah I think you have to give at
 
04:49:25.430 --> 04:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
least an example of what you're talking
 
04:49:29.448 --> 04:49:29.458 align:start position:0%
about okay it's kind of vague yes so we
 
04:49:32.868 --> 04:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
had a we had a smoking ban
 
04:49:35.690 --> 04:49:35.700 align:start position:0%
for bars and restaurants
 
04:49:38.690 --> 04:49:38.700 align:start position:0%
10 years ago okay
 
04:49:41.330 --> 04:49:41.340 align:start position:0%
it was recognized by the agency that was
 
04:49:43.788 --> 04:49:43.798 align:start position:0%
going to report to this
 
04:49:47.270 --> 04:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
that if you didn't have any sanction
 
04:49:50.270 --> 04:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
for a violation it was going to be
 
04:49:52.010 --> 04:49:52.020 align:start position:0%
ignored if that's was going to be
 
04:49:55.190 --> 04:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
ignored so the the agency put in a 50
 
04:49:55.200 --> 04:49:56.690 align:start position:0%
ignored so the the agency put in a 50
fine

04:49:56.690 --> 04:49:56.700 align:start position:0%
fine
 
04:49:59.090 --> 04:49:59.100 align:start position:0%
okay but there was no legislative
 
04:50:02.030 --> 04:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
Authority for a fight and so that
 
04:50:04.250 --> 04:50:04.260 align:start position:0%
particular thing was objected to by the
 
04:50:07.430 --> 04:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
gel car an agency said we realize we
 
04:50:08.930 --> 04:50:08.940 align:start position:0%
don't have any Authority but if you
 
04:50:11.810 --> 04:50:11.820 align:start position:0%
don't you don't have a hammer they're
 
04:50:14.930 --> 04:50:14.940 align:start position:0%
just going to ignore the statue okay so
 
04:50:17.990 --> 04:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
the uh went through the
 
04:50:20.948 --> 04:50:20.958 align:start position:0%
the policy committee which proceeded to
 
04:50:23.930 --> 04:50:23.940 align:start position:0%
authorize changed the law to give them
 
04:50:26.270 --> 04:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
the authority to put in the
 
04:50:28.788 --> 04:50:28.798 align:start position:0%
administrative funds no that's an
 
04:50:31.430 --> 04:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
example of overreach
 
04:50:31.440 --> 04:50:33.730 align:start position:0%
example of overreach
um

04:50:33.730 --> 04:50:33.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:37.430 --> 04:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
Authority and so the committee said no
 
04:50:40.070 --> 04:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
we object and the agency said we
 
04:50:41.628 --> 04:50:41.638 align:start position:0%
understand we don't have any authority
 
04:50:45.770 --> 04:50:45.780 align:start position:0%
to look at it don't work otherwise yeah
 
04:50:49.250 --> 04:50:49.260 align:start position:0%
generally the jail car objects once or
 
04:50:52.070 --> 04:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
twice a year to a rule it's not common
 
04:50:55.730 --> 04:50:55.740 align:start position:0%
more more commonly we we talk about and
 
04:50:57.890 --> 04:50:57.900 align:start position:0%
say we don't like this and and Bully the
 
04:50:59.930 --> 04:50:59.940 align:start position:0%
agency into making the changes we want
 
04:50:59.940 --> 04:51:02.208 align:start position:0%
agency into making the changes we want
that's

04:51:02.208 --> 04:51:02.218 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:51:03.788 --> 04:51:03.798 align:start position:0%
um it's
 
04:51:06.948 --> 04:51:06.958 align:start position:0%
but when we are I the one that I
 
04:51:08.390 --> 04:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
remember was
 
04:51:11.510 --> 04:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh the map we had a state malpractice
 
04:51:13.670 --> 04:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
insurance fund
 
04:51:16.430 --> 04:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
that the insurance department decided
 
04:51:19.570 --> 04:51:19.580 align:start position:0%
was unnecessary and they decided to
 
04:51:21.590 --> 04:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
lapse a
 
04:51:24.110 --> 04:51:24.120 align:start position:0%
several hundred million dollars back to
 
04:51:25.550 --> 04:51:25.560 align:start position:0%
the general fund
 
04:51:27.708 --> 04:51:27.718 align:start position:0%
which was in dire need at that point of
 
04:51:27.718 --> 04:51:28.430 align:start position:0%
which was in dire need at that point of
course

04:51:28.430 --> 04:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
course
 
04:51:32.208 --> 04:51:32.218 align:start position:0%
and so they wrote a rule to do so uh the
 
04:51:34.430 --> 04:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
gel Cara said well you can't do that
 
04:51:36.470 --> 04:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
it's not the general fund's money
 
04:51:40.868 --> 04:51:40.878 align:start position:0%
because it was collected by uh
 
04:51:44.330 --> 04:51:44.340 align:start position:0%
insurance payments by all of the doctors
 
04:51:48.410 --> 04:51:48.420 align:start position:0%
in question so we objected to it and the
 
04:51:52.850 --> 04:51:52.860 align:start position:0%
it went to the legislature and the it
 
04:51:56.750 --> 04:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
was upheld they and the money was in
 
04:51:58.730 --> 04:51:58.740 align:start position:0%
fact returned to the people who'd paid
 
04:52:00.650 --> 04:52:00.660 align:start position:0%
into the insurance
 
04:52:02.810 --> 04:52:02.820 align:start position:0%
but that was a
 
04:52:06.050 --> 04:52:06.060 align:start position:0%
we do give refunds in fact that's uh
 
04:52:08.090 --> 04:52:08.100 align:start position:0%
something that we noticed the last time
 
04:52:10.730 --> 04:52:10.740 align:start position:0%
is that the veterinary it was the
 
04:52:13.730 --> 04:52:13.740 align:start position:0%
veterinary board had been their rules
 
04:52:17.448 --> 04:52:17.458 align:start position:0%
had expired and they can't enforce a fee
 
04:52:19.970 --> 04:52:19.980 align:start position:0%
if it's they can't enforce a rule if it
 
04:52:22.670 --> 04:52:22.680 align:start position:0%
has expired so they are in the process
 
04:52:24.770 --> 04:52:24.780 align:start position:0%
of sending back the registration fees
 
04:52:26.150 --> 04:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
for the people
 
04:52:28.190 --> 04:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
who sent them in during the period the
 
04:52:29.868 --> 04:52:29.878 align:start position:0%
rules were expired
 
04:52:32.570 --> 04:52:32.580 align:start position:0%
so that's an unusual thing but it
 
04:52:34.250 --> 04:52:34.260 align:start position:0%
happens all right
 
04:52:38.150 --> 04:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:40.910 --> 04:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
okay good I'll stop talking
 
04:52:43.550 --> 04:52:43.560 align:start position:0%
thank you all and for showing up on a
 
04:52:45.830 --> 04:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
Monday we will uh
 
04:52:49.368 --> 04:52:49.378 align:start position:0%
have our first hearings on Wednesday and
 
04:52:52.010 --> 04:52:52.020 align:start position:0%
then some on Thursday so I'll see you
 
04:52:52.020 --> 04:52:59.390 align:start position:0%
then some on Thursday so I'll see you
then

04:52:59.390 --> 04:52:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:59.400 --> 04:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
foreign
