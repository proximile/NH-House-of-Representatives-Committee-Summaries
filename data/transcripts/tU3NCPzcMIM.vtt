just deal with it rapidly if that's
 
00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
not an issue i just i'm just not ready

uh
 
00:13:10.949 --> 00:13:10.959 align:start position:0%
questions yes uh
 
00:13:13.509 --> 00:13:13.519 align:start position:0%
representative edwards uh thank you man
 
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
i'm sure um
 
00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
so on on 277 uh i have just a specific
 
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
question out of curiosity and just a
 
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:25.120 align:start position:0%
general observation one
 
00:13:27.509 --> 00:13:27.519 align:start position:0%
the the thing that comes closest to a
 
00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
question is
 
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
um this is this is funding to help with
 
00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
hospital birthing services a valuable
 
00:13:36.949 --> 00:13:36.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:36.959 --> 00:13:37.910 align:start position:0%
 
but

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
to the more general point
 
00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.790 align:start position:0%
to the more general point
is

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:41.990 align:start position:0%
is
this

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
write-up has a description of the
 
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
services it's a it's a qualitative
 
00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
description of what we're doing but
 
00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:51.519 align:start position:0%
there's nothing quantifiable in here i i
 
00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:52.310 align:start position:0%
there's nothing quantifiable in here i i
don't

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
reading this i don't have a sense
 
00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
of of what this 2.4 million dollars will
 
00:13:58.720 --> 00:13:59.910 align:start position:0%
of of what this 2.4 million dollars will
deliver

00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
deliver
 
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
and you know what the value add is and
 
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:04.240 align:start position:0%
you know just just the things that we
 
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
need to do to do our due diligence for
 
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers to know that we're
 
00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
investing our money as opposed to just
 
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
rubber stamping a
 
00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:13.839 align:start position:0%
narrative jordan
 
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
i i can certainly speak to that so um
 
00:14:18.389 --> 00:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
and and i'm going to speak to 277 and
 
00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
278 at the same time and and because
 
00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
they're very similar
 
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
um so house bill 1661 uh appropriated
 
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
funding in in 227
 
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
you'll see 2.4 million for rate
 
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
increases for birthing services and then
 
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
the personal care attendant roughly 700
 
00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:37.750 align:start position:0%
the personal care attendant roughly 700
000

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
000
 
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
was also appropriated in general funds
 
00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:43.519 align:start position:0%
for through hb 1661
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
and so we were appropriated those funds
 
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
through that bill
 
00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
and then you'll see reference in here we
 
00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:50.240 align:start position:0%
had a question come through about why
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
why are we referencing general funds and
 
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
we why did we submit a memo to the
 
00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
department administrative services so we
 
00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
submitted a memo to accept those funds
 
00:14:59.829 --> 00:14:59.839 align:start position:0%
into our budget and what you see here is
 
00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
you see the federal matching funds the
 
00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
50 50 federal matching funds to
 
00:15:06.629 --> 00:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
effectuate uh the directive of the
 
00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
legislature through hp in 60 61.
 
00:15:11.829 --> 00:15:11.839 align:start position:0%
so what what you're seeing here this is
 
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
the mechanics of us accepting the
 
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:19.910 align:start position:0%
 
follow-ups

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
follow-ups
 
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
all right i i i'm going to move on
 
00:15:24.389 --> 00:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
because i i had no intent to oppose this
 
00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
but i i'm not sure that you've heard
 
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
what i've said so maybe i've said it
 
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:29.990 align:start position:0%
what i've said so maybe i've said it
poorly

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
poorly
 
00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
you can describe something qualitatively
 
00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
and you can describe something
 
00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
quantitatively and it's the quantitative
 
00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
that helps me get my head around exactly
 
00:15:42.069 --> 00:15:42.079 align:start position:0%
what the program
 
00:15:42.079 --> 00:15:43.430 align:start position:0%
what the program
scope

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
scope
 
00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.949 align:start position:0%
scope
value

00:15:44.949 --> 00:15:44.959 align:start position:0%
value
 
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
benefits are and that's not in this
 
00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
document and since you brought up 278
 
00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
it's the same observation i i i'm i'm
 
00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
good i'm good for a good story i just
 
00:15:59.910 --> 00:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
want enough math to know what we're
 
00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
doing um and and what the benefit is
 
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
that's all and i'm not going to hold
 
00:16:07.030 --> 00:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
this up i i just want to emphasize that
 
00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
so that in future write-ups we we see
 
00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:13.600 align:start position:0%

senator rosenwald thank you i have a
 
00:16:29.749 --> 00:16:29.759 align:start position:0%
question sometimes
 
00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
in the legislation we include a sentence
 
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
that says
 
00:16:37.509 --> 00:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
the department may accept
 
00:16:39.749 --> 00:16:39.759 align:start position:0%
federal matching funds
 
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
without having to go to fiscal
 
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
did we not do that in this piece of
 
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
legislation and that's why we have to
 
00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:50.560 align:start position:0%
accept the federal funds yes that is
 
00:16:52.629 --> 00:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
correct senator rosenwald that language
 
00:16:55.269 --> 00:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
was not included in hb 1661 which is why
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:02.829 --> 00:17:02.839 align:start position:0%

thanks madam chair um
 
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
in some of the material you provided the
 
00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
committee just before the meeting i
 
00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
guess yesterday there was a chart now
 
00:18:52.390 --> 00:18:52.400 align:start position:0%
this is probably a good place to bring
 
00:18:53.909 --> 00:18:53.919 align:start position:0%
it up or not but
 
00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
in table eight of the information you
 
00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
provided it talked about clients served
 
00:19:01.029 --> 00:19:01.039 align:start position:0%
by community mental health centers
 
00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
and i was just curious
 
00:19:06.789 --> 00:19:06.799 align:start position:0%
in 2012 but this is this on table eight
 
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
it shows a
 
00:19:10.669 --> 00:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
remarkable decline between
 
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
2012 and 2020. could you tell me why
 
00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
there's been a decline
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
sure i'm gonna have katya fox our uh
 
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:19.600 align:start position:0%

of um responses 278 there were a number
 
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
of charts he provided to what's uh
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
yesterday i believe in response to
 
00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:45.679 --> 00:19:47.270 align:start position:0%

so good morning madam chair um for
 
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
clarification this is part of the
 
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
dashboard so it's part um when he
 
00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
references tab eight
 
00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
it's the it's the the dashboard the
 
00:20:03.029 --> 00:20:03.039 align:start position:0%
operating statistics but i'd be happy to
 
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
respond to that question now
 
00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:07.750 align:start position:0%
respond to that question now
okay

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:07.760 align:start position:0%

something

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:17.440 align:start position:0%

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
that we got so i
 
00:20:20.549 --> 00:20:20.559 align:start position:0%

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:22.640 align:start position:0%
ask the question okay well can we hold
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
are there uh questions that folks have
 
00:24:56.549 --> 00:24:56.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:58.549 --> 00:24:58.559 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:24:59.590 --> 00:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
i wonder if you could provide an
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
overview of where
 
00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
should i speak louder no i got you i got
 
00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:04.710 align:start position:0%
should i speak louder no i got you i got
you

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
yeah um where this program stands it's
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
been going on for
 
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
well basically since the through the
 
00:25:11.909 --> 00:25:11.919 align:start position:0%
pandemic and more specifically once you
 
00:25:13.269 --> 00:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
get through that
 
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:15.440 align:start position:0%
what happens when all these and there's
 
00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
there's this one there's several others
 
00:25:18.789 --> 00:25:18.799 align:start position:0%
i believe in this same uh today and i'll
 
00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
just address them all here
 
00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
what happens when all these rental
 
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
assistance programs end at some point in
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
the future yeah so this uh this program
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
emanates going going back as you pointed
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
out i believe the december of 2021 was
 
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
the first round of the we call the
 
00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
emergency rental assistance program
 
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
it's been operational in new hampshire
 
00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:40.789 align:start position:0%
it's been operational in new hampshire
from

00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:40.799 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
roughly a couple months after that and
 
00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
then a second tranche of funds that came
 
00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
um later in 2021 i don't know if i had
 
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
my march 21 march 2020. anyway um so at
 
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
this point we have spent probably a
 
00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
little over 200 million dollars
 
00:25:58.470 --> 00:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
of those funds from the federal
 
00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:00.799 align:start position:0%
government under this program through
 
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire housing
 
00:26:03.669 --> 00:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
they are the
 
00:26:06.549 --> 00:26:06.559 align:start position:0%
the administrator of this program
 
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
i don't have the exact numbers in terms
 
00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
of the number of families that have been
 
00:26:12.789 --> 00:26:12.799 align:start position:0%
assisted but it is a substantial amount
 
00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
over the course of the program what
 
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
you're looking at here in this item is
 
00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
22 317
 
00:26:21.909 --> 00:26:21.919 align:start position:0%
relates to the first trunk of the funds
 
00:26:23.269 --> 00:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
that we've received the state of new
 
00:26:25.269 --> 00:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire received under that program
 
00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
which we refer to as era one those funds
 
00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:30.799 align:start position:0%
are due to expire at the end of
 
00:26:30.799 --> 00:26:31.990 align:start position:0%
are due to expire at the end of
september

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
september
 
00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
and so what we're asking for here is to
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
take the remaining amount that we have
 
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
allocated to er a1
 
00:26:40.549 --> 00:26:40.559 align:start position:0%
and get those over to new hampshire
 
00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:43.039 align:start position:0%
housing so that they can uh can spend
 
00:26:44.789 --> 00:26:44.799 align:start position:0%
down those dollars prior to the end of
 
00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
right i understood that thank you um but
 
00:26:51.669 --> 00:26:51.679 align:start position:0%
there's another one in here if i think
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
another 10 million dollars or 20 million
 
00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
dollars if not mistaken i just maybe
 
00:26:57.269 --> 00:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
capture them all here at one time but
 
00:26:59.029 --> 00:26:59.039 align:start position:0%
more particularly my real question is
 
00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:00.799 align:start position:0%
related to all of these
 
00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
is what happens when these programs end
 
00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
so at this point it's hard for us to
 
00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
have any sort of idea exactly when this
 
00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
is going to end because we do have an
 
00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
expectation that at some point we're
 
00:27:13.269 --> 00:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
told over the next few weeks there will
 
00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
be another tranche of funding
 
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
under the era 2 program which is a later
 
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.110 align:start position:0%
under the era 2 program which is a later
item

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
item
 
00:27:21.269 --> 00:27:21.279 align:start position:0%
that will keep the program uh keep the
 
00:27:22.549 --> 00:27:22.559 align:start position:0%
program running
 
00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:25.039 align:start position:0%
so uh we're hopeful that we're going to
 
00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
be able to drag this to the point where
 
00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:30.559 align:start position:0%
we are able to plan for some level of
 
00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
transition for people that are in the
 
00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.269 align:start position:0%
transition for people that are in the
program

00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
now but at this point it's hard for us
 
00:27:39.269 --> 00:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
to say exactly when that is going to be
 
00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
may if i'll just please i wasn't asking
 
00:27:42.789 --> 00:27:42.799 align:start position:0%
for the end point i get that you don't
 
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
know when it is i hope it's not never
 
00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering have you so have you
 
00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
started thinking about the fact that it
 
00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
might end and these people have been
 
00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
used to this over what has been two
 
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
maybe three maybe four years maybe more
 
00:27:57.190 --> 00:27:57.200 align:start position:0%
i don't know but if you get some some
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
thought to what's going to happen to
 
00:28:00.149 --> 00:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
these folks when
 
00:28:00.159 --> 00:28:01.269 align:start position:0%
these folks when
if

00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:02.720 align:start position:0%
it does end
 
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
well it is going to end at some point
 
00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:07.360 align:start position:0%
that that is a fact i think what we're
 
00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
working with now with new hampshire
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
housing and with the cap agencies is a
 
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
series of other programs that go with
 
00:28:15.669 --> 00:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
this rental and utility assistance that
 
00:28:17.669 --> 00:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
go to things like
 
00:28:20.389 --> 00:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
transitional services support services
 
00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh and funding to assist people to
 
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:24.880 align:start position:0%
be able to make themselves get
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
themselves into a more permanent housing
 
00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
solution this program was in its
 
00:28:33.029 --> 00:28:33.039 align:start position:0%
you know in its initial design um really
 
00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
designed to be able to help people get
 
00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:35.430 align:start position:0%
designed to be able to help people get
through

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
a lack of a job or the downturn the
 
00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
economic downturn and not able to pay
 
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
their rent or their utility costs and so
 
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
we've you know seen great success in
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
that program but as it does end we're
 
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
going to have to lean pretty heavily on
 
00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:50.799 align:start position:0%
the services that are being provided now
 
00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
and expand those and extend those
 
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
um in order to support those people that
 
00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:56.559 align:start position:0%
are not able to transition to a more
 
00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:02.549 --> 00:29:02.559 align:start position:0%
so any further questions
 
00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
senator daniels thank you
 
00:29:07.269 --> 00:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
following up on that statement
 
00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:08.960 align:start position:0%
the documentation says in the event the
 
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
federal funds are no longer available
 
00:29:13.029 --> 00:29:13.039 align:start position:0%
general funds will not be requested to
 
00:29:15.269 --> 00:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
support the program but it sounds like
 
00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
what you just said
 
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
that you would be asking for general
 
00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:19.750 align:start position:0%
that you would be asking for general
funds

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
later to support those
 
00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:23.440 align:start position:0%
the federal funds that aren't there
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
anymore no i should i should i should
 
00:29:27.669 --> 00:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
clarify that um
 
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
and really kind of important maybe to
 
00:29:32.389 --> 00:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
another item later on is that under era
 
00:29:32.399 --> 00:29:33.430 align:start position:0%
another item later on is that under era
2

00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
2
 
00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
which is the second tranche of funding
 
00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:38.320 align:start position:0%
obviously that program allows us to
 
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
spend until 2025
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
and so you'll see a later item here that
 
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
takes a lot of the services and the
 
00:29:47.669 --> 00:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
programs that i described a moment ago
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
transitions those over to era 2 and
 
00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
enables us to continue to spend
 
00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
under that program until at least you
 
00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
know at the longest we could go with
 
00:29:59.269 --> 00:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
that would be 2025.
 
00:29:59.279 --> 00:30:00.710 align:start position:0%
that would be 2025.
so

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:02.559 align:start position:0%
effectively what we're asking here
 
00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
between these items is to
 
00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:08.240 align:start position:0%
fully utilize the era funding for the
 
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
rental assistance and utility systems
 
00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:13.039 align:start position:0%
and then to in addition to continuing
 
00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
that program under era 2
 
00:30:17.909 --> 00:30:17.919 align:start position:0%
shift the the cost of those support
 
00:30:20.549 --> 00:30:20.559 align:start position:0%
services to era 2 because we have a
 
00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
longer horizon to spend those in order
 
00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:23.919 align:start position:0%
to avoid
 
00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
and to make sure that we're using
 
00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
federal funds for those
 
00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
for those programs follow up follow up
 
00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
go ahead um
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
have has the department been monitoring
 
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh this program i mean this started back
 
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
in in the covered
 
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
in the heart of covert uh with two
 
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
percent unemployment
 
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
right now one would expect that maybe
 
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
the numbers would have gone down because
 
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
people are employed and now have uh jobs
 
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
that they didn't have back then and so
 
00:30:54.789 --> 00:30:54.799 align:start position:0%
maybe they don't need as much
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
assistance with rental
 
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
as a department following that
 
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
monitoring that enough so that you can
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
give us some sort of a historical
 
00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:04.640 align:start position:0%
graphing of what's happening yeah the
 
00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
the the level of monitoring that goes on
 
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
with this program is pretty substantial
 
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
and in fact most of it is right on the
 
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
website with the numbers and where it's
 
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
being used and how much is being used
 
00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
and number of families that are being
 
00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:17.039 align:start position:0%
served and so on i think the thing to
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
remember too is that while we are
 
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
definitely seeing the reduction
 
00:31:24.389 --> 00:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
in the unemployment rate we still have
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
seeing very very low vacancy rates
 
00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
across the state
 
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
and a lot of those particularly rental
 
00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
unit rent
 
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
costs are not seeing the same decrease
 
00:31:37.509 --> 00:31:37.519 align:start position:0%
as the unemployment rate
 
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
so it does remain a challenge for a lot
 
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
of people
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm sure
 
00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:48.559 align:start position:0%
are there further yes uh represent
 
00:31:48.559 --> 00:31:49.669 align:start position:0%
are there further yes uh represent

00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
leishman
 
00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
thanks madam chair
 
00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
so i have two questions one is a
 
00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
follow-up to representative earth's
 
00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
questions do you have a rough idea how
 
00:31:58.470 --> 00:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
many people are being served you said
 
00:31:59.909 --> 00:31:59.919 align:start position:0%
you didn't have a number but you must
 
00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:01.919 align:start position:0%
have a rough idea i'm going to ask chase
 
00:32:03.669 --> 00:32:03.679 align:start position:0%
hi chase eggman deputy director at
 
00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
gopher um i i made a note because i
 
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
assume this question would come uh to
 
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
date we've provided over um 200 million
 
00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
dollars in assistance
 
00:32:16.389 --> 00:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
to over 21 000 households
 
00:32:17.990 --> 00:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
and a follow-up if i could but i'm sure
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
yes you may
 
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
thanks um
 
00:32:22.630 --> 00:32:22.640 align:start position:0%
i don't believe we've seen any of the
 
00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
contractual language that you've had
 
00:32:25.669 --> 00:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
with the federal government for
 
00:32:27.909 --> 00:32:27.919 align:start position:0%
receiving these funds but there's no
 
00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
like claw back language in there that
 
00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
the federal government will be looking
 
00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
for any sort of reimbursement from these
 
00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:35.039 align:start position:0%
federal funds
 
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh that's a good question representative
 
00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
there are reallocations within these
 
00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:40.640 align:start position:0%
programs that the federal government has
 
00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
already been engaging and in fact the 12
 
00:32:44.549 --> 00:32:44.559 align:start position:0%
million dollars from this item is 12
 
00:32:46.389 --> 00:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
million dollars being reallocated from
 
00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
other jurisdictions to new hampshire to
 
00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
support its program
 
00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks madam chair okay uh
 
00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
00:32:58.149 --> 00:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh this is this is
 
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
a general concern i think you and i
 
00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
talked about this once in a previous
 
00:33:04.870 --> 00:33:04.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee meeting and and i'm i'm
 
00:33:07.669 --> 00:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
just concerned with our vacancy rate of
 
00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:10.640 align:start position:0%
rentals as low as they are as we
 
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
continue to pump more money into chasing
 
00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
fewer and fewer facilities
 
00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
that we are
 
00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
likely to be contributing to the
 
00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.549 align:start position:0%
likely to be contributing to the
inflationary

00:33:22.549 --> 00:33:22.559 align:start position:0%
inflationary
 
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
nature of the rental increases
 
00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
and we're exacerbating a problem for
 
00:33:31.029 --> 00:33:31.039 align:start position:0%
those who are chasing
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
property that aren't receiving the
 
00:33:35.669 --> 00:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
benefit of government funds
 
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
and last time i mentioned it i i i think
 
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
it was the first time you and i had ever
 
00:33:42.389 --> 00:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
talked about it i'm just curious in the
 
00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:43.919 align:start position:0%
months since then
 
00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:46.559 align:start position:0%
have you given any thought to that
 
00:33:46.559 --> 00:33:47.830 align:start position:0%
have you given any thought to that
dilemma

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
dilemma
 
00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh and whether or not we have a valid
 
00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:52.960 align:start position:0%
cause to worry that we're part of the
 
00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:54.470 align:start position:0%
cause to worry that we're part of the
problem

00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
well i'm certainly familiar with that
 
00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:58.559 align:start position:0%
with that concern representative and i
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
think that you know we are not the only
 
00:34:00.159 --> 00:34:01.029 align:start position:0%
think that you know we are not the only
state

00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:34:03.669 --> 00:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
that is spending resources federal
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
government resources under this program
 
00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
i think the scope and the scale
 
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
of the rental
 
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
shortage and the costs in new hampshire
 
00:34:18.069 --> 00:34:18.079 align:start position:0%
predated in a lot of cases the situation
 
00:34:20.790 --> 00:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
that we're experiencing right now
 
00:34:22.869 --> 00:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
as you are aware we've also
 
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
requested and approved and are running a
 
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
program called invest nh which is a
 
00:34:28.149 --> 00:34:28.159 align:start position:0%
hundred million dollars a federal
 
00:34:30.869 --> 00:34:30.879 align:start position:0%
program to assist getting more of these
 
00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
rental units online
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
i think exacerbating the situation
 
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
pretty significantly
 
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
is the increase in mortgage rates
 
00:34:41.669 --> 00:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
as you see it more difficult to become
 
00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:42.470 align:start position:0%
as you see it more difficult to become
for

00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
individuals and families to purchase a
 
00:34:44.879 --> 00:34:45.909 align:start position:0%
individuals and families to purchase a
home

00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:45.919 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:47.919 align:start position:0%
it continues to put downward pressure on
 
00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
our rental units that are available so
 
00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
people are staying in rental units that
 
00:34:54.629 --> 00:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
normally in sort of a healthy housing
 
00:34:56.629 --> 00:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
market you would see this churn of
 
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
people moving from you know maybe a one
 
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
bedroom to a three bedroom and then to a
 
00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.310 align:start position:0%
bedroom to a three bedroom and then to a
house

00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
that the leap to the house has become a
 
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
bigger leap than it was just a few
 
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
months ago and so it's
 
00:35:12.069 --> 00:35:12.079 align:start position:0%
there's a number of factors that are
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
going into the cost of the rental
 
00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
markets right now in new hampshire this
 
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
you know one could certainly argue is
 
00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
part of it but it is a
 
00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
problem on a national scale
 
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
certainly on a regional scale and we're
 
00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
trying to alleviate that with some of
 
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
the other programs that we have running
 
00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:35.680 align:start position:0%
are there further questions
 
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
i do have one
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
and you probably
 
00:35:41.829 --> 00:35:41.839 align:start position:0%
won't be able to answer it but
 
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
if someone is qualifying under this
 
00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:46.230 align:start position:0%
if someone is qualifying under this
program

00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:35:49.109 --> 00:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
will they also be receiving la heap
 
00:35:49.119 --> 00:35:51.030 align:start position:0%
will they also be receiving la heap
money

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
do you have
 
00:35:53.109 --> 00:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
i think we have
 
00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
we might be able to answer that question
 
00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
oh good thank you it's a question that's
 
00:35:57.589 --> 00:35:57.599 align:start position:0%
come before representative the way the
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
systems are designed is the two are not
 
00:36:01.829 --> 00:36:01.839 align:start position:0%
competing sources of assistance so
 
00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
there's a tracking mechanism to make
 
00:36:06.069 --> 00:36:06.079 align:start position:0%
sure those who are receiving liheap are
 
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
not duplicatively receiving uh era
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
utility assistance so
 
00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
to the extent that lie heap is
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
unavailable to a household then the era
 
00:36:16.470 --> 00:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
assistant steps in
 
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
that was my concern that we were
 
00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
double dipping if that's the right term
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much
 
00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
all right are there further questions

yeah in my book are there any other
 
00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:33.109 align:start position:0%
yeah in my book are there any other
questions

00:38:33.109 --> 00:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:33.119 --> 00:38:34.790 align:start position:0%
 
okay

okay
um

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
this is uh authorization for
 
00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:42.390 align:start position:0%
this is uh authorization for
um

00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
youth and adult homeless shelters is
 
00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
if i
 
00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
yeah youth and young adult yes youth and
 
00:38:52.330 --> 00:38:52.340 align:start position:0%
young adult
 
00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:58.390 align:start position:0%
young adult
[Music]

00:38:58.390 --> 00:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
is this in addition to
 
00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
the current
 
00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
homeless shelter beds that we have
 
00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
or is this part of
 
00:39:13.030 --> 00:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
this this is a separate item um
 
00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
representative this is um
 
00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
a reallocation or an extent an expansion
 
00:39:23.109 --> 00:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
of an existing obligated source for the
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
youth residential services so what we're
 
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
trying to do with this item is use 10
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
million of the original 19 million that
 
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
was authorized
 
00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:34.720 align:start position:0%
to get to a specific
 
00:39:39.030 --> 00:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
subset of providers under this program
 
00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:39.990 align:start position:0%
subset of providers under this program
for

00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
under 22 i believe under 25 years old
 
00:39:45.829 --> 00:39:45.839 align:start position:0%
okay so it's
 
00:39:47.829 --> 00:39:47.839 align:start position:0%
it was really in the original purpose of
 
00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
the of the original item um but for
 
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
whatever reason through some sort of
 
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh lapse uh in the language we weren't
 
00:39:59.349 --> 00:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
able to get it specifically to those
 
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
younger um those those locations that
 
00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
serve younger populations okay so they
 
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
are different than our normal
 
00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh homeless they're qualified is
 
00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:10.390 align:start position:0%
uh homeless they're qualified is
different

00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:40:11.829 --> 00:40:11.839 align:start position:0%
in in a way that we need to have
 
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
additional authorization to get them
 
00:40:15.829 --> 00:40:15.839 align:start position:0%
those resources okay fine fine are there
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
any further questions uh representative
 
00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.589 align:start position:0%
any further questions uh representative
earth

00:40:19.589 --> 00:40:19.599 align:start position:0%
earth
 
00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
oh thank you madam chair
 
00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
so i posed this question in the my
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
queries which apparently i don't know
 
00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:27.040 align:start position:0%
did got 30 or not but related to what
 
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
grants because this is an ongoing
 
00:40:30.069 --> 00:40:30.079 align:start position:0%
program and i was asking about what
 
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
grants have already been made into whom
 
00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
etc i'm guessing your answer is going to
 
00:40:35.270 --> 00:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
be it's on the website which is a good
 
00:40:37.349 --> 00:40:37.359 align:start position:0%
answer could you provide us with it not
 
00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
not right here in in
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
inver in words but could you email to mr
 
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:44.720 align:start position:0%
kane that website address it'd be easy
 
00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:46.720 align:start position:0%
to look up this information
 
00:40:47.829 --> 00:40:47.839 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean we could send you the
 
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
website for uh all the programs here
 
00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
that'd be great thank you this program
 
00:40:53.589 --> 00:40:53.599 align:start position:0%
here i'll just reiterate too is for
 
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
capital improvement uh components of uh
 
00:40:59.190 --> 00:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
uh requests from these organizations but
 
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
i assume it's also the information is
 
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
also probably on the website as well i
 
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
with regard to the specific uh once they
 
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
are approved by council i believe that
 
00:41:12.309 --> 00:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
that that will be up there right so
 
00:41:13.829 --> 00:41:13.839 align:start position:0%
as i said that this is my understanding
 
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
is it's an ongoing program yes many
 
00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
grants have already been authorized so
 
00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
those will probably appear they've been
 
00:41:19.109 --> 00:41:19.119 align:start position:0%
authorized they haven't been through
 
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
council yet they're coming up the next
 
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
meeting all right thank you
 
00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
thank you yes are there further
 
00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:27.990 align:start position:0%
thank you yes are there further
questions

00:41:27.990 --> 00:41:28.000 align:start position:0%
questions

okay i do have just a couple of
 
00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
questions mr lavoy
 
00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:39.349 align:start position:0%
questions mr lavoy
um

00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
i saw your explanation about what you
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
have left out there
 
00:42:47.589 --> 00:42:47.599 align:start position:0%
in um
 
00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
in these variable
 
00:42:52.470 --> 00:42:52.480 align:start position:0%
whatever they're called i assume that
 
00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
those are the ones we see on the highway
 
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
that say
 
00:42:59.510 --> 00:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
you know one death is too many we're at
 
00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
99 or whatever it is
 
00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
is this the sign boards that we're
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
talking about those are the sign boards
 
00:43:07.349 --> 00:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about yes okay
 
00:43:07.359 --> 00:43:08.710 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about yes okay
and

00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
you indicate that you loan these to
 
00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
towns for
 
00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:16.230 align:start position:0%
towns for
whatever

00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
yeah so these are boards
 
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
that the division of emergency services
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
and communications maintains primarily
 
00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
for emergency response
 
00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
capabilities we use them for state
 
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
purposes coordinating with hsem if
 
00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
they're needed but
 
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
locals can also request to to utilize
 
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
those boards they can put a request in
 
00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
through the website form that's on the
 
00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
hscm website
 
00:43:45.109 --> 00:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
and those can be used locally
 
00:43:45.119 --> 00:43:46.390 align:start position:0%
and those can be used locally
and

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:47.270 align:start position:0%
and
how

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
how
 
00:43:49.589 --> 00:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
how long have you had the signs that are
 
00:43:49.599 --> 00:43:50.309 align:start position:0%
how long have you had the signs that are
now

00:43:50.309 --> 00:43:50.319 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
not functional
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
we we've had them for
 
00:43:58.390 --> 00:43:58.400 align:start position:0%
well over i want to say over 10 years uh
 
00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:00.640 align:start position:0%
okay they've
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
they're they're signs that are out in
 
00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:03.839 align:start position:0%
the elements in the weather they wear
 
00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
out over time um
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
and we've been patching them together
 
00:44:09.109 --> 00:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
and keeping them running as best as we
 
00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
can but we continue to lose
 
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
functioning signs on a regular basis so
 
00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
it's not like one or two years it's a
 
00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
it's a long time it's been a while okay
 
00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:44:25.109 --> 00:44:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%

00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
good morning patricia tilley director of
 
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:42.880 align:start position:0%

representative edwards
 
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair and uh thank
 
00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
you miss tilly for engaging with me
 
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
yesterday to um
 
00:45:52.710 --> 00:45:52.720 align:start position:0%
prepare for some of this i
 
00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:54.150 align:start position:0%
prepare for some of this i
i

00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
i i think new hampshire does a great job
 
00:45:59.510 --> 00:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
one of the things we need to do i think
 
00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:00.470 align:start position:0%
one of the things we need to do i think
is

00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:46:03.589 --> 00:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
given some concerns about the cdc
 
00:46:06.309 --> 00:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
coming out and admitting that oftentimes
 
00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
they made policy up as they want without
 
00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
the underlying science i i think that
 
00:46:14.309 --> 00:46:14.319 align:start position:0%
it's incumbent upon us that when we do
 
00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
something controversial and injecting
 
00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
kids under five and
 
00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
boosters over five turns out to be a
 
00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
controversial issue i think it's
 
00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
important for us
 
00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:27.430 align:start position:0%
important for us
to

00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that we're following the
 
00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
science and so we have a policy before
 
00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
us with six million dollars of funding
 
00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
for the state to send mobile vaccines
 
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
out that's the policy
 
00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
that policy should follow the science
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
would you summarize for us
 
00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
what the science is that suggests
 
00:46:50.870 --> 00:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
that the department has done the state's
 
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
due diligence to ensure that there's
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
published peer-reviewed research to
 
00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
indicate that this is a safe and
 
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
efficacious way to go
 
00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question um so what
 
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
we would say primarily i don't know that
 
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
i would necessarily agree with your
 
00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
characterization of the cdc they have
 
00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
had some communications issues and
 
00:47:13.109 --> 00:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
others but we're not here to discuss
 
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
that in terms of the science of vaccine
 
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
the way new hampshire and in particular
 
00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
public health and the department of
 
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
health and human services makes its
 
00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.109 align:start position:0%
health and human services makes its
decision

00:47:23.109 --> 00:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
is based on the data
 
00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:26.790 align:start position:0%
is based on the data
we

00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
led by dr chan who is our state
 
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
epidemiologist and leading infectious
 
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
disease expert he is charged with
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
reviewing all of the data all of the
 
00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed studies around safety and
 
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
efficacy some of the questions have been
 
00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
around vaccine for children we have
 
00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
monitored that data closely we have seen
 
00:47:51.510 --> 00:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
that the current monovalent vaccines are
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
safe and effective in ensuring that kids
 
00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
do not have the worst outcomes of
 
00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
covid19 hospitalizations or even death
 
00:48:01.829 --> 00:48:01.839 align:start position:0%
we know that in new hampshire that we've
 
00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
been lucky we have only had one death of
 
00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
a child during this pandemic while we've
 
00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
had over 2 600 deaths through the great
 
00:48:12.309 --> 00:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
through the adult population we continue
 
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
to have about a death a day
 
00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
in the adult population of covenant 19.
 
00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
covet has not gone away
 
00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
so we are continuing to look at that
 
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
data we look at the broad effects from
 
00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
both the efficacy of the vaccine itself
 
00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
and balance that with the long-term
 
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
effects of covid19 in children we see
 
00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:34.640 align:start position:0%
long-term effects even with those
 
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
smaller numbers we know that 20 to 29
 
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:38.960 align:start position:0%
year olds are actually the age group
 
00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
that have coveted the most but the 10 to
 
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
19 year old population is is up there as
 
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
well um and we know that there are um
 
00:48:49.750 --> 00:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
implications of essentially long covered
 
00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
from children who have had coven 19
 
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
infections there are other outcomes from
 
00:48:58.630 --> 00:48:58.640 align:start position:0%
myocarditis some impacts around diabetes
 
00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
that are really concerning and so we
 
00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
think it is effective policy in order to
 
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
have vaccine available to children and
 
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
to adults there's no requirement for
 
00:49:13.349 --> 00:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
covid19 vaccine in school or child care
 
00:49:15.349 --> 00:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
this is a decision that families can
 
00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
make for themselves and individuals can
 
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
make for themselves as adults but it is
 
00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
our job and it is our policy direction
 
00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
that we think we should make vaccine as
 
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
easily available in every nook and
 
00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
cranny around the state and our mobile
 
00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
vaccine services help us we know that
 
00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:34.160 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:49:37.109 --> 00:49:37.119 align:start position:0%
we administered almost 40 000 around 40
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
000 doses through our mobile vaccine
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
services so there was obviously a demand
 
00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
communities asked us for the van we
 
00:49:46.630 --> 00:49:46.640 align:start position:0%
deployed it there was no pushing of
 
00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
vaccine this was in reaction to
 
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
the input from our community members we
 
00:49:55.829 --> 00:49:55.839 align:start position:0%
were also able to vaccinate over 2 000
 
00:49:58.790 --> 00:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
homebound individuals again individuals
 
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
that had limited access to get that
 
00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
my follow-up
 
00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chairman and uh thank
 
00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
you for
 
00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
that reply
 
00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:13.589 align:start position:0%
that reply
i'm

00:50:13.589 --> 00:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
glad that dr chan is reviewing all the
 
00:50:16.079 --> 00:50:17.349 align:start position:0%
glad that dr chan is reviewing all the
literature

00:50:17.349 --> 00:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
literature
 
00:50:20.069 --> 00:50:20.079 align:start position:0%
is there a way to make available to the
 
00:50:20.079 --> 00:50:21.589 align:start position:0%
is there a way to make available to the
public

00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
a set of the literature that he's looked
 
00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
at that specifically supports the idea
 
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:28.870 align:start position:0%
at that specifically supports the idea
that

00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:50:31.109 --> 00:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
providing this vaccine to kids under
 
00:50:31.119 --> 00:50:32.150 align:start position:0%
providing this vaccine to kids under
five

00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
five
 
00:50:35.430 --> 00:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
and boosters to those over five that
 
00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
that is safe and efficacious and and
 
00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
what i'm looking for there is actual
 
00:50:43.109 --> 00:50:43.119 align:start position:0%
academic research that's been published
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
and peer reviewed
 
00:50:46.549 --> 00:50:46.559 align:start position:0%
that so that the public can understand
 
00:50:48.069 --> 00:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
and get a glimpse
 
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
into the decision process that that
 
00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
we're going through on their behalf
 
00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question we can
 
00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
certainly look into what the best way to
 
00:50:57.430 --> 00:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
share that data whether it's on our
 
00:50:59.109 --> 00:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
website or others
 
00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
i as the committee knows i shared a long
 
00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
list a long literature review last night
 
00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
looking at those very specific to around
 
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
a kid's vaccine but around the
 
00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
efficaciousness of the of the vaccine
 
00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
and also some of the other effects of
 
00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
covid19 we can work with our
 
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
communications folks to determine the
 
00:51:21.349 --> 00:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
best way that we can make that available
 
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
okay uh before you go on
 
00:51:25.109 --> 00:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
00:51:26.630 --> 00:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
um what
 
00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
we're looking for
 
00:51:28.559 --> 00:51:29.829 align:start position:0%
we're looking for
is

00:51:29.829 --> 00:51:29.839 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:51:33.030 --> 00:51:33.040 align:start position:0%
not a list of the studies
 
00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:34.720 align:start position:0%
okay but rather
 
00:51:38.549 --> 00:51:38.559 align:start position:0%
kind of a dr chan's summary
 
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense because
 
00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:44.470 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense because
because

00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:47.030 --> 00:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know about
 
00:51:49.589 --> 00:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
peop everybody but it would be nice to
 
00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
have a summary and then if i want to go
 
00:51:53.589 --> 00:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
someplace else i can do that sure we can
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
certainly provide that okay thank you
 
00:51:57.190 --> 00:51:57.200 align:start position:0%
uh yes
 
00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:58.069 align:start position:0%
uh yes
uh

00:51:58.069 --> 00:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:51:59.750 --> 00:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you man i'm sure and then on a
 
00:52:03.589 --> 00:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
slightly separate topic um in the uh
 
00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
it says that
 
00:52:07.349 --> 00:52:07.359 align:start position:0%
the this program is necessary to help
 
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
students return to school
 
00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
but the
 
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:12.640 align:start position:0%
services don't actually start until
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
october and so i as i remember school
 
00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
kids they've already begun to go to
 
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
school so is this is just is this just
 
00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
poorly written or or did we mean
 
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
something else
 
00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
no i i think you know as you know we
 
00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
prepare these documents long in advance
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
before they actually get to you um we
 
00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
are um in short we want to um with these
 
00:52:35.829 --> 00:52:35.839 align:start position:0%
funds we're going to bring them to if
 
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
approved today we will bring it to
 
00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
governor and council at the end of the
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
month that's a little bit later than we
 
00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
had originally anticipated but
 
00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
regardless whether it's for kids to go
 
00:52:48.069 --> 00:52:48.079 align:start position:0%
back to school or kids to stay in school
 
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
it's really important that we have
 
00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
access to a vaccine i think we have all
 
00:52:54.069 --> 00:52:54.079 align:start position:0%
felt anyone with a child in their life
 
00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
the impact of having to have a child be
 
00:52:59.589 --> 00:52:59.599 align:start position:0%
in isolation out of school and the
 
00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
impact that it has on their caregivers
 
00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
ability to work so i i think we could
 
00:53:06.549 --> 00:53:06.559 align:start position:0%
word that differently but i think that's
 
00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
an artifact of when we've actually
 
00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
started writing the letter all right
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for that the reason i'm so
 
00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
picky is because this goes to the public
 
00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:15.839 align:start position:0%
and this is our communication and it's
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
important to maintain credibility and
 
00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
one way to do that is to write precisely
 
00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
so so that that's where i'm going with
 
00:53:24.549 --> 00:53:24.559 align:start position:0%
that and and if there are no no other
 
00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
questions man i'm sure i i'd be prepared
 
00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:32.319 align:start position:0%
to approve but yeah okay representative
 
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:53:36.230 --> 00:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
so why does the state
 
00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
need to be involved in this vaccine
 
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
distribution and not others
 
00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
a that's a really great question so i
 
00:53:44.549 --> 00:53:44.559 align:start position:0%
think if you look at
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
childhood routine childhood vaccinations
 
00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
we have a long established process by
 
00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
which we provide free vaccines
 
00:53:55.510 --> 00:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
vaccines for children to all providers
 
00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
we have a complicated way in which we
 
00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
work with the insurance companies in
 
00:54:01.829 --> 00:54:01.839 align:start position:0%
order to fund that so that we can have
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
universal access to vaccine that is a
 
00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
artifact of decades worth of work um and
 
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
there's a routine to getting that
 
00:54:09.359 --> 00:54:10.549 align:start position:0%
there's a routine to getting that
vaccine

00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
covid19 is still
 
00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
supplied by the federal government again
 
00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
separately than if i go to the
 
00:54:18.790 --> 00:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical market to get the other
 
00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
vaccines that's a different process the
 
00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
with the federal market we the
 
00:54:25.109 --> 00:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
receives a tranche of vaccines another
 
00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
set of the vaccines go directly to some
 
00:54:33.109 --> 00:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
of the partners like pharmacies there's
 
00:54:35.589 --> 00:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
a direct federal relationship between
 
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
retail pharmacies the federal government
 
00:54:39.589 --> 00:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
there's also a direct relationship in
 
00:54:42.309 --> 00:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
other areas like federal corrections and
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
to a smaller degree federally qualified
 
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
health centers so we are essentially the
 
00:54:49.510 --> 00:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
middle men in this particular vaccine
 
00:54:51.109 --> 00:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
because of the way the federal
 
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
government has procured it
 
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
it is also um we are still in the middle
 
00:54:57.829 --> 00:54:57.839 align:start position:0%
of a public health incident so we are
 
00:55:00.549 --> 00:55:00.559 align:start position:0%
still managing this as an emergency we
 
00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
certainly aren't using emergency powers
 
00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
as we did early in the vac in the
 
00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
vaccinate or the pandemic but we are
 
00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
still controlling it on a day-to-day or
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
managing it on a day-to-day basis
 
00:55:14.549 --> 00:55:14.559 align:start position:0%
ensuring that we get vaccines to the
 
00:55:16.790 --> 00:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
right populations ensure that there's
 
00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
equitable distribution everywhere
 
00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
instead of just leaving it to the
 
00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:27.589 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:55:27.589 --> 00:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:55:27.599 --> 00:55:29.030 align:start position:0%
okay
uh

00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
senator daniels
 
00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
thank you these services offered through
 
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
mobile are still being offered through
 
00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy or have they been
 
00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
discontinued no these services are also
 
00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:42.960 align:start position:0%
available in pharmacy i think right now
 
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
those bivalent vaccines have just
 
00:55:47.349 --> 00:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
started to land in the state and you can
 
00:55:50.069 --> 00:55:50.079 align:start position:0%
get online and go to cvs and walgreens
 
00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:52.559 align:start position:0%
and so if you are someone who's capable
 
00:55:54.789 --> 00:55:54.799 align:start position:0%
and or willing to go through an app and
 
00:55:57.270 --> 00:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
find a find a vaccine time and get
 
00:55:59.670 --> 00:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
yourself there you can do that if that's
 
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
if that's the direction you want to go
 
00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
what we found last year in particular
 
00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
that we were ma
 
00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
the mobile vans made it more convenient
 
00:56:10.870 --> 00:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
for individuals an example i often use
 
00:56:13.190 --> 00:56:13.200 align:start position:0%
is we were able to go to
 
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
work sites and again the work site did
 
00:56:16.870 --> 00:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
not require the vaccine for its
 
00:56:18.309 --> 00:56:18.319 align:start position:0%
employees but wanted to make it
 
00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
available they understood the value in
 
00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
keeping their own workers working and
 
00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
many of the workers wanted to
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
participate and we were able to send the
 
00:56:29.109 --> 00:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
van out in off hours for third shift
 
00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
workers that's the sort of flexibility
 
00:56:33.829 --> 00:56:33.839 align:start position:0%
that the van provides for us we can go
 
00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
to a certain event that if they invite
 
00:56:37.829 --> 00:56:37.839 align:start position:0%
us we can bring there and people can
 
00:56:39.829 --> 00:56:39.839 align:start position:0%
then take that opportunity to get their
 
00:56:42.069 --> 00:56:42.079 align:start position:0%
vaccine rather than trying to get an
 
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
appointment either at their provider or
 
00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
at a retail pharmacy follow-up yes so
 
00:56:49.109 --> 00:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
where does the
 
00:56:52.630 --> 00:56:52.640 align:start position:0%
department uh find balance between
 
00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
personal responsibility and
 
00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
thinking that it's our job
 
00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
to to go to somebody's door as opposed
 
00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
to them uh taking the time to go to the
 
00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
pharmacy on their own sure because there
 
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
is there is a cost to that there is a
 
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
cost and i think that's something that
 
00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
we struggle with in in public health or
 
00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
we balance every day of what's personal
 
00:57:14.630 --> 00:57:14.640 align:start position:0%
responsibility and what's protective of
 
00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
public health this particular strategy
 
00:57:20.710 --> 00:57:20.720 align:start position:0%
not only protects individuals it also
 
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
protects the community we still have a
 
00:57:25.030 --> 00:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
valid interest in ensuring that we
 
00:57:27.430 --> 00:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
reduce and mitigate the spread of
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
covid19 i think we've all learned how
 
00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
expensive those surges of covid19 are to
 
00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
our workplaces who lose staff
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
to those who have to stay home we've
 
00:57:40.230 --> 00:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
seen the implications over and over and
 
00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
we certainly and right now as i noted
 
00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
we're still having at least a person a
 
00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
day die by covid19 it was the third
 
00:57:49.109 --> 00:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
leading cause of death last year so
 
00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
we're still making that balance
 
00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:53.750 align:start position:0%
we're still making that balance
okay

00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
00:57:58.870 --> 00:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
represent edwards uh thank you madam
 
00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
chair as as you know i i wrestled with
 
00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
making a motion a table um but i i'm not
 
00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
going to do that i i just would
 
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate a much stronger commitment by
 
00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
the department to have dr chan sign a
 
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
certifying that he's reviewed the
 
00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
research and that he believes in his
 
00:58:23.030 --> 00:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
professional opinion that this is safe
 
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
and efficacious for this these age
 
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
groups i i heard the department respond
 
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
to it in general but i didn't hear a
 
00:58:31.990 --> 00:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
strong yes we will get it done we'll get
 
00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
it done within a week i'd i'd like i'd
 
00:58:38.069 --> 00:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
thank you i i i need to go back to the
 
00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
team to determine which is what is the
 
00:58:44.150 --> 00:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
best way we agree in in the intent of
 
00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
what you're asking i think we can get
 
00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
there i just don't know exactly what
 
00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
that would look like in this moment
 
00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
i i'm fine with that i i what i'm
 
00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
looking for is is clear accountability
 
00:58:57.190 --> 00:58:57.200 align:start position:0%
that we have an individual who says i've
 
00:59:00.069 --> 00:59:00.079 align:start position:0%
done the research and and this is good
 
00:59:03.030 --> 00:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
so that's that's what i'm looking for so
 
00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for your patience
 
00:59:05.829 --> 00:59:05.839 align:start position:0%

department of health and human services
 
01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:39.440 align:start position:0%

01:00:41.349 --> 01:00:41.359 align:start position:0%
do you have any particular question you
 
01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:43.280 align:start position:0%
want me to start with or would you like
 
01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
me to just give a general overview to
 
01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
start of the item why don't we start
 
01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
with just a general overview i think
 
01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful sure
 
01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
um so this item here for solution health
 
01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:56.079 align:start position:0%
when we look at whether the work of the
 
01:00:58.150 --> 01:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
department over the last several years
 
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
of building a system of care
 
01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:02.640 align:start position:0%
which is basically building services on
 
01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
a continuum from least acuity need to
 
01:01:07.430 --> 01:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
higher acuity need we've spent a lot of
 
01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
time doing that
 
01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
since covid the
 
01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
increase in demand for higher acuity
 
01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:13.670 align:start position:0%
increase in demand for higher acuity
services

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
has been there and over the last year
 
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
the commissioner has been out publicly
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
talking about working to find vendors to
 
01:01:23.349 --> 01:01:23.359 align:start position:0%
work with us to meet those services
 
01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
as you may recall back in january one of
 
01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
those vendors was hca when we were here
 
01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:31.839 align:start position:0%
to submit and accept and expend for that
 
01:01:31.839 --> 01:01:33.270 align:start position:0%
to submit and accept and expend for that
money

01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:01:35.829 --> 01:01:35.839 align:start position:0%
unfortunately since that time we have
 
01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:37.760 align:start position:0%
worked with hca and have not been able
 
01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
to reach agreement so we're not able to
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
move forward at this time with hca
 
01:01:44.950 --> 01:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
we are able however to present to you
 
01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
the solution health which is really the
 
01:01:48.309 --> 01:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
other vendor so
 
01:01:50.309 --> 01:01:50.319 align:start position:0%
this vendor is coming to you now because
 
01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
we're here in
 
01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
in front of fiscal but we have been
 
01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
talking with them for a while as well
 
01:01:58.950 --> 01:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
and they are ready to move forward
 
01:01:58.960 --> 01:01:59.910 align:start position:0%
and they are ready to move forward
um

01:01:59.910 --> 01:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:02.549 --> 01:02:02.559 align:start position:0%
it's the same prototype of a contract so
 
01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
when we look at what we were asking for
 
01:02:06.470 --> 01:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
hca and what we're asking for here it's
 
01:02:07.589 --> 01:02:07.599 align:start position:0%
pretty much
 
01:02:09.349 --> 01:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
the same
 
01:02:12.069 --> 01:02:12.079 align:start position:0%
ask which is to offset the capital costs
 
01:02:15.109 --> 01:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
for them to build services and in return
 
01:02:17.589 --> 01:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
guarantee the state access to services
 
01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
when we need them for that continuum of
 
01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
care for higher acuity services
 
01:02:23.829 --> 01:02:23.839 align:start position:0%
it is our plan that should this be
 
01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
approved today that we would go to
 
01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
governor and council
 
01:02:29.349 --> 01:02:29.359 align:start position:0%
with our request for that grant which
 
01:02:31.030 --> 01:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
would detail what we would ask the
 
01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
vendor specifically to be doing in
 
01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
addition to the accept and expend
 
01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
most times we go to council for the
 
01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
accept and expend and come back with the
 
01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
contract we are going to do that all
 
01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
together should this be approved here
 
01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:47.829 align:start position:0%
together should this be approved here
today

01:02:47.829 --> 01:02:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
are there any questions uh
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
representative edwards uh thank you
 
01:02:53.829 --> 01:02:53.839 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you miss weaver
 
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
for taking the question i
 
01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:57.510 align:start position:0%
for taking the question i
i

01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
i would just ask you if you could help
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
clarify my understanding of the scenario
 
01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
here when
 
01:03:07.030 --> 01:03:07.040 align:start position:0%
we approved essentially saying this it's
 
01:03:09.670 --> 01:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
essentially the same deal as we offered
 
01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
hca now we're offering uh solution
 
01:03:15.349 --> 01:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
health which i understand is somehow
 
01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
affiliated with elliott
 
01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
when when when we cast that vote i could
 
01:03:24.390 --> 01:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
have sworn that we were told that hca
 
01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
had been identified because we had done
 
01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:29.680 align:start position:0%
our due diligence in the state and
 
01:03:32.230 --> 01:03:32.240 align:start position:0%
nobody else had wanted to to bid or
 
01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
participate in an offer like that
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
and so to find ourselves a few months
 
01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:38.309 align:start position:0%
and so to find ourselves a few months
later

01:03:38.309 --> 01:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
later
 
01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
now with elliot basically uh saying that
 
01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
they'd be open to this i'm i'm i'm
 
01:03:47.109 --> 01:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
curious did did did the situation evolve
 
01:03:49.510 --> 01:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
did we not do the right homework up
 
01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:50.549 align:start position:0%
did we not do the right homework up
front

01:03:50.549 --> 01:03:50.559 align:start position:0%
front
 
01:03:53.109 --> 01:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious about that that gap
 
01:03:55.990 --> 01:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
from going from only hca is willing to
 
01:03:58.549 --> 01:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
do this to finding a replacement and i'm
 
01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
happy about it by the way
 
01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
sure i
 
01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
i believe in in in terms of doing our
 
01:04:06.069 --> 01:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
due diligence i believe that we did do
 
01:04:08.230 --> 01:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
that and we did have two interested
 
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
parties at the time hca was the one that
 
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
was able to come forward first with and
 
01:04:14.789 --> 01:04:14.799 align:start position:0%
and be able to get to a point where we
 
01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
could ask for an acceptance spend um
 
01:04:18.950 --> 01:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
solution health at that time hadn't
 
01:04:21.270 --> 01:04:21.280 align:start position:0%
materialized so the commissioner has
 
01:04:23.349 --> 01:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
said publicly several times that we were
 
01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
looking at two vendors that could meet
 
01:04:31.349 --> 01:04:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
are there further quotes senator
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
rosenwald thank you madam chair
 
01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
i'm just can you clarify
 
01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
whether the
 
01:04:44.549 --> 01:04:44.559 align:start position:0%
25 drf beds
 
01:04:48.069 --> 01:04:48.079 align:start position:0%
would be a net ad or is elliot planning
 
01:04:50.309 --> 01:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
to close its
 
01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
drf beds and move them to this new
 
01:04:57.990 --> 01:04:58.000 align:start position:0%
facility i'm sure marissa do you wanna
 
01:05:00.870 --> 01:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
and the other beds too the voluntary
 
01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:02.630 align:start position:0%
and the other beds too the voluntary
beds

01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
beds
 
01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:05:07.109 --> 01:05:07.119 align:start position:0%
sure so um based on the letter of intent
 
01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
and discussions that we've had to date
 
01:05:11.829 --> 01:05:11.839 align:start position:0%
um you'll see on page on page three of
 
01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
the item we have the the the inpatient's
 
01:05:18.069 --> 01:05:18.079 align:start position:0%
bed listed there um we have listed 25
 
01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
beds which is essentially doubling the
 
01:05:21.270 --> 01:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
existing capacity obviously we couldn't
 
01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
exactly you know it's not doubling
 
01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
because it's 12.5
 
01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
um but but it as i understand it it
 
01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:28.720 align:start position:0%
would be a net increase at this point
 
01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:30.309 align:start position:0%
would be a net increase at this point
however

01:05:30.309 --> 01:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
ultimately um you know the final figures
 
01:05:33.270 --> 01:05:33.280 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
determined through negotiations in in
 
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
the final agreement
 
01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
so the elliot is not closing its
 
01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
inpatient units
 
01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:44.630 align:start position:0%
inpatient units
and

01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
using that space to do
 
01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:49.829 align:start position:0%
using that space to do
something

01:05:49.829 --> 01:05:49.839 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:05:51.190 --> 01:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
well then
 
01:05:53.589 --> 01:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
not to my knowledge no would we be
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
requiring that
 
01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
i i think as nathan had said i think we
 
01:05:58.789 --> 01:05:58.799 align:start position:0%
would go through an occasion
 
01:06:00.549 --> 01:06:00.559 align:start position:0%
negotiations won't know that but i don't
 
01:06:01.829 --> 01:06:01.839 align:start position:0%
think we're planning on requiring
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
anybody to close anything what we're
 
01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
requiring is access to services that we
 
01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
don't currently have
 
01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
through that vendor
 
01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
thank you i wasn't thinking we would
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
require elliott to close their beds i
 
01:06:18.630 --> 01:06:18.640 align:start position:0%
was hoping maybe we would require them
 
01:06:21.349 --> 01:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
to keep them open i see that as of
 
01:06:21.359 --> 01:06:22.630 align:start position:0%
to keep them open i see that as of
yesterday

01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
we had 35 adults
 
01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
waiting for
 
01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
an emergency bed so
 
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
we haven't solved
 
01:06:33.510 --> 01:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
the er boarding crisis
 
01:06:35.430 --> 01:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
despite approving
 
01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
lots of millions of dollars
 
01:06:43.190 --> 01:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
giving solution health this money and
 
01:06:49.670 --> 01:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
saying you have to keep these beds open
 
01:06:51.270 --> 01:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
or are we
 
01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:54.309 align:start position:0%
or are we
not

01:06:54.309 --> 01:06:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:56.950 --> 01:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
so if it would be helpful i i can speak
 
01:06:58.549 --> 01:06:58.559 align:start position:0%
to sort of what we're envisioning for
 
01:07:00.309 --> 01:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
the larger agreement and and how that
 
01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
would work if you think that would
 
01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
helpful because it kind of feeds into
 
01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:06.799 align:start position:0%
your question if you would like that
 
01:07:09.349 --> 01:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
i mean yes go ahead i think we are all
 
01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
interested in sure solving the er
 
01:07:15.029 --> 01:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
boarding crisis i know we
 
01:07:17.829 --> 01:07:17.839 align:start position:0%
approved money for all the hospitals to
 
01:07:21.109 --> 01:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
open drf beds there were no takers
 
01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
this time
 
01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:24.470 align:start position:0%
this time
the

01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
hca plan didn't move forward
 
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
i'm hopeful about
 
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
this proposal i know
 
01:07:35.910 --> 01:07:35.920 align:start position:0%
the elliott and southern are interested
 
01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:38.390 align:start position:0%
the elliott and southern are interested
but

01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:41.270 --> 01:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
we have some leverage
 
01:07:43.990 --> 01:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
with this money and i'm just
 
01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.109 align:start position:0%
with this money and i'm just
hoping

01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
hoping
 
01:07:47.670 --> 01:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
and that the department will use that
 
01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
leverage and wondering
 
01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
if you're going to
 
01:07:54.710 --> 01:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
yes so so we we fully intend to so the
 
01:07:56.549 --> 01:07:56.559 align:start position:0%
agreement itself is going to look a
 
01:07:57.910 --> 01:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
little different than many of the
 
01:07:59.990 --> 01:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
contracts that we typically have
 
01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:02.720 align:start position:0%
um in this case it would
 
01:08:04.309 --> 01:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
it would likely be an agreement that has
 
01:08:07.190 --> 01:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
two major phases and the first phase is
 
01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
the construction phase so during at
 
01:08:10.870 --> 01:08:10.880 align:start position:0%
which point the
 
01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
solution health would incur construction
 
01:08:14.950 --> 01:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
costs they would submit in invoices we'd
 
01:08:18.309 --> 01:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
reimburse them for qualified payments
 
01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
after that once the facility would be
 
01:08:21.990 --> 01:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
ready to go live and start accepting
 
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
patients that's where we envision
 
01:08:27.829 --> 01:08:27.839 align:start position:0%
a a 10 potentially 12-year commitment
 
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:30.480 align:start position:0%
where they would be required to ensure
 
01:08:32.789 --> 01:08:32.799 align:start position:0%
certain levels of service and there'd be
 
01:08:34.870 --> 01:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
required quarterly monthly annual
 
01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
potentially biannual reporting
 
01:08:39.749 --> 01:08:39.759 align:start position:0%
requirements based upon the specific
 
01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
terms of those
 
01:08:43.990 --> 01:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
of that agreement we would also um
 
01:08:45.510 --> 01:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
ensure that there would be clawback
 
01:08:47.430 --> 01:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
provisions so that if certain levels of
 
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
services were not provided
 
01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
we would have the ability to claw back
 
01:08:54.070 --> 01:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
some of those funds
 
01:08:56.309 --> 01:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
and or extend the length of the contract
 
01:08:56.319 --> 01:08:57.510 align:start position:0%
and or extend the length of the contract
we're

01:08:57.510 --> 01:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:08:59.110 --> 01:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
as as we've been looking at this
 
01:09:01.030 --> 01:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
agreement we've consulted with many
 
01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
different individuals to make sure that
 
01:09:05.669 --> 01:09:05.679 align:start position:0%
whatever the final agreement looks like
 
01:09:09.030 --> 01:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
it will ensure that a we have long-term
 
01:09:12.070 --> 01:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
access to services for the state and b
 
01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
we have the ability
 
01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
to take action if if necessary if the
 
01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
required services that have been
 
01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
outlined within that agreement are not
 
01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:21.669 align:start position:0%
outlined within that agreement are not
met

01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
met
 
01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
yes senator daniels thank you
 
01:09:32.630 --> 01:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
on page three your justification for
 
01:09:34.789 --> 01:09:34.799 align:start position:0%
this capital s
 
01:09:36.789 --> 01:09:36.799 align:start position:0%
seems to be based upon
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
the the covet blip which
 
01:09:41.110 --> 01:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
tends to be an anomaly
 
01:09:44.149 --> 01:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
in the whole course of things so my my
 
01:09:45.990 --> 01:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
question here is
 
01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.470 align:start position:0%
question here is
uh

01:09:48.470 --> 01:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:09:50.470 --> 01:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
since you're basing this
 
01:09:52.309 --> 01:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
on that period of time what are you
 
01:09:52.319 --> 01:09:53.349 align:start position:0%
on that period of time what are you
doing

01:09:53.349 --> 01:09:53.359 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:09:53.359 --> 01:09:54.390 align:start position:0%
doing
to

01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:55.189 align:start position:0%
to
uh

01:09:55.189 --> 01:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:09:55.199 --> 01:09:56.470 align:start position:0%
uh
address

01:09:56.470 --> 01:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
address
 
01:09:57.910 --> 01:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
what happened
 
01:10:00.550 --> 01:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
during during covid so that it doesn't
 
01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
happen again and
 
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
does that maybe necessitate not the need
 
01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
for such a
 
01:10:09.750 --> 01:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
large facility or or the services that
 
01:10:13.030 --> 01:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:14.950 --> 01:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
thank you senator daniels marissa hen
 
01:10:17.910 --> 01:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
associate commissioner dj jess
 
01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
i think it's interesting when we think
 
01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
about an event like
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
covid because we don't yet know how long
 
01:10:26.229 --> 01:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
the impacts
 
01:10:28.070 --> 01:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
um on a population level when it comes
 
01:10:29.430 --> 01:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
to behavioral health how long that will
 
01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
last we know from other
 
01:10:33.910 --> 01:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
mass events that affect populations
 
01:10:35.510 --> 01:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
things like hurricane katrina et cetera
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
that oftentimes the impacts from a
 
01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
emotional psychological distress
 
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
standpoint can last for decades so
 
01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
many of our local and national and
 
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
international indicators are suggesting
 
01:10:48.229 --> 01:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
that we may have an increased prevalence
 
01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
and acuity of behavioral health need for
 
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
a very long time to come that said i
 
01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
think you raise an important question
 
01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
which is how do we not restrict this
 
01:10:58.149 --> 01:10:58.159 align:start position:0%
just to the covid phenomenon but also
 
01:11:00.149 --> 01:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
build on all the important work that's
 
01:11:02.229 --> 01:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
been going on across the state to
 
01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
address behavioral health needs and i
 
01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
think to the deputy commissioner's point
 
01:11:08.950 --> 01:11:08.960 align:start position:0%
this is building on the 10-year mental
 
01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
health plan and the system of care work
 
01:11:12.070 --> 01:11:12.080 align:start position:0%
to really ensure that we have a
 
01:11:14.229 --> 01:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
continuum of services
 
01:11:15.990 --> 01:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
that we're offering of course still
 
01:11:18.709 --> 01:11:18.719 align:start position:0%
committing to that community-based
 
01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:20.719 align:start position:0%
objective of serving people in their
 
01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:22.400 align:start position:0%
homes in their communities when possible
 
01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
but recognizing there remains a need for
 
01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
that sort of tip of the pyramid level of
 
01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:27.669 align:start position:0%
that sort of tip of the pyramid level of
acute

01:11:27.669 --> 01:11:27.679 align:start position:0%
acute
 
01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
acute care services and that that needs
 
01:11:31.990 --> 01:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
to be provided in more than one facility
 
01:11:33.669 --> 01:11:33.679 align:start position:0%
um and and of course that you know to
 
01:11:36.310 --> 01:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
the question of of hampstead having
 
01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
these beds for children for example not
 
01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
just at hampstead but also offering it
 
01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:43.840 align:start position:0%
at a peer facility is a particular
 
01:11:48.229 --> 01:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:50.630 --> 01:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none could i

are there
 
01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
any questions from um
 
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:07.669 --> 01:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
representative edwards uh thank you
 
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
madam chair and it's just an observation
 
01:13:11.910 --> 01:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
that uh this
 
01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:13.110 align:start position:0%
that uh this
312

01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
312
 
01:13:15.350 --> 01:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
has the same issues as the prior three
 
01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
that i isolated there's there's nothing
 
01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
it's 252 000 it's not a great deal of
 
01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
money but uh when you read the
 
01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
explanation there's nothing uh
 
01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
quantitative in here to give us an
 
01:13:31.189 --> 01:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
understanding of exactly what this 252
 
01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
is going to do what if we're going to
 
01:13:35.590 --> 01:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
spend money what does the end state look
 
01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
like what is our goal what's our
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
objective is it measurable those are the
 
01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
kinds of things i think the fiscal
 
01:13:42.070 --> 01:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
committee needs to know about
 
01:13:44.070 --> 01:13:44.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm not going to oppose this i
 
01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make that point again
 
01:13:49.510 --> 01:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
senator rosenwald thank you
 
01:13:52.709 --> 01:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
i was sort of a chicken in a question
 
01:13:56.229 --> 01:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
you state in the narrative that
 
01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
birth centers are maybe increasing their
 
01:14:01.750 --> 01:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
deliveries because
 
01:14:04.870 --> 01:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
families are choosing not to have births
 
01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
in a hospital setting but to what extent
 
01:14:09.830 --> 01:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
are we seeing
 
01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
this being influenced by the number of
 
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
hospitals that are closing their
 
01:14:16.149 --> 01:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
birthing units
 
01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you patricia tilly again
 
01:14:19.590 --> 01:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
director of public health thank you for
 
01:14:21.669 --> 01:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
that question senator we're not sure
 
01:14:23.510 --> 01:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
right now i think that that requires a
 
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
little bit more study and a lot more
 
01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
detail of understanding where the
 
01:14:30.229 --> 01:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
individuals come from who have those
 
01:14:32.390 --> 01:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
births so it's not surprising that many
 
01:14:33.990 --> 01:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
of those freestanding birth centers are
 
01:14:35.669 --> 01:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
in some of the more densely populated
 
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
areas of state so they would still have
 
01:14:40.630 --> 01:14:40.640 align:start position:0%
access as opposed to
 
01:14:42.149 --> 01:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
the birth closures that we've really
 
01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
seen cut across the middle of new
 
01:14:46.790 --> 01:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire um oddly enough if you if you
 
01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
know route 11 that goes east west it's
 
01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
roughly along route 11 that's where
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
we've seen the first round of big
 
01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
closures from claremont all the way to
 
01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
the eastern part of the state we have
 
01:14:59.669 --> 01:14:59.679 align:start position:0%
some closures up north um
 
01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
so you know we would need to do more
 
01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
digging to figure out which we've just
 
01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
looked at right now and we've certainly
 
01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
seen the numbers that all births in new
 
01:15:11.669 --> 01:15:11.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire have gone up in 2020 and 2021
 
01:15:13.350 --> 01:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire was one of the only states
 
01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
to have an increase in births in 2021 so
 
01:15:18.630 --> 01:15:18.640 align:start position:0%
it's hard to pull apart if this is just
 
01:15:21.510 --> 01:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
an artifact of it's the same proportion
 
01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
that are going or if we're seeing a real
 
01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
increase we know anecdotally what we've
 
01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
heard from the birth centers is that
 
01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
people are saying it was because of
 
01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
covid it was about a more personalized
 
01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
experience it was about being able to
 
01:15:36.310 --> 01:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
bring people especially in 2021 where
 
01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
you couldn't bring
 
01:15:40.229 --> 01:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
supportive partners to the birth all of
 
01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
that has contributed to some of their
 
01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
growth but i can't tell you definitively
 
01:15:47.189 --> 01:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up thank you i knew that at
 
01:15:50.709 --> 01:15:50.719 align:start position:0%
some point the state was paying
 
01:15:52.709 --> 01:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
an enhanced
 
01:15:56.229 --> 01:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
payment to um
 
01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
androscoggin valley correct to keep
 
01:16:01.590 --> 01:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
their ob unit open are we still doing
 
01:16:04.390 --> 01:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
that and are we doing that to any other
 
01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
hospital well thank you yes it is my
 
01:16:09.510 --> 01:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
understanding i am not henry lipman
 
01:16:11.669 --> 01:16:11.679 align:start position:0%
but i can tell you that we are still
 
01:16:13.189 --> 01:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
providing that enhanced payment to
 
01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
andrew scoggin luckily with support of
 
01:16:17.350 --> 01:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
the legislature we were able to have an
 
01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
increase in all rates for birth centers
 
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
and in particular among those rural
 
01:16:24.229 --> 01:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
areas so we're looking forward to that
 
01:16:26.070 --> 01:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
at moving forward to have some increased
 
01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
rates for everyone but androscoggin has
 
01:16:30.630 --> 01:16:30.640 align:start position:0%
historically kept that rate they have a
 
01:16:32.709 --> 01:16:32.719 align:start position:0%
rel you know if we were to lose
 
01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
androscoggin that would be a huge
 
01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:41.110 --> 01:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
senator daniels
 
01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
thank you in the course of doing
 
01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
business i i would look at
 
01:16:47.430 --> 01:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
insurance premiums in this case
 
01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:48.950 align:start position:0%
insurance premiums in this case
malpractice

01:16:48.950 --> 01:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
malpractice
 
01:16:51.270 --> 01:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
premiums as a
 
01:16:54.390 --> 01:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
an ongoing operating expense and so my
 
01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
ques my question is uh what's the
 
01:16:59.510 --> 01:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
justification of using one-time money
 
01:17:02.229 --> 01:17:02.239 align:start position:0%
through opera funds to to pay for
 
01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
operating expense which are ongoing as
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
opposed to one-time cost thank you
 
01:17:09.030 --> 01:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
senator dalios i think that's a very
 
01:17:11.590 --> 01:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
fair question one of the health center
 
01:17:14.229 --> 01:17:14.239 align:start position:0%
one of the birth centers reported to us
 
01:17:16.950 --> 01:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
and reported to gopher that their
 
01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
malpractice insurance had typically been
 
01:17:22.149 --> 01:17:22.159 align:start position:0%
from about twenty four thousand dollars
 
01:17:24.630 --> 01:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
rose in one year to sixty eight thousand
 
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
dollars their volume is so small that
 
01:17:29.189 --> 01:17:29.199 align:start position:0%
they were unable to keep you know that
 
01:17:31.030 --> 01:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
would be a rounding error in many other
 
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
businesses but that was enough to can
 
01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
have them consider closing their doors
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
so i think this is a stop gap measure
 
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
for two years to help them get back on
 
01:17:41.430 --> 01:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
their feet we have some increased rates
 
01:17:43.350 --> 01:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
coming forward for the birth centers so
 
01:17:45.910 --> 01:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
that should be able to equal that
 
01:17:48.070 --> 01:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
that balance of being able to provide
 
01:17:50.470 --> 01:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
one-time support and then support it
 
01:17:52.070 --> 01:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
with ongoing
 
01:17:53.830 --> 01:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
reimbursements from commercial and
 
01:17:56.950 --> 01:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:58.950 --> 01:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh so you state that in the event the
 
01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
federal funds are no longer available
 
01:18:02.709 --> 01:18:02.719 align:start position:0%
that general funds will not be used but
 
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
i just heard you say that you'll be
 
01:18:06.709 --> 01:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
asking for more that basically would
 
01:18:09.189 --> 01:18:09.199 align:start position:0%
take the place of general of federal
 
01:18:09.199 --> 01:18:10.390 align:start position:0%
take the place of general of federal
funds

01:18:10.390 --> 01:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:18:12.630 --> 01:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
uh i i would not characterize that
 
01:18:15.110 --> 01:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
exactly as being so the general funds
 
01:18:17.430 --> 01:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
are going to take the place we are those
 
01:18:20.229 --> 01:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
rates were artificially low and so those
 
01:18:23.110 --> 01:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
rates are rising to regular um closer to
 
01:18:25.350 --> 01:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
what it actually costs to do business i
 
01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
don't know if you want to answer that um
 
01:18:30.630 --> 01:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
i i i i think the
 
01:18:32.630 --> 01:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
that statement is specific to this
 
01:18:34.470 --> 01:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
program here which is specific to
 
01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
targeting the malpractice insurance rate
 
01:18:39.750 --> 01:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
increases and not necessarily to the
 
01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
medicaid rate program we were thinking
 
01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
about those separately in that statement
 
01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
so are we actually playing a shell game
 
01:18:51.189 --> 01:18:51.199 align:start position:0%
so that when the federal funds stop the
 
01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
malpractice insurance is still high so
 
01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
you're just moving
 
01:18:55.199 --> 01:18:56.149 align:start position:0%
you're just moving
moving

01:18:56.149 --> 01:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
moving
 
01:18:56.159 --> 01:18:57.030 align:start position:0%
moving
money

01:18:57.030 --> 01:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:18:59.270 --> 01:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
from the general fund that you get now
 
01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
over to cover the malpractice insurance
 
01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
and asking for more through the general
 
01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:06.550 align:start position:0%
and asking for more through the general
fund

01:19:06.550 --> 01:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:07.990 --> 01:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
i don't necessarily think i would
 
01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
characterize it in in that manner i mean
 
01:19:12.149 --> 01:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
the way that the way that we were
 
01:19:13.430 --> 01:19:13.440 align:start position:0%
envisioning this
 
01:19:16.630 --> 01:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
um in conversations with with gopher and
 
01:19:19.350 --> 01:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
and others was that this would be as as
 
01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
director tilly pointed out this would be
 
01:19:24.550 --> 01:19:24.560 align:start position:0%
the one time stop gap measure um the the
 
01:19:27.189 --> 01:19:27.199 align:start position:0%
the rates have been uh increased that
 
01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
was approved by the legislature this
 
01:19:30.070 --> 01:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
past session
 
01:19:32.470 --> 01:19:32.480 align:start position:0%
um so we we we kind of see these things
 
01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
as two separate items i don't know if i
 
01:19:38.149 --> 01:19:38.159 align:start position:0%
would characterize it in the same way
 
01:19:39.990 --> 01:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
no i i mean i think what we would see
 
01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
with any rates it covers the broad
 
01:19:43.750 --> 01:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
spectrum of costs associated with doing
 
01:19:46.149 --> 01:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
business malpractice is one particular
 
01:19:47.910 --> 01:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
one part of that but it's across the
 
01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
board all of whether the professional
 
01:19:52.229 --> 01:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
service fees and the other fees that are
 
01:19:56.149 --> 01:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
required to to do business so as um as
 
01:19:59.430 --> 01:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
noted the fees are to support ongoing
 
01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
costs this is a one-time effort to
 
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
address this one big leap in malpractice
 
01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:14.470 --> 01:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:20:16.790 --> 01:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
yes said representative
 
01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you madam chair uh throughout
 
01:20:21.110 --> 01:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
the day i've pointed out four of these
 
01:20:23.669 --> 01:20:23.679 align:start position:0%
requests that i i thought needed
 
01:20:25.750 --> 01:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
stronger quantitative analysis and i
 
01:20:28.070 --> 01:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
just didn't want to leave it without
 
01:20:29.669 --> 01:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
giving you an example of what i'm
 
01:20:32.470 --> 01:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
talking about so if you look at 314 we
 
01:20:33.510 --> 01:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
did not
 
01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
you don't have to do it now but
 
01:20:36.550 --> 01:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
when you
 
01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
we're not pulling it off the calendar in
 
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
large part because whoever ghost wrote
 
01:20:42.870 --> 01:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
this for the commissioner's signature
 
01:20:44.950 --> 01:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
did a fairly nice job in that last
 
01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph given us some numbers that we
 
01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
can begin to wrap our head around so so
 
01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
i wanted to give you an example of of of
 
01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
the kind of thing that would be helpful
 
01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
in the future so
 
01:20:59.590 --> 01:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
i didn't want to just be negative this
 
01:21:01.350 --> 01:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
this is a positive thing this is what
 
01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
i'm looking for
 
01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
sure and maybe we can have a
 
01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
conversation offline about you know some
 
01:21:07.110 --> 01:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
some better details and you know
 
01:21:08.470 --> 01:21:08.480 align:start position:0%
outcomes and whatnot that you're looking
 
01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:11.830 align:start position:0%
outcomes and whatnot that you're looking
for

01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:15.590 --> 01:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
okay um are there any further questions
 
01:21:17.350 --> 01:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
01:21:19.590 --> 01:21:19.600 align:start position:0%

01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
are there questions from the committee
 
01:22:33.350 --> 01:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
senator bradley
 
01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:34.310 align:start position:0%
senator bradley
uh

01:22:34.310 --> 01:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:22:37.830 --> 01:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i just wanted to um
 
01:22:39.669 --> 01:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
get into the record the conversation
 
01:22:41.590 --> 01:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
that we had the other day
 
01:22:43.910 --> 01:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
which i believe addressed all of my
 
01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:45.430 align:start position:0%
which i believe addressed all of my
concerns

01:22:45.430 --> 01:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
01:22:49.270 --> 01:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
um when the senate looked at this idea
 
01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:50.790 align:start position:0%
um when the senate looked at this idea
of

01:22:50.790 --> 01:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:22:54.390 --> 01:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
providing funding for homeless services
 
01:22:57.270 --> 01:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
we did it in a different manner
 
01:22:59.590 --> 01:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
mainly because many of the small towns
 
01:23:02.229 --> 01:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire have limited options in
 
01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
terms of services especially in the
 
01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
northern part of the state so i wanted
 
01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
and the senate i think wanted to ensure
 
01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:10.310 align:start position:0%
and the senate i think wanted to ensure
that

01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
for those towns that
 
01:23:15.910 --> 01:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
the only real option for them is to
 
01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:16.950 align:start position:0%
the only real option for them is to
place

01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:23:20.070 --> 01:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
homeless individuals in motel or hotel
 
01:23:21.990 --> 01:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
rooms that
 
01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.189 align:start position:0%
rooms that
this

01:23:23.189 --> 01:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
would allow for that kind of service the
 
01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars to be utilized in that
 
01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:34.070 align:start position:0%
million dollars to be utilized in that
manner

01:23:34.070 --> 01:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:35.430 --> 01:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
i'm on okay
 
01:23:37.430 --> 01:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
i can't figure this out um thank you for
 
01:23:39.669 --> 01:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
that question um senator bradley chris
 
01:23:42.070 --> 01:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
santaniello associate commissioner and
 
01:23:44.229 --> 01:23:44.239 align:start position:0%
yes that would be allowed within the
 
01:23:46.229 --> 01:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
funds that we allocate
 
01:23:50.070 --> 01:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
further yes please go ahead and so a
 
01:23:55.669 --> 01:23:55.679 align:start position:0%

when the cold weather
 
01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
comes the town of conway for instance
 
01:24:12.149 --> 01:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
i'm just using it as a for instance
 
01:24:13.830 --> 01:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
would be able either through a
 
01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
not-for-profit agency or directly to
 
01:24:20.070 --> 01:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
come to the department and be able to
 
01:24:23.669 --> 01:24:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:25.270 --> 01:24:25.280 align:start position:0%

01:24:34.229 --> 01:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
way uh path
 
01:24:36.470 --> 01:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh organization up in conway that is
 
01:24:38.709 --> 01:24:38.719 align:start position:0%
trying to seek further funding for their
 
01:24:40.470 --> 01:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
program that would be
 
01:24:43.030 --> 01:24:43.040 align:start position:0%
very applicable to this
 
01:24:44.870 --> 01:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
for this funding that would they be able
 
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
to strengthen their program there so
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
looking at just those uh those
 
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
organizations throughout each county and
 
01:24:53.910 --> 01:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
their unique needs that would meet that
 
01:24:56.470 --> 01:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
so it if i might madam chair yes please
 
01:24:58.550 --> 01:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
the town of conway then could work with
 
01:25:01.750 --> 01:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
waypoint or the carroll county
 
01:25:04.870 --> 01:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
the county um to access these funds to
 
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
be able to utilize
 
01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
motel accommodations if that's what the
 
01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:10.229 align:start position:0%
motel accommodations if that's what the
best

01:25:10.229 --> 01:25:10.239 align:start position:0%
best
 
01:25:13.030 --> 01:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
option was yes absolutely
 
01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you
 
01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
are there further questions uh
 
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
representative leishman
 
01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
thanks madam chair thanks for your
 
01:25:23.350 --> 01:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
explanations but
 
01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
i'm reading through your
 
01:25:27.189 --> 01:25:27.199 align:start position:0%
letter that you have and you talk about
 
01:25:29.830 --> 01:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
the number of shelters available or beds
 
01:25:32.470 --> 01:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
in the state and it's far not sufficient
 
01:25:34.310 --> 01:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
for the ones we need but i also noted
 
01:25:36.950 --> 01:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
that you do not provide any funding for
 
01:25:39.590 --> 01:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
temporary cold weather
 
01:25:42.709 --> 01:25:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
sure um chris santaniello again um
 
01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
that's just not a program that the
 
01:25:49.350 --> 01:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
department has um
 
01:25:51.669 --> 01:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
had funding for typically
 
01:25:51.679 --> 01:25:52.470 align:start position:0%
had funding for typically
that

01:25:52.470 --> 01:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:56.229 --> 01:25:56.239 align:start position:0%
occurs through um you know municipal
 
01:25:58.229 --> 01:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
dollars community fundraisers but we
 
01:26:02.149 --> 01:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
have very limited dollars um in this
 
01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
program area and so we use it for
 
01:26:07.350 --> 01:26:07.360 align:start position:0%
year-round shelters
 
01:26:13.430 --> 01:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:15.430 --> 01:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
okay but i thought it said some of this
 
01:26:17.910 --> 01:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
money could be used for the cold weather
 
01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:19.189 align:start position:0%
money could be used for the cold weather
shelters

01:26:19.189 --> 01:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
shelters
 
01:26:22.070 --> 01:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
yes um we're gonna do it's divided up we
 
01:26:24.149 --> 01:26:24.159 align:start position:0%
have allocated a million dollars for
 
01:26:26.629 --> 01:26:26.639 align:start position:0%
that yes okay but typically we don't
 
01:26:28.870 --> 01:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
fund those okay and
 
01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
are there further questions uh
 
01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
representative edwards
 
01:26:35.189 --> 01:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair i
 
01:26:37.990 --> 01:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
i expect that 313 is going to pass in an
 
01:26:39.910 --> 01:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
overwhelming way and so i want to
 
01:26:42.070 --> 01:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
explain why i'm going to vote no it's
 
01:26:43.590 --> 01:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
got nothing to do with the department
 
01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
has done it's simply a process issue uh
 
01:26:49.750 --> 01:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
the the the basic outline of this
 
01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
proposal was with the other body in the
 
01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:54.629 align:start position:0%
proposal was with the other body in the
legislature

01:26:54.629 --> 01:26:54.639 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:26:56.390 --> 01:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the term
 
01:26:58.709 --> 01:26:58.719 align:start position:0%
it was held within that body
 
01:27:01.030 --> 01:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
and never sent over to the house so the
 
01:27:03.750 --> 01:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
house policy committee has been excluded
 
01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
from reviewing and approving of this
 
01:27:07.590 --> 01:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
policy i think they may have
 
01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:08.390 align:start position:0%
policy i think they may have
but

01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:27:09.669 --> 01:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
make the point
 
01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:11.910 align:start position:0%
make the point
that

01:27:11.910 --> 01:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
we have a bicameral system and this had
 
01:27:17.430 --> 01:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to go to the house for
 
01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
review and it wasn't uh i'll i'll be
 
01:27:21.590 --> 01:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
voting no
 
01:27:23.910 --> 01:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
because uh this is this is a process
 
01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
crime in my view not a crime but that's
 
01:27:27.669 --> 01:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
that's just a saying
 
01:27:30.390 --> 01:27:30.400 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a process foul how's that
 
01:27:31.750 --> 01:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
01:27:34.870 --> 01:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
thanks okay uh thank you
 
01:27:37.990 --> 01:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh further comments questions
 
01:27:42.470 --> 01:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
um i do know that uh folks are anxious
 
01:27:44.070 --> 01:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
to um
 
01:27:46.390 --> 01:27:46.400 align:start position:0%
know how to apply
 
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
for this money
 
01:27:50.790 --> 01:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea how long it will be
 
01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:52.149 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea how long it will be
until

until
 
01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
something can come out
 
01:27:56.470 --> 01:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
we are working on expediting that
 
01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
process right now so hopefully
 
01:28:01.910 --> 01:28:01.920 align:start position:0%
it would just be a matter of weeks
 
01:28:08.470 --> 01:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
and i assume the application would be on
 
01:28:13.110 --> 01:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
the website
 
01:28:14.310 --> 01:28:14.320 align:start position:0%

the business
 
01:31:34.229 --> 01:31:34.239 align:start position:0%
goes out of business is the state in any
 
01:31:35.830 --> 01:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
way on the hook
 
01:31:38.870 --> 01:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
to repay the federal government for
 
01:31:42.229 --> 01:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
those funds no ma'am so we have no risk
 
01:31:45.910 --> 01:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:48.709 --> 01:31:48.719 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:31:50.709 --> 01:31:50.719 align:start position:0%
uh representative erf
 
01:31:52.390 --> 01:31:52.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair
 
01:31:53.830 --> 01:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea why so many
 
01:31:56.830 --> 01:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
businesses fell into this
 
01:31:56.840 --> 01:31:58.470 align:start position:0%
businesses fell into this
recruitment

01:31:58.470 --> 01:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
recruitment
 
01:32:01.030 --> 01:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
yes well first of all i mean i should go
 
01:32:01.040 --> 01:32:02.310 align:start position:0%
yes well first of all i mean i should go
back

01:32:02.310 --> 01:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:32:05.510 --> 01:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
to the underlying programs uh that this
 
01:32:08.629 --> 01:32:08.639 align:start position:0%
is sort of helping us get to the end of
 
01:32:10.229 --> 01:32:10.239 align:start position:0%
back in cair's act under main street
 
01:32:11.830 --> 01:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
relief fund and the there was a
 
01:32:14.470 --> 01:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
self-employed program
 
01:32:16.870 --> 01:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
there was around 500 million dollars
 
01:32:19.830 --> 01:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
of aid that went under those programs uh
 
01:32:22.390 --> 01:32:22.400 align:start position:0%
to businesses across the state
 
01:32:24.629 --> 01:32:24.639 align:start position:0%
to roughly 12 000
 
01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
small businesses um
 
01:32:30.070 --> 01:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
over the course of uh time in in early
 
01:32:31.990 --> 01:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
april 2021
 
01:32:33.669 --> 01:32:33.679 align:start position:0%
uh we did see that there were going to
 
01:32:35.590 --> 01:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
be some businesses that were going to
 
01:32:38.310 --> 01:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
fall into the recoupment category under
 
01:32:39.590 --> 01:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
the federal rules
 
01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:41.110 align:start position:0%
the federal rules
um

01:32:41.110 --> 01:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:42.629 --> 01:32:42.639 align:start position:0%
through a series of programs we've now
 
01:32:45.350 --> 01:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
gotten that down to fi uh roughly about
 
01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:46.709 align:start position:0%
gotten that down to fi uh roughly about
300

01:32:46.709 --> 01:32:46.719 align:start position:0%
300
 
01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
um of uh small businesses left of those
 
01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:50.390 align:start position:0%
um of uh small businesses left of those
original

01:32:50.390 --> 01:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
original
 
01:32:52.830 --> 01:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
12 000 not all of them obviously face
 
01:32:54.870 --> 01:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
recruitment but you know we're down to
 
01:32:58.310 --> 01:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
basically 98 percent of the program is
 
01:32:59.590 --> 01:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
in a situation where there's no
 
01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:00.629 align:start position:0%
in a situation where there's no
recruitment

01:33:00.629 --> 01:33:00.639 align:start position:0%
recruitment
 
01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
necessary so it really is at the end
 
01:33:06.149 --> 01:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
we're giving a final option for
 
01:33:09.430 --> 01:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
businesses to take to choose if they so
 
01:33:12.950 --> 01:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
choose uh to extend the ability to repay
 
01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
whatever they uh might owe
 
01:33:17.830 --> 01:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
uh under the recoupment requirements for
 
01:33:19.990 --> 01:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
a period of two years at zero percent
 
01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
interest so this is like the the very
 
01:33:27.030 --> 01:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:27.040 --> 01:33:28.310 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:33:29.590 --> 01:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
but you didn't quite answer my question
 
01:33:30.870 --> 01:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
and maybe you can't which if you can't
 
01:33:33.030 --> 01:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
that's fine but i'm just curious as to
 
01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
why did so many businesses maybe i
 
01:33:37.030 --> 01:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
shouldn't say so many why did businesses
 
01:33:38.550 --> 01:33:38.560 align:start position:0%
why did they fall into this recruitment
 
01:33:40.149 --> 01:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
well i mean the simple answer is that a
 
01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
lot of businesses did better than they
 
01:33:43.990 --> 01:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
had anticipated they would do when they
 
01:33:45.430 --> 01:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
when they applied for the initial
 
01:33:47.430 --> 01:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
program so if you call the way the
 
01:33:49.669 --> 01:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
program worked was that we asked
 
01:33:51.350 --> 01:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
businesses to project what they
 
01:33:53.430 --> 01:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
anticipated losses were going to be over
 
01:33:55.990 --> 01:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
the course of the next couple of months
 
01:33:58.629 --> 01:33:58.639 align:start position:0%
and we paid a percentage of that which i
 
01:34:01.270 --> 01:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
believe under most programs around 17 of
 
01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
their projected losses we gave them a
 
01:34:05.350 --> 01:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
grant in that amount
 
01:34:08.070 --> 01:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
there were businesses however that ended
 
01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:08.790 align:start position:0%
there were businesses however that ended
up

01:34:08.790 --> 01:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:09.590 align:start position:0%
up
not

01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:34:11.430 --> 01:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
losing the amount of money that they
 
01:34:13.110 --> 01:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
anticipated they would have that they
 
01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
would have lost
 
01:34:16.470 --> 01:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
and so that put them in a situation
 
01:34:18.310 --> 01:34:18.320 align:start position:0%
where we had to offer them options to
 
01:34:20.070 --> 01:34:20.080 align:start position:0%
offset that and we did that through
 
01:34:22.149 --> 01:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
programs like offsetting with covet
 
01:34:24.470 --> 01:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
expenditures we did that with a
 
01:34:25.750 --> 01:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
recruitment program where there was
 
01:34:27.830 --> 01:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
another brand they could credit against
 
01:34:29.510 --> 01:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
what those uh what the potential
 
01:34:31.590 --> 01:34:31.600 align:start position:0%
recruitment was and that's how we got it
 
01:34:33.350 --> 01:34:33.360 align:start position:0%
down to the 300 number that we're at
 
01:34:34.550 --> 01:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah
 
01:34:40.870 --> 01:34:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:43.030 --> 01:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
yes uh represent representative lynn

thank you can i ask you do
 
01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
we is there has there been some effort

made to ensure will there be some effort
 
01:34:52.550 --> 01:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
made to ensure that
 
01:34:54.790 --> 01:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
before we're you know giving sort of
 
01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:55.830 align:start position:0%
before we're you know giving sort of
loan

01:34:55.830 --> 01:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
loan
 
01:34:57.510 --> 01:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
loans to some of these companies that
 
01:34:58.870 --> 01:34:58.880 align:start position:0%
there's not
 
01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
that they're not sort of under
 
01:35:02.629 --> 01:35:02.639 align:start position:0%
investigation by
 
01:35:03.990 --> 01:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
by the either the attorney general's
 
01:35:06.310 --> 01:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
office or the feds to be for some kind
 
01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:07.110 align:start position:0%

01:35:09.110 --> 01:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
fraudulent activity and in connection
 
01:35:11.270 --> 01:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
with the original loans yes sir
 
01:35:12.709 --> 01:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
absolutely and that's something we
 
01:35:14.470 --> 01:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
monitor very very closely
 
01:35:16.470 --> 01:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
um thankfully we've not had many cases
 
01:35:18.310 --> 01:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
in those categories but that would
 
01:35:21.030 --> 01:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely be part of uh any review
 
01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
that we would be doing
 
01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:23.270 align:start position:0%
that we would be doing
to

01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:35:27.110 --> 01:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:29.910 --> 01:35:29.920 align:start position:0%

so this is the request that we bring
 
01:37:43.910 --> 01:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
before the fiscal committee one

sometimes more times per year for funds
 
01:37:48.550 --> 01:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
in our litigation fund
 
01:37:51.109 --> 01:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
the litigation fund is used to to
 
01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
support the department's efforts to both
 
01:37:55.270 --> 01:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
defend the state and civil litigation
 
01:37:57.109 --> 01:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:37:57.119 --> 01:37:58.550 align:start position:0%
and um
prosecute

01:37:58.550 --> 01:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
prosecute
 
01:37:58.560 --> 01:37:59.430 align:start position:0%
prosecute
so

01:37:59.430 --> 01:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:00.790 align:start position:0%
so
uh

01:38:00.790 --> 01:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:38:02.870 --> 01:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
for our criminal bureau um enforce the
 
01:38:04.950 --> 01:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
state's criminal laws it's used to
 
01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
support the environmental protection
 
01:38:08.070 --> 01:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
bureau which enforces the state's
 
01:38:10.149 --> 01:38:10.159 align:start position:0%
environmental laws it's used to support
 
01:38:12.310 --> 01:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
our criminal uh our consumer protection
 
01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:13.270 align:start position:0%
our criminal uh our consumer protection
bureau

01:38:13.270 --> 01:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
bureau
 
01:38:14.870 --> 01:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
which enforces our consumer protection
 
01:38:16.950 --> 01:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
laws we do both civil and criminal work
 
01:38:19.270 --> 01:38:19.280 align:start position:0%
in the consumer protection bureau
 
01:38:20.950 --> 01:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:22.470 align:start position:0%
and um
it

01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:38:24.390 --> 01:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
it is meant
 
01:38:26.470 --> 01:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
meant to be used sort of as a supplement
 
01:38:28.229 --> 01:38:28.239 align:start position:0%
when we have needs at the department
 
01:38:29.669 --> 01:38:29.679 align:start position:0%
that go beyond
 
01:38:32.070 --> 01:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
what our internal resources can can
 
01:38:32.080 --> 01:38:35.590 align:start position:0%
what our internal resources can can
support

01:38:35.590 --> 01:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:38.149 --> 01:38:38.159 align:start position:0%
this is a larger request
 
01:38:39.910 --> 01:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
than normal
 
01:38:41.430 --> 01:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
so that goes without saying this is a
 
01:38:43.430 --> 01:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
particularly large request
 
01:38:45.109 --> 01:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
and i think that stems from a couple of
 
01:38:47.430 --> 01:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
things and it's multiple factors but but
 
01:38:49.590 --> 01:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
two primary factors
 
01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
one is that i think the state is dealing
 
01:38:54.070 --> 01:38:54.080 align:start position:0%
with more complex civil litigation at
 
01:38:57.430 --> 01:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
the moment than it typically deals with
 
01:38:59.830 --> 01:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
i'll go through it but that that
 
01:39:02.709 --> 01:39:02.719 align:start position:0%
consists of of ydc
 
01:39:05.109 --> 01:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
and the litigation associated with that
 
01:39:06.950 --> 01:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
it consists of
 
01:39:09.590 --> 01:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
a major school funding case
 
01:39:12.310 --> 01:39:12.320 align:start position:0%
one that is much closer to trial and
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
that's now been paired with the second
 
01:39:15.669 --> 01:39:15.679 align:start position:0%
school funding school funding lawsuit
 
01:39:17.669 --> 01:39:17.679 align:start position:0%
that was filed earlier this year
 
01:39:19.990 --> 01:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
consists of two major major federal
 
01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
court cases in which we're defending the
 
01:39:23.830 --> 01:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
01:39:26.070 --> 01:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
multiple cases regarding redistricting
 
01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:28.639 align:start position:0%
and election law and and the list goes
 
01:39:29.990 --> 01:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
on but the department is dealing with
 
01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
more complex civil litigation right now
 
01:39:34.229 --> 01:39:34.239 align:start position:0%
than it typically deals with
 
01:39:36.629 --> 01:39:36.639 align:start position:0%
it's also not just about the number
 
01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
of cases that the department's dealing
 
01:39:41.910 --> 01:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
with it's about where those cases are
 
01:39:44.629 --> 01:39:44.639 align:start position:0%
in the process so the further you move
 
01:39:46.470 --> 01:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
along in a case the further you move
 
01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
through discovery the closer you get to
 
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
trial if they're complex cases the costs
 
01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
the the funding needs at any time um get
 
01:39:56.000 --> 01:39:57.030 align:start position:0%
the the funding needs at any time um get
higher

01:39:57.030 --> 01:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
higher
 
01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
depending on where you are in the case
 
01:40:00.550 --> 01:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
and so it's not just that we have more
 
01:40:02.470 --> 01:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
complex civil litigation but we have a
 
01:40:05.030 --> 01:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
few cases that are that have come to a
 
01:40:07.030 --> 01:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
point where they require some some
 
01:40:09.669 --> 01:40:09.679 align:start position:0%
significant funding so that that's one
 
01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
general reason i think why this is a
 
01:40:14.790 --> 01:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
larger request than normal and the
 
01:40:17.430 --> 01:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
second is that
 
01:40:19.510 --> 01:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
the department has and i won't go
 
01:40:21.510 --> 01:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
through the entire organizational chart
 
01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
but we have a lot of internal resources
 
01:40:25.350 --> 01:40:25.360 align:start position:0%
we do a lot of different
 
01:40:26.790 --> 01:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
things but
 
01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:28.550 align:start position:0%
things but
one

01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:40:28.560 --> 01:40:29.990 align:start position:0%
one
one

01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:40:31.270 --> 01:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
kind of general function of the
 
01:40:33.669 --> 01:40:33.679 align:start position:0%
department of justice is to assist every
 
01:40:36.390 --> 01:40:36.400 align:start position:0%
state agency in state government we
 
01:40:38.709 --> 01:40:38.719 align:start position:0%
represent every state agency we give
 
01:40:41.510 --> 01:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
legal advice we lend support
 
01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:42.390 align:start position:0%
legal advice we lend support
and

01:40:42.390 --> 01:40:42.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:40:44.950 --> 01:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
i think across state government
 
01:40:46.390 --> 01:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
as we all know
 
01:40:48.070 --> 01:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
we've seen challenges with recruitment
 
01:40:49.990 --> 01:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
and retention and that puts a lot of
 
01:40:53.189 --> 01:40:53.199 align:start position:0%
burden on state agencies and because we
 
01:40:55.350 --> 01:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
serve every state agency
 
01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:56.390 align:start position:0%
serve every state agency
we

01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:40:59.189 --> 01:40:59.199 align:start position:0%
uh i think agencies require more support
 
01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
from us than normal and so we're using
 
01:41:03.669 --> 01:41:03.679 align:start position:0%
our internal resources for that and
 
01:41:05.430 --> 01:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
internal resources that we use for that
 
01:41:07.910 --> 01:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
client counseling function cannot be
 
01:41:11.750 --> 01:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
used for litigation so those are two
 
01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
i wanted to just give that overview to
 
01:41:15.430 --> 01:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
sort of explain why this is a larger
 
01:41:17.350 --> 01:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
request than normal i think those are
 
01:41:19.510 --> 01:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
those are two factors that contribute
 
01:41:21.270 --> 01:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
contribute to that so with that i'll
 
01:41:23.109 --> 01:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
just walk through the major cases that
 
01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
01:41:27.669 --> 01:41:27.679 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not sure that's necessary okay uh
 
01:41:29.990 --> 01:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
you you pretty much
 
01:41:33.270 --> 01:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
put that in the thing so uh other
 
01:41:35.990 --> 01:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
senator roosevelt
 
01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just a question on
 
01:41:40.629 --> 01:41:40.639 align:start position:0%
the smallest thing in here
 
01:41:44.149 --> 01:41:44.159 align:start position:0%
the uh election law do you expect or
 
01:41:47.669 --> 01:41:47.679 align:start position:0%
have you already hired any outside
 
01:41:47.679 --> 01:41:49.669 align:start position:0%
have you already hired any outside
counsel

01:41:49.669 --> 01:41:49.679 align:start position:0%
counsel
 
01:41:52.629 --> 01:41:52.639 align:start position:0%
on either of these two redistricting
 
01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:54.719 align:start position:0%
cases or is this
 
01:41:57.510 --> 01:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
incurred in-house
 
01:41:59.510 --> 01:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
we have not and i
 
01:42:02.310 --> 01:42:02.320 align:start position:0%
i think the expenses we're expecting
 
01:42:04.709 --> 01:42:04.719 align:start position:0%
there are for for experts and potential
 
01:42:07.189 --> 01:42:07.199 align:start position:0%
expert testimony we have not retained
 
01:42:09.109 --> 01:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
outside counsel for those redistricting
 
01:42:10.790 --> 01:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
cases i
 
01:42:13.430 --> 01:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
it's possible we may but at this point
 
01:42:15.990 --> 01:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
my goal and my intent is to use in-house
 
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
resources for those cases
 
01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
are there any further uh representative
 
01:42:23.510 --> 01:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
leishman thanks man of chair uh thank
 
01:42:25.189 --> 01:42:25.199 align:start position:0%
you attorney general is it fair to say
 
01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
that some of the recoveries or
 
01:42:28.870 --> 01:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
settlements that you've received lately
 
01:42:30.470 --> 01:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
would more than cover
 
01:42:32.229 --> 01:42:32.239 align:start position:0%
this request the funds that you've
 
01:42:32.239 --> 01:42:33.990 align:start position:0%
this request the funds that you've
received

01:42:33.990 --> 01:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
received
 
01:42:35.750 --> 01:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
yes i mean those recoveries don't go
 
01:42:38.550 --> 01:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
into the litigation fund but i i think
 
01:42:40.229 --> 01:42:40.239 align:start position:0%
it is fair to say that the department
 
01:42:42.629 --> 01:42:42.639 align:start position:0%
has brought in far more money in this
 
01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
calendar year through settlements and
 
01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
recoveries than this litigation fund
 
01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:48.149 align:start position:0%
recoveries than this litigation fund
request

01:42:48.149 --> 01:42:48.159 align:start position:0%
request
 
01:42:51.189 --> 01:42:51.199 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:53.520 align:start position:0%

319 and 320
 
01:44:10.159 --> 01:44:11.750 align:start position:0%
319 and 320
together

01:44:11.750 --> 01:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:44:13.990 --> 01:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
since one is the program and the others
 
01:44:15.350 --> 01:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
the money
 
01:44:21.030 --> 01:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:22.870 align:start position:0%

okay
so

01:44:26.310 --> 01:44:26.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:28.229 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:44:28.229 --> 01:44:28.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:29.910 --> 01:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
i want to emphasize uh i'm charlie
 
01:44:31.189 --> 01:44:31.199 align:start position:0%
erlinghouse i'm the commissioner of
 
01:44:33.030 --> 01:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
administrative services
 
01:44:34.229 --> 01:44:34.239 align:start position:0%
and i'm sherry rockburn i'm the
 
01:44:35.910 --> 01:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner
 
01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:37.510 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner
um

01:44:37.510 --> 01:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:39.590 --> 01:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
i've got so i i want to emphasize a
 
01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
couple things there are a bunch of
 
01:44:42.950 --> 01:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
different things in this package
 
01:44:44.870 --> 01:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
so we're here performing more of a
 
01:44:46.790 --> 01:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
ministerial function so i can talk about
 
01:44:49.910 --> 01:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
the what and the why there's a whole
 
01:44:53.189 --> 01:44:53.199 align:start position:0%
host of commissioners and commandants
 
01:44:55.030 --> 01:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
behind me who will
 
01:44:58.550 --> 01:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
no doubt explain all of that to you why
 
01:45:00.709 --> 01:45:00.719 align:start position:0%
it's essentially a group of recruitment
 
01:45:03.990 --> 01:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
and retention packages for um
 
01:45:07.189 --> 01:45:07.199 align:start position:0%
for a variety of officials
 
01:45:09.510 --> 01:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
um state police
 
01:45:11.990 --> 01:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
um there's a few um
 
01:45:13.750 --> 01:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh people at the fire academy i'm gonna
 
01:45:15.030 --> 01:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
get that wrong
 
01:45:16.629 --> 01:45:16.639 align:start position:0%
fire safety
 
01:45:16.639 --> 01:45:17.830 align:start position:0%
fire safety
personnel

01:45:17.830 --> 01:45:17.840 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
01:45:19.830 --> 01:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
correctional personnel
 
01:45:22.790 --> 01:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
veterans home personnel
 
01:45:24.790 --> 01:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
and there's also a i left somebody out
 
01:45:27.510 --> 01:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
nurses generally across state government
 
01:45:30.709 --> 01:45:30.719 align:start position:0%
and then in addition to that
 
01:45:32.310 --> 01:45:32.320 align:start position:0%
there's a winner maintenance retention
 
01:45:34.470 --> 01:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
program so think of highway maintainers
 
01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
but that program will be extended to
 
01:45:37.910 --> 01:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
other people in state government who
 
01:45:39.270 --> 01:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
have a cdl
 
01:45:41.030 --> 01:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
so people who don't normally participate
 
01:45:42.790 --> 01:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
in winter maintenance could
 
01:45:44.870 --> 01:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
if they chose and they have a cdl a
 
01:45:47.189 --> 01:45:47.199 align:start position:0%
commercial driver's license participate
 
01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:53.430 --> 01:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
it's a sum of recruitment
 
01:45:55.990 --> 01:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
packages which was i think discussed
 
01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
sort of a
 
01:45:59.910 --> 01:45:59.920 align:start position:0%
significant conversation between various
 
01:46:01.270 --> 01:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
people in the governor's office and
 
01:46:02.790 --> 01:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
various people in
 
01:46:05.910 --> 01:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
in these agencies um
 
01:46:08.310 --> 01:46:08.320 align:start position:0%
who will uh who'll be affected by this
 
01:46:10.790 --> 01:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
in ways to both retain personnel and in
 
01:46:12.790 --> 01:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
the case of
 
01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:13.910 align:start position:0%
the case of
retention

01:46:13.910 --> 01:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
retention
 
01:46:16.470 --> 01:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
retention payments and in the case of
 
01:46:18.629 --> 01:46:18.639 align:start position:0%
recruitment payments a lot of
 
01:46:20.310 --> 01:46:20.320 align:start position:0%
people like correction officers for
 
01:46:20.320 --> 01:46:21.270 align:start position:0%
people like correction officers for
example

01:46:21.270 --> 01:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:46:23.109 --> 01:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to get a bonus if
 
01:46:24.790 --> 01:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
they go somewhere else
 
01:46:26.950 --> 01:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
and this will allow us to keep them
 
01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
the commonality i believe between all of
 
01:46:31.590 --> 01:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
these items is that they are
 
01:46:34.550 --> 01:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
functioning 24 7 facilities
 
01:46:36.629 --> 01:46:36.639 align:start position:0%
as opposed to anything else
 
01:46:39.189 --> 01:46:39.199 align:start position:0%
and i'll just note that there's nobody
 
01:46:40.790 --> 01:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
in my department
 
01:46:44.550 --> 01:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:48.550 --> 01:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:52.070 --> 01:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
okay uh yes uh senator roosevelt thank
 
01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:53.350 align:start position:0%
okay uh yes uh senator roosevelt thank
you

01:46:53.350 --> 01:46:53.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:46:56.070 --> 01:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
my question is really specifically about
 
01:46:57.590 --> 01:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
the retention
 
01:46:57.600 --> 01:46:58.629 align:start position:0%
the retention
piece

01:46:58.629 --> 01:46:58.639 align:start position:0%
piece
 
01:47:02.310 --> 01:47:02.320 align:start position:0%
my understanding this is one time money
 
01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:03.109 align:start position:0%
my understanding this is one time money
that

01:47:03.109 --> 01:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:47:05.270 --> 01:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
is pretty significant it looked to me
 
01:47:08.470 --> 01:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
like ten thousand dollars per person it
 
01:47:12.550 --> 01:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:14.310 --> 01:47:14.320 align:start position:0%
think what happens
 
01:47:16.390 --> 01:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
at the end of that
 
01:47:19.510 --> 01:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
when the individual's compensation
 
01:47:22.390 --> 01:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
goes back down by ten thousand dollars
 
01:47:25.109 --> 01:47:25.119 align:start position:0%
are we going to see
 
01:47:25.119 --> 01:47:26.229 align:start position:0%
are we going to see
people

01:47:26.229 --> 01:47:26.239 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:47:28.790 --> 01:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
leaving state government
 
01:47:31.109 --> 01:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
um and what do you think we're going to
 
01:47:32.149 --> 01:47:32.159 align:start position:0%
end up
 
01:47:33.910 --> 01:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
needing to do
 
01:47:34.950 --> 01:47:34.960 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:47:37.510 --> 01:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
ongoing compensation
 
01:47:39.430 --> 01:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
and i realized that you don't get to
 
01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:41.189 align:start position:0%
and i realized that you don't get to
negotiate

01:47:41.189 --> 01:47:41.199 align:start position:0%
negotiate
 
01:47:42.950 --> 01:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
the contracts but
 
01:47:44.550 --> 01:47:44.560 align:start position:0%
what do you think is going to happen to
 
01:47:46.870 --> 01:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
the vacancy rate
 
01:47:49.830 --> 01:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
when people see their compensation fall
 
01:47:49.840 --> 01:47:50.790 align:start position:0%
when people see their compensation fall
off

01:47:50.790 --> 01:47:50.800 align:start position:0%
off
 
01:47:52.310 --> 01:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
i think um
 
01:47:54.149 --> 01:47:54.159 align:start position:0%
i want to emphasize that it's not it's
 
01:47:56.950 --> 01:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
not pay uh i mean it is pay but it's not
 
01:47:59.590 --> 01:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
uh ongoing in your paycheck it's a it's
 
01:48:01.350 --> 01:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
a payment in some case a one-time
 
01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
payment or in some cases a two payment
 
01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:05.030 align:start position:0%
payment or in some cases a two payment
tranches

01:48:05.030 --> 01:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
tranches
 
01:48:07.990 --> 01:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
um and um so it really is in the effect
 
01:48:08.950 --> 01:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
of a
 
01:48:10.950 --> 01:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
it'll feel like a bonus as opposed to a
 
01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:12.470 align:start position:0%
it'll feel like a bonus as opposed to a
um

01:48:12.470 --> 01:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:14.709 --> 01:48:14.719 align:start position:0%
ongoing compensation increase
 
01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
i think it's um for any employer the the
 
01:48:20.390 --> 01:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
challenge with um paying things like
 
01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:21.669 align:start position:0%
challenge with um paying things like
bonuses

01:48:21.669 --> 01:48:21.679 align:start position:0%
bonuses
 
01:48:23.750 --> 01:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
um to sign on you know five thousand
 
01:48:25.350 --> 01:48:25.360 align:start position:0%
dollars to work at dunkin donuts it's
 
01:48:26.709 --> 01:48:26.719 align:start position:0%
probably not five thousand at dunkin
 
01:48:27.910 --> 01:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
donuts but
 
01:48:30.629 --> 01:48:30.639 align:start position:0%
uh but significant um is yeah what
 
01:48:32.629 --> 01:48:32.639 align:start position:0%
happens then do people do people shop
 
01:48:34.629 --> 01:48:34.639 align:start position:0%
around a year later and and i think
 
01:48:36.550 --> 01:48:36.560 align:start position:0%
that's going to be a question i think
 
01:48:38.629 --> 01:48:38.639 align:start position:0%
historically if you look at you know and
 
01:48:39.750 --> 01:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
i don't have data on this but
 
01:48:42.149 --> 01:48:42.159 align:start position:0%
historically if you look at things like
 
01:48:44.709 --> 01:48:44.719 align:start position:0%
um like signing on bonuses
 
01:48:46.709 --> 01:48:46.719 align:start position:0%
um they tend to occur in times where
 
01:48:48.310 --> 01:48:48.320 align:start position:0%
there's a particularly tight labor
 
01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:49.189 align:start position:0%
there's a particularly tight labor
market

01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
market
 
01:48:51.350 --> 01:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
and not be an ongoing basis there's not
 
01:48:53.430 --> 01:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
a reset they they
 
01:48:55.510 --> 01:48:55.520 align:start position:0%
they go in waves and they tend to go in
 
01:48:58.149 --> 01:48:58.159 align:start position:0%
waves everywhere that is to say
 
01:48:59.830 --> 01:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
tons and tons of employers are offering
 
01:49:01.990 --> 01:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
them and then tons and tons of employers
 
01:49:04.950 --> 01:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
are not because the labor market loosens
 
01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:06.070 align:start position:0%
are not because the labor market loosens
and

01:49:06.070 --> 01:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:49:08.070 --> 01:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
and i think that's where we would be
 
01:49:09.669 --> 01:49:09.679 align:start position:0%
i don't honestly think the state
 
01:49:12.470 --> 01:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
government can this is extraordinary
 
01:49:15.109 --> 01:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
quite possibly unprecedented in our in
 
01:49:16.390 --> 01:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
our history
 
01:49:17.990 --> 01:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:49:20.629 --> 01:49:20.639 align:start position:0%
it's sort of a you know a storm of a
 
01:49:22.550 --> 01:49:22.560 align:start position:0%
of a particularly tight labor market
 
01:49:23.669 --> 01:49:23.679 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:49:26.629 --> 01:49:26.639 align:start position:0%
and the availability of arpa funding
 
01:49:28.470 --> 01:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
and though both of those two things are
 
01:49:29.830 --> 01:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
quite unusual
 
01:49:31.830 --> 01:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
and the likelihood of them appearing at
 
01:49:34.790 --> 01:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
the same time again you know are before
 
01:49:36.790 --> 01:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
and and another tight labor market is
 
01:49:39.350 --> 01:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
slim so i don't think it'll happen again
 
01:49:40.950 --> 01:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
and i think it's probably incumbent upon
 
01:49:42.709 --> 01:49:42.719 align:start position:0%
most managers to explain to employees
 
01:49:42.719 --> 01:49:43.590 align:start position:0%
most managers to explain to employees
that

01:49:43.590 --> 01:49:43.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:49:46.149 --> 01:49:46.159 align:start position:0%
that this is unusual and this probably
 
01:49:50.629 --> 01:49:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:52.950 --> 01:49:52.960 align:start position:0%
representative perkins quoca
 
01:49:55.270 --> 01:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
thank you chairwoman you got it exactly
 
01:49:56.550 --> 01:49:56.560 align:start position:0%
right um
 
01:49:58.149 --> 01:49:58.159 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner and i guess just
 
01:49:59.510 --> 01:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
as a quick follow-up to senator
 
01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
roosevelt's question i mean
 
01:50:04.149 --> 01:50:04.159 align:start position:0%
yes this is absolutely an extraordinary
 
01:50:07.350 --> 01:50:07.360 align:start position:0%
um labor market that said as a housing
 
01:50:09.510 --> 01:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
advocate um you know i've been listening
 
01:50:12.229 --> 01:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
to our businesses talk about a shortage
 
01:50:15.189 --> 01:50:15.199 align:start position:0%
of workers for years now so
 
01:50:16.790 --> 01:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
you know i think the question goes more
 
01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:17.669 align:start position:0%
you know i think the question goes more
to

01:50:17.669 --> 01:50:17.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:50:19.430 --> 01:50:19.440 align:start position:0%
this may be a one-time program but in
 
01:50:21.430 --> 01:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
the long term i mean the state
 
01:50:23.910 --> 01:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
government may benefit and i i guess i'm
 
01:50:25.830 --> 01:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
asking for your opinion here in in
 
01:50:27.910 --> 01:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
seeing higher wages just to ensure that
 
01:50:29.830 --> 01:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
we are um
 
01:50:31.430 --> 01:50:31.440 align:start position:0%
you know retaining
 
01:50:33.189 --> 01:50:33.199 align:start position:0%
retaining talent at the state level and
 
01:50:35.350 --> 01:50:35.360 align:start position:0%
not seeing turnover at a place where
 
01:50:37.910 --> 01:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
institutional knowledge is really valued
 
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
i i think it's probably very important
 
01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know my understanding and you
 
01:50:43.510 --> 01:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
know i can't speak for the governor or
 
01:50:45.990 --> 01:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
the bargaining team or any of that
 
01:50:48.629 --> 01:50:48.639 align:start position:0%
but my understanding is that um
 
01:50:50.229 --> 01:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
you know this is a program to deal with
 
01:50:52.709 --> 01:50:52.719 align:start position:0%
one subset of state workers but there's
 
01:50:55.270 --> 01:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
a general recognition that state workers
 
01:50:57.350 --> 01:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
broadly speaking
 
01:50:58.709 --> 01:50:58.719 align:start position:0%
have greater issues and some of that's
 
01:51:00.709 --> 01:51:00.719 align:start position:0%
related to things like inflation you
 
01:51:02.629 --> 01:51:02.639 align:start position:0%
know when when inflation is one one and
 
01:51:04.149 --> 01:51:04.159 align:start position:0%
a half two percent people don't pay a
 
01:51:05.669 --> 01:51:05.679 align:start position:0%
lot of attention to it
 
01:51:07.270 --> 01:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
when it's nine
 
01:51:09.350 --> 01:51:09.360 align:start position:0%
and you kind of do i'm thinking a lot
 
01:51:11.189 --> 01:51:11.199 align:start position:0%
more about my oil payments than i did
 
01:51:12.709 --> 01:51:12.719 align:start position:0%
the last couple years
 
01:51:12.719 --> 01:51:13.990 align:start position:0%
the last couple years
um

01:51:13.990 --> 01:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:15.590 --> 01:51:15.600 align:start position:0%
and so i think that's a thing and i
 
01:51:17.830 --> 01:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
think without question we need to figure
 
01:51:19.669 --> 01:51:19.679 align:start position:0%
out ways to better ways to attract
 
01:51:20.709 --> 01:51:20.719 align:start position:0%
talent and there's no question that
 
01:51:23.669 --> 01:51:23.679 align:start position:0%
wages are part of that
 
01:51:26.229 --> 01:51:26.239 align:start position:0%
housing is also part of that i mean it
 
01:51:28.470 --> 01:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
i'd i'll note that on the
 
01:51:30.629 --> 01:51:30.639 align:start position:0%
governing council agenda
 
01:51:32.229 --> 01:51:32.239 align:start position:0%
yesterday or
 
01:51:33.430 --> 01:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
whenever we were on top of mount
 
01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:34.470 align:start position:0%
whenever we were on top of mount
washington

01:51:34.470 --> 01:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
washington
 
01:51:36.149 --> 01:51:36.159 align:start position:0%
um the air was thin i don't remember
 
01:51:37.830 --> 01:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
well um
 
01:51:39.510 --> 01:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
somebody resigned from a position and
 
01:51:41.669 --> 01:51:41.679 align:start position:0%
one of the things they said was that you
 
01:51:43.669 --> 01:51:43.679 align:start position:0%
know it's really hard to buy a house and
 
01:51:45.669 --> 01:51:45.679 align:start position:0%
so they're going to move to wyoming
 
01:51:47.350 --> 01:51:47.360 align:start position:0%
and we probably need a little bit less
 
01:51:52.470 --> 01:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:52.480 --> 01:51:53.270 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:51:53.270 --> 01:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:51:55.990 --> 01:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
would you like to discuss the
 
01:51:59.109 --> 01:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
total money part
 
01:52:01.030 --> 01:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
which is in 320
 
01:52:02.629 --> 01:52:02.639 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry can you say that again yeah
 
01:52:05.830 --> 01:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
hearing's bad 320
 
01:52:07.830 --> 01:52:07.840 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
is dealing with the money yes
 
01:52:13.270 --> 01:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
sherry can you walk through the money
 
01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:15.750 align:start position:0%
sherry can you walk through the money
quickly

01:52:15.750 --> 01:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
01:52:18.229 --> 01:52:18.239 align:start position:0%
i think the most helpful
 
01:52:20.149 --> 01:52:20.159 align:start position:0%
chart or table to look at
 
01:52:20.159 --> 01:52:21.990 align:start position:0%
chart or table to look at
is

01:52:21.990 --> 01:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:52:24.229 --> 01:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
the money on page or the table on page
 
01:52:26.310 --> 01:52:26.320 align:start position:0%
12 of 13.
 
01:52:28.229 --> 01:52:28.239 align:start position:0%
it takes up almost the whole page in the
 
01:52:28.239 --> 01:52:29.350 align:start position:0%
it takes up almost the whole page in the
packet

01:52:29.350 --> 01:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
packet
 
01:52:30.870 --> 01:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
i think that's a really good summary
 
01:52:32.870 --> 01:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
though of the programs
 
01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:33.750 align:start position:0%
though of the programs
and

01:52:33.750 --> 01:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:52:35.430 --> 01:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
and the funding so i'll give you a
 
01:52:37.830 --> 01:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
minute if you have that page open
 
01:52:40.229 --> 01:52:40.239 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that the first
 
01:52:42.070 --> 01:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
you know six or seven items are all
 
01:52:45.270 --> 01:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
funded with arpa funding
 
01:52:49.990 --> 01:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
and that is 13 just under 13.5 million
 
01:52:52.709 --> 01:52:52.719 align:start position:0%
and you'll see two numbers on the bottom
 
01:52:54.310 --> 01:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
the winner maintenance programs through
 
01:52:56.550 --> 01:52:56.560 align:start position:0%
the department of transportation and
 
01:52:59.430 --> 01:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
those funding is coming 4.3 million is a
 
01:53:01.589 --> 01:53:01.599 align:start position:0%
transfer from highway surplus
 
01:53:03.669 --> 01:53:03.679 align:start position:0%
and around 400 000
 
01:53:05.109 --> 01:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
from the turnpike general reserve
 
01:53:05.119 --> 01:53:05.990 align:start position:0%
from the turnpike general reserve
account

01:53:05.990 --> 01:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
account
 
01:53:08.070 --> 01:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
so that's the the breakdown
 
01:53:11.350 --> 01:53:11.360 align:start position:0%
13-5 coming from arpa and
 
01:53:13.189 --> 01:53:13.199 align:start position:0%
just under five million
 
01:53:14.790 --> 01:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
is from uh transportation highway and
 
01:53:16.470 --> 01:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
turnpike funding and that's strictly on
 
01:53:18.149 --> 01:53:18.159 align:start position:0%
the winner maintenance is where turnpike
 
01:53:21.830 --> 01:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
funding is coming into play and highway
 
01:53:23.910 --> 01:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
i i would just note that this this
 
01:53:25.589 --> 01:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
particular chart
 
01:53:27.910 --> 01:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
sherry did obviously not me
 
01:53:30.470 --> 01:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
in response to my
 
01:53:32.390 --> 01:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
18 different questions which used a
 
01:53:34.629 --> 01:53:34.639 align:start position:0%
different number for the total each time
 
01:53:37.189 --> 01:53:37.199 align:start position:0%
and i think she realized that
 
01:53:39.189 --> 01:53:39.199 align:start position:0%
if my little p brain could get confused
 
01:53:40.709 --> 01:53:40.719 align:start position:0%
look at other people's
 
01:53:43.189 --> 01:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
and uh and when when she was up until
 
01:53:45.270 --> 01:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
midnight at the office doing this
 
01:53:47.270 --> 01:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
at some one of those late hours she came
 
01:53:49.109 --> 01:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
up with this chart and i think it's
 
01:53:52.550 --> 01:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
remarkably helpful at least to me
 
01:53:53.990 --> 01:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
um the only other thing i would add to
 
01:53:56.550 --> 01:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
that is under the initiative i can just
 
01:53:59.270 --> 01:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
talk real high level about the incentive
 
01:54:00.790 --> 01:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
programs that fall under that it doesn't
 
01:54:02.310 --> 01:54:02.320 align:start position:0%
have the dollars with it but i can just
 
01:54:04.470 --> 01:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
very quickly kind of go through that so
 
01:54:07.189 --> 01:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
the first item um the safety
 
01:54:09.990 --> 01:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
for the new full-time state police sworn
 
01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:11.030 align:start position:0%
for the new full-time state police sworn
personnel

01:54:11.030 --> 01:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
01:54:12.470 --> 01:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
that is a
 
01:54:15.109 --> 01:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollar bonus
 
01:54:17.910 --> 01:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
paid as soon as practical upon higher so
 
01:54:19.350 --> 01:54:19.360 align:start position:0%
that's a lump sum that happens at the
 
01:54:21.669 --> 01:54:21.679 align:start position:0%
front end of that hiring they do have to
 
01:54:23.830 --> 01:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
sign an agreement that says they will
 
01:54:25.350 --> 01:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
stay in that position or similar
 
01:54:27.430 --> 01:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
position for up to one year
 
01:54:29.270 --> 01:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
um subject to payback at the end of that
 
01:54:31.589 --> 01:54:31.599 align:start position:0%
year if they choose to to leave
 
01:54:33.030 --> 01:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
state service or take a position that's
 
01:54:34.310 --> 01:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
not related to the one that they were
 
01:54:36.070 --> 01:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
hired into
 
01:54:36.080 --> 01:54:37.109 align:start position:0%
hired into
the

01:54:37.109 --> 01:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:54:39.910 --> 01:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
next one down is for the existing sworn
 
01:54:42.229 --> 01:54:42.239 align:start position:0%
personnel at state police
 
01:54:44.709 --> 01:54:44.719 align:start position:0%
and existing is also 10 000 but that is
 
01:54:49.109 --> 01:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
paid in two lump sum payments a 5 000 um
 
01:54:51.270 --> 01:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
within a as soon as practical upon this
 
01:54:54.470 --> 01:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh passage and then a second payment um
 
01:54:54.480 --> 01:54:55.270 align:start position:0%
uh passage and then a second payment um
in

01:54:55.270 --> 01:54:55.280 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:54:57.430 --> 01:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
march april springtime period i don't
 
01:54:59.030 --> 01:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
have the exact date on that but that's
 
01:55:02.629 --> 01:55:02.639 align:start position:0%
two lump sum payments um 5 000 each
 
01:55:02.639 --> 01:55:04.149 align:start position:0%
two lump sum payments um 5 000 each
um

01:55:04.149 --> 01:55:04.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:04.159 --> 01:55:05.189 align:start position:0%
um
the

01:55:05.189 --> 01:55:05.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:55:07.910 --> 01:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh third one down for safety is the fire
 
01:55:09.669 --> 01:55:09.679 align:start position:0%
safety area there's about nine positions
 
01:55:11.669 --> 01:55:11.679 align:start position:0%
that are in that that follows the same
 
01:55:14.229 --> 01:55:14.239 align:start position:0%
new any new hire would be the 10 000 up
 
01:55:16.470 --> 01:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
front the one underneath it is for
 
01:55:19.830 --> 01:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
existing and that is 5000 split um
 
01:55:21.510 --> 01:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
sort of fall spring
 
01:55:23.669 --> 01:55:23.679 align:start position:0%
then you'll see that corrections has
 
01:55:25.830 --> 01:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
both a new and existing they follow that
 
01:55:28.149 --> 01:55:28.159 align:start position:0%
same logic a new correctional sworn
 
01:55:32.149 --> 01:55:32.159 align:start position:0%
personnel 10 000 and then a 5 000 split
 
01:55:34.950 --> 01:55:34.960 align:start position:0%
um correctional also has a little bit
 
01:55:37.990 --> 01:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
different item here this is a retention
 
01:55:41.270 --> 01:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
incentive it's a 15 enhancement
 
01:55:43.350 --> 01:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
for their nurses their direct care
 
01:55:45.350 --> 01:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
nurses at the institution at their
 
01:55:47.270 --> 01:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
correctional facilities
 
01:55:50.229 --> 01:55:50.239 align:start position:0%
nurses currently have a 15 this is an
 
01:55:52.470 --> 01:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
additional 15 percent that they'll get
 
01:55:54.390 --> 01:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
for a one year period
 
01:55:57.430 --> 01:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
normally enhancements
 
01:55:58.950 --> 01:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
only go through the governor and council
 
01:56:01.430 --> 01:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
process so new hampshire hospital has an
 
01:56:03.990 --> 01:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
enhancement uh glencliff home sununu
 
01:56:05.430 --> 01:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
youth center
 
01:56:07.109 --> 01:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
so that normally
 
01:56:08.790 --> 01:56:08.800 align:start position:0%
agencies fund within their existing
 
01:56:10.310 --> 01:56:10.320 align:start position:0%
budget so it's not something that
 
01:56:12.470 --> 01:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
normally fiscal would see it usually is
 
01:56:14.149 --> 01:56:14.159 align:start position:0%
just a government council item
 
01:56:15.830 --> 01:56:15.840 align:start position:0%
corrections can't absorb this increase
 
01:56:17.430 --> 01:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
within their existing budget so they've
 
01:56:20.229 --> 01:56:20.239 align:start position:0%
asked for arpa funding to approve that
 
01:56:22.070 --> 01:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
additional 15 but all the other
 
01:56:24.149 --> 01:56:24.159 align:start position:0%
institutions that have the nurses at the
 
01:56:25.830 --> 01:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
governor council meeting on wednesday
 
01:56:27.270 --> 01:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
received approval to have that
 
01:56:29.990 --> 01:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
additional 15 percent so they they look
 
01:56:31.350 --> 01:56:31.360 align:start position:0%
a little different but it's just because
 
01:56:33.430 --> 01:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
of their funding stream
 
01:56:36.390 --> 01:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh the veterans home um this is a two
 
01:56:37.669 --> 01:56:37.679 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar
 
01:56:39.589 --> 01:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
payment to all of the staff at the
 
01:56:41.510 --> 01:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
veterans home for full-time there's a
 
01:56:44.310 --> 01:56:44.320 align:start position:0%
500 payment for part-time
 
01:56:46.550 --> 01:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
back in june the veterans home received
 
01:56:48.470 --> 01:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
approval through fiscal of a retention
 
01:56:50.629 --> 01:56:50.639 align:start position:0%
program through frisco and gnc
 
01:56:53.270 --> 01:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
for direct care to receive this
 
01:56:54.950 --> 01:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
incentive payment
 
01:56:57.109 --> 01:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
this is for the non-direct care staffing
 
01:56:59.109 --> 01:56:59.119 align:start position:0%
at the veterans home
 
01:57:01.189 --> 01:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
and this would be payable in november
 
01:57:04.950 --> 01:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
time period as a lump sum payment
 
01:57:07.109 --> 01:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
that's the sum of all the arpa funding
 
01:57:09.750 --> 01:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
and then the last two on transportation
 
01:57:12.709 --> 01:57:12.719 align:start position:0%
that is a five thousand dollar in total
 
01:57:15.510 --> 01:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
payment and that is split 2500 at the
 
01:57:16.790 --> 01:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
beginning of the winter maintenance
 
01:57:19.750 --> 01:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
period and then uh 2500 at the end of
 
01:57:21.589 --> 01:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
the winter maintenance period it would
 
01:57:23.430 --> 01:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
get pro-rated for anyone that gets hired
 
01:57:25.589 --> 01:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
in between and doesn't either uh isn't
 
01:57:27.030 --> 01:57:27.040 align:start position:0%
there for the entire winter maintenance
 
01:57:29.430 --> 01:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
period which is runs about november 1st
 
01:57:32.550 --> 01:57:32.560 align:start position:0%
through um early april
 
01:57:34.629 --> 01:57:34.639 align:start position:0%
so that's sort of a
 
01:57:36.870 --> 01:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
high level summary of the individual
 
01:57:37.990 --> 01:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
items and then the funding that goes
 
01:57:40.229 --> 01:57:40.239 align:start position:0%
with it thank you are there any
 
01:57:40.239 --> 01:57:43.910 align:start position:0%
with it thank you are there any
questions

01:57:43.910 --> 01:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:46.629 --> 01:57:46.639 align:start position:0%
seeing none could i have a motion to
 
01:57:46.639 --> 01:57:50.709 align:start position:0%
seeing none could i have a motion to
accept

01:57:50.709 --> 01:57:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:54.310 --> 01:57:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:54.320 --> 01:57:55.430 align:start position:0%
 
and

possibly just the stamp yeah okay
 
01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:19.270 align:start position:0%
possibly just the stamp yeah okay
sorry

commissioner of education
 
01:59:38.550 --> 01:59:38.560 align:start position:0%
a felon read department of safety
 
01:59:42.470 --> 01:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:44.709 --> 01:59:44.719 align:start position:0%
uh would you just give us
 
01:59:47.669 --> 01:59:47.679 align:start position:0%
three sentences on the program
 
01:59:50.870 --> 01:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:51.990 --> 01:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
then we'll
 
01:59:54.390 --> 01:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
sure so this is a program to
 
01:59:57.109 --> 01:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
improve the security in our school
 
01:59:57.119 --> 01:59:58.709 align:start position:0%
improve the security in our school
buildings

01:59:58.709 --> 01:59:58.719 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
02:00:03.109 --> 02:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
the programs are primarily focused on
 
02:00:05.109 --> 02:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
act go ahead access
 
02:00:06.709 --> 02:00:06.719 align:start position:0%
three categories access control
 
02:00:09.189 --> 02:00:09.199 align:start position:0%
emergency alerting and surveillance
 
02:00:11.510 --> 02:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
and the first round of funding all
 
02:00:14.390 --> 02:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
public schools were eligible to apply
 
02:00:15.750 --> 02:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
and we had
 
02:00:18.229 --> 02:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
about 3.8 million dollars left over from
 
02:00:19.750 --> 02:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
the original public school
 
02:00:21.910 --> 02:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund
 
02:00:23.270 --> 02:00:23.280 align:start position:0%
the account earned a little bit of
 
02:00:24.790 --> 02:00:24.800 align:start position:0%
interest because there was 3.3 but now
 
02:00:27.189 --> 02:00:27.199 align:start position:0%
we're up to 3.8 and some change
 
02:00:31.510 --> 02:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
so this is to award 177
 
02:00:33.830 --> 02:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
applications to 92 different schools
 
02:00:36.790 --> 02:00:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:37.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:00:37.990 --> 02:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:00:40.550 --> 02:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
thank you sure there is um if i made the
 
02:00:43.109 --> 02:00:43.119 align:start position:0%
second round of funding that's um 10
 
02:00:44.550 --> 02:00:44.560 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
02:00:46.709 --> 02:00:46.719 align:start position:0%
that uh we're working through those
 
02:00:48.709 --> 02:00:48.719 align:start position:0%
applications but what's before you is
 
02:00:51.430 --> 02:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
for the first round of applications
 
02:00:51.440 --> 02:00:52.629 align:start position:0%
for the first round of applications
okay

02:00:52.629 --> 02:00:52.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:00:54.629 --> 02:00:54.639 align:start position:0%
the object was to get it out the door as
 
02:00:57.350 --> 02:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible yes ma'am right
 
02:01:02.870 --> 02:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:04.550 --> 02:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
the public school infrastructure
 
02:01:06.709 --> 02:01:06.719 align:start position:0%
representative leishman thank you madam
 
02:01:06.719 --> 02:01:07.510 align:start position:0%
representative leishman thank you madam
chair

02:01:07.510 --> 02:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:01:09.189 --> 02:01:09.199 align:start position:0%
and thanks for your
 
02:01:10.629 --> 02:01:10.639 align:start position:0%
good brief just
 
02:01:12.629 --> 02:01:12.639 align:start position:0%
brief discussion
 
02:01:13.830 --> 02:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
so i
 
02:01:17.109 --> 02:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
looked back the department presented at
 
02:01:17.119 --> 02:01:18.229 align:start position:0%
looked back the department presented at
some

02:01:18.229 --> 02:01:18.239 align:start position:0%
some
 
02:01:21.350 --> 02:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
length a 42-page document showing other
 
02:01:23.990 --> 02:01:24.000 align:start position:0%
grants for security enhancements and i
 
02:01:26.070 --> 02:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
noticed in that particular
 
02:01:28.149 --> 02:01:28.159 align:start position:0%
document there were some issues like
 
02:01:31.510 --> 02:01:31.520 align:start position:0%
hudson got 300 000 for a sprinkler
 
02:01:34.310 --> 02:01:34.320 align:start position:0%
system under the same program now most
 
02:01:36.790 --> 02:01:36.800 align:start position:0%
of the items were for security cameras
 
02:01:38.550 --> 02:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
doors locks
 
02:01:41.189 --> 02:01:41.199 align:start position:0%
now in your request are there any
 
02:01:44.310 --> 02:01:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh outside of security
 
02:01:47.030 --> 02:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
issues or are they all for security
 
02:01:48.470 --> 02:01:48.480 align:start position:0%
right so that first tranche of funding
 
02:01:51.030 --> 02:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
was used for safety which included some
 
02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
safety measures security measures as
 
02:01:53.910 --> 02:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
well as some
 
02:01:53.920 --> 02:01:55.350 align:start position:0%
well as some
truthfully

02:01:55.350 --> 02:01:55.360 align:start position:0%
truthfully
 
02:01:56.790 --> 02:01:56.800 align:start position:0%
broadband measures as well there were
 
02:01:58.870 --> 02:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
some awards for that in there as well
 
02:02:01.189 --> 02:02:01.199 align:start position:0%
this is specifically for security only
 
02:02:02.390 --> 02:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
so these projects are going to be
 
02:02:04.470 --> 02:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
limited to those three categories that
 
02:02:06.070 --> 02:02:06.080 align:start position:0%
fallon had mentioned
 
02:02:07.910 --> 02:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
and just one follow-up madam chair
 
02:02:10.149 --> 02:02:10.159 align:start position:0%
please go ahead thanks
 
02:02:11.990 --> 02:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
i noticed in your request this time for
 
02:02:14.310 --> 02:02:14.320 align:start position:0%
instance salem was looking for maybe a
 
02:02:16.950 --> 02:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
208 thousand dollars and they got a
 
02:02:18.550 --> 02:02:18.560 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars because you set
 
02:02:20.310 --> 02:02:20.320 align:start position:0%
a cap of a hundred thousand dollars and
 
02:02:22.070 --> 02:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
yet there were a number of other
 
02:02:24.149 --> 02:02:24.159 align:start position:0%
smaller schools i'll take my community
 
02:02:25.589 --> 02:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
there's a charter school and they were
 
02:02:29.350 --> 02:02:29.360 align:start position:0%
looking for like 96 or 98 000
 
02:02:31.750 --> 02:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
how did you determine
 
02:02:34.470 --> 02:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
who gets what where the cap came from
 
02:02:36.790 --> 02:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
because for a small school to get safe
 
02:02:40.229 --> 02:02:40.239 align:start position:0%
the 90s somewhat thousand dollars
 
02:02:42.550 --> 02:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
but salem with a much greater school
 
02:02:44.070 --> 02:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
population they only got a hundred
 
02:02:47.910 --> 02:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
thousand on their request
 
02:02:49.510 --> 02:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
sure so i can speak to how we did the
 
02:02:51.910 --> 02:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
risk ranking um but the commission
 
02:02:53.669 --> 02:02:53.679 align:start position:0%
decided to do the hundred thousand
 
02:02:56.470 --> 02:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
dollar cap so once we received all the
 
02:02:58.550 --> 02:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
applications my office at emergency
 
02:03:00.310 --> 02:03:00.320 align:start position:0%
management reviewed each of the
 
02:03:03.270 --> 02:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
applications and we had five questions
 
02:03:05.109 --> 02:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
that were part of the application that
 
02:03:06.629 --> 02:03:06.639 align:start position:0%
helped us do the risk ranking and
 
02:03:08.709 --> 02:03:08.719 align:start position:0%
depending on the answer they either got
 
02:03:12.390 --> 02:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
one point or no points and
 
02:03:15.510 --> 02:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
so the highest potential score was a 7.0
 
02:03:17.669 --> 02:03:17.679 align:start position:0%
and the lowest that was uh given was a
 
02:03:21.270 --> 02:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
2.0 and then we had an average of 5.9 so
 
02:03:23.510 --> 02:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
we had based
 
02:03:23.520 --> 02:03:25.030 align:start position:0%
we had based
the

02:03:25.030 --> 02:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:03:27.430 --> 02:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
questions were pretty standard have you
 
02:03:29.270 --> 02:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
submitted an emergency operations plan
 
02:03:31.189 --> 02:03:31.199 align:start position:0%
within the last 12 months has your
 
02:03:33.030 --> 02:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
school had an assessment completed by
 
02:03:34.790 --> 02:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
emergency management
 
02:03:36.709 --> 02:03:36.719 align:start position:0%
how many security assessments have your
 
02:03:37.990 --> 02:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
school had
 
02:03:41.270 --> 02:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
since we started the program in 2014
 
02:03:42.870 --> 02:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
a reference to
 
02:03:45.589 --> 02:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
emergency drills how many of them have
 
02:03:45.599 --> 02:03:46.870 align:start position:0%
emergency drills how many of them have
been

02:03:46.870 --> 02:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:03:48.950 --> 02:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
emergency all hazards
 
02:03:51.270 --> 02:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
and then have you submitted your current
 
02:03:53.189 --> 02:03:53.199 align:start position:0%
floor plans to first responders so that
 
02:03:54.470 --> 02:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
allowed us to
 
02:03:56.629 --> 02:03:56.639 align:start position:0%
do the scoring have a risk ranking and
 
02:04:00.390 --> 02:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
then we had categories or tiers that we
 
02:04:02.709 --> 02:04:02.719 align:start position:0%
looked at for the score so
 
02:04:04.950 --> 02:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
there were five different tiers
 
02:04:07.589 --> 02:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
the application scoring below average
 
02:04:09.189 --> 02:04:09.199 align:start position:0%
in the categories of access control and
 
02:04:12.149 --> 02:04:12.159 align:start position:0%
emergency alerting were put first so we
 
02:04:14.629 --> 02:04:14.639 align:start position:0%
did as many applications as we could at
 
02:04:16.229 --> 02:04:16.239 align:start position:0%
that point with the cap of a hundred
 
02:04:16.239 --> 02:04:17.189 align:start position:0%
that point with the cap of a hundred
thousand

02:04:17.189 --> 02:04:17.199 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
02:04:19.350 --> 02:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
and then we looked at tier two which was
 
02:04:22.070 --> 02:04:22.080 align:start position:0%
application scoring below 5.0
 
02:04:23.589 --> 02:04:23.599 align:start position:0%
in surveillance and then we went there
 
02:04:25.430 --> 02:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
so we kept going down to the different

02:06:24.790 --> 02:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
anyone has represent earth
 
02:06:27.350 --> 02:06:27.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:06:29.109 --> 02:06:29.119 align:start position:0%
so other than
 
02:06:30.709 --> 02:06:30.719 align:start position:0%
moving the cliff
 
02:06:32.470 --> 02:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
to a higher income threshold bringing
 
02:06:34.390 --> 02:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
more people onto food stamps how does
 
02:06:38.229 --> 02:06:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:41.589 --> 02:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
the intent is that so individuals could
 
02:06:44.709 --> 02:06:44.719 align:start position:0%
continue to pursue employment or pursue
 
02:06:46.390 --> 02:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
a promotion in employment where they
 
02:06:48.550 --> 02:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
would increase their income but
 
02:06:51.189 --> 02:06:51.199 align:start position:0%
oftentimes that isn't quite enough
 
02:06:51.199 --> 02:06:52.629 align:start position:0%
oftentimes that isn't quite enough
to

02:06:52.629 --> 02:06:52.639 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:06:54.709 --> 02:06:54.719 align:start position:0%
be able to continue strengthening their
 
02:06:57.270 --> 02:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
own economic condition so what this does
 
02:06:59.510 --> 02:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
is still enable them to be eligible for
 
02:07:01.830 --> 02:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
snap benefits
 
02:07:03.910 --> 02:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
that way they can continue to strengthen
 
02:07:05.750 --> 02:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
their own position with that added
 
02:07:05.760 --> 02:07:07.589 align:start position:0%
their own position with that added
income

02:07:07.589 --> 02:07:07.599 align:start position:0%
income
 
02:07:09.669 --> 02:07:09.679 align:start position:0%
then slowly be able to
 
02:07:11.910 --> 02:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
instead of suddenly not being eligible
 
02:07:14.390 --> 02:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
any longer for those benefits
 
02:07:17.030 --> 02:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
and experiencing that loss they'd be
 
02:07:19.750 --> 02:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
able to just use that extra income
 
02:07:22.870 --> 02:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
over time to be able to just strengthen
 
02:07:28.790 --> 02:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:30.229 --> 02:07:30.239 align:start position:0%
so i think that and i understand that
 
02:07:32.069 --> 02:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
that's moving the cliff
 
02:07:33.669 --> 02:07:33.679 align:start position:0%
but that doesn't take away the cliff
 
02:07:35.350 --> 02:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
effect correct they're just going to run
 
02:07:36.950 --> 02:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
into the cliff a little bit higher up in
 
02:07:39.270 --> 02:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
their income
 
02:07:41.990 --> 02:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
i would characterize it more as
 
02:07:44.470 --> 02:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
reducing or mitigating the cliff
 
02:07:47.350 --> 02:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
not necessarily eliminating the cliff
 
02:07:49.669 --> 02:07:49.679 align:start position:0%
this is an attempt to try to
 
02:07:51.990 --> 02:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
reduce that sudden loss of those
 
02:07:52.000 --> 02:07:53.109 align:start position:0%
reduce that sudden loss of those
benefits

02:07:53.109 --> 02:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
02:07:54.870 --> 02:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure that
 
02:07:57.030 --> 02:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
there are particular actions that can
 
02:07:59.669 --> 02:07:59.679 align:start position:0%
completely eliminate the cliff but this
 
02:08:05.589 --> 02:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:10.069 --> 02:08:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:11.830 --> 02:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
represent lynn yes can i ask you just
 
02:08:13.910 --> 02:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
ask a question the the the the limit
 
02:08:18.390 --> 02:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
right now is uh is am i correct is 180
 
02:08:21.510 --> 02:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
of the poverty level is that 185 185 i'm
 
02:08:26.709 --> 02:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
sorry and and that 185 was established
 
02:08:29.350 --> 02:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
how does how did that get established
 
02:08:31.430 --> 02:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh that's a good question i believe it
 
02:08:33.270 --> 02:08:33.280 align:start position:0%
was set into law and i don't know the
 
02:08:35.589 --> 02:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
history of that but i could certainly
 
02:08:37.270 --> 02:08:37.280 align:start position:0%
find that out and get that for you so
 
02:08:39.350 --> 02:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
when you i guess do you know maybe did
 
02:08:40.870 --> 02:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
you know this at
 
02:08:42.069 --> 02:08:42.079 align:start position:0%
this point was it when you say it was
 
02:08:43.990 --> 02:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
set into law was that by the state
 
02:08:46.310 --> 02:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
legislature or the feds i believe the
 
02:08:48.149 --> 02:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
state has the discretion of determining
 
02:08:49.990 --> 02:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
the eligibility which is why we're able
 
02:08:53.189 --> 02:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
to change the percentage now through
 
02:08:55.990 --> 02:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
this process okay so i i guess the only
 
02:08:57.430 --> 02:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
question i have and it's really sort of
 
02:08:58.629 --> 02:08:58.639 align:start position:0%
a process
 
02:09:00.470 --> 02:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
question maybe
 
02:09:02.550 --> 02:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
addressed to everyone really is if the
 
02:09:04.629 --> 02:09:04.639 align:start position:0%
legislature set the
 
02:09:07.510 --> 02:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
set the current limit at 185
 
02:09:09.910 --> 02:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
i guess i raised the question of
 
02:09:13.350 --> 02:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
is it appropriate for this body
 
02:09:15.270 --> 02:09:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh which represents only a very small
 
02:09:17.109 --> 02:09:17.119 align:start position:0%
percentage of the whole legislature to
 
02:09:18.390 --> 02:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
change the
 
02:09:21.270 --> 02:09:21.280 align:start position:0%
the number from 185 to 200.
 
02:09:25.189 --> 02:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
sure so um i i guess to start um i'd
 
02:09:27.430 --> 02:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
like just to go back to hb2 from this
 
02:09:28.709 --> 02:09:28.719 align:start position:0%
past session
 
02:09:30.709 --> 02:09:30.719 align:start position:0%
um there was a provision in there
 
02:09:34.470 --> 02:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
chapter 91 section 34 that specified
 
02:09:34.480 --> 02:09:35.270 align:start position:0%
chapter 91 section 34 that specified
that

02:09:35.270 --> 02:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:09:38.310 --> 02:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
any any modifications to that threshold
 
02:09:41.030 --> 02:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
um would need to be both approved uh by
 
02:09:42.629 --> 02:09:42.639 align:start position:0%
the house and human services and elderly
 
02:09:44.870 --> 02:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
affairs committee as well as the fiscal
 
02:09:46.069 --> 02:09:46.079 align:start position:0%
committee and that's that's why we're
 
02:09:48.069 --> 02:09:48.079 align:start position:0%
here before you today um chris
 
02:09:49.910 --> 02:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
centenello just reminded me that the
 
02:09:51.910 --> 02:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
that it was originally set up in
 
02:09:54.790 --> 02:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
administrative rules um which goes which
 
02:09:57.589 --> 02:09:57.599 align:start position:0%
goes through the jail car public process
 
02:09:59.669 --> 02:09:59.679 align:start position:0%
which is directed by statute okay so
 
02:10:01.910 --> 02:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
you're saying that that that the stat
 
02:10:03.030 --> 02:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
that that
 
02:10:05.189 --> 02:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
statutes contemplate that there will be
 
02:10:07.589 --> 02:10:07.599 align:start position:0%
some change made by other than a full
 
02:10:09.510 --> 02:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
vote of the legislature
 
02:10:11.830 --> 02:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
precisely and i believe i i can't speak
 
02:10:13.189 --> 02:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
to the rationale but i believe that's
 
02:10:15.589 --> 02:10:15.599 align:start position:0%
why an hb2 provision was put in this
 
02:10:17.430 --> 02:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
past session so that there was greater
 
02:10:19.270 --> 02:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
oversight and transparency to that
 
02:10:22.709 --> 02:10:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:25.589 --> 02:10:25.599 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
02:10:28.870 --> 02:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
i do have a couple i guess
 
02:10:31.030 --> 02:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
i know that
 
02:10:33.830 --> 02:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
snap benefits
 
02:10:36.550 --> 02:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
affect other areas
 
02:10:40.950 --> 02:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
so by increasing the percentage
 
02:10:43.669 --> 02:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
what other programs
 
02:10:46.390 --> 02:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
are going to be affected
 
02:10:49.189 --> 02:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
by this change in the snap
 
02:10:49.199 --> 02:10:50.709 align:start position:0%
by this change in the snap
criteria

02:10:50.709 --> 02:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
02:10:52.629 --> 02:10:52.639 align:start position:0%
there are no other eligibility programs
 
02:10:54.470 --> 02:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
that are really certainly not adversely
 
02:10:57.510 --> 02:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
impacted by this particular change
 
02:11:00.709 --> 02:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:03.830 --> 02:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
information that i had provided
 
02:11:06.149 --> 02:11:06.159 align:start position:0%
in an answer to that it certainly does
 
02:11:06.159 --> 02:11:07.030 align:start position:0%
in an answer to that it certainly does
make

02:11:07.030 --> 02:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
make
 
02:11:09.669 --> 02:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
more individuals eligible automatically
 
02:11:12.390 --> 02:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
for head start who have children of that
 
02:11:14.550 --> 02:11:14.560 align:start position:0%
age qualifying
 
02:11:16.229 --> 02:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
there are also education and training
 
02:11:20.069 --> 02:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
benefits that people will qualify for
 
02:11:22.069 --> 02:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
because of receiving snap benefits
 
02:11:24.790 --> 02:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
including job search and the ability to
 
02:11:27.669 --> 02:11:27.679 align:start position:0%
pursue credentials that would result in
 
02:11:32.470 --> 02:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
a higher paying job or a high demand job
 
02:11:34.629 --> 02:11:34.639 align:start position:0%
they would also qualify for the free and
 
02:11:38.550 --> 02:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
reduced meals through the school
 
02:11:38.560 --> 02:11:39.750 align:start position:0%
reduced meals through the school
and

02:11:39.750 --> 02:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:11:42.390 --> 02:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
with an agreement that we are putting
 
02:11:45.030 --> 02:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
together with the cap agencies
 
02:11:46.550 --> 02:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
these are individuals with their
 
02:11:49.510 --> 02:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
permission would be contacted by those
 
02:11:52.950 --> 02:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
cap agencies regarding lie he benefits
 
02:11:56.229 --> 02:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
that they would qualify for
 
02:11:58.470 --> 02:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
they also qualify for the what's known
 
02:12:01.589 --> 02:12:01.599 align:start position:0%
as the double up food bucks program
 
02:12:04.550 --> 02:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
which is a an incentive for purchasing
 
02:12:16.950 --> 02:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:19.750 --> 02:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
you probably don't know
 
02:12:23.109 --> 02:12:23.119 align:start position:0%
whether or not these children
 
02:12:24.950 --> 02:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
are currently eligible for free and
 
02:12:27.270 --> 02:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch
 
02:12:31.109 --> 02:12:31.119 align:start position:0%
or is the answer to that i don't
 
02:12:34.950 --> 02:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:37.910 --> 02:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
i i'm talking about you know the the
 
02:12:37.920 --> 02:12:38.950 align:start position:0%
i i'm talking about you know the the
difference

02:12:38.950 --> 02:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
difference
 
02:12:42.709 --> 02:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:45.030 --> 02:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
um so they would they would so if you're
 
02:12:47.350 --> 02:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
185 of federal poverty level below you'd
 
02:12:50.390 --> 02:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
qualify for free if you're 250 percent
 
02:12:52.870 --> 02:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
or below you would qualify for reduced
 
02:12:55.430 --> 02:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
price lunch so between 200 and 185 is
 
02:12:56.550 --> 02:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
that the question
 
02:12:56.560 --> 02:12:57.589 align:start position:0%
that the question
yeah

02:12:57.589 --> 02:12:57.599 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:12:59.510 --> 02:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
it may be difficult for us so right now
 
02:13:02.950 --> 02:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
we direct cert snap students so given
 
02:13:05.189 --> 02:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
this change in eligibility criteria we
 
02:13:07.270 --> 02:13:07.280 align:start position:0%
may have to do some additional work to
 
02:13:09.350 --> 02:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
be able to parse the students between
 
02:13:12.950 --> 02:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
free and reduced but we can work on that
 
02:13:14.790 --> 02:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
02:13:19.669 --> 02:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:22.229 --> 02:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
because it's yet another tier yeah
 
02:13:24.310 --> 02:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
yeah i got it
 
02:13:25.910 --> 02:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
i got it
 
02:13:27.910 --> 02:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
we'll know that before the budget cycle
 
02:13:27.920 --> 02:13:34.709 align:start position:0%
we'll know that before the budget cycle
right

02:13:34.709 --> 02:13:34.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:37.189 --> 02:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
so that
 
02:13:39.589 --> 02:13:39.599 align:start position:0%
the only thing that would truly affect
 
02:13:40.950 --> 02:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
the um
 
02:13:42.470 --> 02:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
the state budget
 
02:13:44.709 --> 02:13:44.719 align:start position:0%
is the free and reduced lunch
 
02:13:44.719 --> 02:13:48.470 align:start position:0%
is the free and reduced lunch
eligibility

02:13:48.470 --> 02:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:48.480 --> 02:13:49.350 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:13:49.350 --> 02:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:13:49.360 --> 02:13:54.069 align:start position:0%
yes
potentially

02:13:54.069 --> 02:13:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:54.079 --> 02:13:59.109 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:13:59.109 --> 02:13:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:02.149 --> 02:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
and and then lie he
 
02:14:02.159 --> 02:14:02.950 align:start position:0%
and and then lie he
sure

02:14:02.950 --> 02:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
sure
 
02:14:02.960 --> 02:14:04.470 align:start position:0%
sure
certainly

02:14:04.470 --> 02:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
02:14:06.069 --> 02:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
i mean we would probably need to look
 
02:14:09.030 --> 02:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
further at it but depending upon
 
02:14:11.990 --> 02:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
how this change in classification is
 
02:14:14.390 --> 02:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
recognized like human health and human
 
02:14:15.830 --> 02:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
services at the federal level may
 
02:14:18.069 --> 02:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
recognize it for one thing some of that
 
02:14:20.149 --> 02:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
same information is used by the u.s
 
02:14:22.069 --> 02:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
02:14:23.990 --> 02:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
to determine specific funding levels
 
02:14:25.350 --> 02:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
relative to
 
02:14:27.910 --> 02:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
some of our title programs so i'm not
 
02:14:30.790 --> 02:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
sure how u.s department of education
 
02:14:33.430 --> 02:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
would recognize these shifts these
 
02:14:35.589 --> 02:14:35.599 align:start position:0%
changes in terms of their funding
 
02:14:38.069 --> 02:14:38.079 align:start position:0%
allocation formulas on the education
 
02:14:38.079 --> 02:14:38.870 align:start position:0%
allocation formulas on the education
side

02:14:38.870 --> 02:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
side
 
02:14:52.629 --> 02:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:52.639 --> 02:14:53.510 align:start position:0%
 
well

02:14:53.510 --> 02:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:14:53.520 --> 02:14:54.390 align:start position:0%
well
yeah

02:14:54.390 --> 02:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:14:56.229 --> 02:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
i think we better have somebody come
 
02:14:58.229 --> 02:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
back and
 
02:15:00.069 --> 02:15:00.079 align:start position:0%
talk to us in
 
02:15:03.510 --> 02:15:03.520 align:start position:0%
november about that i think
 
02:15:03.520 --> 02:15:05.510 align:start position:0%
november about that i think
because

02:15:05.510 --> 02:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:15:07.589 --> 02:15:07.599 align:start position:0%
we just we just need to know
 
02:15:10.390 --> 02:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
you know what what's happening
 
02:15:12.390 --> 02:15:12.400 align:start position:0%
just if it's helpful i can tell you that
 
02:15:14.310 --> 02:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
there are a number of other states maybe
 
02:15:16.390 --> 02:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
20 is my guess
 
02:15:18.629 --> 02:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
including massachusetts that have moved
 
02:15:21.430 --> 02:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
from the 185 percent federal property
 
02:15:24.550 --> 02:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
level to 200 already so the the on the
 
02:15:26.149 --> 02:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
federal level that may have been
 
02:15:26.159 --> 02:15:28.310 align:start position:0%
federal level that may have been
resolved

02:15:28.310 --> 02:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
resolved
 
02:15:30.069 --> 02:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
well we'll see
 
02:15:30.079 --> 02:15:31.830 align:start position:0%
well we'll see
anyhow

02:15:31.830 --> 02:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
anyhow
 
02:15:33.589 --> 02:15:33.599 align:start position:0%
we'll look at
 
02:15:35.589 --> 02:15:35.599 align:start position:0%
i don't think i have anything
 
02:15:37.669 --> 02:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
particular scheduled for november but i
 
02:15:39.910 --> 02:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
do think we need to
 
02:15:42.870 --> 02:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
get a clear understanding of the
 
02:15:42.880 --> 02:15:44.069 align:start position:0%
get a clear understanding of the
impact

02:15:44.069 --> 02:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
impact
 
02:15:46.069 --> 02:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
that it's going to have on the on the
 
02:15:46.079 --> 02:15:47.109 align:start position:0%
that it's going to have on the on the
budget

02:15:47.109 --> 02:15:47.119 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:15:50.550 --> 02:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
uh representative earth
 
02:15:50.560 --> 02:15:51.669 align:start position:0%
uh representative earth
so

02:15:51.669 --> 02:15:51.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:15:54.390 --> 02:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
these are all federal funds correct
 
02:15:56.950 --> 02:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
and we're raising the eligibility rate
 
02:15:56.960 --> 02:15:58.149 align:start position:0%
and we're raising the eligibility rate
here

02:15:58.149 --> 02:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:15:59.510 --> 02:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
you just said massachusetts or some
 
02:16:01.350 --> 02:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
other states have it to 200 percent
 
02:16:02.709 --> 02:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
that's can we set it a ten thousand
 
02:16:02.719 --> 02:16:05.350 align:start position:0%
that's can we set it a ten thousand
percent

02:16:05.350 --> 02:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:16:12.069 --> 02:16:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:12.079 --> 02:16:13.189 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:16:13.189 --> 02:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:15.669 --> 02:16:15.679 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting question
 
02:16:18.390 --> 02:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh representative i don't know that
 
02:16:21.270 --> 02:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
there's a cap on the percentage but
 
02:16:23.589 --> 02:16:23.599 align:start position:0%
i would anticipate that
 
02:16:23.599 --> 02:16:24.629 align:start position:0%
i would anticipate that
um

02:16:24.629 --> 02:16:24.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:26.709 --> 02:16:26.719 align:start position:0%
with a need to be reasonable for the
 
02:16:28.709 --> 02:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
purposes of snap
 
02:16:28.719 --> 02:16:29.910 align:start position:0%
purposes of snap
um

02:16:29.910 --> 02:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:32.389 --> 02:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
to you know address poverty
 
02:16:32.399 --> 02:16:33.429 align:start position:0%
to you know address poverty
um

02:16:33.429 --> 02:16:33.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:36.870 --> 02:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:38.870 --> 02:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
you know within the the percentage that
 
02:16:40.309 --> 02:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
we're looking at
 
02:16:42.389 --> 02:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
and not what you're suggesting
 
02:16:42.399 --> 02:16:43.190 align:start position:0%
and not what you're suggesting
well

02:16:43.190 --> 02:16:43.200 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:16:45.110 --> 02:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
you just suggested it up to 200 in some
 
02:16:45.120 --> 02:16:46.950 align:start position:0%
you just suggested it up to 200 in some
states

02:16:46.950 --> 02:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
states
 
02:16:48.870 --> 02:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
what's what percentage are we looking at
 
02:16:50.709 --> 02:16:50.719 align:start position:0%
500 percent a thousand percent
 
02:16:52.389 --> 02:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
i don't know that anyone is looking at
 
02:16:52.399 --> 02:16:57.429 align:start position:0%
i don't know that anyone is looking at
that

02:16:57.429 --> 02:16:57.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:59.990 --> 02:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
and chris sentinelo just indicated to me
 
02:17:01.830 --> 02:17:01.840 align:start position:0%
we um we can go back and confirm this
 
02:17:03.830 --> 02:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
but it's our understanding that 300 is
 
02:17:11.429 --> 02:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:17.110 --> 02:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:21.429 --> 02:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
okay but yes i'm sure i remove the table
 
02:17:23.270 --> 02:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
i have a motion
 
02:17:24.950 --> 02:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
a table
 
02:17:28.629 --> 02:17:28.639 align:start position:0%
seconded by um
 
02:17:37.349 --> 02:17:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:45.190 --> 02:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:50.389 --> 02:17:50.399 align:start position:0%

02:20:53.910 --> 02:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
this is the
 
02:20:56.870 --> 02:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:09.270 --> 02:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:12.710 --> 02:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
02:21:15.349 --> 02:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
so i apologize for jumping uh earlier
 
02:21:16.389 --> 02:21:16.399 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
02:21:19.429 --> 02:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
we're finally at the right spot
 
02:21:20.469 --> 02:21:20.479 align:start position:0%
so on
 
02:21:23.830 --> 02:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
the table you provided us table eight
 
02:21:27.190 --> 02:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
it had the annual totals for clients
 
02:21:29.110 --> 02:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
served by community mental health
 
02:21:29.120 --> 02:21:30.070 align:start position:0%
served by community mental health
centers

02:21:30.070 --> 02:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
centers
 
02:21:31.830 --> 02:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
and i see there's been quite a reduction
 
02:21:34.389 --> 02:21:34.399 align:start position:0%
from 2012 to present i don't know if you
 
02:21:35.910 --> 02:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
could explain why there's been a
 
02:21:39.110 --> 02:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
reduction in service
 
02:21:41.270 --> 02:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
so good afternoon
 
02:21:43.910 --> 02:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
members of the committee and madam chair
 
02:21:45.830 --> 02:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
i'm katya foxx i'm the director of the
 
02:21:48.309 --> 02:21:48.319 align:start position:0%
division for behavioral health
 
02:21:50.710 --> 02:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
and um first and foremost i want to say
 
02:21:53.030 --> 02:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
that these statistics have been an area
 
02:21:55.590 --> 02:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
that we've wanted to focus on
 
02:21:58.790 --> 02:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
from where we pull the information and
 
02:22:00.790 --> 02:22:00.800 align:start position:0%
so you'll be seeing
 
02:22:03.910 --> 02:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
when we present an updated dashboard and
 
02:22:06.710 --> 02:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
a new design of the dashboard we're also
 
02:22:09.270 --> 02:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
going to change the way that we pull
 
02:22:10.950 --> 02:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
these statistics
 
02:22:12.550 --> 02:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
we want to
 
02:22:14.550 --> 02:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
accurately reflect all of the work
 
02:22:16.230 --> 02:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
that's being done by our community
 
02:22:17.910 --> 02:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
mental health centers
 
02:22:20.710 --> 02:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
and we believe that the new and improved
 
02:22:23.990 --> 02:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
dashboard will also include new improved
 
02:22:27.110 --> 02:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
data in this particular area with that
 
02:22:29.590 --> 02:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
being said i think that
 
02:22:32.389 --> 02:22:32.399 align:start position:0%
what i would like to focus on i see the
 
02:22:35.190 --> 02:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
big drop that you probably noticed from
 
02:22:38.550 --> 02:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
last month from june to july i went back
 
02:22:41.190 --> 02:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
and looked at that and we also had an
 
02:22:45.429 --> 02:22:45.439 align:start position:0%
even more significant drop last year
 
02:22:47.750 --> 02:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
and a couple other years as you go
 
02:22:50.070 --> 02:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
through the dashboard so we can
 
02:22:52.870 --> 02:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
attribute it to several things probably
 
02:22:52.880 --> 02:22:54.950 align:start position:0%
attribute it to several things probably
seasonality

02:22:54.950 --> 02:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
seasonality
 
02:22:57.670 --> 02:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
with school ending and
 
02:23:01.510 --> 02:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
the summer providing more opportunity to
 
02:23:02.790 --> 02:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
not be
 
02:23:05.349 --> 02:23:05.359 align:start position:0%
engaged in services
 
02:23:06.790 --> 02:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
as people do
 
02:23:08.309 --> 02:23:08.319 align:start position:0%
different things through the summer
 
02:23:11.349 --> 02:23:11.359 align:start position:0%
months but also we know as you've
 
02:23:14.309 --> 02:23:14.319 align:start position:0%
already heard about staffing issues
 
02:23:17.910 --> 02:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
and the centers have been among the many
 
02:23:20.630 --> 02:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
health care providers who've struggled
 
02:23:23.190 --> 02:23:23.200 align:start position:0%
with staff and so you need staff to be
 
02:23:25.510 --> 02:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
able to provide those services
 
02:23:26.950 --> 02:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
all right thanks
 
02:23:29.670 --> 02:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
thanks madam chair
 
02:23:31.590 --> 02:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions yes
 
02:23:33.670 --> 02:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
senator grossman thank you
 
02:23:33.680 --> 02:23:34.710 align:start position:0%
senator grossman thank you
um

02:23:34.710 --> 02:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:37.510 --> 02:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
two questions if i could i've we've seen
 
02:23:40.950 --> 02:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:43.190 --> 02:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
put money into
 
02:23:46.070 --> 02:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
more restrictive settings in the mental
 
02:23:48.870 --> 02:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
health system but not in
 
02:23:50.950 --> 02:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
to the community mental health centers
 
02:23:53.030 --> 02:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
to the same extent and i'm just
 
02:23:57.270 --> 02:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
wondering if you could talk about why
 
02:23:59.750 --> 02:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
we haven't worked to address the
 
02:24:01.190 --> 02:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
staffing issue
 
02:24:01.200 --> 02:24:03.030 align:start position:0%
staffing issue
financially

02:24:03.030 --> 02:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
financially
 
02:24:04.870 --> 02:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
as we have
 
02:24:06.790 --> 02:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
in facilities
 
02:24:11.110 --> 02:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:12.950 --> 02:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
so i'm just looking to see if someone
 
02:24:15.910 --> 02:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
else wants to jump in but
 
02:24:18.309 --> 02:24:18.319 align:start position:0%
first and foremost the community mental
 
02:24:20.790 --> 02:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
health system through the 10-year plan
 
02:24:23.670 --> 02:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
has been an amazing effort
 
02:24:26.550 --> 02:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
that has occurred over the last few
 
02:24:28.630 --> 02:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
years and i know you've been part of
 
02:24:31.270 --> 02:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
that through legislative action to
 
02:24:34.150 --> 02:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
provide significant funding that funding
 
02:24:37.190 --> 02:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
has all gone to the community system so
 
02:24:39.349 --> 02:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about housing we have
 
02:24:41.590 --> 02:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
raised rates
 
02:24:43.670 --> 02:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
through that process through medicaid
 
02:24:46.230 --> 02:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
we've you know had the 3.1 percent
 
02:24:49.590 --> 02:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
increase on a subsequent one we
 
02:24:51.190 --> 02:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
supported the community mental health
 
02:24:52.710 --> 02:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
centers through
 
02:24:52.720 --> 02:24:53.750 align:start position:0%
centers through
the

02:24:53.750 --> 02:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:24:56.230 --> 02:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
arpa funding and before that the cares
 
02:24:59.910 --> 02:24:59.920 align:start position:0%
act funding that has all gone to support
 
02:25:02.309 --> 02:25:02.319 align:start position:0%
and shore up the community mental health
 
02:25:04.150 --> 02:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
system and specifically to
 
02:25:07.030 --> 02:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
community-based services we have housing
 
02:25:09.190 --> 02:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
dollars that we've been
 
02:25:12.070 --> 02:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
putting in there we have had different
 
02:25:14.309 --> 02:25:14.319 align:start position:0%
initiatives and be happy to list those
 
02:25:16.710 --> 02:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
out as a matter of fact you'll be
 
02:25:20.150 --> 02:25:20.160 align:start position:0%

02:25:26.710 --> 02:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
because we are submitting our required
 
02:25:29.590 --> 02:25:29.600 align:start position:0%

we have been doing that and i don't
 
02:25:38.230 --> 02:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
think there's any one sector in the
 
02:25:39.910 --> 02:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
health care
 
02:25:43.830 --> 02:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
system right now that has a solution and
 
02:25:46.469 --> 02:25:46.479 align:start position:0%
has been able to
 
02:25:49.270 --> 02:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
crack that nut when it comes to staffing
 
02:25:52.630 --> 02:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
thank you my second question is probably
 
02:25:54.550 --> 02:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
really for nathan
 
02:25:54.560 --> 02:25:56.309 align:start position:0%
really for nathan
um

02:25:56.309 --> 02:25:56.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:58.710 --> 02:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
we got information that the department
 
02:26:00.389 --> 02:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
had lapsed
 
02:26:02.870 --> 02:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
35 million dollars
 
02:26:05.590 --> 02:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
in revenues i think that's the
 
02:26:05.600 --> 02:26:06.790 align:start position:0%
in revenues i think that's the
additional

02:26:06.790 --> 02:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
additional
 
02:26:06.800 --> 02:26:08.389 align:start position:0%
additional
6.2

02:26:08.389 --> 02:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
6.2
 
02:26:11.510 --> 02:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:13.510 --> 02:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
um i i would have to dig into the
 
02:26:16.070 --> 02:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
details to to specifically answer that
 
02:26:18.790 --> 02:26:18.800 align:start position:0%
question um upon initial analysis i i
 
02:26:20.389 --> 02:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
didn't identify
 
02:26:24.070 --> 02:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
that um however i i know before
 
02:26:25.910 --> 02:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
before i started in my role i know that
 
02:26:28.469 --> 02:26:28.479 align:start position:0%
uh karen had previously spoke to all of
 
02:26:30.070 --> 02:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
you about the revenue
 
02:26:32.150 --> 02:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
um challenges that we have in
 
02:26:34.389 --> 02:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
identifying and estimating those on an
 
02:26:36.230 --> 02:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
ongoing basis
 
02:26:38.630 --> 02:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
i do have an update on that we did
 
02:26:41.190 --> 02:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
acquire a system we procured a system
 
02:26:43.750 --> 02:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
this past spring and we developed it and
 
02:26:46.389 --> 02:26:46.399 align:start position:0%
it is now currently live
 
02:26:48.630 --> 02:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
the downside is that we're currently
 
02:26:51.110 --> 02:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
entering data in for this upcoming
 
02:26:51.120 --> 02:26:52.230 align:start position:0%
entering data in for this upcoming
budget

02:26:52.230 --> 02:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:26:54.309 --> 02:26:54.319 align:start position:0%
but we won't we won't be able to really
 
02:26:56.710 --> 02:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
utilize that until
 
02:26:59.190 --> 02:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
uh until we have a full year of complete
 
02:27:00.790 --> 02:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
data which would not be until the end of
 
02:27:03.429 --> 02:27:03.439 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year 2024 which would allow
 
02:27:06.070 --> 02:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
us the analytical tools to really easily
 
02:27:07.429 --> 02:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
dig into that
 
02:27:09.270 --> 02:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
i can go back and conduct a more
 
02:27:11.590 --> 02:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
thorough analysis if you'd like
 
02:27:12.950 --> 02:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
so that i can give you a little bit more
 
02:27:14.550 --> 02:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
insight into
 
02:27:17.830 --> 02:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
what um what revenue sources feed into
 
02:27:20.150 --> 02:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
that that that revenue lapse if if you'd
 
02:27:22.870 --> 02:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
like that would be great because sure
 
02:27:25.190 --> 02:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
we've been told in the past it is the
 
02:27:27.429 --> 02:27:27.439 align:start position:0%
additional federal match
 
02:27:31.270 --> 02:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
but that means that we are not spending
 
02:27:33.190 --> 02:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
the appropriation
 
02:27:35.190 --> 02:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
and that's why we're
 
02:27:38.469 --> 02:27:38.479 align:start position:0%
collapsing the funds so my question was
 
02:27:41.429 --> 02:27:41.439 align:start position:0%
could the department tell us please
 
02:27:43.429 --> 02:27:43.439 align:start position:0%
which programs
 
02:27:43.439 --> 02:27:44.630 align:start position:0%
which programs
are

02:27:44.630 --> 02:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:27:44.640 --> 02:27:48.670 align:start position:0%
are
lapsing

02:27:48.670 --> 02:27:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:51.349 --> 02:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
appropriation that
 
02:27:54.309 --> 02:27:54.319 align:start position:0%
is losing us federal revenues because we
 
02:27:57.590 --> 02:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
can't find the services or something
 
02:28:00.309 --> 02:28:00.319 align:start position:0%
sure can we find out where yes i'll i'll
 
02:28:01.990 --> 02:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
go back and conduct that analysis and
 
02:28:03.510 --> 02:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
follow that would be great thank you
 
02:28:05.670 --> 02:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh
 
02:28:09.590 --> 02:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:11.750 --> 02:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
since we're going to have education and
 
02:28:14.550 --> 02:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
hhs here in november
 
02:28:17.110 --> 02:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
is that soon enough or
 
02:28:19.110 --> 02:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
i expect to be out of town for that
 
02:28:21.990 --> 02:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
meeting but oh yes whatever obviously
 
02:28:24.309 --> 02:28:24.319 align:start position:0%
whenever you schedule it well but
 
02:28:26.389 --> 02:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
they'll be written materials i can look

october
 
02:28:37.429 --> 02:28:37.439 align:start position:0%
we have um
 
02:28:41.030 --> 02:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
des coming to talk to us about pfas in
 
02:28:41.040 --> 02:28:41.830 align:start position:0%
des coming to talk to us about pfas in
uh

02:28:41.830 --> 02:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:28:41.840 --> 02:28:44.389 align:start position:0%
uh
landfills

02:28:44.389 --> 02:28:44.399 align:start position:0%
landfills
 
02:28:44.399 --> 02:28:45.910 align:start position:0%
landfills
and

02:28:45.910 --> 02:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:28:47.990 --> 02:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
it's exciting yeah it is
 
02:28:50.710 --> 02:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's very exciting especially if
 
02:28:53.429 --> 02:28:53.439 align:start position:0%
you uh if you looked at
 
02:28:56.070 --> 02:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
what's going on with
 
02:28:58.630 --> 02:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
with our landfills in the state so
 
02:28:58.640 --> 02:29:01.750 align:start position:0%
with our landfills in the state so
um

02:29:01.750 --> 02:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:03.510 --> 02:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
02:29:05.270 --> 02:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
they told me it would take them about
 
02:29:07.670 --> 02:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
15-20 minutes
 
02:29:11.270 --> 02:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
on the on october yeah in october
 
02:29:11.280 --> 02:29:12.790 align:start position:0%
on the on october yeah in october
so

02:29:12.790 --> 02:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:29:14.230 --> 02:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
let's try to
 
02:29:16.790 --> 02:29:16.800 align:start position:0%

02:29:19.429 --> 02:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
is that that would be amazing thank you
 
02:29:20.830 --> 02:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
would that be okay
 
02:29:24.389 --> 02:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
nathan oh i think so

the report contains three findings and
 
02:31:10.469 --> 02:31:10.479 align:start position:0%
recommendations none of which suggest
 
02:31:13.110 --> 02:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
legislative action may be required
 
02:31:14.950 --> 02:31:14.960 align:start position:0%

in observation number one
 
02:33:53.830 --> 02:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
recommend that the department formally
 
02:33:56.550 --> 02:33:56.560 align:start position:0%
document its policies and procedures
 
02:33:58.630 --> 02:33:58.640 align:start position:0%
covering the major areas of its
 
02:34:01.110 --> 02:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
financial operations and to look for
 
02:34:03.190 --> 02:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
areas to gain efficiencies within its
 
02:34:05.190 --> 02:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
current process for tracking and
 
02:34:07.349 --> 02:34:07.359 align:start position:0%
requesting federal reimbursements of

expenditures
 
02:34:10.950 --> 02:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
written policies and procedures should
 
02:34:13.270 --> 02:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
be approved by management and it be in
 
02:34:16.150 --> 02:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
sufficient detail to prevent significant
 
02:34:18.630 --> 02:34:18.640 align:start position:0%
disruption in its operations

in observation number two beginning on
 
02:34:26.790 --> 02:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
page nine we recommend the department
 
02:34:28.710 --> 02:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
establish and document a formal risk
 
02:34:31.110 --> 02:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
assessment process for recognizing
 
02:34:33.670 --> 02:34:33.680 align:start position:0%
evaluating and responding to risk that
 
02:34:35.270 --> 02:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
could affect the major areas of its
 
02:34:37.270 --> 02:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
financial operations including the
 
02:34:39.670 --> 02:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
receipt deposit and recording of revenue
 
02:34:41.429 --> 02:34:41.439 align:start position:0%
and the authorization payment recording
 
02:34:43.429 --> 02:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
and reporting of its expenditures
 
02:34:44.710 --> 02:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
the risk assessment should be
 
02:34:46.550 --> 02:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
periodically reviewed and revised as
 
02:34:49.830 --> 02:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
necessary to ensure it remains relevant
 
02:34:51.429 --> 02:34:51.439 align:start position:0%
and should be reviewed
 
02:34:54.630 --> 02:34:54.640 align:start position:0%
and formally documented
 
02:34:57.030 --> 02:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
finally observation number three on page
 
02:34:59.190 --> 02:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
10 recommends the department work with
 
02:35:00.710 --> 02:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
the state department of administrative
 
02:35:03.270 --> 02:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
services in the national guard bureau to
 
02:35:04.870 --> 02:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
document its arrangement with the new
 
02:35:07.190 --> 02:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire national guard for the federal
 
02:35:09.110 --> 02:35:09.120 align:start position:0%
supervision of state employees in a
 
02:35:11.270 --> 02:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
memorandum of understanding or other
 
02:35:13.190 --> 02:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
formal policy document
 
02:35:15.030 --> 02:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
which evidences the agreement of both
 
02:35:15.040 --> 02:35:16.469 align:start position:0%
which evidences the agreement of both
parties

02:35:16.469 --> 02:35:16.479 align:start position:0%
parties
 
02:35:18.150 --> 02:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
the policy document should clearly
 
02:35:19.990 --> 02:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
outline the roles and responsibilities
 
02:35:22.469 --> 02:35:22.479 align:start position:0%
of each party to ensure the supervision
 
02:35:24.550 --> 02:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
of department employees and approval of
 
02:35:26.790 --> 02:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
employee time cards is completed in
 
02:35:29.270 --> 02:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
accordance with state policy
 
02:35:31.429 --> 02:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
we also recommend the department
 
02:35:32.870 --> 02:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
current process for completing a
 
02:35:35.510 --> 02:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
secondary review of employee time cards
 
02:35:36.950 --> 02:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
should be strengthened to include the
 
02:35:39.270 --> 02:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
evidence of the review
 
02:35:40.630 --> 02:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
additionally the department should
 
02:35:42.070 --> 02:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
consider requiring new hampshire
 
02:35:44.550 --> 02:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
national guard supervisors who receive
 
02:35:46.550 --> 02:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
access to the state's time management
 
02:35:48.950 --> 02:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
system to complete a confidentiality
 
02:35:50.950 --> 02:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
agreement underscoring that they may
 
02:35:53.510 --> 02:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
have access to personal and confidential
 
02:35:55.190 --> 02:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
information and that they are not to
 
02:35:57.429 --> 02:35:57.439 align:start position:0%
disseminate it
 
02:35:59.750 --> 02:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
the appendix beginning on page 13
 
02:36:01.429 --> 02:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
reports the current status of prior
 
02:36:03.429 --> 02:36:03.439 align:start position:0%
audit findings
 
02:36:05.990 --> 02:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
the status key on the bottom of page 14
 
02:36:07.429 --> 02:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
reports the department has fully
 
02:36:09.590 --> 02:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
resolved seven observations and one
 
02:36:11.510 --> 02:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
remains unresolved
 
02:36:13.429 --> 02:36:13.439 align:start position:0%
this concludes my presentation and we
 
02:36:15.030 --> 02:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
would like to thank the adjutant general
 
02:36:16.710 --> 02:36:16.720 align:start position:0%

yes okay the okay
 
02:37:36.630 --> 02:37:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh beca because it was confusing to me
 
02:37:40.389 --> 02:37:40.399 align:start position:0%
this write-up dealing with uh who could
 
02:37:42.630 --> 02:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
sign time cards you know
 
02:37:45.590 --> 02:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
and uh who could you know supervise
 
02:37:45.600 --> 02:37:48.309 align:start position:0%
and uh who could you know supervise
because

02:37:48.309 --> 02:37:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:50.469 --> 02:37:50.479 align:start position:0%
anyhow normally it's the ranking person
 
02:37:52.230 --> 02:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
no matter who they are
 
02:37:53.910 --> 02:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
right right so in this particular case
 
02:37:57.110 --> 02:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
just conceptually 3000 strong about 2800
 
02:37:59.270 --> 02:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
service members about
 
02:38:01.990 --> 02:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
fifty federal title five civilians and
 
02:38:04.469 --> 02:38:04.479 align:start position:0%
150 state employees
 
02:38:05.910 --> 02:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
most of the state employees work
 
02:38:07.830 --> 02:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
underneath maintenance maintaining our
 
02:38:09.030 --> 02:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
facilities throughout the state both
 
02:38:11.429 --> 02:38:11.439 align:start position:0%
army and air so generally speaking that
 
02:38:13.510 --> 02:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
maintenance worker his supervisor is
 
02:38:15.270 --> 02:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
probably either a federal civilian or a
 
02:38:18.469 --> 02:38:18.479 align:start position:0%
federal military individual
 
02:38:20.389 --> 02:38:20.399 align:start position:0%
so he that individual is the one who
 
02:38:22.309 --> 02:38:22.319 align:start position:0%
signs the time card
 
02:38:23.110 --> 02:38:23.120 align:start position:0%
because they're the ones who have
 
02:38:24.870 --> 02:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
oversight so it's just more of the
 
02:38:26.870 --> 02:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
documentation of
 
02:38:29.510 --> 02:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
the risk associated with um that time
 
02:38:29.520 --> 02:38:30.389 align:start position:0%
the risk associated with um that time
card

02:38:30.389 --> 02:38:30.399 align:start position:0%
card
 
02:38:33.190 --> 02:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
signing process
 
02:38:35.590 --> 02:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
does that help
 
02:38:37.670 --> 02:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
okay i just want to make sure that we're
 
02:38:39.110 --> 02:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
not uh
 
02:38:41.030 --> 02:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
creating complications that don't need
 
02:38:44.630 --> 02:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:46.070 --> 02:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
we do it it's just not a formalized
 
02:38:46.080 --> 02:38:47.750 align:start position:0%
we do it it's just not a formalized
process

02:38:47.750 --> 02:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:38:49.990 --> 02:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
so we have no issue with the finding
 
02:38:52.790 --> 02:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
okay so you'll
 
02:38:54.950 --> 02:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
you'll set up a procedure or something
 
02:38:57.990 --> 02:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
or other for that yes okay yes ma'am all
 
02:39:00.070 --> 02:39:00.080 align:start position:0%
right thank you
 
02:39:03.910 --> 02:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:05.830 --> 02:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
i do have one
 
02:39:07.510 --> 02:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
more sorry
 
02:39:11.190 --> 02:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
i know that um risk assessment is a
 
02:39:13.349 --> 02:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
problem across
 
02:39:15.429 --> 02:39:15.439 align:start position:0%
all agencies
 
02:39:16.630 --> 02:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
not just
 
02:39:19.429 --> 02:39:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:22.389 --> 02:39:22.399 align:start position:0%
whatever you are now
 
02:39:25.670 --> 02:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
military affairs um
 
02:39:25.680 --> 02:39:26.790 align:start position:0%
military affairs um
and

02:39:26.790 --> 02:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:39:29.190 --> 02:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not exactly sure
 
02:39:32.070 --> 02:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
how we solve this problem
 
02:39:34.790 --> 02:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
whether it's a
 
02:39:39.349 --> 02:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
reminder to all the commissioners or
 
02:39:41.270 --> 02:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
or a
 
02:39:43.830 --> 02:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
new audit that just goes out and looks
 
02:39:43.840 --> 02:39:45.110 align:start position:0%
new audit that just goes out and looks
at

02:39:45.110 --> 02:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
at
 
02:39:47.990 --> 02:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
do you have risk assessments
 
02:39:50.870 --> 02:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
because this comes up all the time
 
02:39:52.790 --> 02:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:39:52.800 --> 02:39:54.070 align:start position:0%
and um
i

02:39:54.070 --> 02:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:39:55.910 --> 02:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
i recognize
 
02:39:58.790 --> 02:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
that in my past life i got dinged
 
02:40:01.429 --> 02:40:01.439 align:start position:0%
because i didn't have risk assessments
 
02:40:02.870 --> 02:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:40:06.230 --> 02:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
and i mean we are dealing with
 
02:40:07.830 --> 02:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
public money
 
02:40:10.950 --> 02:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
and we should be
 
02:40:14.710 --> 02:40:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:17.910 --> 02:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
guarding those dollars accurately
 
02:40:21.910 --> 02:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
and we're following the procedure so and
 
02:40:24.469 --> 02:40:24.479 align:start position:0%
since this was written up
 
02:40:27.429 --> 02:40:27.439 align:start position:0%
in your in
 
02:40:27.439 --> 02:40:29.030 align:start position:0%
in your in
2007

02:40:29.030 --> 02:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
2007
 
02:40:30.950 --> 02:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
and it
 
02:40:34.469 --> 02:40:34.479 align:start position:0%
was still open and now we are in some
 
02:40:35.670 --> 02:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
other year
 
02:40:38.630 --> 02:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
and i i just get concerned that
 
02:40:40.950 --> 02:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
you know risk assessment
 
02:40:40.960 --> 02:40:42.150 align:start position:0%
you know risk assessment
is

02:40:42.150 --> 02:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:40:44.630 --> 02:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
probably not on the
 
02:40:47.670 --> 02:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
front burner of and i'm not i'm not
 
02:40:50.469 --> 02:40:50.479 align:start position:0%
talking just about military affairs but
 
02:40:53.429 --> 02:40:53.439 align:start position:0%
i'm talking about the entire
 
02:40:56.870 --> 02:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
scope of the state government so
 
02:40:58.710 --> 02:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
anyhow that's just my
 
02:41:02.070 --> 02:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
my comment and i know that uh mr kane
 
02:41:02.080 --> 02:41:02.950 align:start position:0%
my comment and i know that uh mr kane
will

02:41:02.950 --> 02:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
will
 
02:41:05.030 --> 02:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
take that back so
 
02:41:07.349 --> 02:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
okay is there anything else that you
 
02:41:07.359 --> 02:41:08.389 align:start position:0%
okay is there anything else that you
would

02:41:08.389 --> 02:41:08.399 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:41:10.710 --> 02:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
like to to say
 
02:41:12.150 --> 02:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
either one
 
02:41:14.950 --> 02:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh ma'am this day was uh exceptional we
 
02:41:16.550 --> 02:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
get we have an internal auditing
 
02:41:18.150 --> 02:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
department on the federal side so we get
 
02:41:20.150 --> 02:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
audited a ton uh to make sure the
 
02:41:21.510 --> 02:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
disbursement of federal funds for the
 
02:41:24.630 --> 02:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
state is in an appropriate manner um it
 
02:41:26.870 --> 02:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
was exceptional working with them and uh
 
02:41:28.630 --> 02:41:28.640 align:start position:0%
we have no other comments other than
 
02:41:31.190 --> 02:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
stockholm senator daniels earlier is um
 
02:41:32.630 --> 02:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
just struggling when you hear all these
 
02:41:33.990 --> 02:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
other state departments talk about the
 
02:41:35.990 --> 02:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
challenge for either healthcare workers
 
02:41:38.710 --> 02:41:38.720 align:start position:0%

02:41:40.230 --> 02:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
the military this year
 
02:41:42.309 --> 02:41:42.319 align:start position:0%
um in the army we're having our worst
 
02:41:43.590 --> 02:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
recruiting year since the end of the
 
02:41:47.510 --> 02:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
draft in 1972 and it's affecting us
 
02:41:49.429 --> 02:41:49.439 align:start position:0%
that's that's true
 
02:41:51.910 --> 02:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
very true across
 
02:41:55.910 --> 02:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
not only the guard and the reserves but
 
02:42:00.070 --> 02:42:00.080 align:start position:0%

yeah
 
02:43:12.469 --> 02:43:12.479 align:start position:0%
so it is a very good piece of paper and
 
02:43:14.950 --> 02:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
i didn't do it joyce did
 
02:43:14.960 --> 02:43:16.710 align:start position:0%
i didn't do it joyce did
um

02:43:16.710 --> 02:43:16.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:17.990 --> 02:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
i'm charlie erlinghouse i'm the
 
02:43:21.349 --> 02:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner of administrative services
 
02:43:23.349 --> 02:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
i am joyce pittman the director of risk
 
02:43:24.630 --> 02:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
and benefits
 
02:43:26.870 --> 02:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
um uh chair umberger asked us to do a
 
02:43:26.880 --> 02:43:27.990 align:start position:0%
um uh chair umberger asked us to do a
presentation

02:43:27.990 --> 02:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
02:43:30.070 --> 02:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
and uh to talk to you about how we how
 
02:43:31.750 --> 02:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
we pay for health insurance for state
 
02:43:34.550 --> 02:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
employees and retirees and it's very
 
02:43:36.630 --> 02:43:36.640 align:start position:0%
easy when for us to get in our heads and
 
02:43:38.070 --> 02:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
think everybody
 
02:43:39.990 --> 02:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
everybody remembers when the state went
 
02:43:42.710 --> 02:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
from self-insured to from fully insured
 
02:43:44.550 --> 02:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
to self-insured
 
02:43:46.870 --> 02:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
when craig benson was governor god knows
 
02:43:48.830 --> 02:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
how many of you were in office at the
 
02:43:51.590 --> 02:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
time um and then although actually
 
02:43:53.670 --> 02:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
probably more of you than
 
02:43:53.680 --> 02:43:54.550 align:start position:0%
probably more of you than
not

02:43:54.550 --> 02:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:43:56.070 --> 02:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
um but
 
02:43:57.910 --> 02:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
a refresher is always good because we
 
02:43:59.510 --> 02:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
live and breathe this every day and
 
02:44:03.030 --> 02:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:04.790 --> 02:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
i wish senator perkins quokka was still
 
02:44:06.710 --> 02:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
here because i wanted to say that one of
 
02:44:08.309 --> 02:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
the most important things in recruiting
 
02:44:09.910 --> 02:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
employees in the state
 
02:44:11.510 --> 02:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
wages are
 
02:44:13.429 --> 02:44:13.439 align:start position:0%
wages are always the first thing right
 
02:44:15.190 --> 02:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
we're all crazy if we don't pretend we
 
02:44:17.110 --> 02:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
don't look at the salary but for the
 
02:44:18.630 --> 02:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
state one of the ways we're wonderfully
 
02:44:21.830 --> 02:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
competitive is on health benefits um and
 
02:44:23.349 --> 02:44:23.359 align:start position:0%
it's because we do a really good job on
 
02:44:24.950 --> 02:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
health benefits and are able therefore
 
02:44:27.030 --> 02:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
to offer good health benefits and that's
 
02:44:29.750 --> 02:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
largely because of people like joyce
 
02:44:32.710 --> 02:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
who's going to talk to you
 
02:44:32.720 --> 02:44:33.750 align:start position:0%
who's going to talk to you
okay

02:44:33.750 --> 02:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:44:34.950 --> 02:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:44:36.230 --> 02:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for the
 
02:44:38.070 --> 02:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to come here and talk about
 
02:44:40.309 --> 02:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
the health benefit plan
 
02:44:42.230 --> 02:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
i know it's late for
 
02:44:44.070 --> 02:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
this presentation in the morning or
 
02:44:46.230 --> 02:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
actually early afternoon so i do want to
 
02:44:47.670 --> 02:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
have it interactive so if there's
 
02:44:49.750 --> 02:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
something i'm going over too quickly
 
02:44:53.030 --> 02:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
please stop me if that's okay
 
02:44:55.670 --> 02:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
but the division of risk and benefits
 
02:44:58.230 --> 02:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
submits an informational item
 
02:45:00.389 --> 02:45:00.399 align:start position:0%
every other month to the fiscal
 
02:45:02.469 --> 02:45:02.479 align:start position:0%
committee and the purpose of this
 
02:45:04.309 --> 02:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
presentation is just as charlie said is
 
02:45:06.309 --> 02:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
to provide some of that background
 
02:45:08.630 --> 02:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
but um before we get too deep into the
 
02:45:11.269 --> 02:45:11.279 align:start position:0%
slides i'm on slide three i thought it
 
02:45:13.590 --> 02:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
would be helpful to talk about the two
 
02:45:16.790 --> 02:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
different types of health benefit plans
 
02:45:18.710 --> 02:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
and the funding mechanisms for those
 
02:45:20.870 --> 02:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
benefit plans
 
02:45:23.429 --> 02:45:23.439 align:start position:0%
that we we use them frequently in our
 
02:45:25.190 --> 02:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
world but not sure if everybody knows
 
02:45:26.790 --> 02:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
what we're referring to
 
02:45:28.150 --> 02:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
so there are two different funding
 
02:45:30.550 --> 02:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
mechanisms for health benefit plans
 
02:45:32.710 --> 02:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
that we focus on one of them is fully
 
02:45:35.510 --> 02:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
insured and basically with a fully
 
02:45:37.910 --> 02:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
insured plan you're looking at who's
 
02:45:39.429 --> 02:45:39.439 align:start position:0%
assuming the risk
 
02:45:41.910 --> 02:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
for the the cost of the claims in a
 
02:45:44.309 --> 02:45:44.319 align:start position:0%
fully insured claim it's usually a an
 
02:45:47.429 --> 02:45:47.439 align:start position:0%
insurance carrier who we pay a premium
 
02:45:47.439 --> 02:45:48.150 align:start position:0%
insurance carrier who we pay a premium
to

02:45:48.150 --> 02:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:45:49.990 --> 02:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
every monthly
 
02:45:52.309 --> 02:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
a monthly basis per our members per
 
02:45:54.230 --> 02:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
month and then they assume the claim
 
02:45:56.950 --> 02:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
cost in exchange for that they may
 
02:45:59.750 --> 02:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
receive some sort of federal funding
 
02:46:02.070 --> 02:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
i'll speak in particular to our medicare
 
02:46:04.550 --> 02:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
advantage program our medicare advantage
 
02:46:07.590 --> 02:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
program for our retirees is fully
 
02:46:07.600 --> 02:46:08.710 align:start position:0%
program for our retirees is fully
insured

02:46:08.710 --> 02:46:08.720 align:start position:0%
insured
 
02:46:10.870 --> 02:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
which means aetna who's our current
 
02:46:13.830 --> 02:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
carrier pays those claims all those
 
02:46:15.429 --> 02:46:15.439 align:start position:0%
health care claims that our retiree
 
02:46:18.150 --> 02:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
receives and in exchange for that we pay
 
02:46:20.070 --> 02:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
them a premium which i'm going to talk
 
02:46:22.389 --> 02:46:22.399 align:start position:0%
about in a little bit
 
02:46:23.990 --> 02:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
and then the other type of plan is a
 
02:46:26.710 --> 02:46:26.720 align:start position:0%
self-funded plan and that's where the
 
02:46:29.110 --> 02:46:29.120 align:start position:0%
state is on the hook for the cost of
 
02:46:30.950 --> 02:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
those health benefits those claims
 
02:46:30.960 --> 02:46:32.389 align:start position:0%
those health benefits those claims
expenses

02:46:32.389 --> 02:46:32.399 align:start position:0%
expenses
 
02:46:32.399 --> 02:46:33.269 align:start position:0%
expenses
um

02:46:33.269 --> 02:46:33.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:33.279 --> 02:46:34.230 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:46:34.230 --> 02:46:34.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:46:36.309 --> 02:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
in exchange for paying for those claims
 
02:46:38.469 --> 02:46:38.479 align:start position:0%
we are also eligible to receive
 
02:46:39.990 --> 02:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
subsidies when we're talking about
 
02:46:41.990 --> 02:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs we talk about rebates
 
02:46:44.309 --> 02:46:44.319 align:start position:0%
regularly so those rebates come back to
 
02:46:45.990 --> 02:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:46:48.630 --> 02:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
if it's a medicare
 
02:46:50.950 --> 02:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
well we have a medicare
 
02:46:53.510 --> 02:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
part d plan for prescription drugs for
 
02:46:55.349 --> 02:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
our medicare retirees
 
02:46:57.349 --> 02:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
we pay for those prescription drugs and
 
02:46:59.670 --> 02:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
we get federal subsidies to do so and
 
02:47:01.429 --> 02:47:01.439 align:start position:0%
i'll talk more about that
 
02:47:03.030 --> 02:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
to come
 
02:47:07.510 --> 02:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh just a quick question sure uh are all
 
02:47:09.269 --> 02:47:09.279 align:start position:0%
state employees
 
02:47:11.590 --> 02:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
under the self-funded program
 
02:47:14.389 --> 02:47:14.399 align:start position:0%
state employees are yes okay so
 
02:47:17.670 --> 02:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
every across the board yes okay and then
 
02:47:17.680 --> 02:47:18.630 align:start position:0%
every across the board yes okay and then
the

02:47:18.630 --> 02:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:47:21.990 --> 02:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
retirees are under the fully insured so
 
02:47:23.429 --> 02:47:23.439 align:start position:0%
on slide four
 
02:47:25.190 --> 02:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
you're giving me a great segue to get to
 
02:47:26.950 --> 02:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
the next slide
 
02:47:29.190 --> 02:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
the retirees are split so what you'll
 
02:47:30.710 --> 02:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
see at the top from our
 
02:47:34.150 --> 02:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
employer-sponsored group health plans
 
02:47:36.950 --> 02:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
the active employees and our troopers
 
02:47:38.790 --> 02:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
they are for their medical benefits
 
02:47:41.349 --> 02:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
through anthem that is self-funded
 
02:47:43.030 --> 02:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
as well as the prescription drugs
 
02:47:45.750 --> 02:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
through express scripts also self-funded
 
02:47:47.269 --> 02:47:47.279 align:start position:0%
and then all the way to the right you'll
 
02:47:49.349 --> 02:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
see that we have northeast delta dental
 
02:47:51.910 --> 02:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
which is also self-funded
 
02:47:53.830 --> 02:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
and so across the top are all of our
 
02:47:55.750 --> 02:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
active employees and anybody who's
 
02:47:57.429 --> 02:47:57.439 align:start position:0%
eligible to participate on our active
 
02:47:58.790 --> 02:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
employee plan
 
02:48:00.469 --> 02:48:00.479 align:start position:0%
then below that you see the retiree
 
02:48:03.190 --> 02:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
health plan and that's really split
 
02:48:05.910 --> 02:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
so our non-medicare retirees we often
 
02:48:07.510 --> 02:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
use the phrase commercial it's our
 
02:48:09.190 --> 02:48:09.200 align:start position:0%
commercial plan with our actives and our
 
02:48:11.349 --> 02:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
non-medicare retirees
 
02:48:13.510 --> 02:48:13.520 align:start position:0%
they are self-funded and they're on the
 
02:48:16.150 --> 02:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
an anthem self-funded plan as well as
 
02:48:18.950 --> 02:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
express scripts as a self-funded plan
 
02:48:20.790 --> 02:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
i just want to jump in
 
02:48:20.800 --> 02:48:21.910 align:start position:0%
i just want to jump in
um

02:48:21.910 --> 02:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:21.920 --> 02:48:23.269 align:start position:0%
um
self-funded

02:48:23.269 --> 02:48:23.279 align:start position:0%
self-funded
 
02:48:25.510 --> 02:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
they are not self-funded we
 
02:48:28.150 --> 02:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
we are the self not they are the self
 
02:48:30.389 --> 02:48:30.399 align:start position:0%
so i just and i know everybody knows
 
02:48:31.349 --> 02:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
that but i want to remind you
 
02:48:32.950 --> 02:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
self-funded means the state's on the
 
02:48:32.960 --> 02:48:33.830 align:start position:0%
self-funded means the state's on the
hook

02:48:33.830 --> 02:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
hook
 
02:48:35.750 --> 02:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the insurance companies on
 
02:48:37.349 --> 02:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
the hook it does not mean the person is
 
02:48:39.269 --> 02:48:39.279 align:start position:0%
on the hook
 
02:48:40.389 --> 02:48:40.399 align:start position:0%
i know
 
02:48:43.990 --> 02:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
every now and again yeah thank you
 
02:48:45.429 --> 02:48:45.439 align:start position:0%
so then at the bottom there you'll see
 
02:48:47.590 --> 02:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
medicare and medicare we actually have
 
02:48:50.550 --> 02:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
that population and they fully insured
 
02:48:52.950 --> 02:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
aetna's on the hook to use that phrase
 
02:48:55.349 --> 02:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
to pay those medical claims
 
02:48:57.429 --> 02:48:57.439 align:start position:0%
that is a medicare advantage program
 
02:49:00.230 --> 02:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
also referred to as a medicare part c
 
02:49:00.240 --> 02:49:01.750 align:start position:0%
also referred to as a medicare part c
plan

02:49:01.750 --> 02:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
plan
 
02:49:03.990 --> 02:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
and then our medicare
 
02:49:07.349 --> 02:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
part d prescription drug d as in dog
 
02:49:09.269 --> 02:49:09.279 align:start position:0%
plan is self-funded through express
 
02:49:09.279 --> 02:49:17.510 align:start position:0%
plan is self-funded through express
scripts

02:49:17.510 --> 02:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:17.520 --> 02:49:18.309 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:49:18.309 --> 02:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:20.309 --> 02:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
the laws establishing our health benefit
 
02:49:22.910 --> 02:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
plan are the laws that manage us under
 
02:49:25.990 --> 02:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
21i30 it says the state shall pay a
 
02:49:28.070 --> 02:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
premium partial premium toward group
 
02:49:30.070 --> 02:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
health benefits or self-funded
 
02:49:32.469 --> 02:49:32.479 align:start position:0%
alternative which we've just discussed
 
02:49:33.910 --> 02:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
within the limits of the funds
 
02:49:37.030 --> 02:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
appropriated each legislative session
 
02:49:39.269 --> 02:49:39.279 align:start position:0%
and then more specifically section e of
 
02:49:39.279 --> 02:49:40.950 align:start position:0%
and then more specifically section e of
21i30

02:49:40.950 --> 02:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
21i30
 
02:49:43.349 --> 02:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
specifies that we will have an employee
 
02:49:45.030 --> 02:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
and retiree risk
 
02:49:47.349 --> 02:49:47.359 align:start position:0%
management fund we refer to it as fund
 
02:49:51.349 --> 02:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
60 and that is an internal service fund
 
02:49:53.670 --> 02:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
that is non-lapsing and continually
 
02:49:56.070 --> 02:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
appropriated to dis and we're using
 
02:49:58.710 --> 02:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
those funds only for the use of the
 
02:50:00.469 --> 02:50:00.479 align:start position:0%
health benefit plan to pay for those
 
02:50:02.309 --> 02:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
claims and administrative fees that are
 
02:50:06.389 --> 02:50:06.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:09.110 --> 02:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
yeah oh yes senator daniels thank you
 
02:50:11.830 --> 02:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
before we leave uh page four
 
02:50:13.510 --> 02:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh just a quick question on the
 
02:50:15.990 --> 02:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
non-medicare self-funded with anthem is
 
02:50:18.389 --> 02:50:18.399 align:start position:0%
that the same plan as the act of
 
02:50:21.269 --> 02:50:21.279 align:start position:0%
employees and troopers have
 
02:50:23.349 --> 02:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
it it's actually
 
02:50:24.790 --> 02:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
it's very similar they have a little bit
 
02:50:27.190 --> 02:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
of a different copay structure but yes
 
02:50:29.190 --> 02:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
it's the same they're still using the
 
02:50:31.269 --> 02:50:31.279 align:start position:0%
national preferred formulary okay that
 
02:50:32.870 --> 02:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
the active employees have
 
02:50:35.429 --> 02:50:35.439 align:start position:0%
and on your on your medicare
 
02:50:36.870 --> 02:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
is there a reason
 
02:50:40.230 --> 02:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
why you are using a medicare c
 
02:50:43.190 --> 02:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
program without drugs versus
 
02:50:45.510 --> 02:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
getting one with and then a standalone
 
02:50:45.520 --> 02:50:47.429 align:start position:0%
getting one with and then a standalone
program

02:50:47.429 --> 02:50:47.439 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:50:49.910 --> 02:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
the reason now is really a resort a
 
02:50:51.590 --> 02:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
result of contracting so our
 
02:50:53.590 --> 02:50:53.600 align:start position:0%
prescription drug contract is under a
 
02:50:55.590 --> 02:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
different program but we always explore
 
02:50:57.190 --> 02:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
what would that look like
 
02:50:59.110 --> 02:50:59.120 align:start position:0%
if we were to pull
 
02:51:01.590 --> 02:51:01.600 align:start position:0%
pharmacy into our medicare part c
 
02:51:03.269 --> 02:51:03.279 align:start position:0%
program so that would be a medicare
 
02:51:04.710 --> 02:51:04.720 align:start position:0%
advantage plan
 
02:51:07.990 --> 02:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
with a mapd medicare advantage plan
 
02:51:09.990 --> 02:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
prescription drug plan
 
02:51:12.550 --> 02:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
but at this time just based on how we've
 
02:51:14.389 --> 02:51:14.399 align:start position:0%
contracted it
 
02:51:16.630 --> 02:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
we actually implemented medicare
 
02:51:20.550 --> 02:51:20.560 align:start position:0%
advantage in 2000 it was 2018 for plan
 
02:51:22.710 --> 02:51:22.720 align:start position:0%
year one one of 19.
 
02:51:24.630 --> 02:51:24.640 align:start position:0%
and then 19 and 20 was through anthem
 
02:51:28.150 --> 02:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
and then we transitioned with ex
 
02:51:28.160 --> 02:51:29.510 align:start position:0%
and then we transitioned with ex
with

02:51:29.510 --> 02:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:51:31.910 --> 02:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
aetna for the medicare advantage plan
 
02:51:33.670 --> 02:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
for 2020
 
02:51:35.269 --> 02:51:35.279 align:start position:0%
and we still had express scripts
 
02:51:37.030 --> 02:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
separate but we always explore that as
 
02:51:38.870 --> 02:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
an alternative so there's no reason it's
 
02:51:40.790 --> 02:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
preventing us from doing it it's just
 
02:51:42.870 --> 02:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
the way it is right now if we see that
 
02:51:44.389 --> 02:51:44.399 align:start position:0%
we could um
 
02:51:46.550 --> 02:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
attain additional savings
 
02:51:48.550 --> 02:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
we will do that but we are still getting
 
02:51:51.429 --> 02:51:51.439 align:start position:0%
federal subsidies under the
 
02:51:53.110 --> 02:51:53.120 align:start position:0%
current it's called an employer group
 
02:51:55.670 --> 02:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
waiver plan we refer to the acronym as
 
02:51:55.680 --> 02:51:57.110 align:start position:0%
waiver plan we refer to the acronym as
egwip

02:51:57.110 --> 02:51:57.120 align:start position:0%
egwip
 
02:51:59.510 --> 02:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
but i live in the world of acronyms so i
 
02:52:01.830 --> 02:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
try not to use those too much but our
 
02:52:03.910 --> 02:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
egg whip is a prescription drug it's a
 
02:52:05.670 --> 02:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
part d plan so we are getting that
 
02:52:07.750 --> 02:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
subsidy we're just holding on to it
 
02:52:10.070 --> 02:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
instead of sending it over to our part c
 
02:52:12.309 --> 02:52:12.319 align:start position:0%
provider okay and
 
02:52:15.269 --> 02:52:15.279 align:start position:0%
final question medicare c plans change
 
02:52:17.910 --> 02:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
every year are our contracts with
 
02:52:19.830 --> 02:52:19.840 align:start position:0%
whoever is providing those
 
02:52:22.070 --> 02:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
longer than one year
 
02:52:24.070 --> 02:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
we are currently in a three-year
 
02:52:26.150 --> 02:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
contract with aetna that started in
 
02:52:26.160 --> 02:52:27.750 align:start position:0%
contract with aetna that started in
2020.

02:52:27.750 --> 02:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
2020.
 
02:52:31.750 --> 02:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:33.830 --> 02:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
when we negotiated that contract with
 
02:52:37.750 --> 02:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
aetna they came back with a zero premium
 
02:52:39.750 --> 02:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
so the premium for
 
02:52:42.630 --> 02:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
aetna to assume the risk for our
 
02:52:44.950 --> 02:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
medicare eligible retirees to be on that
 
02:52:47.510 --> 02:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
plan is costs in the state nothing per
 
02:52:47.520 --> 02:52:49.190 align:start position:0%
plan is costs in the state nothing per
month

02:52:49.190 --> 02:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
month
 
02:52:49.200 --> 02:52:50.150 align:start position:0%
month
so

02:52:50.150 --> 02:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:52:55.830 --> 02:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
we have that rate guarantee through 2023
 
02:52:57.429 --> 02:52:57.439 align:start position:0%
and then we have to look at our plan
 
02:52:59.590 --> 02:52:59.600 align:start position:0%
experience to see what our options are
 
02:53:02.309 --> 02:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
for anything beyond that
 
02:53:03.910 --> 02:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
good thank you
 
02:53:06.469 --> 02:53:06.479 align:start position:0%
do you want to add anything
 
02:53:11.990 --> 02:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:15.910 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:53:15.910 --> 02:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:15.920 --> 02:53:17.349 align:start position:0%
 
das

02:53:17.349 --> 02:53:17.359 align:start position:0%
das
 
02:53:20.150 --> 02:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
determines the rate and then they
 
02:53:24.070 --> 02:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
identify or they charge the individual
 
02:53:27.910 --> 02:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
agencies for the cost of their people
 
02:53:29.590 --> 02:53:29.600 align:start position:0%
okay yes
 
02:53:31.190 --> 02:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
and so we we
 
02:53:34.070 --> 02:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
use the term working rate
 
02:53:35.910 --> 02:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
to determine the total cost of what the
 
02:53:37.429 --> 02:53:37.439 align:start position:0%
health care is going to cost on a per
 
02:53:39.670 --> 02:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
member per month basis
 
02:53:41.830 --> 02:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
we actually do that on a per employee
 
02:53:42.870 --> 02:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
per month
 
02:53:44.870 --> 02:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
and it's a term like and in healthcare
 
02:53:46.550 --> 02:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
we use belly buttons when you're looking
 
02:53:48.309 --> 02:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
at members like how many members are in
 
02:53:50.309 --> 02:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
your household so each house could have
 
02:53:52.469 --> 02:53:52.479 align:start position:0%
multiple people covered under the plan
 
02:53:53.990 --> 02:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
multiple members
 
02:53:56.630 --> 02:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
our plan is based on employee how many
 
02:53:58.630 --> 02:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
employees per month
 
02:53:58.640 --> 02:53:59.830 align:start position:0%
employees per month
so

02:53:59.830 --> 02:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:54:01.510 --> 02:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
that working rate
 
02:54:03.030 --> 02:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
inc it's a
 
02:54:05.590 --> 02:54:05.600 align:start position:0%
all-inclusive charge that we charge out
 
02:54:09.030 --> 02:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
so for our medicare retirees for example
 
02:54:11.349 --> 02:54:11.359 align:start position:0%
even though the medical portion of that
 
02:54:14.309 --> 02:54:14.319 align:start position:0%
working rate is zero there is still cost
 
02:54:16.309 --> 02:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
for access to the prescription drug
 
02:54:17.990 --> 02:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
benefit remember that's still
 
02:54:20.550 --> 02:54:20.560 align:start position:0%
self-funded so the state is still paying
 
02:54:22.630 --> 02:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
the cost of the prescription drug claims
 
02:54:24.550 --> 02:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
right in exchange for those federal
 
02:54:26.389 --> 02:54:26.399 align:start position:0%
subsidy dollars and rebates
 
02:54:28.950 --> 02:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
but also um any kind of administrative
 
02:54:31.110 --> 02:54:31.120 align:start position:0%
fees for like the division of risk and
 
02:54:32.870 --> 02:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
benefits we have salaries included in
 
02:54:34.790 --> 02:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
there we have a health benefits
 
02:54:37.349 --> 02:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
consultant that we work with siegel that
 
02:54:39.510 --> 02:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
helps us develop those working rates and
 
02:54:41.830 --> 02:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
budget rates every year
 
02:54:43.190 --> 02:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
there's a cost for them as well and
 
02:54:46.550 --> 02:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
that's included in that working rate
 
02:54:48.389 --> 02:54:48.399 align:start position:0%
and you'll see more information about
 
02:54:50.309 --> 02:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
the cost of those working rates in a few
 
02:54:50.319 --> 02:54:54.389 align:start position:0%
the cost of those working rates in a few
slides

02:54:54.389 --> 02:54:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:58.469 --> 02:54:58.479 align:start position:0%
so on slide six whoops
 
02:55:00.550 --> 02:55:00.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't need that it's okay on
 
02:55:02.389 --> 02:55:02.399 align:start position:0%
slide six it
 
02:55:03.349 --> 02:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
i just thought it would be an
 
02:55:05.030 --> 02:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
interesting question how much does the
 
02:55:06.790 --> 02:55:06.800 align:start position:0%
state pay for health benefits seems like
 
02:55:08.950 --> 02:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
a logical question to ask
 
02:55:11.670 --> 02:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
um thank you so the total cost of the
 
02:55:13.349 --> 02:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
employee and retiree health benefit plan
 
02:55:15.429 --> 02:55:15.439 align:start position:0%
in fy 23
 
02:55:18.870 --> 02:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
is approximately 320 million dollars of
 
02:55:22.070 --> 02:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
which the 43 of that is generally funded
 
02:55:23.670 --> 02:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
and then i break out just the
 
02:55:26.150 --> 02:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
populations just so you can see for fy
 
02:55:26.160 --> 02:55:28.309 align:start position:0%
populations just so you can see for fy
23

02:55:28.309 --> 02:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
23
 
02:55:30.630 --> 02:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
by active and the trooper plan the
 
02:55:32.790 --> 02:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
retiree health benefit plan cost and
 
02:55:35.269 --> 02:55:35.279 align:start position:0%
then dental sometimes is forgotten but
 
02:55:37.910 --> 02:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
that is included in our cost as well
 
02:55:39.910 --> 02:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
and then our budget for the active
 
02:55:42.710 --> 02:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
employee and trooper plan the budget is
 
02:55:45.750 --> 02:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
sitting in the class class 60s
 
02:55:48.150 --> 02:55:48.160 align:start position:0%
for the agencies and then the retiree
 
02:55:49.750 --> 02:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
health benefit budget
 
02:55:51.429 --> 02:55:51.439 align:start position:0%
there are self-funded agencies that
 
02:55:54.309 --> 02:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
budget for their projected retirees as
 
02:55:56.630 --> 02:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
well as das has
 
02:55:58.550 --> 02:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
a retiree health budget
 
02:56:02.309 --> 02:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:04.230 --> 02:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
when you look at slide seven wait wait
 
02:56:08.230 --> 02:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:09.990 --> 02:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
when you say
 
02:56:12.870 --> 02:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
self-funded agencies
 
02:56:15.510 --> 02:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
what what agencies
 
02:56:18.550 --> 02:56:18.560 align:start position:0%
oh do you know which agency so um yes
 
02:56:18.560 --> 02:56:20.230 align:start position:0%
oh do you know which agency so um yes
there's

02:56:20.230 --> 02:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
there's
 
02:56:22.309 --> 02:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
the wire they so they're they're
 
02:56:24.230 --> 02:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
bringing so why are they self-funded
 
02:56:28.950 --> 02:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:30.710 --> 02:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
they're non-generally funded agencies
 
02:56:32.070 --> 02:56:32.080 align:start position:0%
that we bill for the retiree health
 
02:56:34.150 --> 02:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
costs it's carried in their budget in
 
02:56:36.950 --> 02:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
class 64. that money is then transferred
 
02:56:36.960 --> 02:56:39.110 align:start position:0%
class 64. that money is then transferred
into

02:56:39.110 --> 02:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
into
 
02:56:41.030 --> 02:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
into risk and benefits in our budget and
 
02:56:43.190 --> 02:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
you'll see that if you were in division
 
02:56:44.790 --> 02:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
one you would see that in the retiree
 
02:56:45.910 --> 02:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
health line
 
02:56:47.830 --> 02:56:47.840 align:start position:0%
the generally funded agencies or
 
02:56:50.710 --> 02:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
population is budgeted as a lump sum
 
02:56:52.950 --> 02:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
general fund so the retiree health
 
02:56:57.190 --> 02:56:57.200 align:start position:0%
budget in which shows up in house bill 1
 
02:57:00.389 --> 02:57:00.399 align:start position:0%
in the in the das budget you'll see half
 
02:57:02.950 --> 02:57:02.960 align:start position:0%
of it is transfers from agencies
 
02:57:04.950 --> 02:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
via class 64
 
02:57:07.670 --> 02:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
and half of it is not quite is general
 
02:57:10.389 --> 02:57:10.399 align:start position:0%
funds and that's a lump sum
 
02:57:12.309 --> 02:57:12.319 align:start position:0%
general fund appropriation
 
02:57:14.150 --> 02:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
in that portion of our budget
 
02:57:17.190 --> 02:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
those of you who have been on group
 
02:57:19.349 --> 02:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
division one in the past will know that
 
02:57:21.510 --> 02:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
i start my presentation with
 
02:57:23.110 --> 02:57:23.120 align:start position:0%
a tale of two budgets we have two
 
02:57:24.870 --> 02:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
budgets one is our our divisional
 
02:57:26.070 --> 02:57:26.080 align:start position:0%
operating budget and the other is the
 
02:57:27.990 --> 02:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
retiree health budget
 
02:57:29.670 --> 02:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
which is a lot of money
 
02:57:29.680 --> 02:57:32.230 align:start position:0%
which is a lot of money
yeah

02:57:32.230 --> 02:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:34.550 --> 02:57:34.560 align:start position:0%
just some examples of agencies that are
 
02:57:36.790 --> 02:57:36.800 align:start position:0%
self-funded so we have liquor
 
02:57:36.800 --> 02:57:38.790 align:start position:0%
self-funded so we have liquor
transportation

02:57:38.790 --> 02:57:38.800 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
02:57:38.800 --> 02:57:40.230 align:start position:0%
transportation
safety

02:57:40.230 --> 02:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
safety
 
02:57:43.269 --> 02:57:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:45.910 --> 02:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
banking is in there insurance insurance
 
02:57:48.790 --> 02:57:48.800 align:start position:0%
is in there yeah
 
02:57:52.309 --> 02:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:53.750 --> 02:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
that's fine i just
 
02:57:56.150 --> 02:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
trying to when you say self-funded i'm
 
02:57:56.160 --> 02:57:57.590 align:start position:0%
trying to when you say self-funded i'm
going

02:57:57.590 --> 02:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
going
 
02:57:59.590 --> 02:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know of any agency that doesn't
 
02:58:01.990 --> 02:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
get something from the general fund
 
02:58:05.190 --> 02:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
maybe lottery and liquor but
 
02:58:06.070 --> 02:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
02:58:08.070 --> 02:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
it's a function of uh right of their
 
02:58:10.309 --> 02:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
employees and the the you know when this
 
02:58:12.309 --> 02:58:12.319 align:start position:0%
is a de minimis thing 20 or 30 years ago
 
02:58:15.510 --> 02:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't ever de minimis but um
 
02:58:17.510 --> 02:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
it didn't matter but at some point you
 
02:58:19.590 --> 02:58:19.600 align:start position:0%
know the the history of state budgeting
 
02:58:20.950 --> 02:58:20.960 align:start position:0%
if you look for
 
02:58:22.710 --> 02:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
probably forever but certainly for 20 or
 
02:58:23.910 --> 02:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
30 years
 
02:58:25.910 --> 02:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
is a question of how do we how do we
 
02:58:28.790 --> 02:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're capturing costs and
 
02:58:30.469 --> 02:58:30.479 align:start position:0%
the general fund and you if you think of
 
02:58:32.150 --> 02:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
things like things like sweatcap for
 
02:58:34.790 --> 02:58:34.800 align:start position:0%
example it's a it's a it's a way to get
 
02:58:37.670 --> 02:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
the non-general fund
 
02:58:40.469 --> 02:58:40.479 align:start position:0%
portions of the operation so to speak
 
02:58:42.230 --> 02:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
to pay the
 
02:58:45.670 --> 02:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh to pay their share of that function
 
02:58:47.190 --> 02:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
as opposed to it all being just like oh
 
02:58:49.269 --> 02:58:49.279 align:start position:0%
just stick that in a general fund and so
 
02:58:51.429 --> 02:58:51.439 align:start position:0%
with retirees it's like well who you
 
02:58:53.510 --> 02:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
know you retired from liquor therefore
 
02:58:55.670 --> 02:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
you're this you retired from admin
 
02:58:55.680 --> 02:58:56.870 align:start position:0%
you're this you retired from admin
services

02:58:56.870 --> 02:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
services
 
02:58:58.950 --> 02:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
um in one of our general funding pieces
 
02:59:04.150 --> 02:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:06.710 --> 02:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
on slide seven you'll see some uh
 
02:59:08.389 --> 02:59:08.399 align:start position:0%
history of the total health benefit
 
02:59:13.190 --> 02:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:15.349 --> 02:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
this is it's it's kind of a logical
 
02:59:17.110 --> 02:59:17.120 align:start position:0%
slide to look at where you can see that
 
02:59:18.950 --> 02:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
costs are going up over the years you
 
02:59:21.269 --> 02:59:21.279 align:start position:0%
can see a little bit of a blip between
 
02:59:23.590 --> 02:59:23.600 align:start position:0%
fy19 and fy20
 
02:59:23.600 --> 02:59:24.469 align:start position:0%
fy19 and fy20
um

02:59:24.469 --> 02:59:24.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:59:26.950 --> 02:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
i'd like to say it's 100 because we went
 
02:59:28.870 --> 02:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
to medicare advantage and saved all
 
02:59:30.230 --> 02:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
kinds of money but there was something
 
02:59:32.870 --> 02:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
else that happened in calendar year 2020
 
02:59:34.550 --> 02:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
that definitely impacted the cost of
 
02:59:36.309 --> 02:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
health care
 
02:59:36.319 --> 02:59:37.110 align:start position:0%
health care
so

02:59:37.110 --> 02:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:59:39.830 --> 02:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
we did see a decline in health care
 
02:59:42.790 --> 02:59:42.800 align:start position:0%
expenditures in during the covid times
 
02:59:45.429 --> 02:59:45.439 align:start position:0%
but you'll also see quickly after that
 
02:59:47.590 --> 02:59:47.600 align:start position:0%
that we've rebound we've rebounded so
 
02:59:51.750 --> 02:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:59.269 --> 02:59:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:02.870 --> 03:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
on slide eight we have an internal fund
 
03:00:06.150 --> 03:00:06.160 align:start position:0%
60 management team that meets every we
 
03:00:08.070 --> 03:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
we meet bi-monthly but we report to
 
03:00:10.230 --> 03:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
monthly on what our fund balances are
 
03:00:12.870 --> 03:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
and we use that as
 
03:00:15.269 --> 03:00:15.279 align:start position:0%
a management tool for looking at fund
 
03:00:16.870 --> 03:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
balances looking at where we're going
 
03:00:18.550 --> 03:00:18.560 align:start position:0%
for our budget these are our working
 
03:00:21.269 --> 03:00:21.279 align:start position:0%
rate budget rates
 
03:00:23.670 --> 03:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
we also have reported to fiscal in the
 
03:00:25.030 --> 03:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
not too
 
03:00:27.429 --> 03:00:27.439 align:start position:0%
distant history about doing premium
 
03:00:29.510 --> 03:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
holidays for certain populations and
 
03:00:31.670 --> 03:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
it's how we're managing our reserves
 
03:00:33.190 --> 03:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that we're giving that
 
03:00:34.790 --> 03:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
money back if the reserves are getting
 
03:00:36.070 --> 03:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
higher than thresholds that we've
 
03:00:36.080 --> 03:00:37.590 align:start position:0%
higher than thresholds that we've
determined

03:00:37.590 --> 03:00:37.600 align:start position:0%
determined
 
03:00:39.990 --> 03:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
like basically covet covid was slowing
 
03:00:42.230 --> 03:00:42.240 align:start position:0%
down cost expenditures so
 
03:00:44.550 --> 03:00:44.560 align:start position:0%
we don't want to allow those reserves to
 
03:00:46.550 --> 03:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
get too high
 
03:00:47.910 --> 03:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and as one of
 
03:00:50.550 --> 03:00:50.560 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of the retiree plan
 
03:00:52.309 --> 03:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
i'd like to thank you for the holiday we
 
03:00:53.830 --> 03:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
had this summer
 
03:00:55.030 --> 03:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
for premiums
 
03:00:57.349 --> 03:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
you're welcome there you go
 
03:01:00.389 --> 03:01:00.399 align:start position:0%
so you know about holidays
 
03:01:00.399 --> 03:01:01.830 align:start position:0%
so you know about holidays
excellent

03:01:01.830 --> 03:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
03:01:03.349 --> 03:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
we give the money back to where we got
 
03:01:03.359 --> 03:01:06.389 align:start position:0%
we give the money back to where we got
it

03:01:06.389 --> 03:01:06.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:08.230 --> 03:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
it's a notion it's something worth
 
03:01:11.510 --> 03:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
noting right is that um
 
03:01:13.030 --> 03:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
we're collecting we're collecting
 
03:01:14.550 --> 03:01:14.560 align:start position:0%
premiums we're collecting benefit
 
03:01:16.309 --> 03:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
charges from agencies into an internal
 
03:01:18.070 --> 03:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
service fund we're collecting money from
 
03:01:18.080 --> 03:01:19.510 align:start position:0%
service fund we're collecting money from
retirees

03:01:19.510 --> 03:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
retirees
 
03:01:21.670 --> 03:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
and we have a statutory responsibility
 
03:01:23.670 --> 03:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
and a moral responsibility obviously but
 
03:01:25.590 --> 03:01:25.600 align:start position:0%
to to not collect more than you're
 
03:01:26.790 --> 03:01:26.800 align:start position:0%
supposed to
 
03:01:28.230 --> 03:01:28.240 align:start position:0%
and if you collect more than you're
 
03:01:29.590 --> 03:01:29.600 align:start position:0%
supposed to
 
03:01:32.150 --> 03:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
you collected it as a health charge you
 
03:01:33.910 --> 03:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
can't then go out and spend it on a
 
03:01:35.190 --> 03:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
christmas tree
 
03:01:37.190 --> 03:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
and or something like that and and and
 
03:01:38.389 --> 03:01:38.399 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons for the
 
03:01:40.870 --> 03:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
holidays is for that reason that that
 
03:01:42.389 --> 03:01:42.399 align:start position:0%
this is money we've we had this
 
03:01:44.230 --> 03:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
discussion when senator d'allesandro
 
03:01:46.550 --> 03:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
usually asked asked would ask about it
 
03:01:48.550 --> 03:01:48.560 align:start position:0%
but um
 
03:01:51.190 --> 03:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
we can't legitimately
 
03:01:53.590 --> 03:01:53.600 align:start position:0%
and legally i think use that money for
 
03:01:55.110 --> 03:01:55.120 align:start position:0%
any other purpose
 
03:01:56.870 --> 03:01:56.880 align:start position:0%
like there would be no point where we
 
03:01:58.070 --> 03:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
looked at it and went you know we need
 
03:01:59.830 --> 03:01:59.840 align:start position:0%
to repave that why don't we just use
 
03:02:01.670 --> 03:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
that because we got extra
 
03:02:03.750 --> 03:02:03.760 align:start position:0%
we collected it as a as a as the
 
03:02:05.670 --> 03:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
equivalent of a healthcare premium it
 
03:02:07.910 --> 03:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
must be used for that and it's part of
 
03:02:09.510 --> 03:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
the reason that there's a there's a
 
03:02:09.520 --> 03:02:10.710 align:start position:0%
the reason that there's a there's a
management

03:02:10.710 --> 03:02:10.720 align:start position:0%
management
 
03:02:12.870 --> 03:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
team on the internal service fund and
 
03:02:14.790 --> 03:02:14.800 align:start position:0%
it's part of the reason that fiscal has
 
03:02:16.790 --> 03:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
historically wanted us reporting to them
 
03:02:19.670 --> 03:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
every two months is to say
 
03:02:21.349 --> 03:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
yeah what'd you collect
 
03:02:22.790 --> 03:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
did you use it
 
03:02:24.790 --> 03:02:24.800 align:start position:0%
what are you doing about that and it's
 
03:02:25.990 --> 03:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
and it's that i don't want to say
 
03:02:27.990 --> 03:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
they're skeptical but it's basically you
 
03:02:29.670 --> 03:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
know keep us informed about what's going
 
03:02:30.950 --> 03:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
on because uh
 
03:02:33.110 --> 03:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
rep representative emrick
 
03:02:37.429 --> 03:02:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:39.429 --> 03:02:39.439 align:start position:0%
do do you know what do you normally keep
 
03:02:42.230 --> 03:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
as a i'll call it a reserve
 
03:02:44.630 --> 03:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
for self for self funding because
 
03:02:46.870 --> 03:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
obviously you know the state is paying
 
03:02:49.030 --> 03:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
for that and you don't want to
 
03:02:51.030 --> 03:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
run out of money there but if you get
 
03:02:52.950 --> 03:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
extra in
 
03:02:54.550 --> 03:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
what's your buffer this is one of my
 
03:02:56.550 --> 03:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
favorite things um
 
03:02:59.190 --> 03:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
it's i'm sort of obsessed about it
 
03:02:59.200 --> 03:03:00.309 align:start position:0%
it's i'm sort of obsessed about it
um

03:03:00.309 --> 03:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:01.830 --> 03:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
we have there's a there are two kinds of
 
03:03:04.389 --> 03:03:04.399 align:start position:0%
reserve a statutory reserve and a and uh
 
03:03:06.790 --> 03:03:06.800 align:start position:0%
um and a cash balance reserve but
 
03:03:09.110 --> 03:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
they're both reserves so one is
 
03:03:11.269 --> 03:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
specified in statute as a percentage
 
03:03:13.190 --> 03:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
it's a slightly different percentage for
 
03:03:15.030 --> 03:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
retirees for
 
03:03:17.429 --> 03:03:17.439 align:start position:0%
the separate trooper group and for
 
03:03:19.429 --> 03:03:19.439 align:start position:0%
actives but it's three percent or five
 
03:03:21.110 --> 03:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
percent for for either one actually i
 
03:03:23.510 --> 03:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
think for for troopers it's 100
 
03:03:26.550 --> 03:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
in law it's three minimum of three it's
 
03:03:28.389 --> 03:03:28.399 align:start position:0%
what we've chosen and then we've chosen
 
03:03:29.830 --> 03:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
to set that because troopers are a very
 
03:03:31.510 --> 03:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
small group that are very volatile
 
03:03:33.349 --> 03:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
partly because they're small actives are
 
03:03:34.790 --> 03:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
a very large group we have less
 
03:03:37.269 --> 03:03:37.279 align:start position:0%
volatility one of the things we discuss
 
03:03:38.950 --> 03:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
often at the internal
 
03:03:42.550 --> 03:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
at the internal um governance meetings
 
03:03:45.110 --> 03:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
is how big should the reserve be we have
 
03:03:48.469 --> 03:03:48.479 align:start position:0%
targets which are currently set as a as
 
03:03:50.070 --> 03:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
a shorthand at
 
03:03:52.550 --> 03:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
at um two to three months of revenue
 
03:03:54.070 --> 03:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
two i'm sorry two to three months of
 
03:03:55.750 --> 03:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
expenditure how much do you want to have
 
03:03:57.510 --> 03:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
in reserve a couple to three months of
 
03:03:57.520 --> 03:03:58.710 align:start position:0%
in reserve a couple to three months of
expenditure

03:03:58.710 --> 03:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
expenditure
 
03:04:00.630 --> 03:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
one of the things that that that i look
 
03:04:03.349 --> 03:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
at in particular routinely is
 
03:04:04.630 --> 03:04:04.640 align:start position:0%
what's your high month what you're low
 
03:04:06.469 --> 03:04:06.479 align:start position:0%
month because months aren't aren't equal
 
03:04:08.389 --> 03:04:08.399 align:start position:0%
i mean generally we spend on a weekly
 
03:04:10.070 --> 03:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
basis rather than a monthly basis in
 
03:04:12.870 --> 03:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
terms of billing and administration so
 
03:04:14.070 --> 03:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
there's a four-week month and a
 
03:04:15.349 --> 03:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
five-week month
 
03:04:17.190 --> 03:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
but that the the delta between the
 
03:04:19.110 --> 03:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
highest month over the last two years
 
03:04:20.630 --> 03:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
and the lowest month over the last two
 
03:04:23.590 --> 03:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
years the the ratio between them is more
 
03:04:25.590 --> 03:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
than 100 percent that is you know
 
03:04:27.349 --> 03:04:27.359 align:start position:0%
something like 250
 
03:04:30.630 --> 03:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
612 000 and so what we want to guard
 
03:04:31.990 --> 03:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
against is
 
03:04:34.630 --> 03:04:34.640 align:start position:0%
we want to look at two things trend
 
03:04:36.469 --> 03:04:36.479 align:start position:0%
um you know and trend isn't just this
 
03:04:37.670 --> 03:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
month go up or down because there are
 
03:04:39.910 --> 03:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
all kinds of reasons for that um but the
 
03:04:41.990 --> 03:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
other thing is um
 
03:04:42.000 --> 03:04:43.510 align:start position:0%
other thing is um
um

03:04:43.510 --> 03:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:44.870 --> 03:04:44.880 align:start position:0%
are we getting to the point where the
 
03:04:47.429 --> 03:04:47.439 align:start position:0%
reserves are ticking down down down down
 
03:04:48.870 --> 03:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
and so we need to look at what's going
 
03:04:51.510 --> 03:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
on and be careful or up up up up in
 
03:04:53.670 --> 03:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
which case we need to plan a holiday
 
03:04:55.750 --> 03:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
reserves get too high we have a holiday
 
03:04:57.910 --> 03:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
reserves get reserves get too low we
 
03:04:59.349 --> 03:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
don't have holidays and we have to start
 
03:05:01.190 --> 03:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
thinking about things the last time we
 
03:05:03.510 --> 03:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
had a serious cash flow
 
03:05:03.520 --> 03:05:04.469 align:start position:0%
had a serious cash flow
threat

03:05:04.469 --> 03:05:04.479 align:start position:0%
threat
 
03:05:06.309 --> 03:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
maybe it was 2015
 
03:05:09.349 --> 03:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
and fiscal in in those years took action
 
03:05:11.429 --> 03:05:11.439 align:start position:0%
on things like on the retiree side in
 
03:05:14.150 --> 03:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
particular on things like um
 
03:05:15.670 --> 03:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
premium payment prescription drug
 
03:05:17.429 --> 03:05:17.439 align:start position:0%
payments and there was a lot of
 
03:05:19.830 --> 03:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
discussion about what we might do and
 
03:05:22.550 --> 03:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
then in 20 the 2017 past budget there
 
03:05:25.269 --> 03:05:25.279 align:start position:0%
was a a change to the retiree health
 
03:05:25.279 --> 03:05:27.349 align:start position:0%
was a a change to the retiree health
eligibility

03:05:27.349 --> 03:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
03:05:27.359 --> 03:05:29.590 align:start position:0%
eligibility
yes

03:05:29.590 --> 03:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:33.030 --> 03:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
so along those same lines on slide nine
 
03:05:33.040 --> 03:05:34.230 align:start position:0%
so along those same lines on slide nine
we

03:05:34.230 --> 03:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:05:37.990 --> 03:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
hold a term or a expression that former
 
03:05:41.750 --> 03:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner of das linda hodgston said
 
03:05:43.190 --> 03:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
how do you know how much the question
 
03:05:44.870 --> 03:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
was how do you know how much health how
 
03:05:46.070 --> 03:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
much money you need to pay for your
 
03:05:47.349 --> 03:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
health benefits and she said it's
 
03:05:49.910 --> 03:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
basically like landing a 747 on the head
 
03:05:51.349 --> 03:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
of a pin
 
03:05:53.830 --> 03:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
and it's a result of all the different
 
03:05:56.309 --> 03:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
variables that influence health care
 
03:05:59.269 --> 03:05:59.279 align:start position:0%
expenditures and the next slide on slide
 
03:06:01.910 --> 03:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
10 just goes over a few of those there
 
03:06:03.990 --> 03:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
are more than this but one of the key
 
03:06:07.030 --> 03:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
variables that we look at is enrollment
 
03:06:08.550 --> 03:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
enrollment going up
 
03:06:10.230 --> 03:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
um is it
 
03:06:12.150 --> 03:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
also the cost trends around that what
 
03:06:14.389 --> 03:06:14.399 align:start position:0%
are people spending their money on you
 
03:06:16.790 --> 03:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
can't predict who's going to get what
 
03:06:18.950 --> 03:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
diagnoses and who's going to need what
 
03:06:21.429 --> 03:06:21.439 align:start position:0%
for for care but you try to look at that
 
03:06:23.510 --> 03:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
over what you've been trending
 
03:06:25.510 --> 03:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
as well as claim mix inflation
 
03:06:27.590 --> 03:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
innovation there are drugs out there now
 
03:06:29.670 --> 03:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
that cost a lot of money
 
03:06:31.670 --> 03:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
but they're saving lives
 
03:06:33.349 --> 03:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
so we want that to be available for our
 
03:06:35.110 --> 03:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
members we rely on our third party
 
03:06:36.950 --> 03:06:36.960 align:start position:0%
administrators to help us manage those
 
03:06:39.750 --> 03:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
costs but there is that potential for
 
03:06:42.230 --> 03:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
those those types of expenses coming to
 
03:06:44.710 --> 03:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
the plan in addition to as you all know
 
03:06:47.269 --> 03:06:47.279 align:start position:0%
the the funding the the sources of those
 
03:06:49.030 --> 03:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
funds in the budget
 
03:06:51.910 --> 03:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
and also plan design looking at how our
 
03:06:53.590 --> 03:06:53.600 align:start position:0%
members are utilizing the plan what are
 
03:06:56.230 --> 03:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
they paying for that cost share um there
 
03:06:58.070 --> 03:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
is some change when you when you
 
03:07:00.230 --> 03:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
increase deductibles people start to
 
03:07:03.190 --> 03:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
weigh in that consumerism is introduced
 
03:07:05.190 --> 03:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
um and that's that's with everybody
 
03:07:07.269 --> 03:07:07.279 align:start position:0%
um and then at the bottom of page 10
 
03:07:09.590 --> 03:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
there's the on the right there's that
 
03:07:11.510 --> 03:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
bullet that says
 
03:07:13.750 --> 03:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
different incentives getting our members
 
03:07:15.990 --> 03:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
engaged in shopping for health care and
 
03:07:17.750 --> 03:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
looking for they're all high quality
 
03:07:19.910 --> 03:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
health care but the price variation
 
03:07:22.870 --> 03:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
amongst providers can be significant so
 
03:07:25.030 --> 03:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
can we incent their behavior to shop
 
03:07:26.790 --> 03:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
give them a little incentive and save
 
03:07:28.309 --> 03:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
the plan some money
 
03:07:29.830 --> 03:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
and that is something that we can do for
 
03:07:33.030 --> 03:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
only our active and our non-uh medicare
 
03:07:36.230 --> 03:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:39.110 --> 03:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
so we do provide some incentive or we
 
03:07:39.120 --> 03:07:40.150 align:start position:0%
so we do provide some incentive or we
don't

03:07:40.150 --> 03:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
don't
 
03:07:42.630 --> 03:07:42.640 align:start position:0%
we do for our active employees there's a
 
03:07:45.429 --> 03:07:45.439 align:start position:0%
program called smart shopper
 
03:07:47.429 --> 03:07:47.439 align:start position:0%
and if they shop first before they seek
 
03:07:49.110 --> 03:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
services and they actually go to one of
 
03:07:52.230 --> 03:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
those high quality lower cost providers
 
03:07:54.309 --> 03:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
they can receive a cash back incentive
 
03:07:55.590 --> 03:07:55.600 align:start position:0%
for doing that
 
03:07:57.429 --> 03:07:57.439 align:start position:0%
and the same for our non-medicare
 
03:07:59.750 --> 03:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
medicare does not allow any kind of
 
03:08:01.830 --> 03:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
steerage right and that's considered
 
03:08:03.590 --> 03:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
steerage so we're not permitted to do
 
03:08:04.870 --> 03:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
something like that for our medicare
 
03:08:06.389 --> 03:08:06.399 align:start position:0%
population okay
 
03:08:07.750 --> 03:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:08:10.309 --> 03:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
um so on slide 11
 
03:08:11.429 --> 03:08:11.439 align:start position:0%
the members enrolled in our health
 
03:08:12.950 --> 03:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
benefit plan if you're
 
03:08:14.389 --> 03:08:14.399 align:start position:0%
talking about belly buttons as i
 
03:08:16.469 --> 03:08:16.479 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier we're looking at about
 
03:08:19.670 --> 03:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
37 500 members on our health benefit
 
03:08:19.680 --> 03:08:20.469 align:start position:0%
37 500 members on our health benefit
plan

03:08:20.469 --> 03:08:20.479 align:start position:0%
plan
 
03:08:22.790 --> 03:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
and it's broken out by the actives we
 
03:08:24.710 --> 03:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
have about 23 000
 
03:08:26.870 --> 03:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
troopers 850
 
03:08:29.670 --> 03:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
excuse me 850 and then our retiree plan
 
03:08:31.349 --> 03:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
is split like we've been talking about
 
03:08:34.630 --> 03:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
so about 13 500
 
03:08:38.550 --> 03:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
2500 non-medicare and about 11 000
 
03:08:40.950 --> 03:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
medicare retirees the big difference
 
03:08:43.030 --> 03:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
between our active plan whether in our
 
03:08:45.510 --> 03:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
troopers plan is their plan design and
 
03:08:47.030 --> 03:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
everything about their health benefits
 
03:08:49.110 --> 03:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
is collectively bargained
 
03:08:51.990 --> 03:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
on the retiree plan side their benefits
 
03:08:54.230 --> 03:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
are determined by the legislature
 
03:08:55.590 --> 03:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
and and so there's that's a big
 
03:08:56.950 --> 03:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
difference between those two different
 
03:08:56.960 --> 03:09:00.230 align:start position:0%
difference between those two different
programs

03:09:00.230 --> 03:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:03.190 --> 03:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
are the other state employees is that
 
03:09:05.429 --> 03:09:05.439 align:start position:0%
part of the collective bargaining or
 
03:09:06.710 --> 03:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
do you just
 
03:09:09.110 --> 03:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
the state employees yeah so the state
 
03:09:10.230 --> 03:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
employees are you talking about all
 
03:09:11.990 --> 03:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
state employees i'm talking about the
 
03:09:15.190 --> 03:09:15.200 align:start position:0%
2300 members so the 2300 that's the
 
03:09:17.750 --> 03:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
members they're about 93
 
03:09:20.790 --> 03:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
100 state employees and yes they're all
 
03:09:22.469 --> 03:09:22.479 align:start position:0%
somehow connected to the collectively
 
03:09:24.630 --> 03:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
bargained planned design okay i can't
 
03:09:27.910 --> 03:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:29.990 --> 03:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
it's okay it's a lot of information to
 
03:09:33.349 --> 03:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:35.910 --> 03:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
on slide 12 i just did a deeper dive on
 
03:09:38.870 --> 03:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
retiree enrollment mainly because
 
03:09:38.880 --> 03:09:39.670 align:start position:0%
retiree enrollment mainly because
um

03:09:39.670 --> 03:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:41.510 --> 03:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
as charlie just said we've made changes
 
03:09:44.230 --> 03:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
over the past few years to how our
 
03:09:46.950 --> 03:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
retiree health benefits are designed to
 
03:09:49.349 --> 03:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
work on cost containment strategies but
 
03:09:51.429 --> 03:09:51.439 align:start position:0%
one thing we can't prevent is people
 
03:09:53.750 --> 03:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
getting older
 
03:09:55.590 --> 03:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
so that is happening and what you'll see
 
03:09:57.590 --> 03:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
on slide 12
 
03:10:00.469 --> 03:10:00.479 align:start position:0%
not no no so the top line that you can
 
03:10:02.230 --> 03:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
see going up that's our medicare
 
03:10:04.469 --> 03:10:04.479 align:start position:0%
population and you can see
 
03:10:08.790 --> 03:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
from 2013 to 2000 our projected 2025
 
03:10:11.349 --> 03:10:11.359 align:start position:0%
population were over 11 000 members
 
03:10:13.990 --> 03:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
there and then the bottom line
 
03:10:17.429 --> 03:10:17.439 align:start position:0%
is the non-medicare population and so
 
03:10:19.110 --> 03:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
one reason why that population is
 
03:10:20.710 --> 03:10:20.720 align:start position:0%
declining is because they're getting
 
03:10:21.910 --> 03:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
older and they're moving on to the
 
03:10:23.269 --> 03:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
medicare plan
 
03:10:25.110 --> 03:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
and the other reason is that we made
 
03:10:27.510 --> 03:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
some changes to our eligibility for the
 
03:10:29.750 --> 03:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
people who are eligible to retire before
 
03:10:32.710 --> 03:10:32.720 align:start position:0%
age 65 before they're medicare eligible
 
03:10:35.110 --> 03:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
so that's also part of it the other part
 
03:10:37.190 --> 03:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
of it is people are working longer
 
03:10:38.870 --> 03:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
so they're not retiring before they're
 
03:10:40.150 --> 03:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
medicare eligible they're actually in
 
03:10:42.389 --> 03:10:42.399 align:start position:0%
the workforce longer so there's a few
 
03:10:44.630 --> 03:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
competing demands that are it's pushing
 
03:10:47.429 --> 03:10:47.439 align:start position:0%
that medicare enrollment faster than and
 
03:10:48.630 --> 03:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
you'll see that decline on the
 
03:10:48.640 --> 03:10:50.309 align:start position:0%
you'll see that decline on the
non-medicare

03:10:50.309 --> 03:10:50.319 align:start position:0%
non-medicare
 
03:10:50.319 --> 03:10:53.590 align:start position:0%
non-medicare
so

03:10:53.590 --> 03:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:55.190 --> 03:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
i pay money
 
03:10:57.389 --> 03:10:57.399 align:start position:0%
every month for my
 
03:10:57.399 --> 03:10:58.950 align:start position:0%
every month for my
medicaid

03:10:58.950 --> 03:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
03:10:58.960 --> 03:11:01.910 align:start position:0%
medicaid
medicare

03:11:01.910 --> 03:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:04.150 --> 03:11:04.160 align:start position:0%
where does that go
 
03:11:06.710 --> 03:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
in for the medic
 
03:11:09.590 --> 03:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
medicaid retiree medicare are you uh are
 
03:11:11.269 --> 03:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
you a state retiree
 
03:11:11.279 --> 03:11:13.110 align:start position:0%
you a state retiree
no

03:11:13.110 --> 03:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:11:14.309 --> 03:11:14.319 align:start position:0%
so you're probably are you thinking
 
03:11:16.150 --> 03:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
about your medicare part b premium that
 
03:11:17.910 --> 03:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
you're paying that's coming out so
 
03:11:19.830 --> 03:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
that's going that's going through
 
03:11:20.950 --> 03:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
actually i think it's coming out of your
 
03:11:22.630 --> 03:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
social security check
 
03:11:24.230 --> 03:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
so the the federal government is taking
 
03:11:24.240 --> 03:11:25.830 align:start position:0%
so the the federal government is taking
that

03:11:25.830 --> 03:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:11:27.510 --> 03:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
that's not coming to us we're not
 
03:11:29.510 --> 03:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
getting what you're paying out of your
 
03:11:31.510 --> 03:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
social security check is not coming no
 
03:11:34.150 --> 03:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
but i'm talking about the retirees
 
03:11:36.870 --> 03:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
the medicare retirees so our medicare
 
03:11:39.590 --> 03:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
retirees are also paying a medicare part
 
03:11:42.150 --> 03:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
b premium and it's the same thing so
 
03:11:44.469 --> 03:11:44.479 align:start position:0%
we're not collecting okay so that goes
 
03:11:45.990 --> 03:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
to the federal government yes it does
 
03:11:49.190 --> 03:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
and then that must be part of the
 
03:11:51.910 --> 03:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
federal reimbursement
 
03:11:55.910 --> 03:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:00.150 --> 03:12:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:01.429 --> 03:12:01.439 align:start position:0%
so our
 
03:12:04.469 --> 03:12:04.479 align:start position:0%
medicare eligible retirees are paying
 
03:12:06.389 --> 03:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
they're paying two things they're paying
 
03:12:06.399 --> 03:12:07.429 align:start position:0%
they're paying two things they're paying
a

03:12:07.429 --> 03:12:07.439 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:12:09.269 --> 03:12:09.279 align:start position:0%
medicare part b
 
03:12:10.630 --> 03:12:10.640 align:start position:0%
premium that's coming out of their
 
03:12:12.630 --> 03:12:12.640 align:start position:0%
social security check and that's going
 
03:12:14.710 --> 03:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
that way and they're also paying a
 
03:12:17.190 --> 03:12:17.200 align:start position:0%
premium that's coming to us that gives
 
03:12:19.190 --> 03:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
us gives them access to our group health
 
03:12:19.200 --> 03:12:20.389 align:start position:0%
us gives them access to our group health
benefits

03:12:20.389 --> 03:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
03:12:22.469 --> 03:12:22.479 align:start position:0%
that's the and you'll actually see that
 
03:12:24.070 --> 03:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
in a few slides of what they're paying
 
03:12:26.389 --> 03:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
but it's roughly about twenty dollars
 
03:12:28.389 --> 03:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
per member per month that they're paying
 
03:12:30.550 --> 03:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
that's coming to us
 
03:12:32.469 --> 03:12:32.479 align:start position:0%
in exchange for that 20
 
03:12:34.710 --> 03:12:34.720 align:start position:0%
the cost of health care so our medicare
 
03:12:36.870 --> 03:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
retirees are responsible to pay a
 
03:12:39.750 --> 03:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
medicare part b deductible
 
03:12:42.230 --> 03:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
and that's this year it's like 203
 
03:12:44.790 --> 03:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
dollars so once they've met that out of
 
03:12:47.510 --> 03:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
pocket they're getting
 
03:12:49.830 --> 03:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
their coverage through the medicare part
 
03:12:52.309 --> 03:12:52.319 align:start position:0%
c program let's leave pharmacy aside for
 
03:12:54.150 --> 03:12:54.160 align:start position:0%
a moment they're getting their medical
 
03:12:57.190 --> 03:12:57.200 align:start position:0%
benefits through the aetna plan aetna
 
03:12:57.200 --> 03:12:58.070 align:start position:0%
benefits through the aetna plan aetna
then

03:12:58.070 --> 03:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:13:00.070 --> 03:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
is the one who's submitting the bill to
 
03:13:02.469 --> 03:13:02.479 align:start position:0%
the federal government that's it so our
 
03:13:05.190 --> 03:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
retirees go to the doctor they give
 
03:13:07.750 --> 03:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
their medicare advantage etna card to
 
03:13:08.950 --> 03:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
their doctor
 
03:13:11.429 --> 03:13:11.439 align:start position:0%
and the doctor in exchange invoices or
 
03:13:14.950 --> 03:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
bills aetna and then aetna handles okay
 
03:13:18.070 --> 03:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
this is a part a or part b you know a is
 
03:13:19.670 --> 03:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
your hospital-based charges or your
 
03:13:22.389 --> 03:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
inpatient charges and part b is your
 
03:13:24.469 --> 03:13:24.479 align:start position:0%
outpatient type of services aetna
 
03:13:26.070 --> 03:13:26.080 align:start position:0%
handles all of that
 
03:13:28.710 --> 03:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
so in this world medicare part a plus
 
03:13:32.070 --> 03:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
medicare part b equals medicare part c
 
03:13:34.150 --> 03:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense and aetna takes care
 
03:13:36.469 --> 03:13:36.479 align:start position:0%
of that for our members
 
03:13:38.469 --> 03:13:38.479 align:start position:0%
on the medicare part d
 
03:13:41.590 --> 03:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
as you know as in dog drug
 
03:13:41.600 --> 03:13:42.630 align:start position:0%
as you know as in dog drug
they

03:13:42.630 --> 03:13:42.640 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:13:44.950 --> 03:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
are our members use their
 
03:13:46.630 --> 03:13:46.640 align:start position:0%
express scripts
 
03:13:48.870 --> 03:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
id card when they go to the pharmacy
 
03:13:49.990 --> 03:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:13:51.590 --> 03:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
express scripts turns around and they
 
03:13:53.590 --> 03:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
actually invoice us for the cost of that
 
03:13:55.750 --> 03:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
drug and we pay for that but in exchange
 
03:13:57.830 --> 03:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
our retirees pay a co-pay and that
 
03:14:00.150 --> 03:14:00.160 align:start position:0%
depends on whether or not it's a generic
 
03:14:02.389 --> 03:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
a preferred or non-preferred i included
 
03:14:04.070 --> 03:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
some more of that information if you
 
03:14:05.510 --> 03:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
really want to dig deeper in the
 
03:14:05.520 --> 03:14:06.790 align:start position:0%
really want to dig deeper in the
appendix

03:14:06.790 --> 03:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
appendix
 
03:14:08.389 --> 03:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
i just didn't want to get that granular
 
03:14:09.429 --> 03:14:09.439 align:start position:0%
because i know
 
03:14:11.670 --> 03:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
it can get really weedy but there is an
 
03:14:13.349 --> 03:14:13.359 align:start position:0%
appendix that gets a little bit into
 
03:14:14.950 --> 03:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
like what's the co-pay structure and
 
03:14:14.960 --> 03:14:17.269 align:start position:0%
like what's the co-pay structure and
whatnot

03:14:17.269 --> 03:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
whatnot
 
03:14:19.269 --> 03:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
did that answer your question
 
03:14:21.110 --> 03:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
okay perfect
 
03:14:23.349 --> 03:14:23.359 align:start position:0%
on slide 13
 
03:14:24.790 --> 03:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
just more about how we're trying to
 
03:14:28.630 --> 03:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
maximize our federal funding so in 2015
 
03:14:31.269 --> 03:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
we moved to that employer group waiver
 
03:14:33.030 --> 03:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
program that i was referring to as an
 
03:14:35.590 --> 03:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
egg whip plan for our prescription drug
 
03:14:37.590 --> 03:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
prior to that we had a program called
 
03:14:40.550 --> 03:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
rds which stands for retiree drug
 
03:14:43.910 --> 03:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
subsidy so the state was still receiving
 
03:14:45.830 --> 03:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
subsidies from the federal government
 
03:14:47.510 --> 03:14:47.520 align:start position:0%
but through working with siegel we were
 
03:14:49.190 --> 03:14:49.200 align:start position:0%
able to determine that we could increase
 
03:14:51.349 --> 03:14:51.359 align:start position:0%
our federal subsidy by moving to that
 
03:14:53.510 --> 03:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
employer group waiver program
 
03:14:55.750 --> 03:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
through express scripts so we made that
 
03:14:58.790 --> 03:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
change in 2015 and have increased that
 
03:15:01.590 --> 03:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
that revenue source to our plan
 
03:15:04.229 --> 03:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
um in 2019 i know i already covered this
 
03:15:06.469 --> 03:15:06.479 align:start position:0%
just to recap really quick
 
03:15:08.950 --> 03:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
we actually did an amendment to our
 
03:15:13.110 --> 03:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
anthem medical tpa contract to carve out
 
03:15:15.030 --> 03:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
our medicare population and put them
 
03:15:17.110 --> 03:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
into the fully insured
 
03:15:18.870 --> 03:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
anthem program
 
03:15:20.790 --> 03:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
in 2019
 
03:15:22.790 --> 03:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
and the premium that they were
 
03:15:25.429 --> 03:15:25.439 align:start position:0%
paying just for that anthem program was
 
03:15:28.229 --> 03:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
about 109 11 per month
 
03:15:30.150 --> 03:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
i say about and i am giving you down to
 
03:15:31.830 --> 03:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
the penny
 
03:15:34.389 --> 03:15:34.399 align:start position:0%
it's burned in my brain
 
03:15:37.269 --> 03:15:37.279 align:start position:0%
and then that was the same for 2020 but
 
03:15:39.750 --> 03:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
then we went out to bid
 
03:15:41.670 --> 03:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
procurement as you know is a strategy to
 
03:15:43.110 --> 03:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
look for
 
03:15:44.950 --> 03:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
cost saving strategies and cost
 
03:15:47.990 --> 03:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
containment strategies in 2021 that's
 
03:15:50.229 --> 03:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
when we were able to
 
03:15:52.389 --> 03:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
lock down that zero per member per month
 
03:15:52.399 --> 03:15:53.510 align:start position:0%
lock down that zero per member per month
premium

03:15:53.510 --> 03:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
premium
 
03:15:54.790 --> 03:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
for aetnas
 
03:15:57.190 --> 03:15:57.200 align:start position:0%
access to the adna program and that like
 
03:15:59.269 --> 03:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
i said is a three-year contract and
 
03:16:01.110 --> 03:16:01.120 align:start position:0%
we're estimating about 15 million
 
03:16:04.710 --> 03:16:04.720 align:start position:0%
dollars in savings per year for 2020 21
 
03:16:07.510 --> 03:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:08.950 --> 03:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
also we're looking at improvements we
 
03:16:10.950 --> 03:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
have we have a question i thought i just
 
03:16:13.110 --> 03:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
heard you say that that the retirees
 
03:16:14.309 --> 03:16:14.319 align:start position:0%
were paying
 
03:16:16.550 --> 03:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
20 a month
 
03:16:18.870 --> 03:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
so remember so the retiree that's the
 
03:16:20.870 --> 03:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
working rate and i'll show you that too
 
03:16:22.389 --> 03:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
so you'll see those numbers break out
 
03:16:24.150 --> 03:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
but that's the total cost of their
 
03:16:26.309 --> 03:16:26.319 align:start position:0%
premium which includes pharmacy
 
03:16:27.990 --> 03:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
okay so actually what they're doing is
 
03:16:28.000 --> 03:16:29.030 align:start position:0%
okay so actually what they're doing is
they're

03:16:29.030 --> 03:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
they're
 
03:16:30.630 --> 03:16:30.640 align:start position:0%
the the zero
 
03:16:32.469 --> 03:16:32.479 align:start position:0%
per person per month you're talking
 
03:16:34.389 --> 03:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
about is actually
 
03:16:36.950 --> 03:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
no deductible on health care
 
03:16:39.590 --> 03:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
or no premium on health care but twenty
 
03:16:39.600 --> 03:16:41.030 align:start position:0%
or no premium on health care but twenty
dollars

03:16:41.030 --> 03:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:16:42.950 --> 03:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
but okay but the other one is
 
03:16:42.960 --> 03:16:44.710 align:start position:0%
but okay but the other one is
self-funded

03:16:44.710 --> 03:16:44.720 align:start position:0%
self-funded
 
03:16:47.670 --> 03:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
so the 20 that they're paying
 
03:16:50.469 --> 03:16:50.479 align:start position:0%
is a so it's it's um like 200 a month is
 
03:16:52.469 --> 03:16:52.479 align:start position:0%
what the state pays to provide our
 
03:16:52.479 --> 03:16:54.150 align:start position:0%
what the state pays to provide our
retirees

03:16:54.150 --> 03:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
retirees
 
03:16:55.590 --> 03:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
the um
 
03:16:57.510 --> 03:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
access to those group health benefits so
 
03:16:58.950 --> 03:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
the aetna
 
03:17:00.550 --> 03:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
the express scripts
 
03:17:02.469 --> 03:17:02.479 align:start position:0%
and then that extra administrative cost
 
03:17:04.630 --> 03:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
for consulting and dis salary you know
 
03:17:06.070 --> 03:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
risk and benefits salaries and that sort
 
03:17:07.910 --> 03:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
of thing that's that's less than
 
03:17:09.990 --> 03:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
less than three percent that that's a
 
03:17:12.630 --> 03:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
small amount so
 
03:17:14.710 --> 03:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
you'll see that coming up on a slide so
 
03:17:16.070 --> 03:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
you can see the breakdown so we
 
03:17:18.150 --> 03:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
calculate that 10 percent which is in
 
03:17:20.550 --> 03:17:20.560 align:start position:0%
law so if you're a medicare retiree and
 
03:17:22.790 --> 03:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
your date of birth is on
 
03:17:26.229 --> 03:17:26.239 align:start position:0%
or after 1 1 of 1949
 
03:17:28.469 --> 03:17:28.479 align:start position:0%
you pay a 10
 
03:17:28.479 --> 03:17:29.990 align:start position:0%
you pay a 10
premium

03:17:29.990 --> 03:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
premium
 
03:17:32.229 --> 03:17:32.239 align:start position:0%
and that's 10 of the working rate which
 
03:17:34.229 --> 03:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
is roughly 200 so that's where they're
 
03:17:36.070 --> 03:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
paying the 20.
 
03:17:37.590 --> 03:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
and you'll see that again
 
03:17:38.830 --> 03:17:38.840 align:start position:0%
in a little
 
03:17:41.190 --> 03:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
bit um just the other thing like i said
 
03:17:43.670 --> 03:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
before is we look at procurement as a
 
03:17:46.150 --> 03:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
mechanism to save to find more ways of
 
03:17:48.070 --> 03:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
saving money for the state
 
03:17:50.389 --> 03:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
um we had a contract we have a contract
 
03:17:52.950 --> 03:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
with anthem through 2022
 
03:17:54.710 --> 03:17:54.720 align:start position:0%
and we just renewed with express scripts
 
03:17:56.309 --> 03:17:56.319 align:start position:0%
and we're able to attain about a five
 
03:17:58.229 --> 03:17:58.239 align:start position:0%
percent savings for the state just by
 
03:18:00.229 --> 03:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
doing that procurement
 
03:18:01.830 --> 03:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
that's good
 
03:18:03.349 --> 03:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
yes please
 
03:18:06.070 --> 03:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
the when you said that the costs to the
 
03:18:08.710 --> 03:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
state i think you said for the aetna was
 
03:18:10.870 --> 03:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
like 200 a month
 
03:18:12.389 --> 03:18:12.399 align:start position:0%
and that's where the 20
 
03:18:13.349 --> 03:18:13.359 align:start position:0%
that the
 
03:18:15.910 --> 03:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
that the employee pays
 
03:18:18.150 --> 03:18:18.160 align:start position:0%
is that did i understand that correctly
 
03:18:20.469 --> 03:18:20.479 align:start position:0%
i mean roughly that that's correct
 
03:18:22.309 --> 03:18:22.319 align:start position:0%
so let's skip to slide 16 because i
 
03:18:23.830 --> 03:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
think if you can see the numbers it it
 
03:18:27.349 --> 03:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:29.590 --> 03:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
so over the years um
 
03:18:31.110 --> 03:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
you can it should say at the top
 
03:18:33.030 --> 03:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
medicare monthly premium contribution
 
03:18:33.040 --> 03:18:34.790 align:start position:0%
medicare monthly premium contribution
history

03:18:34.790 --> 03:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
history
 
03:18:36.630 --> 03:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the bottom there as
 
03:18:42.389 --> 03:18:42.399 align:start position:0%
of 1 1 of 2022 you see 204.87
 
03:18:44.229 --> 03:18:44.239 align:start position:0%
that's what we call our total working
 
03:18:46.550 --> 03:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
rate that's what per
 
03:18:49.510 --> 03:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
member so each retiree on medicare and
 
03:18:51.750 --> 03:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
or their spouse because the spouses are
 
03:18:53.510 --> 03:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
also can be on medicare
 
03:18:56.469 --> 03:18:56.479 align:start position:0%
they that's what it costs us per member
 
03:18:58.710 --> 03:18:58.720 align:start position:0%
to be on our plan for both
 
03:19:00.950 --> 03:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
scripture for the total working rate
 
03:19:03.990 --> 03:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
includes both aetna which remembers zero
 
03:19:06.150 --> 03:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
and express scripts which is roughly
 
03:19:07.750 --> 03:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
about twenty dollars
 
03:19:09.429 --> 03:19:09.439 align:start position:0%
or two hundred and four dollars excuse
 
03:19:12.070 --> 03:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
me that which also includes the das
 
03:19:12.080 --> 03:19:13.590 align:start position:0%
me that which also includes the das
administrative

03:19:13.590 --> 03:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
03:19:16.469 --> 03:19:16.479 align:start position:0%
small margin to add to that right so you
 
03:19:18.870 --> 03:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
know my mic no i i i guess i understand
 
03:19:20.389 --> 03:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
that i guess my my question just to make
 
03:19:22.309 --> 03:19:22.319 align:start position:0%
sure i'm understanding so
 
03:19:24.469 --> 03:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
that strikes me as a really
 
03:19:26.630 --> 03:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
the 204 87
 
03:19:29.510 --> 03:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
strikes me as a really small amount of
 
03:19:29.520 --> 03:19:30.550 align:start position:0%
strikes me as a really small amount of
money

03:19:30.550 --> 03:19:30.560 align:start position:0%
money
 
03:19:32.070 --> 03:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
which which leads me to believe that
 
03:19:35.429 --> 03:19:35.439 align:start position:0%
most of the most of
 
03:19:37.830 --> 03:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
most of how aetna is being compensated
 
03:19:37.840 --> 03:19:38.630 align:start position:0%
most of how aetna is being compensated
for

03:19:38.630 --> 03:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:19:41.110 --> 03:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
for for being the insurer is they're
 
03:19:43.910 --> 03:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
getting paid by the feds from our
 
03:19:46.389 --> 03:19:46.399 align:start position:0%
medicare premiums which are a lot more
 
03:19:48.550 --> 03:19:48.560 align:start position:0%
than twenty dollars a month so they're
 
03:19:50.790 --> 03:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
they're also getting paid by the fed so
 
03:19:52.469 --> 03:19:52.479 align:start position:0%
when you look at a medicare advantage
 
03:19:54.870 --> 03:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
program they're getting paid by
 
03:19:57.030 --> 03:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
the federal government to keep that care
 
03:19:58.550 --> 03:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
at a certain level
 
03:20:00.710 --> 03:20:00.720 align:start position:0%
so they're they're managing their care
 
03:20:03.910 --> 03:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
and then they get what is referred to as
 
03:20:03.920 --> 03:20:04.870 align:start position:0%
and then they get what is referred to as
um

03:20:04.870 --> 03:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:07.429 --> 03:20:07.439 align:start position:0%
well they get a risk score so the the
 
03:20:09.190 --> 03:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
if they're managing their population
 
03:20:11.510 --> 03:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
they get a rate by how i'm going to say
 
03:20:13.269 --> 03:20:13.279 align:start position:0%
how sick their population is and it
 
03:20:14.550 --> 03:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
increases the amount of money the
 
03:20:16.389 --> 03:20:16.399 align:start position:0%
federal government pays them
 
03:20:17.990 --> 03:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
but they also if they can keep those
 
03:20:21.510 --> 03:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
people healthier they keep that money so
 
03:20:24.309 --> 03:20:24.319 align:start position:0%
by them inheriting our population that
 
03:20:26.229 --> 03:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
roughly what did i say like 11 000
 
03:20:27.990 --> 03:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
people and they can manage that in their
 
03:20:29.990 --> 03:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
bigger book of business because that is
 
03:20:30.000 --> 03:20:31.110 align:start position:0%
bigger book of business because that is
big

03:20:31.110 --> 03:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
big
 
03:20:33.429 --> 03:20:33.439 align:start position:0%
so it's not just us but they also got a
 
03:20:35.510 --> 03:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
lion's share of a large population in
 
03:20:37.190 --> 03:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire so if you're
 
03:20:38.790 --> 03:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
coming into a market and you want to
 
03:20:40.710 --> 03:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
start taking over a business in new
 
03:20:42.389 --> 03:20:42.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire as a medicare advantage
 
03:20:44.710 --> 03:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
program if you can take on the state as
 
03:20:46.389 --> 03:20:46.399 align:start position:0%
your client
 
03:20:48.070 --> 03:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
it's worth the zero premium that they're
 
03:20:50.870 --> 03:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
charging us so we're leveraging that
 
03:20:53.990 --> 03:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:56.550 --> 03:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
yeah but the big picture they get money
 
03:20:58.070 --> 03:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
from the state only in this case they
 
03:21:00.229 --> 03:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
don't and they get money from the feds
 
03:21:01.590 --> 03:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
and the and they got to cover their
 
03:21:04.630 --> 03:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
costs with those and edna just said yeah
 
03:21:06.630 --> 03:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
we can make enough off the feds so we're
 
03:21:06.640 --> 03:21:08.229 align:start position:0%
we can make enough off the feds so we're
good

03:21:08.229 --> 03:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
good
 
03:21:10.309 --> 03:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
and and by the way they probably thought
 
03:21:12.550 --> 03:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
that at zero they would win the bid
 
03:21:14.950 --> 03:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
and they were right
 
03:21:17.110 --> 03:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
so basically this is this is the cost of
 
03:21:19.349 --> 03:21:19.359 align:start position:0%
the supplemental insurance
 
03:21:21.990 --> 03:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
for retirees on medicare
 
03:21:24.389 --> 03:21:24.399 align:start position:0%
um i i don't like to use that word
 
03:21:27.190 --> 03:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
because that's a different thing no but
 
03:21:30.150 --> 03:21:30.160 align:start position:0%
in in a dumb person's conceptualization
 
03:21:33.030 --> 03:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
there's a gap between what medicare pays
 
03:21:34.710 --> 03:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
and what i have to pay
 
03:21:37.990 --> 03:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
and this is basically covering that
 
03:21:40.229 --> 03:21:40.239 align:start position:0%
this is basically paying for your i'll
 
03:21:41.910 --> 03:21:41.920 align:start position:0%
say it this way your prescription drug
 
03:21:43.910 --> 03:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
benefit i feel better if you walk away
 
03:21:45.830 --> 03:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
with that than saying it's paying for a
 
03:21:47.670 --> 03:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
supplemental plan because there is
 
03:21:49.590 --> 03:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
something called a medicare supplemental
 
03:21:51.750 --> 03:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
plan and we no longer have that we used
 
03:21:54.550 --> 03:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
to but we don't have that anymore i i
 
03:21:57.670 --> 03:21:57.680 align:start position:0%
fine i don't want to get up in the words
 
03:21:59.349 --> 03:21:59.359 align:start position:0%
i know senator daniels knows exactly
 
03:22:01.750 --> 03:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
what i mean i clarify that with a
 
03:22:04.309 --> 03:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
medicare advantage plan medicare does
 
03:22:07.110 --> 03:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
not pay any of the claims
 
03:22:10.150 --> 03:22:10.160 align:start position:0%
they give a subsidy to private companies
 
03:22:14.150 --> 03:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
like aetna humana anthem
 
03:22:16.229 --> 03:22:16.239 align:start position:0%
places like that so your insurance is
 
03:22:18.150 --> 03:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
through a private
 
03:22:21.190 --> 03:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
private company which as she pointed out
 
03:22:24.150 --> 03:22:24.160 align:start position:0%
is is different than a supplement which
 
03:22:27.349 --> 03:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
medicare pays say 80 percent of it and
 
03:22:29.750 --> 03:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
then a supplement picks up the other 20
 
03:22:32.469 --> 03:22:32.479 align:start position:0%
so it's a whole new structure but you do
 
03:22:35.269 --> 03:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
have to pay that uh part b premium of
 
03:22:38.790 --> 03:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
200 uh 233 dollars in order to be
 
03:22:38.800 --> 03:22:39.990 align:start position:0%
200 uh 233 dollars in order to be
eligible

03:22:39.990 --> 03:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
03:22:42.229 --> 03:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
to get a medicare advantage plan
 
03:22:44.309 --> 03:22:44.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:22:45.429 --> 03:22:45.439 align:start position:0%
he does this
 
03:22:46.389 --> 03:22:46.399 align:start position:0%
i know
 
03:22:51.269 --> 03:22:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:52.870 --> 03:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
so i'm just going to go back we just
 
03:22:55.110 --> 03:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
quickly glazed over um i think we're
 
03:22:57.510 --> 03:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
done this slide 13 at the bottom there
 
03:22:59.429 --> 03:22:59.439 align:start position:0%
just says we made some changes to plan
 
03:23:02.469 --> 03:23:02.479 align:start position:0%
design and then slide 14 i'm often asked
 
03:23:04.950 --> 03:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
this of like what did we do on the
 
03:23:07.910 --> 03:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
eligibility side of how do you get into
 
03:23:10.630 --> 03:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
retiree health benefits and you can see
 
03:23:12.950 --> 03:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
it's on slide 14 it's divided by group
 
03:23:14.710 --> 03:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
one and group two
 
03:23:16.229 --> 03:23:16.239 align:start position:0%
um and then you can see the changes that
 
03:23:18.229 --> 03:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
were made so prior to july
 
03:23:20.469 --> 03:23:20.479 align:start position:0%
1st of 2003
 
03:23:20.479 --> 03:23:22.150 align:start position:0%
1st of 2003
um

03:23:22.150 --> 03:23:22.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:23.750 --> 03:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
there was a different benefit but as of
 
03:23:26.229 --> 03:23:26.239 align:start position:0%
that day we required 10 years of service
 
03:23:28.469 --> 03:23:28.479 align:start position:0%
and a minimum age of 60 unless you had
 
03:23:30.309 --> 03:23:30.319 align:start position:0%
over 30 years of service and then you
 
03:23:32.229 --> 03:23:32.239 align:start position:0%
can see the next change that was made
 
03:23:34.790 --> 03:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
and these changes are being made in law
 
03:23:38.790 --> 03:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
um on or after july 1 of 2003 but before
 
03:23:40.790 --> 03:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
july 1 of 11
 
03:23:42.950 --> 03:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
the service requirement increased to 20
 
03:23:45.190 --> 03:23:45.200 align:start position:0%
years i'm looking at the group one
 
03:23:47.349 --> 03:23:47.359 align:start position:0%
box on the top and it's still the same
 
03:23:49.190 --> 03:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
minimum age requirement
 
03:23:51.429 --> 03:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
and then as you can see on or after july
 
03:23:54.710 --> 03:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
1 of 2011 it's still 20 years but that's
 
03:23:57.910 --> 03:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
the we changed the entry point to being
 
03:24:00.070 --> 03:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
age 65 and that's where you're seeing
 
03:24:01.990 --> 03:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
that decline on the non-medicare side
 
03:24:03.910 --> 03:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
because people are on that
 
03:24:05.910 --> 03:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
eligibility for medicare side of the
 
03:24:05.920 --> 03:24:06.950 align:start position:0%
eligibility for medicare side of the
coin

03:24:06.950 --> 03:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
coin
 
03:24:09.190 --> 03:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
and it's similar to group two i won't
 
03:24:10.550 --> 03:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
read that unless you would like me to go
 
03:24:14.389 --> 03:24:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:16.870 --> 03:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
and then on slide 15 you can see the
 
03:24:16.880 --> 03:24:18.150 align:start position:0%
and then on slide 15 you can see the
changes

03:24:18.150 --> 03:24:18.160 align:start position:0%
changes
 
03:24:20.150 --> 03:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
that we've made in the non-medicare
 
03:24:22.550 --> 03:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
premium over the years so starting in
 
03:24:25.830 --> 03:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
july of 2009 that's when our retirees
 
03:24:27.990 --> 03:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
started paying a premium it was a flat
 
03:24:30.550 --> 03:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
dollar sixty five dollar per month
 
03:24:33.910 --> 03:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
fee to be on our non-medicare retiree
 
03:24:35.110 --> 03:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
health plan
 
03:24:37.910 --> 03:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
and then as the years went on um you can
 
03:24:42.070 --> 03:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
see in january of 2016 we actually um
 
03:24:44.389 --> 03:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee actually increased the
 
03:24:46.550 --> 03:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
premium contribution
 
03:24:48.710 --> 03:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
from 12.5
 
03:24:51.110 --> 03:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
to 17.5
 
03:24:53.830 --> 03:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
and then prior to then after that um in
 
03:24:57.349 --> 03:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
october of 2017 i want to say charlie
 
03:24:58.950 --> 03:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
that was the trailer bill the big
 
03:25:01.349 --> 03:25:01.359 align:start position:0%
christmas tree bill included in that
 
03:25:03.429 --> 03:25:03.439 align:start position:0%
bill was the
 
03:25:06.150 --> 03:25:06.160 align:start position:0%
increase from 17 and a half percent to
 
03:25:06.160 --> 03:25:07.190 align:start position:0%
increase from 17 and a half percent to
20

03:25:07.190 --> 03:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
20
 
03:25:08.950 --> 03:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
and that's where we still are today for
 
03:25:13.830 --> 03:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:16.389 --> 03:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
i know we covered slide 16 but you can
 
03:25:20.630 --> 03:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
see so as of january 1 of 2018 this was
 
03:25:22.550 --> 03:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
actually included in that same
 
03:25:26.070 --> 03:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
bill that increased us to 20 for the
 
03:25:26.080 --> 03:25:27.670 align:start position:0%
bill that increased us to 20 for the
non-medicare

03:25:27.670 --> 03:25:27.680 align:start position:0%
non-medicare
 
03:25:30.550 --> 03:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
um for medicare you have to make changes
 
03:25:33.349 --> 03:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
on a calendar year basis if it's a i'm
 
03:25:34.950 --> 03:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
going to call it a negative change or a
 
03:25:37.030 --> 03:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
change that cost the retirees more on
 
03:25:40.070 --> 03:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
medicare so we had to postpone that
 
03:25:43.190 --> 03:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
change to january 1 of 2018
 
03:25:45.910 --> 03:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
so if you were a retiree and or your
 
03:25:47.990 --> 03:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
spouse with a date of birth on or after
 
03:25:50.389 --> 03:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
1 1 of 1949
 
03:25:52.469 --> 03:25:52.479 align:start position:0%
you're that's when we started having a
 
03:25:55.830 --> 03:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
charge to our retirees on medicare of 10
 
03:25:57.910 --> 03:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
and you can see through cost containment
 
03:26:00.830 --> 03:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
efforts that in 18 it started at
 
03:26:03.590 --> 03:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
36.24 cents per month
 
03:26:05.429 --> 03:26:05.439 align:start position:0%
and then you can see we were able to
 
03:26:07.750 --> 03:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
decrease that in 19 that's when we went
 
03:26:10.309 --> 03:26:10.319 align:start position:0%
remember to medicare advantage
 
03:26:12.550 --> 03:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
we kept it flat in 20
 
03:26:16.229 --> 03:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
in 21 it decreased again that's a result
 
03:26:18.229 --> 03:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
of the change changeover with the zero
 
03:26:21.349 --> 03:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
premium going to aetna in 2021 so our
 
03:26:23.750 --> 03:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
retirees paid 10 almost 10 dollars less
 
03:26:25.030 --> 03:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
per month
 
03:26:27.429 --> 03:26:27.439 align:start position:0%
at that point and then here we are in
 
03:26:30.070 --> 03:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
january of 2022
 
03:26:34.950 --> 03:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:34.960 --> 03:26:35.750 align:start position:0%
 
i

03:26:35.750 --> 03:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
i
 
03:26:38.630 --> 03:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
i just have to add because
 
03:26:40.550 --> 03:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
this is insane
 
03:26:42.229 --> 03:26:42.239 align:start position:0%
i'm going to just point this out this is
 
03:26:44.630 --> 03:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
ridiculous in terms of what happened
 
03:26:47.030 --> 03:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
it's not literally not possible i'd have
 
03:26:47.990 --> 03:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
told you
 
03:26:49.750 --> 03:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh costs are not going to go down from
 
03:26:52.389 --> 03:26:52.399 align:start position:0%
362. our goal is to make them go up
 
03:26:55.830 --> 03:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
slowly from 362. and they went down to
 
03:26:55.840 --> 03:26:57.269 align:start position:0%
slowly from 362. and they went down to
204

03:26:57.269 --> 03:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
204
 
03:27:00.309 --> 03:27:00.319 align:start position:0%
and and if you had showed me this after
 
03:27:03.030 --> 03:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
the fact and i hadn't lived through it i
 
03:27:04.790 --> 03:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
would tell you that somebody made it
 
03:27:07.590 --> 03:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
made an arithmetic error and was adding
 
03:27:10.229 --> 03:27:10.239 align:start position:0%
it up wrong and that that you know a lot
 
03:27:11.990 --> 03:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
of this is joyce and just to be honest
 
03:27:13.750 --> 03:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
i'm joyce and cassie keane or most of
 
03:27:15.830 --> 03:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
the committee knows and a lot of work
 
03:27:18.150 --> 03:27:18.160 align:start position:0%
over a lot of time but
 
03:27:20.710 --> 03:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
we our goal is to hit singles that's
 
03:27:23.030 --> 03:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
what we it's what we try to do every day
 
03:27:25.190 --> 03:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
and and they hit like four grand slams
 
03:27:27.030 --> 03:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
in a row and it's not going to keep
 
03:27:28.469 --> 03:27:28.479 align:start position:0%
happening because we're running out of
 
03:27:29.750 --> 03:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
rep there are only so many rabbits you
 
03:27:30.950 --> 03:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
can fit in a hat
 
03:27:33.110 --> 03:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
and she's pulled them all out i think
 
03:27:33.120 --> 03:27:34.150 align:start position:0%
and she's pulled them all out i think
but

03:27:34.150 --> 03:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:27:36.070 --> 03:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
it's worth noting that you know our
 
03:27:37.349 --> 03:27:37.359 align:start position:0%
trend looks
 
03:27:39.110 --> 03:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
like remarkable where you know
 
03:27:40.150 --> 03:27:40.160 align:start position:0%
healthcare and the rest of the country
 
03:27:42.309 --> 03:27:42.319 align:start position:0%
is going up 10 a year and we've gone
 
03:27:46.229 --> 03:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
down and we've cut it almost in half and
 
03:27:47.990 --> 03:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
you know we're done
 
03:27:49.190 --> 03:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
and but
 
03:27:51.269 --> 03:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
it's it's something that i highlight the
 
03:27:53.110 --> 03:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
slide because i'm really really really
 
03:27:54.550 --> 03:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
proud of it
 
03:27:55.830 --> 03:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
it's not me
 
03:27:57.910 --> 03:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
it's her and her team but i'm really
 
03:27:59.750 --> 03:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
proud of it and it and it's something
 
03:28:01.590 --> 03:28:01.600 align:start position:0%
that nobody in this committee you know
 
03:28:03.110 --> 03:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
named me the last program you had where
 
03:28:04.790 --> 03:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
somebody came in and went you know what
 
03:28:06.550 --> 03:28:06.560 align:start position:0%
i think we can give you a better benefit
 
03:28:08.389 --> 03:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
next year for half the price
 
03:28:10.150 --> 03:28:10.160 align:start position:0%
and that doesn't happen and it's not
 
03:28:13.510 --> 03:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
supposed to happen and it and it did so
 
03:28:15.349 --> 03:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
anyway that's me giving her a pen on the
 
03:28:15.359 --> 03:28:16.469 align:start position:0%
anyway that's me giving her a pen on the
back

03:28:16.469 --> 03:28:16.479 align:start position:0%
back
 
03:28:18.150 --> 03:28:18.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:28:21.030 --> 03:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
on the last slide on uh almost last
 
03:28:23.190 --> 03:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
night slide 17
 
03:28:25.030 --> 03:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
this was a question that i was regularly
 
03:28:27.510 --> 03:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
asked to report back to fiscal law on
 
03:28:30.309 --> 03:28:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:32.790 --> 03:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
we're charging a medicare population and
 
03:28:34.550 --> 03:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
it's only that date of birth that the
 
03:28:36.950 --> 03:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
line in the sand that we had to draw
 
03:28:38.630 --> 03:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
and the theory behind that and we work
 
03:28:40.309 --> 03:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
closely with the legislature to come up
 
03:28:43.349 --> 03:28:43.359 align:start position:0%
with that date it was not a randomly
 
03:28:45.269 --> 03:28:45.279 align:start position:0%
grabbed out of the hat kind of date to
 
03:28:47.590 --> 03:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
keep with the rabbit analogy
 
03:28:50.469 --> 03:28:50.479 align:start position:0%
but but it was very um
 
03:28:52.469 --> 03:28:52.479 align:start position:0%
how much could we get away with yeah or
 
03:28:54.150 --> 03:28:54.160 align:start position:0%
so how can we charge the least amount of
 
03:28:56.550 --> 03:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
people possible but in time you can see
 
03:28:58.710 --> 03:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
from fiscal 18
 
03:28:58.720 --> 03:28:59.990 align:start position:0%
from fiscal 18
to

03:28:59.990 --> 03:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:29:01.950 --> 03:29:01.960 align:start position:0%
to our projections for
 
03:29:04.309 --> 03:29:04.319 align:start position:0%
fy25 you can see that our medicare
 
03:29:06.150 --> 03:29:06.160 align:start position:0%
retirees are projected to continue to
 
03:29:06.160 --> 03:29:07.190 align:start position:0%
retirees are projected to continue to
increase

03:29:07.190 --> 03:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
increase
 
03:29:09.910 --> 03:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
but you can also see just through
 
03:29:13.510 --> 03:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
time alone that the people not paying
 
03:29:15.110 --> 03:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
is decreasing
 
03:29:17.349 --> 03:29:17.359 align:start position:0%
and the people paying
 
03:29:18.630 --> 03:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
is increasing
 
03:29:21.269 --> 03:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
so without moving the date of birth just
 
03:29:23.990 --> 03:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
over time it's more people are paying
 
03:29:27.030 --> 03:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
that's what that is meant to illustrate
 
03:29:28.550 --> 03:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
i used to always call this the ober
 
03:29:33.269 --> 03:29:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:35.030 --> 03:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
and then this is the last slide before
 
03:29:36.630 --> 03:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
the um
 
03:29:38.790 --> 03:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
appendix is just what we keep doing
 
03:29:39.990 --> 03:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to keep doing what we've
 
03:29:41.429 --> 03:29:41.439 align:start position:0%
been doing so we're going to keep
 
03:29:43.030 --> 03:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
managing our vendors we're going to keep
 
03:29:45.269 --> 03:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
looking for cost containment strategies
 
03:29:46.950 --> 03:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to keep going out to bid
 
03:29:48.309 --> 03:29:48.319 align:start position:0%
we're going to keep looking for more
 
03:29:49.990 --> 03:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
competitive pricing
 
03:29:52.070 --> 03:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
more creative funding rate arrangements
 
03:29:53.110 --> 03:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
trying to get
 
03:29:54.790 --> 03:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
increased federal subsidies where it's
 
03:29:56.950 --> 03:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
possible we are going to keep exploring
 
03:29:58.070 --> 03:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
what what does it mean with our
 
03:30:00.309 --> 03:30:00.319 align:start position:0%
prescription drug when do you flip it
 
03:30:02.389 --> 03:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
like those are things we ask every year
 
03:30:04.469 --> 03:30:04.479 align:start position:0%
and we we try to develop future
 
03:30:06.389 --> 03:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
strategies to do that
 
03:30:08.389 --> 03:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
we also work with our retirees and our
 
03:30:10.229 --> 03:30:10.239 align:start position:0%
active employees on how they're managing
 
03:30:11.910 --> 03:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
their individual health because if we
 
03:30:14.469 --> 03:30:14.479 align:start position:0%
can curb that utilization and keep those
 
03:30:16.389 --> 03:30:16.399 align:start position:0%
preventive visits on the rise get those
 
03:30:19.110 --> 03:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
diagnoses if needed earlier manage their
 
03:30:21.510 --> 03:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
health care manage the diabetes that's
 
03:30:22.950 --> 03:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
saving us money
 
03:30:24.870 --> 03:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
and then of course plan design those
 
03:30:26.950 --> 03:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
sorts of things looking at ways to
 
03:30:26.960 --> 03:30:28.309 align:start position:0%
sorts of things looking at ways to
incent

03:30:28.309 --> 03:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
incent
 
03:30:30.389 --> 03:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
cost-effective health care so we're
 
03:30:31.830 --> 03:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
going to keep doing that and analyzing
 
03:30:33.990 --> 03:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
the data and hopefully as charlie says
 
03:30:35.830 --> 03:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
there may be a small rabbit in there
 
03:30:37.750 --> 03:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
somewhere i just don't know i'm not
 
03:30:41.190 --> 03:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:43.269 --> 03:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
there's actually a little bunny in there
 
03:30:48.309 --> 03:30:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:49.670 --> 03:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
yes you may
 
03:30:51.990 --> 03:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
it's interesting that the medicare
 
03:30:54.309 --> 03:30:54.319 align:start position:0%
system is working against you
 
03:30:56.229 --> 03:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
because they require
 
03:30:59.429 --> 03:30:59.439 align:start position:0%
certain levels of care you have to have
 
03:31:01.510 --> 03:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
every six months you know my wife's a
 
03:31:03.349 --> 03:31:03.359 align:start position:0%
diabetic so she has to go see an
 
03:31:05.670 --> 03:31:05.680 align:start position:0%
endocrinologist every six months and if
 
03:31:08.070 --> 03:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
she doesn't he the prescriptions can't
 
03:31:09.190 --> 03:31:09.200 align:start position:0%
get filled
 
03:31:09.200 --> 03:31:09.990 align:start position:0%
get filled
so

03:31:09.990 --> 03:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:31:11.269 --> 03:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
you're going to be able to compress this
 
03:31:13.590 --> 03:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
to a point but at some point medicare is
 
03:31:15.750 --> 03:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
put pushing back on you
 
03:31:18.070 --> 03:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
with this every six month visit
