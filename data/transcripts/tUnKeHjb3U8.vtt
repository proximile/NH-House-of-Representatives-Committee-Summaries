representative folsom
 
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
i think there is
 
00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:11.919 align:start position:0%
three or four
 
00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
theoretically going to be here on
 
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
the democratic side
 
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
and we'll welcome them as they come
 
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
here comes the democratic
 
00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:27.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:32.629 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:34.639 align:start position:0%
you are the democratic party at the
 
00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:35.990 align:start position:0%
you are the democratic party at the
moment

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
moment
 
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
um i know
 
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
of at least four others okay good
 
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.749 align:start position:0%
of at least four others okay good
um

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:45.759 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
so the plan
 
00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
from my standpoint is to take a look at
 
00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
those bills that we have
 
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
scheduled on the calendar for work
 
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:55.749 align:start position:0%
scheduled on the calendar for work
session

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:55.759 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
cacr 24
 
00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.670 align:start position:0%
cacr 24
hb

00:06:59.670 --> 00:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
hb
 
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.189 align:start position:0%
hb
1033

00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
1033
 
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
hb 1102 hb 1170 and hb 1269
 
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:10.560 align:start position:0%
in no particular order um
 
00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
but i these are the ones that have been
 
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
we can reach a consensus
 
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
easily or enough with an amendment or
 
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
something along those lines but i would
 
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.029 align:start position:0%
 
then

00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
slip into executive session
 
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
as you'll see executive session on
 
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
pending legislation may be held
 
00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:42.639 align:start position:0%
throughout the day
 
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
from time to time the committee is
 
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:46.720 align:start position:0%
initially convened um
 
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
that is now um
 
00:07:51.749 --> 00:07:51.759 align:start position:0%
so we are capable
 
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
of bringing up any of the bills that we
 
00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
have held hearings on
 
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
and executing them
 
00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.110 align:start position:0%
and executing them
um

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
but we are scheduled now for the work
 
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:05.520 align:start position:0%

the members which
 
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
where where to jump into the work
 
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.950 align:start position:0%
where where to jump into the work
session

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
you have
 
00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
you have a time constraint so you may
 
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:24.950 align:start position:0%

representative silber
 
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
um i assume every that was handed out at
 
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
the hearing so i'm assuming everyone has
 
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
taken a look at that
 
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:19.760 align:start position:0%

our researcher
 
00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:26.160 align:start position:0%

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:48.230 --> 00:10:48.240 align:start position:0%

yesterday
 
00:11:29.350 --> 00:11:29.360 align:start position:0%
in the course of a conversation i heard
 
00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
that there was a problem with the
 
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
boilerplate language
 
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
on all the constitutional amendments
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh were you aware of that
 
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.230 align:start position:0%
uh were you aware of that
no

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:38.240 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.829 align:start position:0%

on all of the ones that we have
 
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
apparently all the constitutional
 
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
amendments written this year have the
 
00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
old boilerplate and not the new
 
00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.550 align:start position:0%
old boilerplate and not the new
boilerplate

00:11:50.550 --> 00:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
and what does that mean
 
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
i'm not a lawyer
 
00:11:54.720 --> 00:12:06.310 align:start position:0%

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:44.069 align:start position:0%
is there anything to this could you

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:49.350 align:start position:0%
help us a little good morning
representative

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chair members of the
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
committee uh just to answer your
 
00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.509 align:start position:0%
committee uh just to answer your
question

00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:53.519 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
several years ago
 
00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
statutory revisions were made with how
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment concurrent
 
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
resolutions are drafted
 
00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:04.959 align:start position:0%
basically what that means is that any
 
00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
amendment that is drafted is going to
 
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
need an amendment by the committee
 
00:13:13.509 --> 00:13:13.519 align:start position:0%
if it's going to be acted on positively
 
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
because essentially
 
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
you have to draft the language that's
 
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
going to be included in the um
 
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
the the the voters guide that's created
 
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
for voters so that that is that was a
 
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
reconstruction of statute about a decade
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
ago by then senator bragdon
 
00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
will you take a question or two if there
 
00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:39.839 align:start position:0%
are any certainly
 
00:13:39.839 --> 00:13:41.430 align:start position:0%
are any certainly
so

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any but here's my
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
question um
 
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
it sounds like this is not anything
 
00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
that's just new for this year this is
 
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
something that has been ongoing
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
that is correct sir every every time
 
00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
we've had a a constitutional amendment
 
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
over the last several years if if
 
00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
something is to pass the body it's going
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
to need an amendment created by the
 
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
committee to address the voter guide
 
00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.150 align:start position:0%
committee to address the voter guide
issue

00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
having to be voted on prior to it
 
00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
reaching the floor or is that something
 
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
that could be a floor amendment or
 
00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
i i suppose a floor amendment
 
00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
would handle that because again it would
 
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
have it would have the uh the action
 
00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.430 align:start position:0%
have it would have the uh the action
included

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
included
 
00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:24.550 align:start position:0%
included
okay

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.590 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:30.720 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire is that
 
00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
your understanding more or less yes
 
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
fortunately my committee only had one
 
00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
there is
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
on some of these however there are um
 
00:14:49.269 --> 00:14:49.279 align:start position:0%
there is verbiage that says what
 
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
what the
 
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
voter guide language would be is that
 
00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
sufficient or does that have to be
 
00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
changed i think that the the the
 
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
boilerplate as representative mcguire uh
 
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
alluded to uh is that it hasn't
 
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily been there however if
 
00:15:07.269 --> 00:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
sponsors of certain amendments have
 
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
gotten deep into the weeds to make sure
 
00:15:10.629 --> 00:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
it's included then
 
00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
then kudos to them
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
um one other question while i have you
 
00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
on the hot seat okay
 
00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
and and not necessarily with this cacr
 
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
but we have another one that could prove
 
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:15:28.389 --> 00:15:28.399 align:start position:0%
if if required to print out every
 
00:15:30.389 --> 00:15:30.399 align:start position:0%
possible change
 
00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:33.759 align:start position:0%
to something like the constitution
 
00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned in testimony by someone
 
00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.189 align:start position:0%
mentioned in testimony by someone
that

00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
the entire constitution
 
00:15:43.269 --> 00:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
would need to be in the voter guide
 
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
because you need to show the voters
 
00:15:47.189 --> 00:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
every single change
 
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
that is correct
 
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
correct yes
 
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
i wanted to clarify that
 
00:15:58.069 --> 00:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:59.749 --> 00:15:59.759 align:start position:0%
i think i concur
 
00:16:01.829 --> 00:16:01.839 align:start position:0%
um that would make the vote yes that
 
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
would make the voter guide
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
10 or 12 pages um just on that one
 
00:16:08.629 --> 00:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
question i would think
 
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
could be an opportunity for education
 
00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:15.430 align:start position:0%
could be an opportunity for education
um

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.710 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:16:19.509 --> 00:16:19.519 align:start position:0%
um so anyway back on
 
00:16:19.519 --> 00:16:20.230 align:start position:0%
um so anyway back on
on

00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
cacr 24 um
 
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
there uh
 
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
we didn't pull this out and have copies
 
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
made for our
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
for our guest that um
 
00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:32.470 align:start position:0%
for our guest that um
well

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:16:45.509 --> 00:16:45.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
no i think i have a clean one it's just
 
00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:50.959 align:start position:0%
the front page for my notes
 
00:16:50.959 --> 00:16:52.790 align:start position:0%
the front page for my notes
um

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
but at any rate uh so we have an
 
00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
amendment um
 
00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.310 align:start position:0%
amendment um
the

00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
to paraphrase or or my understanding and
 
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
people can correct me my understanding
 
00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
of the amendment was just to simply put
 
00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:08.069 align:start position:0%
of the amendment was just to simply put
um

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:08.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:09.189 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:17:09.189 --> 00:17:09.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:11.909 --> 00:17:11.919 align:start position:0%
the exact language but into a different
 
00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
it was in one section of law that didn't
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
that was different
 
00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:24.079 align:start position:0%
for purposes of voting
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
than what we currently do when we
 
00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
when the house
 
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
and senate votes for in joint session
 
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
for secretary of state and um
 
00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:35.350 align:start position:0%
for secretary of state and um
treasurer

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
treasurer
 
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
and all that the amendment did was bring
 
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
this attorney general new language into
 
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
that same section so that there would be
 
00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
an election
 
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
handled the same way that we that we
 
00:17:50.789 --> 00:17:50.799 align:start position:0%
currently handle it for the secretary of
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
state and treasurer
 
00:17:54.789 --> 00:17:54.799 align:start position:0%
i don't think there was anything else in
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:02.789 --> 00:18:02.799 align:start position:0%
now that i don't have my uh my guide um
 
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
are there any things
 
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
oh thank you are there any things in the
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh in
 
00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
our researchers guide that
 
00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
anyone would like to
 
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
or is there are there concerns with this
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
are we good with it as it is are we yep
 
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:28.070 align:start position:0%
are we good with it as it is are we yep
yes

00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
am not going to support this
 
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh from research that i was able to do
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
i found that in the past 41 years there
 
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
have been 20
 
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.510 align:start position:0%
have been 20
attempts

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
attempts
 
00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:42.160 align:start position:0%
to change the provisions of our
 
00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.950 align:start position:0%
to change the provisions of our
constitution

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:47.840 align:start position:0%
regarding the attorney general
 
00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:50.799 align:start position:0%
my personal belief is that
 
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
our constitution is a sacred document
 
00:18:56.950 --> 00:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
it's the basis on which we have
 
00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
lived and performed all our duties for
 
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
hundreds of years
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
and before anybody goes to change the
 
00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
constitution there should be an effort
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
to find out what the real need is
 
00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:11.039 align:start position:0%
and perhaps file bills
 
00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
to determine those needs and to
 
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
determine what direction in which we
 
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
should go
 
00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:17.909 align:start position:0%
should go
um

00:19:17.909 --> 00:19:17.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
every single time
 
00:19:21.669 --> 00:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
provision has come through
 
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
to change and elect
 
00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:28.640 align:start position:0%
the attorney general it has gone down
 
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
therefore i i cannot support
 
00:19:33.909 --> 00:19:33.919 align:start position:0%
this cacr
 
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
there are um
 
00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
in some of the
 
00:19:44.789 --> 00:19:44.799 align:start position:0%
emails i've received um
 
00:19:47.669 --> 00:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
they did mention the 19 or 20 times and
 
00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
and our researcher brought up the 19 or
 
00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:50.799 align:start position:0%
20 times
 
00:19:52.549 --> 00:19:52.559 align:start position:0%
as you go through
 
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
there is a request for the entire state
 
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:05.440 align:start position:0%
to elect the attorney general
 
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
and about half of them
 
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
there is a request by the just the
 
00:20:13.029 --> 00:20:13.039 align:start position:0%
general court to elect like we do with
 
00:20:14.950 --> 00:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state
 
00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.070 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state
um

00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
the other thing that occurred to me as i
 
00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.630 align:start position:0%
 
write-up

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
write-up
 
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
with 19
 
00:20:32.549 --> 00:20:32.559 align:start position:0%
with 19 attempts at this
 
00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
that to me indicates that there's a
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
concern um or that in and of itself
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
means that somebody is
 
00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
is thinking enough about this that there
 
00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
has that it keeps coming back um it's
 
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
not just one and
 
00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:48.630 align:start position:0%
not just one and
done

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
so um that was that was my view of
 
00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
um why it
 
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
at least
 
00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
deserves some additional
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:07.750 align:start position:0%
 
anyone

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:13.350 --> 00:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
i i don't
 
00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:16.799 align:start position:0%
suggest that there is
 
00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
any any type of amendment or anything
 
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:21.520 align:start position:0%
that we need that we could work on
 
00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
there's nothing about this
 
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
that you find favorable
 
00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:26.870 align:start position:0%
that you find favorable
um

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
00:21:31.669 --> 00:21:31.679 align:start position:0%
where are you i guess
 
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
aside from just saying no i'm not
 
00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
um well it's not just yeah okay it's
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
years of experience in listening to
 
00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
members of the general public and
 
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
members of the general court
 
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
and yes there are people who have
 
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
obviously brought this issue forward
 
00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
multiple times
 
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
and i i don't see anything wrong with
 
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
the way it's drafted it's the concept
 
00:21:56.789 --> 00:21:56.799 align:start position:0%
and the fact that if we start
 
00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
trying to elect our attorney general
 
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
what is the best method shouldn't we
 
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
figure something out before just saying
 
00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to do it
 
00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.350 align:start position:0%
we're going to do it
um

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
when you're building a house you lay the
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
foundation there's no foundation for
 
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
this except we want to do this we want
 
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
to change the constitution
 
00:22:15.909 --> 00:22:15.919 align:start position:0%
again as i said earlier it's important
 
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
to look at an issue and if there is a
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
real need from the general public in the
 
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
general court then we should study it
 
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
figure it out figure how to do it what
 
00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
the best method is
 
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
so that we don't politicize this office
 
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
too much and so that we don't cause a
 
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
lot of confusion and
 
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
hold things up in a process that
 
00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:42.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:42.559 --> 00:22:45.350 align:start position:0%
 
anyone

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
representative wallace thank you mr
 
00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
chairman seeing that this has come up 19
 
00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
or 20 times for a change over the last
 
00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
40 years it makes me wonder what
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
happened roughly
 
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
40 years ago
 
00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
to initiate these requests for changes
 
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
as a trigger to
 
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
make this change
 
00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
i don't have that answer but i have the
 
00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.350 align:start position:0%
i don't have that answer but i have the
question

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:10.549 align:start position:0%
question
um

00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:10.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
you know if you go back and read
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
testimony and the history from those
 
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
times that
 
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
has come up it seems like
 
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's a different a different issue each
 
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
time as i read it
 
00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:26.390 align:start position:0%
time as i read it
um

00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:28.640 align:start position:0%
there are there are some it
 
00:23:31.029 --> 00:23:31.039 align:start position:0%
and it truly has been studied because
 
00:23:33.029 --> 00:23:33.039 align:start position:0%
they talk about whether it should be a
 
00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:35.039 align:start position:0%
position that's four years rather than
 
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
two years
 
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
they talk about obviously whether it
 
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
should be elected by the entire
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
population or whether it should be
 
00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
just uh from the house side in the
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
senate side and joint session
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
so there are
 
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
conversations i think where
 
00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
if you boil it down
 
00:23:58.630 --> 00:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
as i look at it it seems that it comes
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
from a concern
 
00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:01.909 align:start position:0%
from a concern
that

00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:01.919 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
in its current state
 
00:24:04.559 --> 00:24:05.510 align:start position:0%
in its current state
um

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
the attorney general is a
 
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
function of the executive branch
 
00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:12.630 align:start position:0%
function of the executive branch
and

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
and there are two part
 
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
parts or two problems with that seen by
 
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
the people the drafters
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
one is
 
00:24:22.789 --> 00:24:22.799 align:start position:0%
if there is an issue
 
00:24:22.799 --> 00:24:23.909 align:start position:0%
if there is an issue
that

00:24:23.909 --> 00:24:23.919 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
is involving the governor
 
00:24:28.549 --> 00:24:28.559 align:start position:0%
they wonder whether there's a conflict
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
of interest and whether the attorney
 
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
general will not aggressively pursue
 
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
that issue because they are
 
00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
part of the executive branch and that is
 
00:24:42.390 --> 00:24:42.400 align:start position:0%
you know it's like taking on your boss
 
00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
so that's one
 
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
avenue one problem the other problem
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
the attorney general is there to defend
 
00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
the laws that the general court
 
00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:02.470 align:start position:0%
the laws that the general court
creates

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:05.669 --> 00:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
so there needs these people that that
 
00:25:05.679 --> 00:25:06.710 align:start position:0%
so there needs these people that that
draft

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:06.720 align:start position:0%
draft
 
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
the amendments in in prior years have
 
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
said then the attorney general needs to
 
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
be have a direct
 
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
link to the general court so that they
 
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
would defend their
 
00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
their actions
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
rather than the executive branch
 
00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
those are the two that i see
 
00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
that's that's just my reading
 
00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.230 align:start position:0%
that's that's just my reading
representative

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
um we were given information
 
00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
by the sponsor in an attachment and
 
00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
it when i read through this
 
00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
it appears that though there were 43
 
00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
states that elect the attorney general
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
by popular vote
 
00:25:50.149 --> 00:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
but the amendments that had been brought
 
00:25:50.159 --> 00:25:51.669 align:start position:0%
but the amendments that had been brought
forward

00:25:51.669 --> 00:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
really were to
 
00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:55.110 align:start position:0%
really were to
elect

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
elect
 
00:25:57.510 --> 00:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
by the house
 
00:25:58.630 --> 00:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
and senate
 
00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.710 align:start position:0%
and senate
and

00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:01.750 align:start position:0%
and
that

00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:04.559 align:start position:0%
has been the times that have been
 
00:26:06.149 --> 00:26:06.159 align:start position:0%
not passed by the house died on the
 
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
floor of the house we're a retaining
 
00:26:08.159 --> 00:26:09.430 align:start position:0%
floor of the house we're a retaining
committee

00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
there's and the 43 states elect by
 
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
popular vote there's only one state
 
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
that does it
 
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
by the house and the senate and that's
 
00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
so with that it appears that the
 
00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
majority of the states in the country
 
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
don't seem to have a problem with the
 
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
current way that it is
 
00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.029 align:start position:0%
current way that it is
so

00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:37.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
i am um
 
00:26:42.549 --> 00:26:42.559 align:start position:0%
flip and flopping on this one
 
00:26:42.559 --> 00:26:46.310 align:start position:0%
flip and flopping on this one
thanks

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:49.520 align:start position:0%

in person for the hearings but i did
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
diligently watch them
 
00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
i didn't know if i was going to bring
 
00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
this up but why not i actually have
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
worked for attorneys general and other
 
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
states actually just one other state
 
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
kentucky where i'm from originally
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
where they elect many
 
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.350 align:start position:0%
where they elect many
positions

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:25.360 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:27.360 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:28.799 align:start position:0%
i would support
 
00:27:31.029 --> 00:27:31.039 align:start position:0%
the people of the granite state choosing
 
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
an attorney general because
 
00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
an enormous chance to vet issues around
 
00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:44.149 align:start position:0%
an enormous chance to vet issues around
judicial

00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:44.159 --> 00:27:46.230 align:start position:0%
 
authority

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
authority
 
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
many issues are raised on the campaign
 
00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:49.269 align:start position:0%
many issues are raised on the campaign
trail

00:27:49.269 --> 00:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
trail
 
00:27:49.279 --> 00:27:50.549 align:start position:0%
trail
there

00:27:50.549 --> 00:27:50.559 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
i am proud to be a granite stater and i
 
00:27:56.789 --> 00:27:56.799 align:start position:0%
realize we don't have a lot of
 
00:27:59.590 --> 00:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
statewide elections but i would support
 
00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
for whatever it's worth
 
00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.870 align:start position:0%
for whatever it's worth
electing

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
electing
 
00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:03.990 align:start position:0%
electing
more

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:28:06.870 --> 00:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh executive branch officers at the
 
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
state level
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
and i happen to have worked for two
 
00:28:12.549 --> 00:28:12.559 align:start position:0%
attorneys general
 
00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
for whatever that's worth
 
00:28:17.669 --> 00:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:28:17.679 --> 00:28:19.430 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
yes

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:21.919 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i'm guessing
 
00:28:24.149 --> 00:28:24.159 align:start position:0%
that there are members here today who
 
00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
have not been familiar with this issue
 
00:28:29.909 --> 00:28:29.919 align:start position:0%
before and in terms of how we get our
 
00:28:32.710 --> 00:28:32.720 align:start position:0%
attorney general in the first place
 
00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
as with other positions
 
00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
the governor does not choose the
 
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
attorney general the governor
 
00:28:41.430 --> 00:28:41.440 align:start position:0%
makes a nomination
 
00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
it's a selective process and then the
 
00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:46.640 align:start position:0%
executive council votes on this
 
00:28:50.389 --> 00:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
my concern is that if we have the house
 
00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
and senate vote on the attorney general
 
00:28:54.789 --> 00:28:54.799 align:start position:0%
becomes too politicized
 
00:28:56.789 --> 00:28:56.799 align:start position:0%
the attorney general is not responsible
 
00:28:59.669 --> 00:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
for answering to us as people
 
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
the attorney general is responsible for
 
00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
dealing with laws and protecting our
 
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
state from criminal activities
 
00:29:10.149 --> 00:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
the concern that we've heard in the past
 
00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
is that if we elect our attorney general
 
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
then if it's for two years or four years
 
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
or whatever length of time that's chosen
 
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
it becomes too political because that
 
00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
person then has to raise money has to go
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
out and get elected campaigning and such
 
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
and what happens if there's a big
 
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
criminal case just before an election we
 
00:29:33.029 --> 00:29:33.039 align:start position:0%
have to trust that our attorney general
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
is going to focus exclusively on that
 
00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
case and not on getting re-elected and
 
00:29:40.549 --> 00:29:40.559 align:start position:0%
there is the potential for conflict of
 
00:29:40.559 --> 00:29:41.590 align:start position:0%
there is the potential for conflict of
interest

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:29:43.269 --> 00:29:43.279 align:start position:0%
um and again
 
00:29:43.279 --> 00:29:44.149 align:start position:0%
um and again
um

00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
i i'm deeply concerned
 
00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.750 align:start position:0%
i i'm deeply concerned
that

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
a process that's working now
 
00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
would be changed and become so
 
00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
politicized and complicated as opposed
 
00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
to something that's working right now
 
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
and again the old axiom if it's not
 
00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:02.559 align:start position:0%
broken don't fix it
 
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:09.510 align:start position:0%
thank you
anyone

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:10.950 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
i think we've taken everything we can
 
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
out of that um
 
00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
it may be
 
00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
maybe that our best move at this point
 
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%
is to move on to one of the the other
 
00:30:22.559 --> 00:30:25.510 align:start position:0%
is to move on to one of the the other
items

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
next on the list is
 
00:30:30.149 --> 00:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
house bill and i realize you've just
 
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
received your packet so
 
00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:33.750 align:start position:0%
received your packet so
i

00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:30:35.669 --> 00:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
i hesitate to
 
00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
make you smarter by giving you all that
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
and then not giving you the time to read
 
00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
it so that kind of
 
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:30:56.630 --> 00:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:59.909 --> 00:30:59.919 align:start position:0%
i think we also should probably uh try
 
00:31:03.269 --> 00:31:03.279 align:start position:0%
to create the packages for
 
00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
the other bills that we have
 
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
so why don't we uh take just a quick
 
00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
second and
 
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
and assemble those
 
00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.950 align:start position:0%
and assemble those
um

00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:22.389 --> 00:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
at least provide
 
00:32:04.389 --> 00:32:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:12.549 --> 00:32:12.559 align:start position:0%
this is prohibiting
 
00:32:15.509 --> 00:32:15.519 align:start position:0%
recipients of state or local grants or
 
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
appropriations from using such funds for
 
00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:19.110 align:start position:0%
appropriations from using such funds for
lobbying

00:32:19.110 --> 00:32:19.120 align:start position:0%
lobbying
 
00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:20.070 align:start position:0%
lobbying
um

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
there is also an amendment on this bill

00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:44.480 align:start position:0%

what happened in this bill
 
00:32:59.190 --> 00:32:59.200 align:start position:0%
was um
 
00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
when ols drafted
 
00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
there is a current law
 
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
rsa 15 colon 5
 
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
that prohibits recipients of state or
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
from using state funds for lobbying and
 
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
when the prime sponsor went to ols
 
00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.630 align:start position:0%
in order to
create

00:33:30.630 --> 00:33:30.640 align:start position:0%
create
 
00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
local funds for lobbying as well
 
00:33:39.039 --> 00:33:41.830 align:start position:0%
local funds for lobbying as well
and

00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:43.919 align:start position:0%
there was some question
 
00:33:45.909 --> 00:33:45.919 align:start position:0%
during the hearings whether that was
 
00:33:49.269 --> 00:33:49.279 align:start position:0%
appropriate to use the language of grant
 
00:33:51.669 --> 00:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
or appropriation of state county
 
00:33:51.679 --> 00:33:52.870 align:start position:0%
or appropriation of state county
municipal

00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
municipal
 
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
school district and village funds
 
00:33:57.990 --> 00:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
so this amendment changes
 
00:34:00.630 --> 00:34:00.640 align:start position:0%
or adds a line
 
00:34:02.789 --> 00:34:02.799 align:start position:0%
to further define
 
00:34:02.799 --> 00:34:05.590 align:start position:0%
to further define
that

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:06.549 align:start position:0%
 
those

00:34:06.549 --> 00:34:06.559 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
funds refer to
 
00:34:13.829 --> 00:34:13.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
so the purpose of the bill
 
00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:17.829 align:start position:0%
so the purpose of the bill
is

00:34:17.829 --> 00:34:17.839 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
to enhance the existing 15 colon 5
 
00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:23.669 align:start position:0%
to enhance the existing 15 colon 5
legislation

00:34:23.669 --> 00:34:23.679 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
so that state funds would not be used to
 
00:34:29.349 --> 00:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
hire professional lobbyists
 
00:34:29.359 --> 00:34:30.869 align:start position:0%
hire professional lobbyists
and

00:34:30.869 --> 00:34:30.879 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
local property tax funds would not be
 
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
allowed to be used to hire
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
where are we on that on this
 
00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:47.270 align:start position:0%
where are we on that on this
legislation

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
representative roulard
 
00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
um for the folks that just got that
 
00:34:55.829 --> 00:34:55.839 align:start position:0%
amendment there's a paragraph two to it
 
00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
and it just reiterates
 
00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
county municipal village district
 
00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
throughout that section as well
 
00:35:05.589 --> 00:35:05.599 align:start position:0%
the questions that i have for this is
 
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about recipient
 
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
this particular statute is the statute
 
00:35:14.069 --> 00:35:14.079 align:start position:0%
for lobbying
 
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
and when we talk about recipient
 
00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
i'm just not sure how that is defined
 
00:35:24.550 --> 00:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if it is defined as a
 
00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:26.069 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if it is defined as a
lobbyist

00:35:26.069 --> 00:35:26.079 align:start position:0%
lobbyist
 
00:35:26.079 --> 00:35:27.270 align:start position:0%
lobbyist
a

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
individual that is paid
 
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.430 align:start position:0%
individual that is paid
funds

00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
by the town or municipality that they
 
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:34.870 align:start position:0%
by the town or municipality that they
are

00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:35.910 align:start position:0%
are
in

00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:35:37.670 --> 00:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
maybe the clerk
 
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
or a school board
 
00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:40.870 align:start position:0%
or a school board
director

00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
director
 
00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:41.750 align:start position:0%
director
a

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
anybody else i'm not sure recipient what
 
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
that really means
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
in grant or appropriation
 
00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
i'm also concerned a little bit that we
 
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
have grant or appropriation of the state
 
00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
or the county
 
00:35:57.589 --> 00:35:57.599 align:start position:0%
and the reason that that
 
00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
is a concern of mine is grants have a
 
00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
tendency to have funds that are not
 
00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.390 align:start position:0%
tendency to have funds that are not
necessarily

00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
from state tax dollars and you could
 
00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
have grant money and sometimes
 
00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.349 align:start position:0%
have grant money and sometimes
commingled

00:36:11.349 --> 00:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
commingled
 
00:36:11.359 --> 00:36:12.470 align:start position:0%
commingled
with

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
funds that have been donated as well as
 
00:36:17.109 --> 00:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
funds from the state and there's nothing
 
00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
in here
 
00:36:21.829 --> 00:36:21.839 align:start position:0%
to indicate how that is going to be told
 
00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
to the person that is the recipient
 
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
of as to whether or not there is any
 
00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
funds that is just grant money
 
00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:31.510 align:start position:0%
funds that is just grant money
um

00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
that's given to the towns or or the
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
village districts so i think that we
 
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
probably need to kind of tune that up a
 
00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:41.910 align:start position:0%
little bit
and

00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
because if we have a recipient
 
00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:47.190 align:start position:0%
because if we have a recipient
that

00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
would be prohibited
 
00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
to participate on line five in political
 
00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.109 align:start position:0%
to participate on line five in political
activity

00:36:55.109 --> 00:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
activity
 
00:36:58.310 --> 00:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
i'm just not sure what that means does
 
00:36:59.670 --> 00:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
that mean
 
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
that they are unable to speak to
 
00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:04.720 align:start position:0%
their state representatives or their
 
00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
senators or
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
go out and pick it
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
whatever it is we're voting on i i just
 
00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
don't know so i think that there needs
 
00:37:15.030 --> 00:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
to be a little bit more definition there
 
00:37:17.430 --> 00:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
especially when we're dealing with funds
 
00:37:19.589 --> 00:37:19.599 align:start position:0%
from the municipality and the village
 
00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
district etc so although i would i am
 
00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
in support
 
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
of lobbying and um
 
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
funds coming from taxpayers for lobbying
 
00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
purposes i think the language needs to
 
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
be perhaps looked at a little closer
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:37:41.589 --> 00:37:41.599 align:start position:0%
can i clarify one thing you asked sure
 
00:37:44.069 --> 00:37:44.079 align:start position:0%
um did did you say that you were in
 
00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
favor of funds coming from property
 
00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:47.589 align:start position:0%
favor of funds coming from property
taxes

00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
00:37:49.510 --> 00:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
for lobbying purposes
 
00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
no i'm not in favor
 
00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
i left out the word not did i no okay i
 
00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
am not in favor
 
00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:57.190 align:start position:0%
am not in favor
um

00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:57.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
there is also uh section 15 colon one um
 
00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
that determines
 
00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:05.440 align:start position:0%
who who is a lobbyist and and
 
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
um it was pointed out to me by um
 
00:38:10.950 --> 00:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
i think it might have been been pointed
 
00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
out by one of the people testifying
 
00:38:16.310 --> 00:38:16.320 align:start position:0%
um that lobbying
 
00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:17.349 align:start position:0%
um that lobbying
public

00:38:17.349 --> 00:38:17.359 align:start position:0%

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
so it would seem to me
 
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony that this would
 
00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:52.069 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony that this would
prohibit

00:38:52.069 --> 00:38:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
cities and towns to have their voices
 
00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:56.390 align:start position:0%
cities and towns to have their voices
heard

00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
heard
 
00:38:58.950 --> 00:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
by the general court and i think this
 
00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
points out that that
 
00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
that would not be the case there there
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.270 align:start position:0%
 
yep

00:39:09.270 --> 00:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative roulette all right thank
 
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
you i think that where we're in the
 
00:39:17.589 --> 00:39:17.599 align:start position:0%
lobbyist section
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
um and we're talking about lobbyists
 
00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
being prohibited
 
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
that when we talk about no recipient
 
00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
of a grant perhaps me we want to
 
00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
consider no lobbyists
 
00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
where that's in the lobbyist section so
 
00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
there's no ambiguity those are just my
 
00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:41.190 align:start position:0%
there's no ambiguity those are just my
thoughts

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
is that a hand raised
 
00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um after we had
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
our hearing i heard from two communities
 
00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
both smaller towns
 
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
one's medium-sized ones very small and
 
00:39:59.109 --> 00:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
we heard from the municipal association
 
00:40:01.109 --> 00:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
the municipal association comes before
 
00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
this committee and others
 
00:40:05.349 --> 00:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
in the legislature and essentially
 
00:40:05.359 --> 00:40:06.790 align:start position:0%
in the legislature and essentially
lobbies

00:40:06.790 --> 00:40:06.800 align:start position:0%
lobbies
 
00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
if you would put it that way for issues
 
00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
that affect municipalities in the
 
00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.309 align:start position:0%
that affect municipalities in the
state

00:40:14.309 --> 00:40:14.319 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
there is a concern
 
00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
that i have heard
 
00:40:19.349 --> 00:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
after our hearing
 
00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:20.720 align:start position:0%
that this
 
00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
would cause problems for cities
 
00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
and towns because again as our chairman
 
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.190 align:start position:0%
and towns because again as our chairman
said

00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
they want to have their voices heard up
 
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:32.720 align:start position:0%
here what small town can afford to hire
 
00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
somebody to keep track of all the bills
 
00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
that come before us
 
00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
and and figure out what's going to
 
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
affect the town and what isn't and then
 
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
take the time to come up here to testify
 
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
what city which is so busy with
 
00:40:48.069 --> 00:40:48.079 align:start position:0%
budgeting and of all the concerns of any
 
00:40:50.309 --> 00:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
big city is going to be able to do the
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
same and that's why we rely on the
 
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
municipal association we did have some
 
00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839 align:start position:0%
testimony which i think is a little
 
00:40:58.630 --> 00:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
inaccurate something about how it cost
 
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
i could be wrong five thousand a year
 
00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
for that
 
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
that was from
 
00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
and that that is not entirely accurate
 
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
different municipalities pay different
 
00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
amounts into that that was from that
 
00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
particular town i think okay because um
 
00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
one of the towns i represent just pays a
 
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
few hundred dollars a year to the
 
00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
municipal association um so it does vary
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
according to population apparently
 
00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
that's what we're figuring i think they
 
00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
gave a range did they not uh they said
 
00:41:29.349 --> 00:41:29.359 align:start position:0%
manchester was
 
00:41:31.349 --> 00:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
big some number and
 
00:41:34.309 --> 00:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
exactly yeah exactly so again the
 
00:41:37.109 --> 00:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
concerns that i heard after our hearing
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
are that
 
00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:40.069 align:start position:0%
are that
um

00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:40.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:41.589 --> 00:41:41.599 align:start position:0%
some group like the municipal
 
00:41:43.990 --> 00:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
association is essential
 
00:41:46.150 --> 00:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
uh to come in and speak on behalf of
 
00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
communities that doesn't mean all the
 
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
communities they're representing just
 
00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
will agree with the municipal
 
00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
association's position
 
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
but at least they're out there giving
 
00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.870 align:start position:0%
but at least they're out there giving
information

00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:41:59.750 --> 00:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
to help the communities know
 
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
where others are standing there there's
 
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
just no way you can get all these
 
00:42:05.829 --> 00:42:05.839 align:start position:0%
municipalities together to communicate
 
00:42:05.839 --> 00:42:06.950 align:start position:0%
municipalities together to communicate
otherwise

00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
so um i i did hear concerns about this
 
00:42:12.870 --> 00:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh thank you
 
00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
representative um do you understand that
 
00:42:18.309 --> 00:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:19.829 --> 00:42:19.839 align:start position:0%
would prohibit
 
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
a city in town from hiring
 
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire municipal association
 
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:26.720 align:start position:0%
is that what how you read the
 
00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:29.109 align:start position:0%
is that what how you read the
legislation

00:42:29.109 --> 00:42:29.119 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
mr chairman that is how the
 
00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities who got in touch with me
 
00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
interpreted it
 
00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:36.230 align:start position:0%
interpreted it
and

00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:37.030 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
it's not only the municipal association
 
00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
but any other
 
00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
lobbyists who might be out there for a
 
00:42:44.309 --> 00:42:44.319 align:start position:0%
group unlike uh for example for
 
00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
municipal insurances and things like
 
00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:50.069 align:start position:0%
municipal insurances and things like
that

00:42:50.069 --> 00:42:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
these communities who contacted me
 
00:42:52.640 --> 00:42:53.990 align:start position:0%
these communities who contacted me
believe

00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:42:56.950 --> 00:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
that what we have once again is working
 
00:42:58.589 --> 00:42:58.599 align:start position:0%
there seems to be an
 
00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
a concern among some legislators that
 
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:04.000 align:start position:0%
lobbyists are not altogether the kind of
 
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
people we really want to work with and i
 
00:43:08.309 --> 00:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
apologize for putting it that way
 
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
lobbyists are here to inform us
 
00:43:13.109 --> 00:43:13.119 align:start position:0%
lobbyists are here to work with us
 
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
if any lobbyist does anything that's
 
00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
inappropriate the war gets out fast and
 
00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
they don't have a job for long
 
00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
we we have to rely on lobbyists for
 
00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
certain matters
 
00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
and at least they're there to inform us
 
00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
we can listen or not listen but the fact
 
00:43:30.870 --> 00:43:30.880 align:start position:0%
that we have them working for and with
 
00:43:32.069 --> 00:43:32.079 align:start position:0%
us and
 
00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know if
 
00:43:35.990 --> 00:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
and i could be wrong but for my time up
 
00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:39.839 align:start position:0%
here i've never heard of a lobbyist
 
00:43:41.589 --> 00:43:41.599 align:start position:0%
who was hired just by
 
00:43:45.109 --> 00:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
one town to promote one issue
 
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
and use taxpayers money
 
00:43:50.069 --> 00:43:50.079 align:start position:0%
all lobbyists have to register all
 
00:43:52.550 --> 00:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
obvious have to file accounts with the
 
00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office and so they
 
00:43:56.390 --> 00:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
are accountable
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
and i don't see where there is a real
 
00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
problem at this point nor do the
 
00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
communities have contacted me thank you
 
00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:04.960 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
representative espidia
 
00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
thank it was truman yeah i just
 
00:44:11.109 --> 00:44:11.119 align:start position:0%
you know and i will i will say i don't
 
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
always agree with my my friends with the
 
00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
orange badges all the time you know we
 
00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
don't always have um sometimes we're in
 
00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
opposition of each other but
 
00:44:24.309 --> 00:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
i do think especially with um
 
00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
you know i represented a large city like
 
00:44:27.670 --> 00:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
nashua and
 
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
um i can imagine if you know if there
 
00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
was a specific issue around like you
 
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
know land uh you know waste management
 
00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
for example that
 
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
um would be something that i wouldn't
 
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
want my you know my my commission my
 
00:44:43.349 --> 00:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
public works director to go all the way
 
00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
take her time out of her day to go all
 
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:46.240 align:start position:0%
the way up to concord
 
00:44:48.309 --> 00:44:48.319 align:start position:0%
um so that she would have to testify i
 
00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
mean i think the municipal association
 
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
or sorry i shouldn't just even say one
 
00:44:54.069 --> 00:44:54.079 align:start position:0%
group but other organizations like they
 
00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
take the time to
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
to be able to do that and i do just
 
00:44:59.589 --> 00:44:59.599 align:start position:0%
think that you know
 
00:45:01.349 --> 00:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
that there is
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
you know funding for that does matter so
 
00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
that these not just nashua but other
 
00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
communities smaller smaller towns
 
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
that may not be able to afford it um
 
00:45:13.910 --> 00:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
that they be able to have their voice
 
00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
heard and conquered like i said because
 
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
of because of the hours that we serve
 
00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:19.750 align:start position:0%
of because of the hours that we serve
um

00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
you know we're here at 10 a.m um 10 40
 
00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
a.m right now if i was
 
00:45:27.270 --> 00:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
you know in another career i would
 
00:45:29.109 --> 00:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
probably be at work i'd be in the office
 
00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
right now so it would be very difficult
 
00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
for me to make the time to come up here
 
00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:33.910 align:start position:0%
for me to make the time to come up here
to

00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
probably take some time off or i'd have
 
00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
to be on the clock for work so that
 
00:45:39.030 --> 00:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
would be taxpayer money from our
 
00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities that would be going
 
00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
towards our you know director to come up
 
00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
here so that they could be speaking and
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
testifying on a bill that may negatively
 
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
impact or positively impact the
 
00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
community so
 
00:45:51.349 --> 00:45:51.359 align:start position:0%
i mean i see there is a lot of value
 
00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
towards you know towards making sure
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:45:56.950 --> 00:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
that we could use you know funds in that
 
00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
way so
 
00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:46:03.829 --> 00:46:03.839 align:start position:0%
representative simon thank you mr chair
 
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
um so i have a couple of thoughts i
 
00:46:07.270 --> 00:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
suppose um
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
first off when we're looking at the fees
 
00:46:11.109 --> 00:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
that the municipalities or the
 
00:46:14.069 --> 00:46:14.079 align:start position:0%
municipality association is being um
 
00:46:14.079 --> 00:46:14.950 align:start position:0%
municipality association is being um
given

00:46:14.950 --> 00:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
given
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
by our local municipalities
 
00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
if i'm correct when i'm reading this
 
00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:20.710 align:start position:0%
if i'm correct when i'm reading this
amendment

00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:20.720 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
we're only limiting funds given by
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
property tax correct so other funds are
 
00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
available so when we're looking at a
 
00:46:29.349 --> 00:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
town having to come up with 400 let's
 
00:46:31.589 --> 00:46:31.599 align:start position:0%
say a small town in order to retain
 
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
those services
 
00:46:35.109 --> 00:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
um they could get that through
 
00:46:37.349 --> 00:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
fees that they collect at their
 
00:46:40.069 --> 00:46:40.079 align:start position:0%
recycling center or any other place that
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
they get funds other than just from
 
00:46:45.589 --> 00:46:45.599 align:start position:0%
property taxation
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
my other concern is that we're we appear
 
00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
to be getting pigeonholed
 
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
into just talking about municipalities
 
00:46:53.829 --> 00:46:53.839 align:start position:0%
school boards and things of that nature
 
00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
but they're not the only organizations
 
00:46:57.510 --> 00:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
that receive
 
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
these kinds of grants and appropriations
 
00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
they aren't so specifically tied to
 
00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:05.599 align:start position:0%
local representation of you know our
 
00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
public our
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
political sector
 
00:47:09.359 --> 00:47:11.430 align:start position:0%
political sector
and

00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:47:13.349 --> 00:47:13.359 align:start position:0%
would it be beneficial even potentially
 
00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
to discuss
 
00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
separating off municipalities in a
 
00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
separate way if we had to from other
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
organizations that maybe get grants from
 
00:47:23.109 --> 00:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
local funding um
 
00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
because other kinds of organizations get
 
00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
these funds so those are those are just
 
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
two thoughts that i have i
 
00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
i i represent small towns all of my
 
00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
towns are small towns um i find it hard
 
00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
to believe with with the fees that
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
they're being charged that they wouldn't
 
00:47:37.589 --> 00:47:37.599 align:start position:0%
be able to scrape together
 
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
the few hundred dollars that they would
 
00:47:41.109 --> 00:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
need to outside of just
 
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
property taxation to retain those
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
services if they chose to thank you
 
00:47:48.470 --> 00:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:51.270 --> 00:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
any other comments
 
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
i think that um what representative
 
00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
simon said is correct that um
 
00:48:00.309 --> 00:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
that this is not a prohibition of of a
 
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
town whatever size
 
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
from hiring lobbyists i think this is
 
00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
the source of the funds is the key item
 
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
whether and whether that would be still
 
00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
available to them as an option
 
00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:20.720 align:start position:0%
whether they have additional sources of
 
00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:21.670 align:start position:0%
whether they have additional sources of
income

00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:21.680 align:start position:0%
income
 
00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:23.950 align:start position:0%
i also agree with the idea of
 
00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:25.349 align:start position:0%
i also agree with the idea of
[Music]

00:48:25.349 --> 00:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:48:25.359 --> 00:48:27.990 align:start position:0%
[Music]
of

00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
i don't know if pigeonholing is the
 
00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:30.470 align:start position:0%
i don't know if pigeonholing is the
right

00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
phrase but um whether we are limiting
 
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:36.720 align:start position:0%
down and i and i think the purpose and i
 
00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
shouldn't put words in any sponsor's
 
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
mouth but i think the purpose was more
 
00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:45.750 align:start position:0%
mouth but i think the purpose was more
for

00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:48:48.309 --> 00:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
the municipals and the municipalities
 
00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
and the school districts
 
00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
was where
 
00:48:55.829 --> 00:48:55.839 align:start position:0%
in testimony he mostly spoke but
 
00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
representative maguire
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
yes thank you this has come up several
 
00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
times before
 
00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
the usual
 
00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
spur to putting a bill in like this is
 
00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:08.230 align:start position:0%
spur to putting a bill in like this is
the

00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
school board association
 
00:49:14.549 --> 00:49:14.559 align:start position:0%
coming in and fighting very hard for the
 
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
government school structure
 
00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:18.549 align:start position:0%
government school structure
which

00:49:18.549 --> 00:49:18.559 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:49:20.549 --> 00:49:20.559 align:start position:0%
looking at the sponsors
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
the the these people are are concerned
 
00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:24.230 align:start position:0%
the the these people are are concerned
about

00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
the municipal association has also taken
 
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
stances that are
 
00:49:37.589 --> 00:49:37.599 align:start position:0%
not always appreciated by members of the
 
00:49:37.599 --> 00:49:38.870 align:start position:0%
not always appreciated by members of the
house

00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:49:41.829 --> 00:49:41.839 align:start position:0%
and so this is an attempt to
 
00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
just cut them off from public funds
 
00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:46.069 align:start position:0%
just cut them off from public funds
because

00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:49:48.230 --> 00:49:48.240 align:start position:0%
those two organizations although they
 
00:49:50.549 --> 00:49:50.559 align:start position:0%
are frequently very useful
 
00:49:53.349 --> 00:49:53.359 align:start position:0%
do take very political stances on
 
00:49:53.359 --> 00:49:54.630 align:start position:0%
do take very political stances on
occasion

00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
occasion
 
00:49:57.670 --> 00:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
and that's what this bill in my opinion
 
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
is intended to cut off that is the the
 
00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
strongly political positions that they
 
00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:03.750 align:start position:0%
strongly political positions that they
take

00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
take
 
00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
on occasion
 
00:50:07.510 --> 00:50:07.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:08.790 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:08.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:50:12.150 --> 00:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
representative for what you just said
 
00:50:14.069 --> 00:50:14.079 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely accurate
 
00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
as always
 
00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:50:18.390 --> 00:50:18.400 align:start position:0%
but i i still am
 
00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned that we're
 
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
taking too big a chunk out of
 
00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:24.150 align:start position:0%
taking too big a chunk out of
our

00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:25.349 align:start position:0%
our
um

00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:27.680 align:start position:0%

amendment that is
 
00:52:24.309 --> 00:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
coming around the purpose i think of
 
00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
by the way there was only uh one person
 
00:52:29.990 --> 00:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
signed in online in support of this bill
 
00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
there were no none in opposition
 
00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this
 
00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
was to
 
00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:38.549 align:start position:0%
was to
remove

00:52:38.549 --> 00:52:38.559 align:start position:0%

um and and place it in
 
00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:56.230 --> 00:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
rsa section
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
and that was it when we received the
 
00:53:01.589 --> 00:53:01.599 align:start position:0%
bill however there were a number of
 
00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
repeals that were tacked on to the
 
00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
bottom that didn't appear to
 
00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:09.030 align:start position:0%
bottom that didn't appear to
be

00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
necessary to the overall goal of the
 
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor
 
00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:17.200 align:start position:0%

repeals

00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
repeals
 
00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
and it removed one word
 
00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:31.680 align:start position:0%

simon
 
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
i have no idea if it's a concern or not
 
00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
but um line nine
 
00:53:46.790 --> 00:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
attachment removed does anybody know
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
carol repper maguires yes thank you that
 
00:53:58.470 --> 00:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
it refers to the
 
00:54:01.109 --> 00:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
administrative attachment of the boards
 
00:54:03.829 --> 00:54:03.839 align:start position:0%
to the secretary of state the joint
 
00:54:06.150 --> 00:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
board of licensure certification has
 
00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:07.190 align:start position:0%
board of licensure certification has
been

00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
repealed for
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
four or five years
 
00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:13.280 align:start position:0%
but it was previously administratively
 
00:54:15.829 --> 00:54:15.839 align:start position:0%
attached to the
 
00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:21.190 --> 00:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
got it
 
00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
anything else representative wall no
 
00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
this media no
 
00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:31.990 align:start position:0%
this media no
um

00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
so it would seem to me that the
 
00:54:35.910 --> 00:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
amendment should be
 
00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
sufficient to
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
move along great
 
00:54:44.069 --> 00:54:44.079 align:start position:0%
that was a simple one
 
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
like that um
 
00:54:50.309 --> 00:54:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
was also one that seemed to have
 
00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:56.799 align:start position:0%
concerns or or consternation or in need
 
00:54:59.190 --> 00:54:59.200 align:start position:0%
of a uh an amendment
 
00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:00.069 align:start position:0%
of a uh an amendment
um

00:55:00.069 --> 00:55:00.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:02.549 --> 00:55:02.559 align:start position:0%
and this is limiting the authority of
 
00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire delegates to policy
 
00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:06.390 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire delegates to policy
making

00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
making
 
00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:07.829 align:start position:0%
making
conventions

00:55:07.829 --> 00:55:07.839 align:start position:0%
conventions
 
00:55:07.839 --> 00:55:08.710 align:start position:0%
conventions
um

00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:08.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:12.549 --> 00:55:12.559 align:start position:0%
we do have an amendment i don't do i
 
00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:18.309 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:55:18.309 --> 00:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:20.400 align:start position:0%

00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:25.910 align:start position:0%
heather or somewhere
um

00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative ruler you are aware of

correct can you give us a
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
line i am um
 
00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
the changes to the underlying bill
 
00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
were how the members of the delegation
 
00:55:44.549 --> 00:55:44.559 align:start position:0%
were to be selected
 
00:55:46.829 --> 00:55:46.839 align:start position:0%
it wasn't anything in the
 
00:55:50.309 --> 00:55:50.319 align:start position:0%
bill to tell us that
 
00:55:50.319 --> 00:55:51.430 align:start position:0%

so this amendment is number

00:55:55.069 --> 00:55:55.079 align:start position:0%

00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:49.040 align:start position:0%

the delegates from the state of new
 
00:57:17.109 --> 00:57:17.119 align:start position:0%

and

00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:28.880 align:start position:0%
they changed the language a little bit
 
00:57:31.589 --> 00:57:31.599 align:start position:0%
and removed some language in the on the
 
00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
last sentence
 
00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:35.430 align:start position:0%
last sentence
and

00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
the actual language reads now
 
00:57:40.789 --> 00:57:40.799 align:start position:0%
i do solemnly swear or refer them to the
 
00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
best of my abilities i will as a
 
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
delegate to the interstate convention
 
00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:46.480 align:start position:0%

00:57:48.390 --> 00:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
united states and the state of new
 
00:57:50.549 --> 00:57:50.559 align:start position:0%
hampshire i will accept and act in
 
00:57:51.990 --> 00:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
accordance with the limits of the
 
00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
authority as a delegate granted to me by
 
00:57:56.789 --> 00:57:56.799 align:start position:0%
new hampshire under new hampshire law
 
00:57:59.030 --> 00:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
and i will not vote to consider or
 
00:58:02.069 --> 00:58:02.079 align:start position:0%
approve any unauthorized amendment or
 
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
policy proposal introduced by the
 
00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
convention as prohibited by new
 
00:58:08.230 --> 00:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire law and this is the language
 
00:58:10.789 --> 00:58:10.799 align:start position:0%
that was changed this language now in
 
00:58:13.270 --> 00:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
the amendment says i understand
 
00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
penalties may be imposed under new
 
00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:18.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire law for the violation of this
 
00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:19.030 align:start position:0%
hampshire law for the violation of this
oath

00:58:19.030 --> 00:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
oath
 
00:58:21.430 --> 00:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
the reason that that was important
 
00:58:24.069 --> 00:58:24.079 align:start position:0%
is in the underlying bill
 
00:58:26.309 --> 00:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
that last paragraph
 
00:58:26.319 --> 00:58:29.430 align:start position:0%
that last paragraph
actually

00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
i can find it real quickly said i
 
00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
understand and accept
 
00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:36.720 align:start position:0%
any penalties
 
00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
accepting the penalties in the statute
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
is in fact been removed so that you're
 
00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
not able to put forward any defense and
 
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
they'll accept the penalties that come
 
00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
so it's understand that penalties may be
 
00:58:53.349 --> 00:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
imposed take away the i accept that's
 
00:58:59.270 --> 00:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:02.309 --> 00:59:02.319 align:start position:0%
thank you representative um

00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.480 align:start position:0%

that came back this year for us instead
 
01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:39.829 align:start position:0%
that came back this year for us instead
of

through the end of the bill
 
01:04:59.270 --> 01:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:01.589 align:start position:0%

thirty

so from there to the end of the bill was
 
01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:35.349 align:start position:0%
so from there to the end of the bill was
totally

01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
totally
 
01:05:37.109 --> 01:05:37.119 align:start position:0%
new additions
 
01:05:40.789 --> 01:05:40.799 align:start position:0%
from the bill that we saw last year
 
01:05:43.829 --> 01:05:43.839 align:start position:0%
and we worked through
 
01:05:46.789 --> 01:05:46.799 align:start position:0%
page 9 in the top of page 10 with house
 
01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
clerk paul smith and he gave us some
 
01:05:51.589 --> 01:05:51.599 align:start position:0%
suggestions on wording
 
01:05:51.599 --> 01:05:53.910 align:start position:0%
suggestions on wording
um

01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
the the wording on on page 9
 
01:06:01.270 --> 01:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
line 30 the codified study committee
 
01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
um that wording should be commissioned
 
01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:05.839 align:start position:0%
according to um
 
01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:07.440 align:start position:0%
clerk smith so
 
01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
we changed that wording
 
01:06:12.390 --> 01:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh through um
 
01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
page 10
 
01:06:15.670 --> 01:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
line 10.
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
we kept that in
 
01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
if you
 
01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
the other
 
01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
amendment we made was on page 10
 
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
line one
 
01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
talks about 15 members
 
01:06:32.309 --> 01:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
clerk smith suggested that we add that
 
01:06:35.430 --> 01:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
the majority of those members should be
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
from the legislature
 
01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
they should be legislative members
 
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
so we added that wording
 
01:06:44.829 --> 01:06:44.839 align:start position:0%
on that
 
01:06:47.270 --> 01:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
line and then
 
01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
like i said
 
01:06:51.510 --> 01:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
page 10 starting in line 11 to the end
 
01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
01:07:00.150 --> 01:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
page 10
 
01:07:05.349 --> 01:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
starting in line 11
 
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
through the end of the bill
 
01:07:10.390 --> 01:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
page 12 line 22
 
01:07:11.990 --> 01:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
the only
 
01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
lines on page 12 we kept were lines 23
 
01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:23.589 --> 01:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
and the amendment
 
01:07:25.589 --> 01:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
that we wrote up
 
01:07:30.549 --> 01:07:30.559 align:start position:0%
speaks to those changes now
 
01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
once we
 
01:07:36.069 --> 01:07:36.079 align:start position:0%
talked to ols about our amendment
 
01:07:38.549 --> 01:07:38.559 align:start position:0%
and got that submitted we did
 
01:07:40.710 --> 01:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
ref rouliard received a call from one of
 
01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsors
 
01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
wanting more changes
 
01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
and um so
 
01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
that's what we're here to talk about
 
01:07:50.789 --> 01:07:50.799 align:start position:0%
today i don't know if you want to speak
 
01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:52.640 align:start position:0%
to that representative roulard well
 
01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
before we get there can i ask a couple
 
01:07:57.190 --> 01:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
of quick questions about this so why um
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
on line
 
01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:03.990 align:start position:0%
on line
eight

01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
eight
 
01:08:07.270 --> 01:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh page eight line thirty three
 
01:08:09.109 --> 01:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
um did we
 
01:08:09.119 --> 01:08:10.390 align:start position:0%
um did we
remove

01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
remove
 
01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
the weights and measures advisory board
 
01:08:17.349 --> 01:08:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
or is that still in there we did not
 
01:08:20.950 --> 01:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
that's still in there
 
01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:21.910 align:start position:0%
that's still in there
okay

01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:08:24.149 --> 01:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that that started the new
 
01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
on page 10 starting in on line 11. okay
 
01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
but we kept the weights and measures
 
01:08:37.030 --> 01:08:37.040 align:start position:0%
advisory board language
 
01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
and each place that it says committee
 
01:08:43.749 --> 01:08:43.759 align:start position:0%
you changed to commission yeah
 
01:08:46.309 --> 01:08:46.319 align:start position:0%
and then uh what was the purpose of
 
01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
removing everything from line 10
 
01:08:55.269 --> 01:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
page 10 line 11. what what was
 
01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
sorry uh because it was a joint
 
01:09:06.149 --> 01:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
committee on codified study committees
 
01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
it's a committee on committees
 
01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:09.269 align:start position:0%
it's a committee on committees
so

01:09:09.269 --> 01:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:09:11.189 --> 01:09:11.199 align:start position:0%
we felt that we didn't need necessarily
 
01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
a committee on committees if we were
 
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
putting in a repeal
 
01:09:17.430 --> 01:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
for both the codified study committees
 
01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
and the commissions
 
01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
to expire
 
01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
five years from the date they were
 
01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:25.030 align:start position:0%
five years from the date they were
effective

01:09:25.030 --> 01:09:25.040 align:start position:0%
effective
 
01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:25.990 align:start position:0%
effective
or

01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:27.520 align:start position:0%
the date when they were complete and the
 
01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
final report was issued whichever was
 
01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:31.990 align:start position:0%
final report was issued whichever was
earlier

01:09:31.990 --> 01:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
excuse me so that both
 
01:09:37.349 --> 01:09:37.359 align:start position:0%
both types of committees the codified
 
01:09:38.789 --> 01:09:38.799 align:start position:0%
and the commission
 
01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
and why i have a fragment though
 
01:09:42.789 --> 01:09:42.799 align:start position:0%
um will be repealed to me this is the
 
01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
biggest thing in the entire bill
 
01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
that these committees will expire
 
01:09:47.279 --> 01:09:48.870 align:start position:0%
that these committees will expire
automatically

01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
automatically
 
01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
sunset and
 
01:09:53.349 --> 01:09:53.359 align:start position:0%
with five years or after be when the
 
01:09:55.910 --> 01:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
final report whichever is earlier so
 
01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
that's the reason we didn't need that
 
01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
last section because if you look at that
 
01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
page and page 11 and 12. it talks about
 
01:10:05.189 --> 01:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
the year beginning and then the other
 
01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
night in 2024 and then it goes 25 and it
 
01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
goes all the way through which is
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh kind of cumbersome rather than let's
 
01:10:12.630 --> 01:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
establish the committees and the
 
01:10:14.950 --> 01:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
commissions and that they will sunset in
 
01:10:16.870 --> 01:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
five years
 
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
is that right vanessa
 
01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:20.149 align:start position:0%
is that right vanessa
okay

01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:24.229 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:10:24.229 --> 01:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:10:26.470 --> 01:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
maguire yes thank you i don't know if
 
01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
you covered this
 
01:10:29.430 --> 01:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
but the
 
01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
legislative information technology
 
01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
oversight committee
 
01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:35.350 align:start position:0%
oversight committee
um

01:10:35.350 --> 01:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
where is that
 
01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:38.070 align:start position:0%
where is that
page

01:10:38.070 --> 01:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
two i think page one actually
 
01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:42.870 align:start position:0%
two i think page one actually
that's

01:10:42.870 --> 01:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
which should have been part of the
 
01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:45.590 align:start position:0%
which should have been part of the
original

01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
original
 
01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:47.669 align:start position:0%
original
bill

01:10:47.669 --> 01:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:10:53.590 --> 01:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:55.590 --> 01:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
i'm glad to see you're getting rid of
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
the legislative committee but when i was
 
01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
the commissioner he suggested we might
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
add legislators to the
 
01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
existing council i.t council
 
01:11:12.229 --> 01:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
would this be an appropriate place to do
 
01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:17.669 --> 01:11:17.679 align:start position:0%
page we're on page 10 in the underlying
 
01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
bill with all the handwritten notes on
 
01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:20.870 align:start position:0%
bill with all the handwritten notes on
that

01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
what page you want carol no page one i
 
01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
actually it's lines 23 24 25 are where
 
01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
you're deleting the reference to the
 
01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee because
 
01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:51.030 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee because
the

01:11:51.030 --> 01:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
looks like you're repealing that
 
01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
somewhere else which is fine
 
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
no objection
 
01:12:01.189 --> 01:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
but you're suggesting that we add
 
01:12:05.189 --> 01:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
a legislator or two to the to that
 
01:12:05.199 --> 01:12:07.110 align:start position:0%
a legislator or two to the to that
earlier

01:12:07.110 --> 01:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
01:12:09.189 --> 01:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
in that section which describes the
 
01:12:09.199 --> 01:12:13.030 align:start position:0%
in that section which describes the
council

01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:12:15.910 --> 01:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
if it's too much if this is too
 
01:12:18.790 --> 01:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
complicated i'll i'll skip oh no no this
 
01:12:21.189 --> 01:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
is the time to do it yeah
 
01:12:23.830 --> 01:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
and mr chair i think that's where where
 
01:12:26.310 --> 01:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
is the um information
 
01:12:29.189 --> 01:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
that designates how many people
 
01:12:32.149 --> 01:12:32.159 align:start position:0%
or where they come from it's obviously
 
01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
earlier in that section let me look it
 
01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
up while you go on to other issues okay
 
01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
but that should be i think that would be
 
01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
the perfect time to add it into this
 
01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:42.790 align:start position:0%
the perfect time to add it into this
amendment

01:12:42.790 --> 01:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:12:44.790 --> 01:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
representative richard
 
01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair i just wanted to
 
01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
clarify the explanation and also um
 
01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:52.870 align:start position:0%
clarify the explanation and also um
when

01:12:52.870 --> 01:12:52.880 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:12:56.630 --> 01:12:56.640 align:start position:0%
the word the codified study committee is
 
01:12:59.350 --> 01:12:59.360 align:start position:0%
going away we're replacing that correct
 
01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
the committee on committees essentially
 
01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
is what this bill is doing on i'll tell
 
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:14.790 --> 01:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
right yeah we're changing yeah and
 
01:13:16.709 --> 01:13:16.719 align:start position:0%
that's where the essential
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
essence of this right
 
01:13:20.950 --> 01:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
and um uh representative ruler's
 
01:13:22.709 --> 01:13:22.719 align:start position:0%
explanation was really
 
01:13:25.030 --> 01:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
excellent with everything sun setting
 
01:13:27.110 --> 01:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
but my question is is there anywhere
 
01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:28.470 align:start position:0%
but my question is is there anywhere
else

01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
else
 
01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
that maybe legislative services or you
 
01:13:30.239 --> 01:13:31.270 align:start position:0%
that maybe legislative services or you
did

01:13:31.270 --> 01:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
looked for where
 
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
taking that this title of that codified
 
01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:38.310 align:start position:0%
study committee
impacts

01:13:38.310 --> 01:13:38.320 align:start position:0%
impacts
 
01:13:39.910 --> 01:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
any other
 
01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
legislation or is this the only place
 
01:13:43.750 --> 01:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
where it impacts that or
 
01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:45.600 align:start position:0%
did i understand correctly when
 
01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
representative ruler said that means
 
01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
everything else will sunset because
 
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
we've taken this away
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that that's what i said but
 
01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:54.640 align:start position:0%
i think that we have
 
01:13:57.030 --> 01:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
the clerk of the house that can explain
 
01:14:00.149 --> 01:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
why we wanted to make this change here
 
01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
can we have the clerk come up and
 
01:14:09.990 --> 01:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:11.189 --> 01:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair members of the
 
01:14:14.070 --> 01:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
committees so currently in statute we
 
01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
have either study committees legislative
 
01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
study committees or commissions the
 
01:14:19.590 --> 01:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
original bill wanted to change the title
 
01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
of commissions to codified study
 
01:14:23.750 --> 01:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
committees my concern
 
01:14:25.510 --> 01:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
is administratively
 
01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
differentiating between committees as
 
01:14:29.669 --> 01:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
study committees or chaptered study
 
01:14:32.229 --> 01:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
committees versus codified statutory
 
01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
committees or whatever uh iteration
 
01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
there is so
 
01:14:38.550 --> 01:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
the current practice of commission uh is
 
01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
what what my suggestion was
 
01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that explanation because i
 
01:14:46.709 --> 01:14:46.719 align:start position:0%
was worried that
 
01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
there was this had existed somewhere
 
01:14:50.870 --> 01:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
else before but now we're making sure it
 
01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't ever exist and that is a good
 
01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:53.430 align:start position:0%
doesn't ever exist and that is a good
thing

01:14:53.430 --> 01:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:14:54.830 --> 01:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:14:58.229 --> 01:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
right good
 
01:14:58.239 --> 01:14:59.750 align:start position:0%
right good
others

01:14:59.750 --> 01:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
others
 
01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
so we would expect more language coming
 
01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:04.790 align:start position:0%
so we would expect more language coming
from

01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
you representing actually looking at it
 
01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:08.310 align:start position:0%
you representing actually looking at it
the

01:15:08.310 --> 01:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:10.709 --> 01:15:10.719 align:start position:0%
there are already two representatives on
 
01:15:10.719 --> 01:15:11.750 align:start position:0%
there are already two representatives on
the

01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh the technology council and
 
01:15:21.270 --> 01:15:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:22.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:15:24.149 --> 01:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
we're good with that we're good with it
 
01:15:27.030 --> 01:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:28.149 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:15:30.149 --> 01:15:30.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
i appreciate all the work that's been
 
01:15:33.910 --> 01:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
done and continues to be done on this
 
01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
particular issue because we've heard
 
01:15:37.189 --> 01:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
testimony and those of us who have been
 
01:15:39.189 --> 01:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
here for a while know there's been a
 
01:15:41.990 --> 01:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
proliferation of commissions and study
 
01:15:44.870 --> 01:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
committees to the point where
 
01:15:47.189 --> 01:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
they often dominate the work that we do
 
01:15:49.669 --> 01:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
especially during the summer time so i i
 
01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
am thankful for the work that's been
 
01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:52.550 align:start position:0%
am thankful for the work that's been
done

01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:15:54.790 --> 01:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
i think if we did nothing else this year
 
01:15:58.790 --> 01:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:01.430 --> 01:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
we've earned her a hundred dollars
 
01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:03.990 align:start position:0%
we've earned her a hundred dollars
um

01:16:03.990 --> 01:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:04.870 align:start position:0%
 
great

01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:16:07.270 --> 01:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
so that um i think that pretty much we
 
01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
just have one correction or two or a few
 
01:16:15.750 --> 01:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:18.709 --> 01:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
amending the amendment right um
 
01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
but um so for exact session
 
01:16:24.390 --> 01:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
when we bring this up we would be able
 
01:16:25.910 --> 01:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
to have
 
01:16:28.229 --> 01:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
the corrected version we're done now
 
01:16:30.950 --> 01:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
we're not taking any more suggestions
 
01:16:33.030 --> 01:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
right this is it we're done and i didn't
 
01:16:34.630 --> 01:16:34.640 align:start position:0%
want to add that we
 
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
they took out a section about marine
 
01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:38.310 align:start position:0%
they took out a section about marine
fisheries

01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
fisheries
 
01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:39.189 align:start position:0%
fisheries
right

01:16:39.189 --> 01:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:16:39.199 --> 01:16:40.070 align:start position:0%
right
that

01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
we heard from
 
01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
some members of the marine fisheries
 
01:16:46.070 --> 01:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
last year asking if we could
 
01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
make a change and so we did and we
 
01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
passed that last year and it was taken
 
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
out of this bill this year so we amended
 
01:16:54.709 --> 01:16:54.719 align:start position:0%
it and put it back in that was another
 
01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
amendment that was it just to remind
 
01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:58.870 align:start position:0%
amendment that was it just to remind
people

01:16:58.870 --> 01:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
that marine fisheries was set up so that
 
01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
it was an exclusive club to those that
 
01:17:05.669 --> 01:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
lived on the seacoast you had to live in
 
01:17:08.470 --> 01:17:08.480 align:start position:0%
a seacoast town to belong to the marine
 
01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:09.830 align:start position:0%
a seacoast town to belong to the marine
fisheries

01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
fisheries
 
01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:11.510 align:start position:0%
fisheries
commission

01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
and and we made it
 
01:17:15.669 --> 01:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
we changed one word and said there would
 
01:17:18.630 --> 01:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
be a majority of members that came from
 
01:17:22.070 --> 01:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
that but not so that it wouldn't exclude
 
01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:24.719 align:start position:0%
the possibility that someone happened to
 
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
move out of a seacoast town but still
 
01:17:28.870 --> 01:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
was on that commission
 
01:17:32.070 --> 01:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
and the senate ended up taking that out
 
01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:33.430 align:start position:0%
and the senate ended up taking that out
um

01:17:33.430 --> 01:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
i think the the club decided that that
 
01:17:38.550 --> 01:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
was not not good so
 
01:17:40.550 --> 01:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
i'm pleased to see that that's back in
 
01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:42.830 align:start position:0%
i'm pleased to see that that's back in
here

01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:44.709 align:start position:0%
 
right

01:17:44.709 --> 01:17:44.719 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
and i think we now are sending them back
 
01:17:51.110 --> 01:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
a better version of what we sent them
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
the first time
 
01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
so let's see how that goes
 
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
um great i think
 
01:18:01.270 --> 01:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
i think we're done with our work session
 
01:18:03.910 --> 01:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
i'm going to suggest a
 
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
10 minute break and then we come back
 
01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
and try to exact some of these um
 
01:18:11.510 --> 01:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
we can do 15 minutes that's fine so mr
 
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
chairman yes
 
01:18:15.110 --> 01:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
one quick question about
 
01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:15.910 align:start position:0%
one quick question about
this

01:18:15.910 --> 01:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:18:17.590 --> 01:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
amendment to the bill
 
01:18:19.110 --> 01:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
i i believe
 
01:18:21.590 --> 01:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
did i hear correctly that um the
 
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
original sponsors
 
01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
had a chance to see this amendment
 
01:18:28.630 --> 01:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
and they were cool with it
 
01:18:32.310 --> 01:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:33.510 --> 01:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
we had
 
01:18:36.550 --> 01:18:36.560 align:start position:0%
i had conversation with um
 
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative umberger
 
01:18:41.430 --> 01:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
about changes uh to this i'm assuming
 
01:18:43.350 --> 01:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
that she also spoke with representative
 
01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
ebel on that
 
01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
she also had conversation with the folks
 
01:18:49.830 --> 01:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
from the discovery center and went over
 
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
this line by line with me
 
01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
so i did have changes to be made we put
 
01:18:57.830 --> 01:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
them in so that the sponsors of the bill
 
01:18:59.830 --> 01:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
are the ones that are actually driving
 
01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
the train on this
 
01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:07.750 --> 01:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
i did receive an email from the prime
 
01:19:10.470 --> 01:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
sponsor that said i have a conflict
 
01:19:12.870 --> 01:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
tomorrow meaning today and won't be able
 
01:19:14.790 --> 01:19:14.800 align:start position:0%

01:19:18.149 --> 01:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
ordinarily i would have been there in
 
01:19:21.669 --> 01:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
case the committee needed me as a
 
01:19:23.830 --> 01:19:23.840 align:start position:0%

1033

02:02:50.229 --> 02:02:50.239 align:start position:0%

waiting for amendments or
 
02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:02.550 align:start position:0%
waiting for amendments or
or

02:03:02.550 --> 02:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:03:04.470 --> 02:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
small pieces of information so we'll
 
02:03:06.550 --> 02:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
have one additional
 
02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:07.910 align:start position:0%
have one additional
short

02:03:07.910 --> 02:03:07.920 align:start position:0%

02:03:25.030 --> 02:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
so we only have one early bill maybe
 
02:03:28.310 --> 02:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
maybe our clerk can tell us when the
 
02:03:31.350 --> 02:03:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:32.550 --> 02:03:32.560 align:start position:0%

it's true of a different committee the
 
02:03:39.189 --> 02:03:39.199 align:start position:0%
deadline for early bills is the tenth
 
02:03:41.510 --> 02:03:41.520 align:start position:0%

there further discussion representative
expedia

02:04:54.870 --> 02:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
expedia
 
02:04:56.950 --> 02:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
you know at this time i think reducing
 
02:04:59.669 --> 02:04:59.679 align:start position:0%
the pay to two cents would be
 
02:05:01.589 --> 02:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
i think it's it's it's not the right
 
02:05:03.910 --> 02:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
course of action um and i just think
 
02:05:03.920 --> 02:05:05.189 align:start position:0%
course of action um and i just think
that

02:05:05.189 --> 02:05:05.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:05:07.270 --> 02:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
given that we do have some expenditures
 
02:05:10.069 --> 02:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
200 goes it goes a long way so just
 
02:05:11.189 --> 02:05:11.199 align:start position:0%
against it
 
02:05:13.109 --> 02:05:13.119 align:start position:0%
thank you representative speedy any
 
02:05:15.750 --> 02:05:15.760 align:start position:0%

just briefly uh the testimony we heard

there's some very pragmatic reasons that
 
02:07:38.950 --> 02:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
why this bill shouldn't go why it
 
02:07:41.270 --> 02:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be going forward requiring
 
02:07:43.910 --> 02:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
very long verbage on the actual ballots

chair um i'll i will be uh voting no on
 
02:08:00.550 --> 02:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
the icl i believe that this uh
 
02:08:02.950 --> 02:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
legislation has to merit i think that we
 
02:08:04.390 --> 02:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
can you know i think that the
 
02:08:05.990 --> 02:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
constitution does the purpose of
 
02:08:08.550 --> 02:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
amendments or to keep our constitution a
 
02:08:10.149 --> 02:08:10.159 align:start position:0%
living document to be you know
 
02:08:13.189 --> 02:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
modernized with uh the current situation
 
02:08:15.270 --> 02:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
of our state so you know i think this
 
02:08:18.550 --> 02:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
would be a good a good bill to just
 
02:08:18.560 --> 02:08:19.350 align:start position:0%
would be a good a good bill to just
re

02:08:19.350 --> 02:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
re
 
02:08:20.149 --> 02:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:08:22.950 --> 02:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
change some of the verbiage um as you
 
02:08:24.950 --> 02:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
know there's there's language around the
 
02:08:27.510 --> 02:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
governor being he and and his royalness
 
02:08:29.030 --> 02:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
and i think you know we've had a couple
 
02:08:29.040 --> 02:08:29.910 align:start position:0%
and i think you know we've had a couple
of

02:08:29.910 --> 02:08:29.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:08:31.589 --> 02:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
female governors so i think that you
 
02:08:33.109 --> 02:08:33.119 align:start position:0%
know changing the constitution to make
 
02:08:34.950 --> 02:08:34.960 align:start position:0%
sure that the language is concerning
 
02:08:36.470 --> 02:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
with the times would be would be would
 
02:08:38.790 --> 02:08:38.800 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman during our work
 
02:10:41.669 --> 02:10:41.679 align:start position:0%
session i was very vocal in terms of
 
02:10:44.629 --> 02:10:44.639 align:start position:0%
why i want this to be killed i i believe
 
02:10:46.709 --> 02:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
that the constitution is a sacred
 
02:10:48.950 --> 02:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
document i don't believe that we should
 
02:10:51.270 --> 02:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
just be changing it because there are
 
02:10:53.669 --> 02:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
individuals who don't agree with the way
 
02:10:55.910 --> 02:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
it's drafted it's not broken we don't
 
02:10:58.470 --> 02:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
need to fix it if we were to elect the
 
02:10:59.750 --> 02:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
attorney general we would be
 
02:11:02.229 --> 02:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
politicizing the office
 
02:11:04.870 --> 02:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
if we were to elect the attorney general
 
02:11:06.870 --> 02:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
there's a concern that there might be a
 
02:11:08.870 --> 02:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest if a serious case
 
02:11:10.950 --> 02:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
came up just before election where would
 
02:11:13.990 --> 02:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
the concentration of effort be with the
 
02:11:16.310 --> 02:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
election or with the case there are all
 
02:11:19.830 --> 02:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
kinds of concerns uh this just is not a
 
02:11:23.189 --> 02:11:23.199 align:start position:0%

about the way we
 
02:15:57.119 --> 02:15:58.310 align:start position:0%
about the way we
represent

02:15:58.310 --> 02:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:16:01.750 --> 02:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
the granite state and
 
02:16:03.589 --> 02:16:03.599 align:start position:0%
you know made some interesting points
 
02:16:05.030 --> 02:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
for us to think about
 
02:16:05.040 --> 02:16:05.990 align:start position:0%
for us to think about

02:16:07.270 --> 02:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
the basic
 
02:16:09.990 --> 02:16:10.000 align:start position:0%

02:16:13.750 --> 02:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
that number of reps and a different
 
02:16:17.270 --> 02:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
sort of representation just really
 
02:16:19.990 --> 02:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
seems impractical there weren't enough
 
02:16:23.030 --> 02:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
provisions even if you support it to
 
02:16:25.189 --> 02:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
fully determine how you would even carry
 
02:16:28.069 --> 02:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
that out as an election so
 
02:16:30.950 --> 02:16:30.960 align:start position:0%

would representative simon like to speak
 
02:27:28.070 --> 02:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
to his motion uh briefly um there are a
 
02:27:29.910 --> 02:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
number of things that are wrong with
 
02:27:31.110 --> 02:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:27:33.510 --> 02:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
but the vast majority of what is trying
 
02:27:34.790 --> 02:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
to be done
 
02:27:36.950 --> 02:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
is already covered under federal law
 
02:27:39.510 --> 02:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
both in article 14 section 3 of the
 
02:27:41.429 --> 02:27:41.439 align:start position:0%
united states constitution as well as
 
02:27:43.750 --> 02:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
u.s code 2383
 
02:27:46.150 --> 02:27:46.160 align:start position:0%
which already deals with the issue of
 
02:27:46.160 --> 02:27:47.910 align:start position:0%
which already deals with the issue of
insurrection

02:27:47.910 --> 02:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
insurrection
 
02:27:51.110 --> 02:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
or rebellion and would disqualify
 
02:27:52.550 --> 02:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
anybody who
 
02:27:53.990 --> 02:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
participated in those activities from
 
02:27:55.270 --> 02:27:55.280 align:start position:0%
holding office at any level of
 
02:27:56.710 --> 02:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
government within the state of new
 
02:27:58.309 --> 02:27:58.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire whether it's local state or
 
02:28:01.110 --> 02:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
federal uh so seeing as though the
 
02:28:02.469 --> 02:28:02.479 align:start position:0%
federal government's already kind of got
 
02:28:04.790 --> 02:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
that covered uh and the vagueness with
 
02:28:06.710 --> 02:28:06.720 align:start position:0%
which we would have to
 
02:28:09.190 --> 02:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
determine in our own body whether or not
 
02:28:10.950 --> 02:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
somebody had um
 
02:28:12.790 --> 02:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
was at fault
 
02:28:15.190 --> 02:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
of participating in these activities uh
 
02:28:17.309 --> 02:28:17.319 align:start position:0%

02:28:30.309 --> 02:28:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:33.190 --> 02:28:33.200 align:start position:0%

um
 
02:28:38.830 --> 02:28:38.840 align:start position:0%
on january 6
 
02:28:41.990 --> 02:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
2021 uh there was a resolution that we
 
02:28:44.469 --> 02:28:44.479 align:start position:0%
had an opportunity to vote on
 
02:28:47.349 --> 02:28:47.359 align:start position:0%
and it condemned the insurrection
 
02:28:49.429 --> 02:28:49.439 align:start position:0%
seditious acts that were taking place in
 
02:28:51.110 --> 02:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
our capital
 
02:28:53.670 --> 02:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
i vividly heard
 
02:28:56.790 --> 02:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
votes against that resolution
 
02:28:59.110 --> 02:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
at the time our speaker did not hear
 
02:29:02.469 --> 02:29:02.479 align:start position:0%
that and it was ruled unanimous
 
02:29:05.270 --> 02:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
we have since heard instances of our
 
02:29:05.280 --> 02:29:07.270 align:start position:0%
we have since heard instances of our
colleagues

02:29:07.270 --> 02:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
colleagues
 
02:29:11.510 --> 02:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
expressing support in ways uh submitting
 
02:29:14.309 --> 02:29:14.319 align:start position:0%
bills to secede from the united states i
 
02:29:17.190 --> 02:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
think that this should be a bipart and
 
02:29:19.110 --> 02:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
it is a bipartisan
 
02:29:19.120 --> 02:29:20.389 align:start position:0%
it is a bipartisan
opinion

02:29:20.389 --> 02:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
02:29:22.630 --> 02:29:22.640 align:start position:0%
that if you do not
 
02:29:25.990 --> 02:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
support our electoral process
 
02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:27.190 align:start position:0%
support our electoral process
uh

02:29:27.190 --> 02:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:29:29.910 --> 02:29:29.920 align:start position:0%
campaigns are a replacement for violence
 
02:29:32.710 --> 02:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
and violent overthrow of government
 
02:29:36.150 --> 02:29:36.160 align:start position:0%
i don't think this should be
 
02:29:37.830 --> 02:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
anything other than
 
02:29:41.190 --> 02:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
a no-brainer i think
 
02:29:43.990 --> 02:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of work to do as a country
 
02:29:46.630 --> 02:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
i have concerns about bipartisanship
 
02:29:48.710 --> 02:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
because of this topic
 
02:29:52.630 --> 02:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
i believe in the good of all people
 
02:29:54.070 --> 02:29:54.080 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
02:29:57.510 --> 02:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do is to take a stand
 
02:29:59.349 --> 02:29:59.359 align:start position:0%
that we even have to
 
02:30:02.710 --> 02:30:02.720 align:start position:0%
say this is an issue is concerning
 
02:30:04.950 --> 02:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
and i pray for peace
 
02:30:04.960 --> 02:30:06.630 align:start position:0%
and i pray for peace
personally

02:30:06.630 --> 02:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
personally
 
02:30:10.150 --> 02:30:10.160 align:start position:0%
and i hope that we can
 
02:30:12.790 --> 02:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
find a way to move on from these issues
 
02:30:14.870 --> 02:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
in a way that makes sense
 
02:30:16.469 --> 02:30:16.479 align:start position:0%
but in our
 
02:30:19.349 --> 02:30:19.359 align:start position:0%
in our court the general court i think
 
02:30:20.870 --> 02:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:30:23.590 --> 02:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
makes total sense and i
 
02:30:23.600 --> 02:30:25.030 align:start position:0%
makes total sense and i
support

02:30:25.030 --> 02:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
support
 
02:30:26.710 --> 02:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
passing this bill
 
02:30:29.190 --> 02:30:29.200 align:start position:0%

02:30:29.200 --> 02:30:31.670 align:start position:0%
and um i say that

thank you

if i had thought things through and
 
02:32:48.230 --> 02:32:48.240 align:start position:0%
realized i was going to speak about this
 
02:32:50.389 --> 02:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
topic i probably would have deferred
 
02:32:52.950 --> 02:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
the last one to someone else um
 
02:32:57.110 --> 02:32:57.120 align:start position:0%
but you know controversy is as it is um
 
02:32:59.590 --> 02:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
i care deeply about this issue because
 
02:33:02.870 --> 02:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
our non-partisan staff members have
 
02:33:05.830 --> 02:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
suffered in the past couple years since
 
02:33:05.840 --> 02:33:07.190 align:start position:0%
suffered in the past couple years since
covid

02:33:07.190 --> 02:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
covid
 
02:33:11.190 --> 02:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
protocols uh have been in place
 
02:33:12.710 --> 02:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
i happen to know
 
02:33:15.670 --> 02:33:15.680 align:start position:0%
um because i know at least one person
 
02:33:18.230 --> 02:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
anyway from prior to my
 
02:33:21.110 --> 02:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
being elected to this body
 
02:33:21.120 --> 02:33:23.030 align:start position:0%
being elected to this body
um

02:33:23.030 --> 02:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:33:23.040 --> 02:33:23.910 align:start position:0%
um
and

02:33:23.910 --> 02:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:33:26.070 --> 02:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
this person confided in me
 
02:33:28.070 --> 02:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
and i've since talked to other of our
 
02:33:30.230 --> 02:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan employees
 
02:33:34.070 --> 02:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
that the way that they were recalled
 
02:33:36.790 --> 02:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
to return to work the way that
 
02:33:40.469 --> 02:33:40.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:42.630 --> 02:33:42.640 align:start position:0%
flouted for lack of a better word in the
 
02:33:42.640 --> 02:33:44.630 align:start position:0%
flouted for lack of a better word in the
moment

02:33:44.630 --> 02:33:44.640 align:start position:0%
moment
 
02:33:46.469 --> 02:33:46.479 align:start position:0%
some have worried for their own safety
 
02:33:48.150 --> 02:33:48.160 align:start position:0%
and health
 
02:33:48.160 --> 02:33:50.469 align:start position:0%
and health
and

02:33:50.469 --> 02:33:50.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:33:53.030 --> 02:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
feel what you feel about labor unions
 
02:33:55.910 --> 02:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
this gives an opportunity for workers to
 
02:33:57.670 --> 02:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
come together and stand up for their
 
02:33:59.910 --> 02:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
rights when they most need it
 
02:34:01.510 --> 02:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
and to do
 
02:34:04.070 --> 02:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
this in a non-partisan way is very
 
02:34:04.080 --> 02:34:05.429 align:start position:0%
this in a non-partisan way is very
important

02:34:05.429 --> 02:34:05.439 align:start position:0%
important
 
02:34:07.429 --> 02:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
the oversight of our nonpartisan
 
02:34:07.439 --> 02:34:08.710 align:start position:0%
the oversight of our nonpartisan
employees

02:34:08.710 --> 02:34:08.720 align:start position:0%
employees
 
02:34:10.870 --> 02:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
should be something that
 
02:34:13.429 --> 02:34:13.439 align:start position:0%
helps all of them feel safe
 
02:34:15.670 --> 02:34:15.680 align:start position:0%
that doesn't cause any of them to want
 
02:34:15.680 --> 02:34:16.469 align:start position:0%
that doesn't cause any of them to want
to

02:34:16.469 --> 02:34:16.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:34:18.870 --> 02:34:18.880 align:start position:0%
get a different job potentially we've
 
02:34:18.880 --> 02:34:19.750 align:start position:0%
get a different job potentially we've
lost

02:34:19.750 --> 02:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
lost
 
02:34:21.670 --> 02:34:21.680 align:start position:0%
some really good
 
02:34:25.349 --> 02:34:25.359 align:start position:0%
staff members with enormous experience
 
02:34:27.990 --> 02:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
and it is in large part because of the
 
02:34:30.870 --> 02:34:30.880 align:start position:0%
way they have been treated as employees
 
02:34:33.590 --> 02:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
i make no aspersions on any of the folks
 
02:34:35.429 --> 02:34:35.439 align:start position:0%
who made those decisions
 
02:34:38.309 --> 02:34:38.319 align:start position:0%
i get that there is a disagreement
 
02:34:41.429 --> 02:34:41.439 align:start position:0%
but when it comes to
 
02:34:43.030 --> 02:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
the health and safety
 
02:34:46.950 --> 02:34:46.960 align:start position:0%
of the people who serve us and the state
 
02:34:49.429 --> 02:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
i think that we have failed them
 
02:34:51.590 --> 02:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
to give them the opportunity to stand up
 
02:34:53.429 --> 02:34:53.439 align:start position:0%
for their own rights is the right thing
 
02:34:54.630 --> 02:34:54.640 align:start position:0%
to do
 
02:34:54.640 --> 02:34:56.830 align:start position:0%
to do
and

02:34:56.830 --> 02:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:35:00.389 --> 02:35:00.399 align:start position:0%
why our country hasn't been as embracing
 
02:35:02.630 --> 02:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
of the human right to organize
 
02:35:02.640 --> 02:35:03.590 align:start position:0%
of the human right to organize
is

02:35:03.590 --> 02:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:35:06.710 --> 02:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
an issue that i care deeply about
 
02:35:06.720 --> 02:35:08.710 align:start position:0%
an issue that i care deeply about
um

02:35:08.710 --> 02:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:12.309 --> 02:35:12.319 align:start position:0%
and so for in the interest
 
02:35:14.309 --> 02:35:14.319 align:start position:0%
of our employees
 
02:35:16.389 --> 02:35:16.399 align:start position:0%
they deserve the chance to stand up for
 
02:35:19.190 --> 02:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
themselves and not live in fear
 
02:35:21.190 --> 02:35:21.200 align:start position:0%
of speaking out
 
02:35:23.750 --> 02:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
for retribution because an issue seems
 
02:35:23.760 --> 02:35:25.270 align:start position:0%
for retribution because an issue seems
political

02:35:25.270 --> 02:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
political
 
02:35:27.349 --> 02:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
i think that is
 
02:35:29.110 --> 02:35:29.120 align:start position:0%
morally wrong
 
02:35:31.510 --> 02:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
and i am proud to be a co-sponsor of
 
02:35:33.910 --> 02:35:33.920 align:start position:0%

and no one told me about it so
 
02:36:03.830 --> 02:36:03.840 align:start position:0%

we have well
 
02:40:19.750 --> 02:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
it may be
 
02:40:22.950 --> 02:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
it may be that we didn't have any um
 
02:40:25.269 --> 02:40:25.279 align:start position:0%
because remember we had almost no one
 
02:40:27.190 --> 02:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
here other than the prime sponsor that
 
02:40:28.550 --> 02:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
was here
 
02:40:31.349 --> 02:40:31.359 align:start position:0%

jennifer

02:40:38.710 --> 02:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:41.429 --> 02:40:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:44.630 --> 02:40:44.640 align:start position:0%

02:40:46.950 --> 02:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
included in anything for the for the
 
02:40:59.030 --> 02:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:59.040 --> 02:41:01.670 align:start position:0%
 
really

02:41:01.670 --> 02:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:03.510 --> 02:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
well um
 
02:41:07.110 --> 02:41:07.120 align:start position:0%
up to you folks i mean it i

up to you folks i mean it i
i

02:41:08.150 --> 02:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:41:10.550 --> 02:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
thought the only thing that i had to do
 
02:41:12.550 --> 02:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
was go actually i didn't even have to do
 
02:41:14.469 --> 02:41:14.479 align:start position:0%
that but i went online to try to find
 
02:41:17.349 --> 02:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
out and i thought that there would be
 
02:41:20.550 --> 02:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
more people online watching than than
 
02:41:20.560 --> 02:41:21.429 align:start position:0%
more people online watching than than
not

02:41:21.429 --> 02:41:21.439 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:41:23.590 --> 02:41:23.600 align:start position:0%
but um but if you
 
02:41:25.590 --> 02:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
want to add to this we certainly can go
 
02:41:27.910 --> 02:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
get the folder for each one and do it
 
02:41:33.830 --> 02:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:37.030 --> 02:41:37.040 align:start position:0%

second representative simon seconds
 
02:43:41.590 --> 02:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
representative green would you like to
 
02:43:43.030 --> 02:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
 
02:43:45.030 --> 02:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
02:43:46.870 --> 02:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
in the discussion something i brought up
 
02:43:48.950 --> 02:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
during the hearing is that
 
02:43:50.790 --> 02:43:50.800 align:start position:0%
something i've
 
02:43:52.630 --> 02:43:52.640 align:start position:0%
become more aware of
 
02:43:52.640 --> 02:43:53.830 align:start position:0%
become more aware of
is

02:43:53.830 --> 02:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:43:56.550 --> 02:43:56.560 align:start position:0%
there's many instances where
 
02:43:59.429 --> 02:43:59.439 align:start position:0%
a lobbying organization gets the idea
 
02:44:01.030 --> 02:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
for the model legislation from a
 
02:44:01.040 --> 02:44:02.389 align:start position:0%
for the model legislation from a
legislator

02:44:02.389 --> 02:44:02.399 align:start position:0%
legislator
 
02:44:03.830 --> 02:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking this kind of sounds like a
 
02:44:05.990 --> 02:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
what came first the chicken or the egg
 
02:44:08.950 --> 02:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
so you can have this bill pass but
 
02:44:11.830 --> 02:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
i think in reality
 
02:44:14.870 --> 02:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
we really still don't really know
 
02:44:14.880 --> 02:44:15.830 align:start position:0%
we really still don't really know
where

02:44:15.830 --> 02:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:44:18.070 --> 02:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
the impetus or where the true origin of
 
02:44:19.349 --> 02:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
a bill is
 
02:44:21.510 --> 02:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
and so that means for that reason i move
 
02:44:21.520 --> 02:44:23.830 align:start position:0%
and so that means for that reason i move
itl

02:44:23.830 --> 02:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
itl
 
02:44:25.750 --> 02:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative greene is there
 
02:44:28.230 --> 02:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
any further discussion on
 
02:44:29.309 --> 02:44:29.319 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
02:44:33.510 --> 02:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
1084 representative expedia yeah so
 
02:44:35.429 --> 02:44:35.439 align:start position:0%
you know i think
 
02:44:37.510 --> 02:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
it would be great if in good faith like
 
02:44:40.230 --> 02:44:40.240 align:start position:0%
people would say you know this bill came
 
02:44:43.590 --> 02:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
from you know ex-group or you know
 
02:44:45.190 --> 02:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
because i don't think you know we always
 
02:44:46.790 --> 02:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
typically asked has this been done in
 
02:44:48.870 --> 02:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
any other state which is you know it's
 
02:44:50.150 --> 02:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
always good to know i was like oh how's
 
02:44:52.389 --> 02:44:52.399 align:start position:0%
it going over in idaho or is it how's it
 
02:44:55.349 --> 02:44:55.359 align:start position:0%
going over in nebraska um
 
02:44:57.429 --> 02:44:57.439 align:start position:0%
but it is good to
 
02:45:00.230 --> 02:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
i think for us to kind of get an idea of
 
02:45:00.240 --> 02:45:00.950 align:start position:0%
i think for us to kind of get an idea of
if

02:45:00.950 --> 02:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:45:04.070 --> 02:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
you know if there were organizations or
 
02:45:06.309 --> 02:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
um you know with particular interests
 
02:45:08.309 --> 02:45:08.319 align:start position:0%
who who tried to help and it doesn't you
 
02:45:11.110 --> 02:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
know i think it could be it sounds a
 
02:45:11.120 --> 02:45:11.990 align:start position:0%
know i think it could be it sounds a
little

02:45:11.990 --> 02:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
little
 
02:45:14.070 --> 02:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
for some folks it'll be like oh well we
 
02:45:15.269 --> 02:45:15.279 align:start position:0%
don't want folks to know that we didn't
 
02:45:16.630 --> 02:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
come up with these ideas because i know
 
02:45:19.510 --> 02:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
that a lot of us have great ideas but um
 
02:45:21.590 --> 02:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
i think it's um i just think it serves
 
02:45:24.309 --> 02:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
as a good way for us to know that um you
 
02:45:26.230 --> 02:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
know legislation has been done in other
 
02:45:27.910 --> 02:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
places that you know that the general
 
02:45:29.670 --> 02:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
public knows that all right this is this
 
02:45:32.070 --> 02:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
is where we got an idea from it so
 
02:45:33.349 --> 02:45:33.359 align:start position:0%
that's why i'll
 
02:45:37.190 --> 02:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
be voting um against the uh idea thank
 
02:45:39.110 --> 02:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
you representatives media representative
 
02:45:39.120 --> 02:45:40.230 align:start position:0%

mcguire
 
02:45:42.469 --> 02:45:42.479 align:start position:0%
yes thank you i've frequently seen
 
02:45:45.030 --> 02:45:45.040 align:start position:0%
legislation drafted by
 
02:45:47.429 --> 02:45:47.439 align:start position:0%
professional organizations
 
02:45:48.710 --> 02:45:48.720 align:start position:0%
brought in
 
02:45:48.720 --> 02:45:50.309 align:start position:0%
brought in
as

02:45:50.309 --> 02:45:50.319 align:start position:0%
as
 
02:45:51.990 --> 02:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
a bill a
 
02:45:54.870 --> 02:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
house bill here to
 
02:45:54.880 --> 02:45:56.550 align:start position:0%
house bill here to
encourage

02:45:56.550 --> 02:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
encourage
 
02:45:58.469 --> 02:45:58.479 align:start position:0%
licensing for a profession that's not
 
02:46:00.790 --> 02:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
currently licensed in fact there's been
 
02:46:02.710 --> 02:46:02.720 align:start position:0%
quite a few cases
 
02:46:02.720 --> 02:46:03.590 align:start position:0%
quite a few cases
and

02:46:03.590 --> 02:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:46:06.150 --> 02:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
most of the time the sponsors
 
02:46:08.150 --> 02:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
will mention that that this is you know
 
02:46:10.309 --> 02:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
it was my idea to go for a license but
 
02:46:13.750 --> 02:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:15.670 --> 02:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
the art therapist a professional
 
02:46:17.269 --> 02:46:17.279 align:start position:0%
organization or
 
02:46:17.279 --> 02:46:18.630 align:start position:0%
organization or
whomever

02:46:18.630 --> 02:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
whomever
 
02:46:19.670 --> 02:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:46:21.510 --> 02:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
it's very helpful to know that
 
02:46:23.910 --> 02:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
information but i would agree with
 
02:46:25.510 --> 02:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
representative espicia that it's
 
02:46:29.510 --> 02:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
generally our idea we say we want to
 
02:46:31.590 --> 02:46:31.600 align:start position:0%
to do this
 
02:46:34.070 --> 02:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
and then we find out other places where
 
02:46:35.510 --> 02:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
we can
 
02:46:39.349 --> 02:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
get detailed language that saves us and
 
02:46:39.359 --> 02:46:40.630 align:start position:0%
get detailed language that saves us and
our

02:46:40.630 --> 02:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:46:42.550 --> 02:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
our hard-working
 
02:46:45.110 --> 02:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
office of legislative services working
 
02:46:47.190 --> 02:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
out the details of the language if
 
02:46:49.830 --> 02:46:49.840 align:start position:0%
you've got a framework
 
02:46:52.870 --> 02:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
to work from it's much easier to work to
 
02:46:54.950 --> 02:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
present a well thought out build than if
 
02:46:56.150 --> 02:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
you just say
 
02:46:58.230 --> 02:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
i've got an idea
 
02:46:58.240 --> 02:46:58.950 align:start position:0%
i've got an idea
and

02:46:58.950 --> 02:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:47:01.110 --> 02:47:01.120 align:start position:0%
you know plop
 
02:47:01.120 --> 02:47:01.990 align:start position:0%
you know plop
so

02:47:01.990 --> 02:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:47:05.110 --> 02:47:05.120 align:start position:0%
i i think it's a good idea but i don't
 
02:47:07.429 --> 02:47:07.439 align:start position:0%
know that it would be
 
02:47:10.870 --> 02:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate to mandate it
 
02:47:13.110 --> 02:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mcguire
 
02:47:14.950 --> 02:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
any further comments
 
02:47:18.630 --> 02:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1084
 
02:47:25.030 --> 02:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:27.429 --> 02:47:27.439 align:start position:0%
sorry i i apologize for not being
 
02:47:28.870 --> 02:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
entirely familiar with this bill i'm
 
02:47:31.990 --> 02:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
curious so i've had the constituents
 
02:47:34.710 --> 02:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
bring legislation to me to have filed
 
02:47:36.309 --> 02:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
for them
 
02:47:38.790 --> 02:47:38.800 align:start position:0%
people who were afraid of retribution
 
02:47:40.309 --> 02:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
from their employers
 
02:47:42.150 --> 02:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
or from
 
02:47:45.110 --> 02:47:45.120 align:start position:0%
regulatory agencies would this bill
 
02:47:45.120 --> 02:47:46.230 align:start position:0%
regulatory agencies would this bill
preclude

02:47:46.230 --> 02:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
preclude
 
02:47:48.389 --> 02:47:48.399 align:start position:0%
them from being able to do so without me
 
02:47:50.309 --> 02:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
having to name them
 
02:47:53.030 --> 02:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
just wondering uh thank you for your
 
02:47:55.269 --> 02:47:55.279 align:start position:0%
question um
 
02:47:57.190 --> 02:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
i don't believe so
 
02:47:57.200 --> 02:47:58.070 align:start position:0%
i don't believe so
um

02:47:58.070 --> 02:47:58.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:01.030 --> 02:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
i think uh follow it as the bill says
 
02:48:03.110 --> 02:48:03.120 align:start position:0%
following introduction of the bill if
 
02:48:05.590 --> 02:48:05.600 align:start position:0%
the source of the model act
 
02:48:07.670 --> 02:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
was not made available under paragraph
 
02:48:09.429 --> 02:48:09.439 align:start position:0%
one a third party may request the
 
02:48:09.439 --> 02:48:10.710 align:start position:0%
one a third party may request the
disclosure

02:48:10.710 --> 02:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
disclosure
 
02:48:12.710 --> 02:48:12.720 align:start position:0%
but i think they're specifically talking
 
02:48:16.389 --> 02:48:16.399 align:start position:0%
about the source of a model act
 
02:48:17.990 --> 02:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
02:48:18.000 --> 02:48:19.030 align:start position:0%
rather than
a

02:48:19.030 --> 02:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:48:21.590 --> 02:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
individual that gave you the idea for a
 
02:48:23.510 --> 02:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
bill if that's what you're
 
02:48:25.510 --> 02:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
referring to that you would not have to
 
02:48:25.520 --> 02:48:26.950 align:start position:0%
referring to that you would not have to
disclose

02:48:26.950 --> 02:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
disclose
 
02:48:26.960 --> 02:48:27.750 align:start position:0%
disclose
that

02:48:27.750 --> 02:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:48:30.309 --> 02:48:30.319 align:start position:0%
the idea came from an individual it
 
02:48:31.830 --> 02:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
would have to be from
 
02:48:34.550 --> 02:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
from an existing model act
 
02:48:38.230 --> 02:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:38.240 --> 02:48:40.150 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:48:40.150 --> 02:48:40.160 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:48:43.269 --> 02:48:43.279 align:start position:0%
sorry model legislation is defined
 
02:48:45.670 --> 02:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
it's a legislative proposal or a uniform
 
02:48:47.590 --> 02:48:47.600 align:start position:0%
or suggested act written promoted or
 
02:48:49.349 --> 02:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
distributed by a partnership firm
 
02:48:51.830 --> 02:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
non-profit entity or corporation to an
 
02:48:53.750 --> 02:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
elected official into other public
 
02:48:55.830 --> 02:48:55.840 align:start position:0%
officials of at least one more state and
 
02:48:59.030 --> 02:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
then formally adopted is also defined
 
02:49:01.190 --> 02:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
and according to this bill it means that
 
02:49:03.429 --> 02:49:03.439 align:start position:0%
the partnership firm nonprofit entity or
 
02:49:03.439 --> 02:49:04.710 align:start position:0%
the partnership firm nonprofit entity or
corporation

02:49:04.710 --> 02:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
corporation
 
02:49:06.630 --> 02:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
votes to endorse support or distribute
 
02:49:12.150 --> 02:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:13.990 --> 02:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
nope no that's hard that's why we're
 
02:49:16.150 --> 02:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
here representative schultz
 
02:49:18.469 --> 02:49:18.479 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i want to just
 
02:49:20.309 --> 02:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
hang a lantern on
 
02:49:21.670 --> 02:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
the intent
 
02:49:23.990 --> 02:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
behind the bill because
 
02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:24.950 align:start position:0%
behind the bill because
um

02:49:24.950 --> 02:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:29.269 --> 02:49:29.279 align:start position:0%
famous organizations like alec have
 
02:49:32.950 --> 02:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
provided a number of bill language to
 
02:49:34.790 --> 02:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
our colleagues
 
02:49:36.790 --> 02:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
and i find it helpful to know if that's
 
02:49:39.030 --> 02:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
the source but
 
02:49:42.630 --> 02:49:42.640 align:start position:0%
just yesterday i was asked by a reporter
 
02:49:44.630 --> 02:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
on an immigration bill
 
02:49:46.950 --> 02:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
if that language came from an
 
02:49:49.110 --> 02:49:49.120 align:start position:0%
organization that is declared by the
 
02:49:51.269 --> 02:49:51.279 align:start position:0%
southern poverty law center
 
02:49:54.070 --> 02:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
to be a hate group
 
02:49:56.870 --> 02:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
you may know the group fair
 
02:49:58.469 --> 02:49:58.479 align:start position:0%
you may disagree with the southern
 
02:50:00.950 --> 02:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
poverty law center
 
02:50:02.950 --> 02:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
but it would be helpful to know
 
02:50:05.510 --> 02:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
because the implication is
 
02:50:05.520 --> 02:50:06.469 align:start position:0%
because the implication is
that

02:50:06.469 --> 02:50:06.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:50:08.630 --> 02:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
certain anti-immigration bills that have
 
02:50:10.790 --> 02:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
come through the house are actually from
 
02:50:13.590 --> 02:50:13.600 align:start position:0%
this very well-funded organization
 
02:50:16.870 --> 02:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
i think our constituents
 
02:50:19.349 --> 02:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
deserve to know and
 
02:50:20.790 --> 02:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
you probably could point out
 
02:50:23.110 --> 02:50:23.120 align:start position:0%
organizations on our side that you would
 
02:50:24.950 --> 02:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
like to know about too
 
02:50:28.150 --> 02:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
i think that it's a reasonable request
 
02:50:30.710 --> 02:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
and that a reporter asked me
 
02:50:33.110 --> 02:50:33.120 align:start position:0%
is i think meaningful i suggested she
 
02:50:35.830 --> 02:50:35.840 align:start position:0%
talked to the sponsors but for whatever
 
02:50:37.510 --> 02:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
it's worth
 
02:50:39.830 --> 02:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative schultz
 
02:50:45.910 --> 02:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:47.429 --> 02:50:47.439 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
02:50:49.190 --> 02:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
ask the clerk to call the roll
 
02:50:51.349 --> 02:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
representative green yes
 
02:50:53.750 --> 02:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative osborne

sponsor filed this bill
 
02:58:13.429 --> 02:58:13.439 align:start position:0%
um a few months prior to our last
 
02:58:15.030 --> 02:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
meeting at the doubletree for a general
 
02:58:15.040 --> 02:58:16.070 align:start position:0%
meeting at the doubletree for a general
session

02:58:16.070 --> 02:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
session
 
02:58:17.990 --> 02:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
at that time we suspended the rules and
 
02:58:19.269 --> 02:58:19.279 align:start position:0%
basically took care of this issue so
 
02:58:22.710 --> 02:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
it's no longer necessary
 
02:58:25.349 --> 02:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
representative expedia
 
02:58:26.790 --> 02:58:26.800 align:start position:0%

that i think you know it was handled for
 
02:58:36.550 --> 02:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
for this you know biennium i think we
 
02:58:39.349 --> 02:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
need legislation that would
 
02:58:41.590 --> 02:58:41.600 align:start position:0%
um you know just in case we had any
 
02:58:43.030 --> 02:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
other circumstances where we would have
 
02:58:45.190 --> 02:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
to change the state uh
 
02:58:47.030 --> 02:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
the state house that we would have to
 
02:58:47.040 --> 02:58:47.990 align:start position:0%
the state house that we would have to
move

02:58:47.990 --> 02:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
move
 
02:58:50.070 --> 02:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
then we would you know it would be good
 
02:58:52.309 --> 02:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
to be able to change that so
 
02:58:55.269 --> 02:58:55.279 align:start position:0%
and be able to pay travel alone so
 
02:58:57.030 --> 02:58:57.040 align:start position:0%

03:03:04.150 --> 03:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
chair um you know this bill is just uh
 
03:03:05.590 --> 03:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
something that the
 
03:03:08.309 --> 03:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
house has kind of gone back and forth on
 
03:03:11.349 --> 03:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the fiscal committee
 
03:03:11.359 --> 03:03:12.389 align:start position:0%
um in terms of the fiscal committee
um

03:03:12.389 --> 03:03:12.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:14.550 --> 03:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
and you know i know that representative
 
03:03:15.990 --> 03:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
ruler you've mentioned this before in
 
03:03:18.950 --> 03:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
the past of uh you know it would be well
 
03:03:20.630 --> 03:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
sorry i'm not gonna put words in your
 
03:03:21.670 --> 03:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
mouth but i
 
03:03:22.630 --> 03:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
i think
 
03:03:24.230 --> 03:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
from my perspective we want to make sure
 
03:03:26.710 --> 03:03:26.720 align:start position:0%
that you know if we switch back and
 
03:03:28.710 --> 03:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
forth no we don't just you know i don't
 
03:03:30.710 --> 03:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
think that the democratic or republican
 
03:03:32.309 --> 03:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
party is gonna you know have a
 
03:03:33.990 --> 03:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
stronghold over
 
03:03:36.710 --> 03:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
um over who's in charge of the state
 
03:03:40.070 --> 03:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
house for forever but um you know i
 
03:03:41.910 --> 03:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
think it would be fair to be able to you
 
03:03:44.630 --> 03:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
know have the fiscal committee be
 
03:03:47.910 --> 03:03:47.920 align:start position:0%
um have a set number of folks um and
 
03:03:49.429 --> 03:03:49.439 align:start position:0%
then also
 
03:03:52.870 --> 03:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
have um the members be chosen by the
 
03:03:54.870 --> 03:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
minority leader rather than
 
03:03:57.190 --> 03:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
the speaker um
 
03:03:59.030 --> 03:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
and so because i think they know their
 
03:04:00.630 --> 03:04:00.640 align:start position:0%
their party well we hope they know their
 
03:04:04.389 --> 03:04:04.399 align:start position:0%
party best um and so i think this bill
 
03:04:06.230 --> 03:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
would you know would be a good a good
 
03:04:09.190 --> 03:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
idea for for the future
 
03:04:09.200 --> 03:04:10.150 align:start position:0%
idea for for the future
so

03:04:10.150 --> 03:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:04:11.750 --> 03:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's why i will be voting now on the
 
03:04:11.760 --> 03:04:13.190 align:start position:0%

oregon would you like to speak to them i
 
03:10:38.830 --> 03:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
apologize for being late i
 
03:10:42.950 --> 03:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
was i was at a another meeting the i
 
03:10:44.630 --> 03:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
actually have not seen the amendment but
 
03:10:47.830 --> 03:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
i've seen a lot of these bills and i
 
03:10:50.870 --> 03:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
these articles from five conventions or
 
03:10:52.710 --> 03:10:52.720 align:start position:0%
these other interstate conventions they
 
03:10:54.950 --> 03:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
will be
 
03:10:56.710 --> 03:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
function like legislative bodies just
 
03:10:58.469 --> 03:10:58.479 align:start position:0%
like this house or the us congress
 
03:11:00.150 --> 03:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
they'll set their own rules there'll be
 
03:11:01.910 --> 03:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
some sort of enabling act that says how
 
03:11:01.920 --> 03:11:03.030 align:start position:0%
some sort of enabling act that says how
many

03:11:03.030 --> 03:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
many
 
03:11:04.710 --> 03:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
delegates we have so certainly what's in
 
03:11:06.710 --> 03:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
the bill is introduced
 
03:11:08.469 --> 03:11:08.479 align:start position:0%
has nothing
 
03:11:10.710 --> 03:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with necessary to do
 
03:11:12.870 --> 03:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
with what the parameters for any future
 
03:11:16.309 --> 03:11:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:17.910 --> 03:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
feel silly breezing in here and then
 
03:11:19.750 --> 03:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
saying this but i think this uh
 
03:11:21.349 --> 03:11:21.359 align:start position:0%
i think this bill is off on the wrong
 
03:11:23.910 --> 03:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
track altogether and we should probably
 
03:11:25.590 --> 03:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
if there is any such convention of
 
03:11:27.030 --> 03:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
course new hampshire should participate
 
03:11:29.190 --> 03:11:29.200 align:start position:0%
but we will probably have to participate
 
03:11:30.790 --> 03:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
representative we're talking about the
 
03:11:33.269 --> 03:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
amendment at the moment not not the bill
 
03:11:35.110 --> 03:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
okay what to see
 
03:11:36.630 --> 03:11:36.640 align:start position:0%
if i can get you the amendment yes
 
03:11:38.870 --> 03:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
please do okay okay so does anyone have
 
03:11:42.229 --> 03:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
an extra copy for the for the amendment
 
03:11:44.710 --> 03:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
is there any other
 
03:11:44.720 --> 03:11:45.830 align:start position:0%
is there any other
comments

03:11:45.830 --> 03:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
comments
 
03:11:49.190 --> 03:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
concerns questions about the amendment
 
03:11:51.110 --> 03:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
representative harrigan yes i see at
 
03:11:53.269 --> 03:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
least one of my concerns has not yet
 
03:11:55.349 --> 03:11:55.359 align:start position:0%
been met which was there we're deciding
 
03:11:57.429 --> 03:11:57.439 align:start position:0%
how many members are in our delegation
 
03:11:59.670 --> 03:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
and that's uh
 
03:11:59.680 --> 03:12:00.630 align:start position:0%
and that's uh
that's

03:12:00.630 --> 03:12:00.640 align:start position:0%
that's
 
03:12:01.990 --> 03:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
not necessarily going to be the number
 
03:12:03.910 --> 03:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
of members we have in any such
 
03:12:05.830 --> 03:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
convention and we would have to
 
03:12:07.190 --> 03:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
pass and we would
 
03:12:08.870 --> 03:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
we would have to pass another we would
 
03:12:10.469 --> 03:12:10.479 align:start position:0%
have to amend the law or pass another
 
03:12:12.710 --> 03:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
enabling act in order to participate but
 
03:12:12.720 --> 03:12:13.750 align:start position:0%
enabling act in order to participate but
um

03:12:13.750 --> 03:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:12:15.990 --> 03:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
and also these things
 
03:12:20.150 --> 03:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
i've seen the part three um
 
03:12:22.070 --> 03:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
we're worried about an unauthorized
 
03:12:23.670 --> 03:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
using the constitutional amendment
 
03:12:25.030 --> 03:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
anything that comes out of these
 
03:12:26.950 --> 03:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
conventions would have to
 
03:12:29.269 --> 03:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
be ratified by the states or ratified in
 
03:12:31.030 --> 03:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
some other ways so anything
 
03:12:33.110 --> 03:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
and there's a there's a very difficult
 
03:12:34.710 --> 03:12:34.720 align:start position:0%
super majority it's very hard to get a
 
03:12:36.070 --> 03:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment passed so
 
03:12:38.070 --> 03:12:38.080 align:start position:0%
anything any authorized amendment would
 
03:12:39.510 --> 03:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
have no effect unless it actually got
 
03:12:41.269 --> 03:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
ratified and if it got ratified my
 
03:12:42.550 --> 03:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
belief is
 
03:12:43.990 --> 03:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
it would be
 
03:12:45.990 --> 03:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
something very popular that had broad
 
03:12:47.510 --> 03:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
popular support here in new hampshire
 
03:12:49.030 --> 03:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
and nationwide and
 
03:12:49.040 --> 03:12:50.309 align:start position:0%
and nationwide and
we

03:12:50.309 --> 03:12:50.319 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:12:51.750 --> 03:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
would probably be taking a political
 
03:12:52.950 --> 03:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
risk and
 
03:12:54.630 --> 03:12:54.640 align:start position:0%
blocking its ratification and
 
03:12:56.309 --> 03:12:56.319 align:start position:0%
overturning the will of the people so
 
03:13:00.229 --> 03:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
that's that's just my opinion today
 
03:13:01.830 --> 03:13:01.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representative horror again
 
03:13:04.710 --> 03:13:04.720 align:start position:0%

03:13:09.680 --> 03:13:10.950 align:start position:0%

03:15:34.309 --> 03:15:34.319 align:start position:0%
representative wallace would you like to
 
03:15:36.309 --> 03:15:36.319 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
 
03:15:38.150 --> 03:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
yes thank you briefly although new
 
03:15:39.910 --> 03:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire has but one house concurrent
 
03:15:41.670 --> 03:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
resolution pending the ballot's budget
 
03:15:43.670 --> 03:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
amendment resolution there are several
 
03:15:45.670 --> 03:15:45.680 align:start position:0%
pending that are
 
03:15:47.190 --> 03:15:47.200 align:start position:0%
there are several pending they are the
 
03:15:49.349 --> 03:15:49.359 align:start position:0%
balanced budget amendment with 27 states
 
03:15:51.190 --> 03:15:51.200 align:start position:0%
on board presently convention estates
 
03:15:54.150 --> 03:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
with 17 wolfpack with five and u.s
 
03:15:56.469 --> 03:15:56.479 align:start position:0%
trimulants with four with a total of 42
 
03:15:58.229 --> 03:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
states with some type of resolution
 
03:15:58.239 --> 03:15:59.190 align:start position:0%
states with some type of resolution
pending

03:15:59.190 --> 03:15:59.200 align:start position:0%
pending
 
03:16:00.550 --> 03:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
that being said it's crucial to have
 
03:16:03.190 --> 03:16:03.200 align:start position:0%
these guard rails in place prior to the
 
03:16:04.870 --> 03:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
convention call regardless of your
 
03:16:16.229 --> 03:16:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:17.830 --> 03:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
all right all set thank you
 
03:16:19.830 --> 03:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
representative wallace um
 
03:16:21.190 --> 03:16:21.200 align:start position:0%
further comment
 
03:16:23.830 --> 03:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
representative oregon well basically
 
03:16:25.349 --> 03:16:25.359 align:start position:0%
just what i said when debating the
 
03:16:27.030 --> 03:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
amendment the uh
 
03:16:28.950 --> 03:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
the amendment did not meet the
 
03:16:31.030 --> 03:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
objections that i present i apologize
 
03:16:32.870 --> 03:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
for speaking out of turn but
 
03:16:34.790 --> 03:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
just the fact remains that
 
03:16:36.870 --> 03:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
if such a convention
 
03:16:38.870 --> 03:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
came along it would
 
03:16:40.469 --> 03:16:40.479 align:start position:0%
there would be some sort of enabling act
 
03:16:42.229 --> 03:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
it would have its own rules so it's not
 
03:16:45.750 --> 03:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to say that we have
 
03:16:45.760 --> 03:16:46.630 align:start position:0%
necessarily going to say that we have
four

03:16:46.630 --> 03:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
four
 
03:16:48.630 --> 03:16:48.640 align:start position:0%
members and three three alternates it
 
03:16:50.469 --> 03:16:50.479 align:start position:0%
could be uh that's i mean that's a
 
03:16:52.229 --> 03:16:52.239 align:start position:0%
number of congressional
 
03:16:54.070 --> 03:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
that's the number of u.s reps and
 
03:16:55.590 --> 03:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
senators have but there's no guarantee
 
03:16:57.030 --> 03:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
of that it could be something else and
 
03:16:58.389 --> 03:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
it might even
 
03:17:00.150 --> 03:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
say how they're going to be appointed
 
03:17:02.070 --> 03:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
they might not necessarily be appointed
 
03:17:04.389 --> 03:17:04.399 align:start position:0%
by the legislature might ask for popular
 
03:17:06.309 --> 03:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
elections i think this
 
03:17:06.319 --> 03:17:07.190 align:start position:0%
elections i think this
uh

03:17:07.190 --> 03:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:17:09.269 --> 03:17:09.279 align:start position:0%
so i think this thing is uh it's
 
03:17:11.349 --> 03:17:11.359 align:start position:0%
premature and i think it also probably
 
03:17:12.710 --> 03:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
does not match
 
03:17:14.389 --> 03:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
what we would actually be asked to do
 
03:17:16.950 --> 03:17:16.960 align:start position:0%
and there should be ample time
 
03:17:20.389 --> 03:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
to pass uh to pass an rsa to uh
 
03:17:20.399 --> 03:17:21.670 align:start position:0%
to pass uh to pass an rsa to uh
to

03:17:21.670 --> 03:17:21.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:17:24.229 --> 03:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
cover this issue and also
 
03:17:25.990 --> 03:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
also we we if we had to elect the
 
03:17:27.269 --> 03:17:27.279 align:start position:0%
officials we'd have to make a number of
 
03:17:30.710 --> 03:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
changes to election law too so um that's
 
03:17:32.710 --> 03:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
that's why i'm feel silly breezing in

um
 
03:20:26.550 --> 03:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
i would ask representative simon for
 
03:20:31.269 --> 03:20:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:34.790 --> 03:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i would uh move itl
 
03:20:36.229 --> 03:20:36.239 align:start position:0%

03:20:38.309 --> 03:20:38.319 align:start position:0%
thank you representative simon is there
 
03:20:40.229 --> 03:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
a second second
 
03:20:43.389 --> 03:20:43.399 align:start position:0%
representative green seconds house bill
 
03:20:46.389 --> 03:20:46.399 align:start position:0%
1309 itl
 
03:20:47.910 --> 03:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
representative simon would you like to
 
03:20:50.150 --> 03:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
 
03:20:50.160 --> 03:20:51.429 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
um

03:20:51.429 --> 03:20:51.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:54.630 --> 03:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:56.070 --> 03:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
so there are a couple different things
 
03:20:57.990 --> 03:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
with this bill uh real quickly one is
 
03:20:59.830 --> 03:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
that it invites the senate into a
 
03:21:02.389 --> 03:21:02.399 align:start position:0%
process on house rules which seems
 
03:21:04.070 --> 03:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
to not make a lot of sense
 
03:21:04.080 --> 03:21:06.070 align:start position:0%
to not make a lot of sense
um

03:21:06.070 --> 03:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:09.190 --> 03:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
the other is uh we heard testimony
 
03:21:12.070 --> 03:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
that most of these things are are added
 
03:21:15.510 --> 03:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
in by the senate and not by ourselves
 
03:21:15.520 --> 03:21:17.030 align:start position:0%
in by the senate and not by ourselves
um

03:21:17.030 --> 03:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:19.750 --> 03:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
and so it seems strange to to
 
03:21:21.910 --> 03:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
do this on the house side uh so with
 
03:21:24.870 --> 03:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
that i i'd move itl on 1309. thank you
 
03:21:26.630 --> 03:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
representative simon is there further
 
03:21:35.510 --> 03:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:37.269 --> 03:21:37.279 align:start position:0%
representative expedia
 
03:21:40.070 --> 03:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
now just given the depth that the budget
 
03:21:42.790 --> 03:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
trailer bill gets in hb2
 
03:21:42.800 --> 03:21:43.830 align:start position:0%
trailer bill gets in hb2
and

03:21:43.830 --> 03:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:21:45.990 --> 03:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
each individual part i think it would be
 
03:21:47.429 --> 03:21:47.439 align:start position:0%
worthwhile to
 
03:21:50.790 --> 03:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
establish you know to study that and
 
03:21:53.990 --> 03:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
and to create a committee to just take a
 
03:21:56.070 --> 03:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
look at it and so we'll i'll be voting
 
03:21:58.950 --> 03:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
no on the uh on an ito
 
03:22:01.030 --> 03:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative expedia anyone
 
03:22:03.990 --> 03:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
else on house bill 1309
 
03:22:06.309 --> 03:22:06.319 align:start position:0%
representative simon just real quickly
 
03:22:07.590 --> 03:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
uh just
 
03:22:09.590 --> 03:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
um off of representative espida's uh
 
03:22:11.670 --> 03:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
comments i'm not sure that the
 
03:22:13.190 --> 03:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
conflict is necessarily on whether or
 
03:22:14.469 --> 03:22:14.479 align:start position:0%
not we want things to get a public
 
03:22:16.550 --> 03:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
hearing just for the record i think
 
03:22:17.830 --> 03:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
i would like to see things get an
 
03:22:19.910 --> 03:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
adequate public hearing as well just the
 
03:22:21.190 --> 03:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
the way that the bill itself is
 
03:22:23.510 --> 03:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
constructed um there are just too many
 
03:22:24.950 --> 03:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
flaws in it for this to be an
 
03:22:26.710 --> 03:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate vehicle to make that happen
 
03:22:29.190 --> 03:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
so just so just to say that at least as
 
03:22:30.389 --> 03:22:30.399 align:start position:0%
from my perspective we're on the same
 
03:22:32.710 --> 03:22:32.720 align:start position:0%

03:22:34.309 --> 03:22:34.319 align:start position:0%

uh yes mr chair thank you um i
 
03:24:56.309 --> 03:24:56.319 align:start position:0%
understand that there are a lot of
 
03:24:58.309 --> 03:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
difficulties um
 
03:25:00.309 --> 03:25:00.319 align:start position:0%
when you run for office as far as time
 
03:25:02.389 --> 03:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
constraints and responsibilities
 
03:25:02.399 --> 03:25:04.070 align:start position:0%
constraints and responsibilities
um

03:25:04.070 --> 03:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:05.670 --> 03:25:05.680 align:start position:0%
first off i don't really want to add
 
03:25:07.190 --> 03:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
another study committee to an already
 
03:25:09.750 --> 03:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
overburdened study committee
 
03:25:09.760 --> 03:25:10.710 align:start position:0%
overburdened study committee
sector

03:25:10.710 --> 03:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
sector
 
03:25:12.469 --> 03:25:12.479 align:start position:0%
of work for us but
 
03:25:13.750 --> 03:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
just as a
 
03:25:15.590 --> 03:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
a general rule
 
03:25:17.990 --> 03:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
as a business owner i have a hard time
 
03:25:19.590 --> 03:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
wrapping my head around asking myself
 
03:25:22.229 --> 03:25:22.239 align:start position:0%
and other people who run businesses to
 
03:25:24.389 --> 03:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
pay taxes to offer a service that we
 
03:25:26.550 --> 03:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
ourselves aren't able to
 
03:25:30.469 --> 03:25:30.479 align:start position:0%
provide for our our own workers
 
03:25:31.429 --> 03:25:31.439 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:25:33.990 --> 03:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
i'm always a little hesitant when we
 
03:25:35.830 --> 03:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
when we start off this kind of
 
03:25:37.670 --> 03:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
conversation this way
 
03:25:39.429 --> 03:25:39.439 align:start position:0%
where we do it at the state level when
 
03:25:40.550 --> 03:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
the people who will be paying for it
 
03:25:42.389 --> 03:25:42.399 align:start position:0%
can't necessarily provide it and might
 
03:25:44.550 --> 03:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
want to provide it further for their own
 
03:25:47.750 --> 03:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
employees so with that i would move itl
 
03:25:50.710 --> 03:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
representative simon moves itl uh are
 
03:25:53.110 --> 03:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
there any other comments questions
 
03:25:55.990 --> 03:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
representative wall
 
03:25:59.429 --> 03:25:59.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i
 
03:26:01.429 --> 03:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
quite honestly was against this to begin
 
03:26:02.710 --> 03:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
with but then i looked at who the
 
03:26:04.389 --> 03:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
sponsors were and though we didn't hear
 
03:26:07.429 --> 03:26:07.439 align:start position:0%
from representative wallner she owns a
 
03:26:08.550 --> 03:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
couple of
 
03:26:10.950 --> 03:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
daycare centers here in new hampshire in
 
03:26:13.429 --> 03:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
concord excuse me
 
03:26:15.190 --> 03:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
i feel if someone
 
03:26:16.870 --> 03:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
of that caliber who is at that
 
03:26:18.229 --> 03:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
reputation that's been in the
 
03:26:20.790 --> 03:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
legislature a very long time wants to
 
03:26:21.990 --> 03:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
look at this
 
03:26:24.710 --> 03:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
and figure out what to do
 
03:26:26.309 --> 03:26:26.319 align:start position:0%
then it might be worth it we had this
 
03:26:29.429 --> 03:26:29.439 align:start position:0%
bill last time and we didn't pass it
 
03:26:31.269 --> 03:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean that
 
03:26:33.110 --> 03:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
what some of the sponsors wanted was for
 
03:26:35.830 --> 03:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
us to have daycare right here in the llb
 
03:26:38.229 --> 03:26:38.239 align:start position:0%
it means options somewhere around and
 
03:26:41.349 --> 03:26:41.359 align:start position:0%
what to look at and how to do this so uh
 
03:26:43.750 --> 03:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
given the fact that we have someone who
 
03:26:45.750 --> 03:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
owns a couple of daycare centers who
 
03:26:47.990 --> 03:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
wants to look at this further i'm going
 
03:26:50.229 --> 03:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
to support this bill
 
03:26:52.309 --> 03:26:52.319 align:start position:0%
thank you representative while any
 
03:26:54.870 --> 03:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
further yep representative
 
03:26:57.110 --> 03:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
i would just like to comment that um
 
03:26:57.120 --> 03:26:57.910 align:start position:0%
i would just like to comment that um
in

03:26:57.910 --> 03:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:27:00.229 --> 03:27:00.239 align:start position:0%
in off comments there was a really great
 
03:27:02.550 --> 03:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
suggestion on how to make sure that we
 
03:27:05.110 --> 03:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
can support our study committees and so
 
03:27:07.429 --> 03:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
i hope to see that come forward but i
 
03:27:09.910 --> 03:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
don't think that that just because we
 
03:27:11.590 --> 03:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
have a lot of study committees means
 
03:27:13.910 --> 03:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
that we should not be supporting another
 
03:27:15.910 --> 03:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
one when there is something as important
 
03:27:18.389 --> 03:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
as this to look at which is an issue
 
03:27:21.830 --> 03:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
that really our economy is is relying on
 
03:27:23.030 --> 03:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
right now so
 
03:27:25.590 --> 03:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna vote against the itl and in
 
03:27:27.590 --> 03:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
support of this thank you representative
 
03:27:27.600 --> 03:27:28.710 align:start position:0%
support of this thank you representative
richards

03:27:28.710 --> 03:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
richards
 
03:27:30.630 --> 03:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
representative schultz
 
03:27:33.510 --> 03:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i agree with all
 
03:27:35.510 --> 03:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
the things that my democratic colleagues
 
03:27:37.349 --> 03:27:37.359 align:start position:0%
have said and i happen
 
03:27:40.229 --> 03:27:40.239 align:start position:0%
to know that we have more than one
 
03:27:43.590 --> 03:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
member uh on both sides of the aisle men
 
03:27:46.389 --> 03:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
and women who have young children that
 
03:27:48.229 --> 03:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
uh do struggle
 
03:27:51.429 --> 03:27:51.439 align:start position:0%
with their with their abilities to
 
03:27:54.070 --> 03:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
attend and and do
 
03:27:57.269 --> 03:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
uh the work that we do in part because
 
03:27:59.510 --> 03:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
of concerns around this and
 
03:28:01.190 --> 03:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
you know i don't think this study
 
03:28:03.429 --> 03:28:03.439 align:start position:0%
committee is offensive in any way
 
03:28:05.830 --> 03:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
uh it probably will benefit folks like
 
03:28:08.309 --> 03:28:08.319 align:start position:0%
the gentle lady from nashua
 
03:28:11.269 --> 03:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
and i think it's um
 
03:28:13.670 --> 03:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
you know it's just a study committee
 
03:28:16.950 --> 03:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
there's no harm in the conversation
 
03:28:18.229 --> 03:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative charles for
 
03:28:21.429 --> 03:28:21.439 align:start position:0%
representative harrigan um yes i think
 
03:28:23.030 --> 03:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
i think this committee will help us not
 
03:28:25.510 --> 03:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
just to figure out
 
03:28:27.830 --> 03:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
how to handle child care for our own
 
03:28:30.150 --> 03:28:30.160 align:start position:0%
members and there's more to it than just
 
03:28:31.910 --> 03:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
you know providing some sort of daycare
 
03:28:34.469 --> 03:28:34.479 align:start position:0%
or nursery it also may mean how we
 
03:28:36.309 --> 03:28:36.319 align:start position:0%
how our what our procedures are and how
 
03:28:39.429 --> 03:28:39.439 align:start position:0%
we meet and when we meet and
 
03:28:42.870 --> 03:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
also this legislature is uh
 
03:28:44.950 --> 03:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
gradually getting younger i've been here
 
03:28:47.910 --> 03:28:47.920 align:start position:0%
14 years i'm 65 years old when i came
 
03:28:47.920 --> 03:28:49.269 align:start position:0%
14 years i'm 65 years old when i came
here

03:28:49.269 --> 03:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:28:51.429 --> 03:28:51.439 align:start position:0%
i think there are hardly any members
 
03:28:52.790 --> 03:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
there's only a handful of members who
 
03:28:55.269 --> 03:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
had young children and i think the first
 
03:28:56.950 --> 03:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
and there's a rep who gave birth i think
 
03:28:59.190 --> 03:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
my second term a republican from
 
03:29:01.030 --> 03:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
somersworth who i think had been the
 
03:29:03.190 --> 03:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
first one first member to give birth
 
03:29:05.349 --> 03:29:05.359 align:start position:0%
well the first female member many male
 
03:29:07.990 --> 03:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
members partners had given birth um in
 
03:29:10.550 --> 03:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
a number of years and now um
 
03:29:13.830 --> 03:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
now we have uh many many reps who are
 
03:29:16.150 --> 03:29:16.160 align:start position:0%
raising raising young children so
 
03:29:17.190 --> 03:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
as a
 
03:29:19.110 --> 03:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
sort of my generation
 
03:29:20.309 --> 03:29:20.319 align:start position:0%
i mean i'm planning to be around for a
 
03:29:21.990 --> 03:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
long time but my generation is starting
 
03:29:23.429 --> 03:29:23.439 align:start position:0%
to fade from the scene we're either
 
03:29:25.349 --> 03:29:25.359 align:start position:0%
dying or moving on to other activities
 
03:29:27.990 --> 03:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
so we are becoming a younger body so i
 
03:29:29.429 --> 03:29:29.439 align:start position:0%
think we
 
03:29:30.950 --> 03:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
we should get ahead of this issue and
 
03:29:32.710 --> 03:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
having a study committee meet this fall
 
03:29:35.190 --> 03:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
issue report would be a useful first
 
03:29:37.830 --> 03:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
step so i'll vote for the committee
 
03:29:39.429 --> 03:29:39.439 align:start position:0%

03:29:52.389 --> 03:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
horrigan's uh mentioned is that child
 
03:29:54.950 --> 03:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
care options isn't necessarily just
 
03:29:57.030 --> 03:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
where do we put our kids but making sure
 
03:29:58.870 --> 03:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
that we schedule or
 
03:30:02.150 --> 03:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
could be studying when hours are good or
 
03:30:04.389 --> 03:30:04.399 align:start position:0%
even notices on how like how much time
 
03:30:06.229 --> 03:30:06.239 align:start position:0%

child care
 
03:30:10.229 --> 03:30:10.239 align:start position:0%

17-0
 
03:39:11.110 --> 03:39:11.120 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask
 
03:39:13.349 --> 03:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
that we not put this on the consent
 
03:39:13.359 --> 03:39:14.469 align:start position:0%
that we not put this on the consent
calendar

03:39:14.469 --> 03:39:14.479 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
03:39:14.479 --> 03:39:16.150 align:start position:0%
calendar
although

03:39:16.150 --> 03:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
although
 
03:39:18.790 --> 03:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
the idea is if we don't put it on the
 
03:39:21.349 --> 03:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
consent calendar
 
03:39:24.150 --> 03:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure this is the right time
 
03:39:25.830 --> 03:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
this is going to be an enormous session
 
03:39:27.510 --> 03:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
that we have coming up
 
03:39:29.990 --> 03:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm wondering if we do put it on
 
03:39:32.790 --> 03:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
the consent and then in in a future date
 
03:39:33.990 --> 03:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
we do
 
03:39:37.750 --> 03:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
um a unanimous consent and um we explain
 
03:39:39.750 --> 03:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
how this all works and where we go yeah
 
03:39:46.469 --> 03:39:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:46.479 --> 03:39:49.349 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:39:49.349 --> 03:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:51.349 --> 03:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
i'm getting i'm getting the shake over
 
03:39:54.950 --> 03:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
there uh from from uh our house clerk
 
03:39:58.070 --> 03:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
i i think the idea is that um time is of
 
03:40:01.030 --> 03:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
the essence here and and if we can
 
03:40:03.429 --> 03:40:03.439 align:start position:0%
if it's not an early bill just don't
 
03:40:06.950 --> 03:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:08.710 --> 03:40:08.720 align:start position:0%
yep we could do that
 
03:40:10.309 --> 03:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
we could do that we can hang on to it
 
03:40:14.150 --> 03:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
and then do um in the in the next
 
03:40:16.870 --> 03:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
maybe the next session after we deal
 
03:40:19.510 --> 03:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
with all of the early bills is that
 
03:40:21.030 --> 03:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
where house clerk would you like to
 
03:40:22.229 --> 03:40:22.239 align:start position:0%
speak yep
 
03:40:46.950 --> 03:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:48.630 --> 03:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
let's think about it
 
03:40:48.640 --> 03:40:49.429 align:start position:0%
let's think about it
um

03:40:49.429 --> 03:40:49.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:55.670 --> 03:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:55.680 --> 03:40:57.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:40:57.670 --> 03:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:40:59.910 --> 03:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
because it does cry out for uh
 
03:41:02.790 --> 03:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
conversation on the floor and uh
 
03:41:04.950 --> 03:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
and we'll do our best to make that
 
03:41:07.590 --> 03:41:07.600 align:start position:0%
happen i guess i'll leave it at that
 
03:41:07.600 --> 03:41:09.030 align:start position:0%
happen i guess i'll leave it at that
um

03:41:09.030 --> 03:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:12.229 --> 03:41:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:22.389 --> 03:41:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:24.469 --> 03:41:24.479 align:start position:0%
it's not a bad idea either but we need
 
03:41:24.479 --> 03:41:26.950 align:start position:0%
it's not a bad idea either but we need
to

03:41:26.950 --> 03:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:29.269 --> 03:41:29.279 align:start position:0%
who knows when that will be first of all
 
03:41:30.950 --> 03:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
and secondly we've got a bill that we've
 
03:41:32.469 --> 03:41:32.479 align:start position:0%
got to do something with but i agree
 
03:41:34.309 --> 03:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
with you it would be interesting if we
 
03:41:35.990 --> 03:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
could show it
 
03:41:37.189 --> 03:41:37.199 align:start position:0%
you could have we could have the
 
03:41:38.870 --> 03:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
majority leader hold up the little
 
03:41:45.830 --> 03:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:48.309 --> 03:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
yeah right right
 
03:41:50.389 --> 03:41:50.399 align:start position:0%
oh that's right sorry no props you can't
 
03:41:50.399 --> 03:41:53.030 align:start position:0%
oh that's right sorry no props you can't
uh

03:41:53.030 --> 03:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:54.830 --> 03:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
yeah i think it would
 
03:41:57.990 --> 03:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
be i think it would be
 
03:41:58.000 --> 03:41:58.790 align:start position:0%
be i think it would be
yeah

03:41:58.790 --> 03:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:42:01.030 --> 03:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
we'll figure out something here
 
03:42:03.189 --> 03:42:03.199 align:start position:0%
there's also the option to
 
03:42:04.950 --> 03:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
put it on the regular calendar but then
 
03:42:11.830 --> 03:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:15.110 --> 03:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
we'll um we'll have a conversation
 
03:42:17.750 --> 03:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
um the three of us uh representative
 
03:42:20.150 --> 03:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
wall rep and the house clerk and i and
 
03:42:20.160 --> 03:42:21.510 align:start position:0%
wall rep and the house clerk and i and
we'll

03:42:21.510 --> 03:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
we'll
 
03:42:23.590 --> 03:42:23.600 align:start position:0%
we'll work on something special
 
03:42:27.030 --> 03:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:30.790 --> 03:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
last bill i'm going to ask this is house
 
03:42:33.590 --> 03:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution 9.
 
03:42:36.550 --> 03:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
i spoke with the prime sponsor on it
 
03:42:39.269 --> 03:42:39.279 align:start position:0%
really all he wanted out of this was a
 
03:42:42.469 --> 03:42:42.479 align:start position:0%
um a certificate some recognition
 
03:42:45.349 --> 03:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
um really didn't need to be filed as a
 
03:42:46.550 --> 03:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
as a
 
03:42:46.560 --> 03:42:48.070 align:start position:0%
as a
bill

03:42:48.070 --> 03:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:42:48.080 --> 03:42:49.269 align:start position:0%
bill
so

03:42:49.269 --> 03:42:49.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:42:51.189 --> 03:42:51.199 align:start position:0%
we're already working with the speaker's
 
03:42:53.110 --> 03:42:53.120 align:start position:0%
office on that
 
03:42:56.870 --> 03:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:59.830 --> 03:42:59.840 align:start position:0%
one suggestion or one request and that
 
03:43:02.469 --> 03:43:02.479 align:start position:0%
was for us to not kill it
 
03:43:02.479 --> 03:43:03.590 align:start position:0%
was for us to not kill it
because

03:43:03.590 --> 03:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:43:05.750 --> 03:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
by the time the certificate gets there
 
03:43:08.710 --> 03:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
he doesn't want this person to
 
03:43:12.150 --> 03:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
be seeing that the committee killed her
 
03:43:15.750 --> 03:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
or bill so i'm requesting that we um
 
03:43:18.389 --> 03:43:18.399 align:start position:0%
that we move into someone moves interim
 
03:43:22.070 --> 03:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
study on this so that it it's not dead
 
03:43:24.870 --> 03:43:24.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's here and then he can surprise
 
03:43:27.830 --> 03:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
her with the certificate hopefully she's
 
03:43:29.590 --> 03:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
not watching
 
03:43:32.469 --> 03:43:32.479 align:start position:0%
um so moved at any rate
 
03:43:34.790 --> 03:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's my suggestion uh can i
 
03:43:36.229 --> 03:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
get a motion on
 
03:43:38.150 --> 03:43:38.160 align:start position:0%

yeah representative harrigan i'm the

prime sponsor so i was happy that they
 
03:46:21.590 --> 03:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
took my idea and improved on it i still
 
03:46:23.030 --> 03:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
think maybe my wording for the first
 
03:46:24.870 --> 03:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
part of it is better but they mean the
 
03:46:26.790 --> 03:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
same thing so i'm uh
 
03:46:29.750 --> 03:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to go yeah so i okay i like hp
 
03:46:33.189 --> 03:46:33.199 align:start position:0%
1650 and so this bill is unnecessary
 
03:46:36.510 --> 03:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
so what we'll have to do is is vote on
 
03:46:36.520 --> 03:46:38.229 align:start position:0%
