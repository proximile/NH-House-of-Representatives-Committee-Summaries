00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 align:start position:0%
okay it is um 1103 uh I would like to uh
 
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 align:start position:0%
convene a work session on House Bill 49
 
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
for those of you who uh are are just
 
00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 align:start position:0%
sort of Dipping into this issue for the
 
00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 align:start position:0%
first time House Bill 49 is uh
 
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 align:start position:0%
interconnected in many ways to
 
00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
um a much larger issue which is what are
 
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
we going to do about the sununu youth
 
00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:01.759 align:start position:0%
development center
 
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 align:start position:0%
in legislation a couple years ago we
 
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
passed into law that we must close the
 
00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
sununu center on one March and so we're
 
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
now just about three three weeks and a
 
00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 align:start position:0%
few days away from that and so there are
 
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
three separate bills that are kind of
 
00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 align:start position:0%
live in the system
 
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
HP 49 is one of them I'm a prime sponsor
 
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:32.180 align:start position:0%
um and and what it does is it it
 
00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 align:start position:0%
currently moves out the dates through
 
00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 align:start position:0%
the rest of the fiscal year there's also
 
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 align:start position:0%
a an HP 120
 
00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
that is a more comprehensive bill that's
 
00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:45.539 align:start position:0%
very close to what was done by the
 
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
committee conference nearly two years
 
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 align:start position:0%
ago it is being worked by the children
 
00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 align:start position:0%
in family law I ex I expect that it's
 
00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 align:start position:0%
probably going to be retained there for
 
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 align:start position:0%
a while and then the other one that's
 
00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:01.259 align:start position:0%
very live and in finance and getting
 
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 align:start position:0%
scheduled is sb1 it's a pretty
 
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
comprehensive Bill to replace the sununu
 
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.790 align:start position:0%
comprehensive Bill to replace the sununu
center

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 align:start position:0%
center
 
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 align:start position:0%
and provides some design criteria so
 
00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
that the architectural firms and the
 
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
people who do operational planning can
 
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 align:start position:0%
start to do do some serious analysis and
 
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
get to work
 
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 align:start position:0%
so that passed the Senate 24 to nothing
 
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.180 align:start position:0%
and it's in the the hands of Finance
 
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:32.220 align:start position:0%
we're going to have our first finance
 
00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:37.139 align:start position:0%
committee on that on the ninth so so I
 
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
talk about those three because I want
 
00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:44.479 align:start position:0%
you to everyone could we hand these out
 
00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
there's we're going to pass a graphic
 
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:50.220 align:start position:0%
around that basically visualizes of much
 
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:52.620 align:start position:0%
of what I just said but but
 
00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.340 align:start position:0%
um so so this is uh this is House Bill
 
00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:57.550 align:start position:0%
um so so this is uh this is House Bill
49

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560 align:start position:0%
49
 
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:01.610 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:01.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:05.220 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple on House Bill 49 are there
 
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.210 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:11.220 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.290 align:start position:0%
okay
so

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:12.300 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
so this is this is this is our first
 
00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:18.419 align:start position:0%
discussion in official committee on
 
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:22.020 align:start position:0%
house bill 49 and the sununu replacement
 
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:24.180 align:start position:0%
Center and we'll talk about the sununu
 
00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:26.419 align:start position:0%
replacement bill
 
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
as we talk about some amendments uh I
 
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
don't think we're going to take any
 
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:33.840 align:start position:0%
formal votes today at least certainly
 
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:35.900 align:start position:0%
not until
 
00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:39.479 align:start position:0%
representative nordgren can be here she
 
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:41.460 align:start position:0%
she's she's not going to come at all
 
00:07:43.969 --> 00:07:43.979 align:start position:0%
today so it's a no formal votes and then
 
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:45.720 align:start position:0%
you know representative stringham's not
 
00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:49.080 align:start position:0%
here so today is is is pretty much going
 
00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:52.020 align:start position:0%
to be discussion I might take some straw
 
00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:54.780 align:start position:0%
votes though representative walner just
 
00:07:56.450 --> 00:07:56.460 align:start position:0%
to get a sense of where people are at
 
00:07:59.689 --> 00:07:59.699 align:start position:0%
nothing that is binding in any way or or
 
00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:02.639 align:start position:0%
really determinative for what we advise
 
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
the finance committee of our position
 
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
but just in case we we need the sense of
 
00:08:11.089 --> 00:08:11.099 align:start position:0%
where we're at
 
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:14.580 align:start position:0%
so that's a very long intro but then I
 
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:17.340 align:start position:0%
didn't gavel so but we're we're now
 
00:08:20.689 --> 00:08:20.699 align:start position:0%
we're now in session uh and uh
 
00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:23.639 align:start position:0%
representative whole do you have a
 
00:08:25.369 --> 00:08:25.379 align:start position:0%
question I do I'm looking at this
 
00:08:25.379 --> 00:08:26.450 align:start position:0%
question I do I'm looking at this
graphic

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:26.460 align:start position:0%
graphic
 
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate whoever threw this out
 
00:08:33.529 --> 00:08:33.539 align:start position:0%
but yeah that was me I was an analyst I
 
00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
was never a graphic artist that's okay
 
00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:38.940 align:start position:0%
um broken is clear as a word is that
 
00:08:41.209 --> 00:08:41.219 align:start position:0%
attempt is the next word it's not real
 
00:08:43.329 --> 00:08:43.339 align:start position:0%
clear what how that reads
 
00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:47.100 align:start position:0%
okay so photocopies so as you read from
 
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
left to right the the left hand column
 
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:53.820 align:start position:0%
where it says RSA close the sysc and
 
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
then the committee conference those are
 
00:08:58.310 --> 00:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
two actions that happened pretty much at
 
00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:01.620 align:start position:0%
around the same time the result of those
 
00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:04.740 align:start position:0%
things those two things is that we came
 
00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:07.740 align:start position:0%
up with a badly broken process from a
 
00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
legislative perspective we we had
 
00:09:13.610 --> 00:09:13.620 align:start position:0%
determined that the sununu center would
 
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
close and we determined that we had no
 
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
idea what the replacement would look
 
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:21.420 align:start position:0%
like this is this is a backwards process
 
00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:23.700 align:start position:0%
where normally if you want to close
 
00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:25.620 align:start position:0%
something you would do the planning to
 
00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
figure out what the the replacement
 
00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:29.940 align:start position:0%
would be and then you do the transition
 
00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
planning from the old to the new we
 
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
didn't do that so so there there is I'm
 
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:40.140 align:start position:0%
sure frustration abounding that uh we've
 
00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959 align:start position:0%
got some bad process here but I think
 
00:09:46.509 --> 00:09:46.519 align:start position:0%
this legislature inherited a a broken
 
00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
situation and and now we're trying to
 
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
repair it knowing that if you go to the
 
00:09:54.829 --> 00:09:54.839 align:start position:0%
right of that sheet of paper that one
 
00:09:58.610 --> 00:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
March 2023 deadline is you know in the
 
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:01.260 align:start position:0%
military we would say danger close we
 
00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
need we need to really be focused on
 
00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.389 align:start position:0%
need we need to really be focused on
that

00:10:05.389 --> 00:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:05.399 --> 00:10:07.009 align:start position:0%
that
so

00:10:07.009 --> 00:10:07.019 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:07.019 --> 00:10:09.110 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
in this work session should I should I
 
00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:14.100 align:start position:0%
be introducing HP 49 we're just talking
 
00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:16.620 align:start position:0%
about it does everyone have a copy of
 
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
hb49 I don't I don't think I have a copy
 
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
of hb49
 
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:23.580 align:start position:0%
do I
 
00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:25.860 align:start position:0%
okay I do
 
00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:28.200 align:start position:0%
does everyone on the committee have a
 
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
copy okay uh everyone in the audience
 
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
that wants a copy do you have a copy
 
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:36.180 align:start position:0%
raise your hand if you don't have a copy
 
00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:38.700 align:start position:0%
and you really want a copy okay so we're
 
00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.090 align:start position:0%
and you really want a copy okay so we're
good

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:43.140 align:start position:0%
um and then for those that are doing the
 
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
the YouTube
 
00:10:48.110 --> 00:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
um Mr Ripple uh they can get to House
 
00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:50.700 align:start position:0%
Bill 49 just through the general court
 
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
looking at the bill search under hb49 is
 
00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
that correct yes okay so this is a very
 
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
short bill it's only got 10 lines
 
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:07.140 align:start position:0%
um it essentially uh extends the date of
 
00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:10.980 align:start position:0%
closure from the 1st of March until the
 
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
end of the fiscal year this fiscal year
 
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:15.240 align:start position:0%
which is June 30th that's essentially
 
00:11:19.069 --> 00:11:19.079 align:start position:0%
four months so we're this this would buy
 
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
us some time and then uh the
 
00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:25.620 align:start position:0%
appropriation the second part is because
 
00:11:28.009 --> 00:11:28.019 align:start position:0%
we're going to keep it open for an
 
00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
additional four months there was a need
 
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
to put some monies against it and the
 
00:11:39.069 --> 00:11:39.079 align:start position:0%
1.5 million was sort of an Edwards uh
 
00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:42.300 align:start position:0%
finger in the air kind of estimate that
 
00:11:44.509 --> 00:11:44.519 align:start position:0%
I I have since verbally confirmed with
 
00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
the Department is not a horrible guess
 
00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
and we'll get we can get some testimony
 
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
on that and so this is a kind of a kick
 
00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:55.260 align:start position:0%
that can buy some time as soon as this
 
00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:57.240 align:start position:0%
gets signed by the governor it would
 
00:11:59.690 --> 00:11:59.700 align:start position:0%
immediately go into effect that's what
 
00:12:02.569 --> 00:12:02.579 align:start position:0%
HP 49 does
 
00:12:05.389 --> 00:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
um or is there any discussion on 49 any
 
00:12:07.069 --> 00:12:07.079 align:start position:0%
amendments that we're going to offer on
 
00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
49 representative hole
 
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
um whoever's testifying relative to
 
00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
section two in terms of the costs can
 
00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
they figure it out at a per month rate
 
00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:21.180 align:start position:0%
for us as well so let's say June 30th
 
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
isn't the magic date that we want to
 
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
move this out let's say we choose I
 
00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:27.300 align:start position:0%
don't know September 30th to pick a
 
00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
number out of the air or a date out of
 
00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
the air right that number is going to
 
00:12:33.710 --> 00:12:33.720 align:start position:0%
directly impact section two so if we can
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
get information at a like 1 12th of the
 
00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:38.700 align:start position:0%
operating budget per month we can then
 
00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:42.860 align:start position:0%
do the math uh yes sir I think the ripe
 
00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:45.720 align:start position:0%
ripe time to talk about that was if
 
00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
there's an amendment that pushes the
 
00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
closure date out Beyond this fiscal year
 
00:12:54.290 --> 00:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
but yes yes sir I would be willing to
 
00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
offer an amendment
 
00:12:59.090 --> 00:12:59.100 align:start position:0%
to that effect if necessary and the
 
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
reason I was
 
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
I have seen enough enough legislation
 
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
that gets passed in the July August time
 
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
frame that August 30th might be
 
00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable because historically the
 
00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:11.940 align:start position:0%
bills work their way through even if
 
00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
it's an expedited Bill takes a little
 
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
bit of time to get to the governor's
 
00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
desk and there's no reason to try and
 
00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
hamper this by days when we know all the
 
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
bills will be processed in time for a
 
00:13:25.129 --> 00:13:25.139 align:start position:0%
veto session in September so if there
 
00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
was two more months to this I shoot that
 
00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
one so when you say you offer an
 
00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:30.959 align:start position:0%
amendment are you offering a suggestion
 
00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:33.839 align:start position:0%
for an amendment or do you have a an OLS
 
00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:36.660 align:start position:0%
uh unapproved draft of an amendment uh I
 
00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
am offering a suggestion for an
 
00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:41.220 align:start position:0%
amendment at this point yes sir okay do
 
00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:44.700 align:start position:0%
we have any OLS documentation on an
 
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
amendment that we want to consider
 
00:13:49.069 --> 00:13:49.079 align:start position:0%
representative walner
 
00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
well I do have a I do have a couple of
 
00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:53.700 align:start position:0%
amendments I do want to know if we're
 
00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
going to have an opportunity to talk
 
00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
about uh the appropriation that is in
 
00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.350 align:start position:0%
about uh the appropriation that is in
Hospital

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
Hospital
 
00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.750 align:start position:0%
Hospital
49

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
49
 
00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:06.300 align:start position:0%
yes okay good and I do have a couple of
 
00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:08.220 align:start position:0%
amendments do you want to do that before
 
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
we discuss either of your amendments
 
00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:20.090 --> 00:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
thank you I just have a comment and I
 
00:14:21.769 --> 00:14:21.779 align:start position:0%
know that I am playing catch up on the
 
00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:24.420 align:start position:0%
education factor of this whole topic
 
00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:26.940 align:start position:0%
um but I guess I question
 
00:14:29.629 --> 00:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
the four-month extension if we have no
 
00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:32.100 align:start position:0%
place for them to go on March 1st where
 
00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:34.500 align:start position:0%
are the children going to go on June
 
00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:37.980 align:start position:0%
30th and is this a little short-sighted
 
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
intern I get and again maybe I'm wrong
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at who the prime sponsor is
 
00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
and and I'd say that guy is usually
 
00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:55.740 align:start position:0%
pretty short-sighted so so no what this
 
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
was if you if you look at the graph
 
00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:01.380 align:start position:0%
the the picture you know just to help
 
00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:04.620 align:start position:0%
put 49 into context when I sent this
 
00:15:08.449 --> 00:15:08.459 align:start position:0%
into OLS back in November or September I
 
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:11.220 align:start position:0%
think it was September actually uh I
 
00:15:12.949 --> 00:15:12.959 align:start position:0%
didn't know what the future would be I
 
00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:15.959 align:start position:0%
didn't know how we would be sitting here
 
00:15:19.009 --> 00:15:19.019 align:start position:0%
today and all this did was it recognized
 
00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:21.060 align:start position:0%
that something was broken and that we
 
00:15:23.629 --> 00:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
might need to and you'll notice that I I
 
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
headlined it by time
 
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
that that purchase of time was sort of a
 
00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
a an ability for us to have more
 
00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
discussion if we needed to on what the
 
00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:38.940 align:start position:0%
real answer is so this was just intended
 
00:15:41.689 --> 00:15:41.699 align:start position:0%
to buy us some time if we got into a
 
00:15:44.509 --> 00:15:44.519 align:start position:0%
rock and a hard place and and we're kind
 
00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:45.660 align:start position:0%
of there
 
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
so so it is short-sighted but it was
 
00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:50.100 align:start position:0%
intentionally short-sighted thinking it
 
00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
was just enough time for us to decide
 
00:15:56.329 --> 00:15:56.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:58.970 --> 00:15:58.980 align:start position:0%
that was the intent okay
 
00:16:03.889 --> 00:16:03.899 align:start position:0%
so so Mr ribson do you have a follow-up
 
00:16:03.899 --> 00:16:05.930 align:start position:0%
so so Mr ribson do you have a follow-up
representative

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:05.940 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:08.220 align:start position:0%
okay okay that's okay I will continue to
 
00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:10.079 align:start position:0%
absorb the information and my questions
 
00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
might be answered as we go okay uh Miss
 
00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:15.180 align:start position:0%
ribson could you come up introduce
 
00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:16.490 align:start position:0%
ribson could you come up introduce
yourself

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:16.500 align:start position:0%
yourself
 
00:16:23.689 --> 00:16:23.699 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:26.100 align:start position:0%
and and and let's let's keep this
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
distinct the the first thing I I want to
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
do is I want to address just what's in
 
00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
HP 49 and and then we can lift our eyes
 
00:16:38.689 --> 00:16:38.699 align:start position:0%
up and and talk longer term but first
 
00:16:40.790 --> 00:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
let's just stay on 49. great good
 
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
morning everybody Joe ripson director of
 
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:45.180 align:start position:0%
dcyf uh thank you for having me here
 
00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing from me and happy
 
00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
to discuss any aspect of this that the
 
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:51.540 align:start position:0%
committee would like to discuss
 
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
okay so I'll I'll start you off with a
 
00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:55.860 align:start position:0%
question then on
 
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
um on HP 49 lines five through nine
 
00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:04.020 align:start position:0%
there's an appropriation for 1.5 million
 
00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:07.620 align:start position:0%
to get us through the four months uh
 
00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:09.780 align:start position:0%
that we would add from the first of
 
00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:13.740 align:start position:0%
March to the end of June uh tell us tell
 
00:17:16.370 --> 00:17:16.380 align:start position:0%
us your thoughts your professional
 
00:17:20.689 --> 00:17:20.699 align:start position:0%
judgment about the adequacy of uh that
 
00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:24.620 align:start position:0%
1.5 million dollar wedge yes so last
 
00:17:27.949 --> 00:17:27.959 align:start position:0%
biennium the appropriation to operate
 
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%
sysc was struck at about 10.4 million
 
00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:31.820 align:start position:0%
dollars per year
 
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
that included about roughly in 2023 1.4
 
00:17:38.810 --> 00:17:38.820 align:start position:0%
million dollars of what was called other
 
00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:41.340 align:start position:0%
funds sysc for folks that aren't
 
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
familiar is not allowed to operate with
 
00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:44.760 align:start position:0%
federal funds Medicaid and things like
 
00:17:46.669 --> 00:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
that are not allowed to be used under
 
00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:49.740 align:start position:0%
current law for facilities like this
 
00:17:51.289 --> 00:17:51.299 align:start position:0%
although good news folks might not
 
00:17:53.570 --> 00:17:53.580 align:start position:0%
realize is this yet there is a change in
 
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
federal law in a couple years where you
 
00:17:56.810 --> 00:17:56.820 align:start position:0%
are going to be allowed to use Medicaid
 
00:17:59.930 --> 00:17:59.940 align:start position:0%
to support detained youth for treatment
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
purposes it's not exactly clear how far
 
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
that will spread if it's just for the
 
00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:05.820 align:start position:0%
actual individual treatment episodes of
 
00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
kids and stuff but there will be some
 
00:18:08.810 --> 00:18:08.820 align:start position:0%
relief on that coming in a couple years
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
I want to be careful not to make
 
00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:11.820 align:start position:0%
everyone think that half of the cost is
 
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
suddenly going to be federally absorbed
 
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's how far it'll go
 
00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
but there will be some some relief
 
00:18:18.289 --> 00:18:18.299 align:start position:0%
coming there
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
um anyway
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
um the 1.4 million dollars in other
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
funds there's a couple things
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
um that have happened since then so as
 
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
everybody's aware we've had some real
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
challenges of sysc with Staffing caused
 
00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
by a few different things number one
 
00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
real massive shifts in Workforce that
 
00:18:36.289 --> 00:18:36.299 align:start position:0%
have hit Health and Human Services
 
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
across the board but particularly
 
00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
Residential Care particularly a facility
 
00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
like sysc where wages no longer were
 
00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:44.940 align:start position:0%
competitive with what people can make in
 
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
retail fast food or anywhere else we did
 
00:18:49.669 --> 00:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
make some efforts to try to improve
 
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
wages with enhancements and stuff but it
 
00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
simply wasn't enough to keep Pace the
 
00:18:54.409 --> 00:18:54.419 align:start position:0%
other big thing that happened of course
 
00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
that has been discussed many many times
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
in this legislature was the inability to
 
00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
come to some type of plan for the future
 
00:19:03.409 --> 00:19:03.419 align:start position:0%
leaving the future of sysc in limbo and
 
00:19:04.970 --> 00:19:04.980 align:start position:0%
leaving a closure date on the books
 
00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:07.500 align:start position:0%
where staff kind of gave up and figured
 
00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:08.460 align:start position:0%
they weren't going to have a future and
 
00:19:10.610 --> 00:19:10.620 align:start position:0%
started looking for other jobs so we got
 
00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:11.940 align:start position:0%
to a point where a facility that really
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
requires 45 front line staff to run got
 
00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
down to 20 Front Line staff and got into
 
00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:18.900 align:start position:0%
a real crisis
 
00:19:21.289 --> 00:19:21.299 align:start position:0%
um when that happened we could no longer
 
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
continue to run what was a contract with
 
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
the state of Vermont to serve their
 
00:19:27.289 --> 00:19:27.299 align:start position:0%
youth that is where a lot of those other
 
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
funds were anticipated to come from so
 
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:31.140 align:start position:0%
we were no longer able to bring in these
 
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
other funds to operate the facility so
 
00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:35.340 align:start position:0%
we lost a revenue stream that we were
 
00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:37.140 align:start position:0%
operating in the past
 
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
that also required us to really really
 
00:19:42.350 --> 00:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
ramp up overtime in the facility and
 
00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:44.220 align:start position:0%
actually required me to mandate Juvenile
 
00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:46.140 align:start position:0%
Justice probation and parole officers to
 
00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
start covering shifts in the facility in
 
00:19:49.789 --> 00:19:49.799 align:start position:0%
order to keep it safe
 
00:19:51.529 --> 00:19:51.539 align:start position:0%
um that's run up over time dramatically
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
too and those staff make a lot more
 
00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:54.780 align:start position:0%
money than YC's than our youth
 
00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
counselors do so that's ran up costs
 
00:19:59.210 --> 00:19:59.220 align:start position:0%
pretty dramatically
 
00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:01.380 align:start position:0%
we when we kind of did the ran the
 
00:20:03.049 --> 00:20:03.059 align:start position:0%
numbers and figured out kind of what the
 
00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:05.940 align:start position:0%
burn rate was we think it's about 1.6
 
00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
million that we're going to end up short
 
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
by the end of the year you know whether
 
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
that's done through an appropriation
 
00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
here through some type of departmental
 
00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:14.100 align:start position:0%
transfer through joint fiscal at some
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
point but we do think we're going to
 
00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
have some type of challenge in that
 
00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:17.940 align:start position:0%
ballpark that we're keeping an eye on
 
00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:20.820 align:start position:0%
um representative Holz good point about
 
00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799 align:start position:0%
the fact that you're going to have a
 
00:20:24.409 --> 00:20:24.419 align:start position:0%
potential issue if the facility stays
 
00:20:25.789 --> 00:20:25.799 align:start position:0%
open longer I think that is true
 
00:20:27.529 --> 00:20:27.539 align:start position:0%
although I also Imagine that's something
 
00:20:28.669 --> 00:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
that could be addressed through the
 
00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:31.380 align:start position:0%
typical budget process you know assuming
 
00:20:32.570 --> 00:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
that you would if you would continue
 
00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:33.960 align:start position:0%
operating the budget or operating
 
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:35.940 align:start position:0%
facility the next fiscal year you would
 
00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:37.500 align:start position:0%
anticipate the costs for that in your
 
00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:39.660 align:start position:0%
next fiscal year budget
 
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for that I I'm looking for
 
00:20:45.529 --> 00:20:45.539 align:start position:0%
a kind of a bottom line yes no kind of
 
00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
thing here uh yes we in hb2 estimates
 
00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:53.220 align:start position:0%
1.5 million needed for the four
 
00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:54.780 align:start position:0%
additional months
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
is that a good estimate or did I just
 
00:20:59.330 --> 00:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
hear you say you think it really ought
 
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
to be 1.6 million I think 1.5 is good we
 
00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:05.039 align:start position:0%
1.6 is what we came up with but there's
 
00:21:05.039 --> 00:21:05.990 align:start position:0%
1.6 is what we came up with but there's
also

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:07.860 align:start position:0%
at any given time the truth is there's
 
00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
contracts out there for example that we
 
00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:10.740 align:start position:0%
know we're not going to be paid in full
 
00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
right so we have for example a contract
 
00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
with Dartmouth to provide Clinical
 
00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:16.799 align:start position:0%
Services that funds a part-time
 
00:21:18.830 --> 00:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist a part-time psychologist
 
00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
and two clinicians they've not been able
 
00:21:22.669 --> 00:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
to fill the second clinician so we're
 
00:21:23.930 --> 00:21:23.940 align:start position:0%
not going to be we're not going to pay
 
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:25.919 align:start position:0%
that for that clinician right and that's
 
00:21:27.169 --> 00:21:27.179 align:start position:0%
about a hundred thousand dollars right
 
00:21:28.669 --> 00:21:28.679 align:start position:0%
there so
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
the way that our budgeting works that
 
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
contract currently appears as encumbered
 
00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:34.620 align:start position:0%
so that hundred thousand dollars shows
 
00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
up as being spent but I also know at the
 
00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
end of the fiscal year we're not going
 
00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
to spend a hundred thousand dollars
 
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
because that clinician wasn't working so
 
00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:43.980 align:start position:0%
while our on the books we're showing 1.6
 
00:21:46.549 --> 00:21:46.559 align:start position:0%
it probably is really 1.5 because I know
 
00:21:48.289 --> 00:21:48.299 align:start position:0%
we're not going to spend 100 000 on the
 
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
clinician that hasn't shown up
 
00:21:57.289 --> 00:21:57.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:57.299 --> 00:22:00.289 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:22:00.289 --> 00:22:00.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
do you have any figures on how much you
 
00:22:05.690 --> 00:22:05.700 align:start position:0%
have spent on overtime not with me but I
 
00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
can get that and what is the vacancy
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
rate at
 
00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:12.360 align:start position:0%
the sununu center
 
00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:14.700 align:start position:0%
right now in terms of Youth counselors
 
00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:16.620 align:start position:0%
It's it's dry I think we have 45
 
00:22:18.169 --> 00:22:18.179 align:start position:0%
positions on something at this point
 
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
like 17 filled
 
00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:23.460 align:start position:0%
45 and 45 positions with something like
 
00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:26.220 align:start position:0%
17 filled we do have temp staff there
 
00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
which makes it a little bit better but I
 
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't count them in our account
 
00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
um and we have some of that 17 actually
 
00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:35.580 align:start position:0%
wasn't turnover since the 20 it was
 
00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:37.020 align:start position:0%
actually a couple folks were promoted to
 
00:22:39.289 --> 00:22:39.299 align:start position:0%
supervisory roles which is good really
 
00:22:41.149 --> 00:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
since the conversation says he have
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
heated up about kind of a future State
 
00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:44.340 align:start position:0%
and people have gotten a little more
 
00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
hope we haven't seen people leaving the
 
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
facility which is good we've had one
 
00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:49.740 align:start position:0%
person leave but that was to a
 
00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
promotional opportunity to become a jppo
 
00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
and I don't really consider that you
 
00:22:55.789 --> 00:22:55.799 align:start position:0%
know that's that's career growth it
 
00:22:57.770 --> 00:22:57.780 align:start position:0%
wasn't like an exodus
 
00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
so things have kind of stabilized in
 
00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:01.020 align:start position:0%
terms of people leaving but trying to
 
00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:02.820 align:start position:0%
get people to come in has been really
 
00:23:05.149 --> 00:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
hard because they they don't really see
 
00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:07.380 align:start position:0%
a future and you know again the wage
 
00:23:09.049 --> 00:23:09.059 align:start position:0%
issue is still a challenge I am hopeful
 
00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:10.740 align:start position:0%
on that front you know the the current
 
00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:12.049 align:start position:0%
on that front you know the the current
negotiations

00:23:12.049 --> 00:23:12.059 align:start position:0%
negotiations
 
00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
um in terms of collective bargaining
 
00:23:15.649 --> 00:23:15.659 align:start position:0%
agreement seem pretty promising and I
 
00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:16.980 align:start position:0%
think we'll be in a better position come
 
00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:19.740 align:start position:0%
July 1 on that but right now that the
 
00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:21.780 align:start position:0%
wage issue is also a challenge in terms
 
00:23:23.990 --> 00:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
of recruiting staff
 
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.490 align:start position:0%
of recruiting staff
okay

00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:25.500 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:23:27.529 --> 00:23:27.539 align:start position:0%
um have you and you have used some
 
00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
incentives to get people there what can
 
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
you just really quickly tell me there
 
00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:34.380 align:start position:0%
was yeah there was one incentive program
 
00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:37.620 align:start position:0%
which was a retention incentive program
 
00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
where if staff stayed for a period of
 
00:23:40.909 --> 00:23:40.919 align:start position:0%
six months the guy I think it was about
 
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
a thousand dollars that that program has
 
00:23:45.049 --> 00:23:45.059 align:start position:0%
expired and in fact a lot of Staff left
 
00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
anyway during that period
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
there is another incentive currently in
 
00:23:51.529 --> 00:23:51.539 align:start position:0%
place that was approved by joint fiscal
 
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
for a staff who work 24 hours of
 
00:23:55.669 --> 00:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
overtime in a pay period they receive an
 
00:23:57.649 --> 00:23:57.659 align:start position:0%
extra 300 on top of the time and a half
 
00:23:59.210 --> 00:23:59.220 align:start position:0%
that they would ordinarily receive that
 
00:24:00.529 --> 00:24:00.539 align:start position:0%
has been well received and a lot of
 
00:24:01.850 --> 00:24:01.860 align:start position:0%
people are working a lot of overtime
 
00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:03.480 align:start position:0%
which is great to keep the facilities
 
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:05.460 align:start position:0%
safe but it also Burns people out over
 
00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
time right
 
00:24:09.049 --> 00:24:09.059 align:start position:0%
um and there's a another Statewide
 
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:10.740 align:start position:0%
incentive in terms of being able to
 
00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:12.900 align:start position:0%
anytime you can recruit a state employee
 
00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
there's kind of a bonus for the person
 
00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:15.900 align:start position:0%
who does the Recruitment and a bonus for
 
00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:17.580 align:start position:0%
the person who gets recruited and stays
 
00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:19.620 align:start position:0%
on board for 90 days we actually haven't
 
00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
seen that result in any kind of movement
 
00:24:24.529 --> 00:24:24.539 align:start position:0%
in terms of sysc recruitment but we have
 
00:24:26.029 --> 00:24:26.039 align:start position:0%
seen that kind of have some some
 
00:24:27.770 --> 00:24:27.780 align:start position:0%
movement on the child protection side of
 
00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
dcyf great thank you yep
 
00:24:34.669 --> 00:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
um I just I want to keep my numbers
 
00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:37.380 align:start position:0%
straight the first time I heard you you
 
00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
talk about the number of direct care
 
00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
providers in contact with the residents
 
00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
you said that you you're authorized 45
 
00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:47.940 align:start position:0%
and you only had 25 of them but then the
 
00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:49.380 align:start position:0%
second time
 
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
you said 17. so so is it 17 20 or 25.
 
00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
I've never said 25 I don't think we have
 
00:24:59.750 --> 00:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
20 we had 20 we're now down to 17
 
00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:01.860 align:start position:0%
because we had two that promoted up to
 
00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
supervisors okay and one that left to
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
become a jppo okay so the implication of
 
00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
that 17 of the 45 is that should you
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
have a tremendously High vacancy rate uh
 
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
a scary one yes and so for all of those
 
00:25:18.289 --> 00:25:18.299 align:start position:0%
people in the community that would like
 
00:25:21.049 --> 00:25:21.059 align:start position:0%
to see uh the sununu center
 
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
transitioning to a trauma-informed
 
00:25:26.169 --> 00:25:26.179 align:start position:0%
therapeutic environment
 
00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:29.720 align:start position:0%
the ability to do that I'm guessing
 
00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:31.880 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
very limited you know just because
 
00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:37.860 align:start position:0%
training takes time you're going to
 
00:25:39.529 --> 00:25:39.539 align:start position:0%
invest in training you want people to
 
00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:41.940 align:start position:0%
stick around what what can you tell us
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
about where you are and what you think
 
00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:47.460 align:start position:0%
about transitioning the current program
 
00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
to a trauma-informed therapeutic
 
00:25:52.909 --> 00:25:52.919 align:start position:0%
environment great good question the yeah
 
00:25:55.549 --> 00:25:55.559 align:start position:0%
so if we look at you know sb1 or even
 
00:25:57.769 --> 00:25:57.779 align:start position:0%
the bill that was passed last year hb120
 
00:25:59.450 --> 00:25:59.460 align:start position:0%
all of them anticipate a host of
 
00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:01.380 align:start position:0%
programming changes even the audit that
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
happened a couple years ago right moving
 
00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:04.860 align:start position:0%
to evidence-based models stuff that
 
00:26:06.529 --> 00:26:06.539 align:start position:0%
we're actually positioned to do in terms
 
00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:07.980 align:start position:0%
of our clinical team our psychologist
 
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
down there has identified kind of ready
 
00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:11.700 align:start position:0%
to go but all of them are highly
 
00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
dependent on having a stable milieu
 
00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:16.260 align:start position:0%
Workforce Frontline Workforce that knows
 
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
your kids and who can be trained to use
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
these models and when you have a
 
00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:22.020 align:start position:0%
Workforce like we have right now where
 
00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:25.740 align:start position:0%
you have you know 17 core staff of 45
 
00:26:27.289 --> 00:26:27.299 align:start position:0%
and everybody else is kind of just
 
00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:29.220 align:start position:0%
floating in for six hours here or there
 
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
you can never really Implement a model
 
00:26:33.049 --> 00:26:33.059 align:start position:0%
like that because they're all wholly
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
dependent on knowing your kids being
 
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
able to anticipate their behaviors and
 
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
redirect and you don't you just can't do
 
00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:40.620 align:start position:0%
that if you don't know your kids and you
 
00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:41.820 align:start position:0%
can't know your kids if you don't spend
 
00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:43.980 align:start position:0%
a lot of time with them it's really as
 
00:26:45.769 --> 00:26:45.779 align:start position:0%
simple as that so as long as we're in
 
00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
this position of limbo I do fear that
 
00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:49.260 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be able to make that
 
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
next step that next transition into
 
00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
being able to effectively Implement
 
00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:53.700 align:start position:0%
evidence-based trauma-informed
 
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
programming so let's come back to that
 
00:26:58.669 --> 00:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
next step you know the the obviously the
 
00:27:00.769 --> 00:27:00.779 align:start position:0%
community consensus around this is that
 
00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:02.820 align:start position:0%
we want a trauma-informed therapeutic
 
00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:04.730 align:start position:0%
we want a trauma-informed therapeutic
model

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:04.740 align:start position:0%
model
 
00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:10.380 align:start position:0%
um but I I think what you let us know is
 
00:27:12.409 --> 00:27:12.419 align:start position:0%
that all of those changes in that
 
00:27:15.169 --> 00:27:15.179 align:start position:0%
mission and that methodology are in
 
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
bills that have not yet passed and that
 
00:27:20.810 --> 00:27:20.820 align:start position:0%
if you went to the current statutes you
 
00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:22.799 align:start position:0%
don't have anything from the legislature
 
00:27:26.029 --> 00:27:26.039 align:start position:0%
or the governor telling you that you
 
00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:29.580 align:start position:0%
shall be providing a trump-based
 
00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
therapeutic model is that true
 
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
correct I think we do have an audit
 
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
saying that we should be doing these
 
00:27:39.289 --> 00:27:39.299 align:start position:0%
things and we have responded to that
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
audit saying that we're trying but we've
 
00:27:42.649 --> 00:27:42.659 align:start position:0%
not been able to implement for the for
 
00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:43.980 align:start position:0%
these reasons
 
00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:46.860 align:start position:0%
oh okay so it would still be helpful I
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
think to have the legislative intent for
 
00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
you to transition uh representative Holt
 
00:27:54.169 --> 00:27:54.179 align:start position:0%
did you have a question
 
00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:55.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
a number of uh several numbers were
 
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
given to me and since I'm taking notes
 
00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:01.980 align:start position:0%
can you provide those in written form
 
00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:05.700 align:start position:0%
both for Staffing and costs
 
00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
um and in in particular the retention
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
bonus I did not capture all that
 
00:28:11.279 --> 00:28:12.529 align:start position:0%
bonus I did not capture all that
information

00:28:12.529 --> 00:28:12.539 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:15.240 align:start position:0%
so like the if some if a staff member
 
00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:16.740 align:start position:0%
works so many hours there's a bonus on
 
00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:19.980 align:start position:0%
top of the hourly rate it's 300 for 24
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
hours over two weeks over a pay period
 
00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
but would you like an email with that
 
00:28:25.669 --> 00:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
yeah if you can just summarize all of
 
00:28:25.679 --> 00:28:26.570 align:start position:0%
yeah if you can just summarize all of
those

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:33.070 --> 00:28:33.080 align:start position:0%
do you have a question
 
00:28:35.149 --> 00:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney and then
 
00:28:36.769 --> 00:28:36.779 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner
 
00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
being here today we've heard a lot about
 
00:28:42.289 --> 00:28:42.299 align:start position:0%
the Staffing which is very helpful of
 
00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:44.220 align:start position:0%
course but what about the juvenile
 
00:28:46.909 --> 00:28:46.919 align:start position:0%
residents how many are there now and
 
00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:49.200 align:start position:0%
what is your projection for enrollment
 
00:28:51.649 --> 00:28:51.659 align:start position:0%
by the end of June I know that's hard to
 
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
estimate with people coming and going
 
00:28:56.269 --> 00:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:29:00.529 --> 00:29:00.539 align:start position:0%
sure today the census is 12.
 
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:14.649 --> 00:29:14.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:21.529 --> 00:29:21.539 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Ripple is bringing around a chart
 
00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
that has the sysc daily population from
 
00:29:31.490 --> 00:29:31.500 align:start position:0%
July 20 from July 1 2016 through
 
00:29:36.529 --> 00:29:36.539 align:start position:0%
um the start of this year January 1 2023
 
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
. as I said today's census is 12 but the
 
00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:44.100 align:start position:0%
census varies radically over time you do
 
00:29:47.149 --> 00:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
see back in 2016 the census often was in
 
00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
the 70s up to about 75 at times you also
 
00:29:54.649 --> 00:29:54.659 align:start position:0%
see kind of a real giant decline between
 
00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
2016 and 2019 and there were a couple
 
00:29:58.430 --> 00:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
big things that have been happening
 
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
during that time you had
 
00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
changes in the law as to who could be
 
00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
detained and committed and you also had
 
00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:05.700 align:start position:0%
the Advent of the children's system of
 
00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:07.320 align:start position:0%
care so we started creating alternative
 
00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
community-based programs to try to work
 
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
with kids in their behavioral health
 
00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:13.380 align:start position:0%
care needs to prevent them from having
 
00:30:15.950 --> 00:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
to come into the system also in the past
 
00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
year we implemented what we call our
 
00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice assessment process
 
00:30:22.669 --> 00:30:22.679 align:start position:0%
whereby whenever kids have contact with
 
00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
law enforcement we now use a child
 
00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:26.460 align:start position:0%
adolescent needs and strengths tool to
 
00:30:27.649 --> 00:30:27.659 align:start position:0%
determine do they even need to go to
 
00:30:29.149 --> 00:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
court or is this a kid that has some
 
00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
type of challenge that we can meet in
 
00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:31.860 align:start position:0%
the community without them even going to
 
00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:34.980 align:start position:0%
court in the first place so we have lots
 
00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
of efforts to try to keep kids out that
 
00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
have gotten this census down much
 
00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
further than where it used to be
 
00:30:42.049 --> 00:30:42.059 align:start position:0%
if you look at this chart does everybody
 
00:30:44.330 --> 00:30:44.340 align:start position:0%
have it now yeah the green at the top is
 
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
the total
 
00:30:47.889 --> 00:30:47.899 align:start position:0%
the red line is the detained population
 
00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:49.980 align:start position:0%
the blue line is the committed
 
00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
population you see those two numbers
 
00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:53.820 align:start position:0%
kind of crisscross each other pretty
 
00:30:58.490 --> 00:30:58.500 align:start position:0%
frequently the census has kind of peaked
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
because we have new members on the
 
00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:02.460 align:start position:0%
committee that have not dealt with the
 
00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
definitions of detain and committed
 
00:31:06.409 --> 00:31:06.419 align:start position:0%
could you just give us a very short
 
00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
definition I can so a detained youth
 
00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:11.580 align:start position:0%
typically means a young person who has
 
00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:14.100 align:start position:0%
been arrested and is pending court right
 
00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:16.860 align:start position:0%
they've and under law to to be detained
 
00:31:18.649 --> 00:31:18.659 align:start position:0%
you have to have committed a relatively
 
00:31:21.289 --> 00:31:21.299 align:start position:0%
serious offense in New Hampshire
 
00:31:21.299 --> 00:31:21.830 align:start position:0%
serious offense in New Hampshire
um

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:23.570 --> 00:31:23.580 align:start position:0%
so typically that means that they're
 
00:31:25.669 --> 00:31:25.679 align:start position:0%
pending court but within that population
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
and typically that means it's a
 
00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
relatively short period of time but
 
00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:31.980 align:start position:0%
there are some some offenses for which
 
00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
that population could be there for a
 
00:31:36.169 --> 00:31:36.179 align:start position:0%
long time and that typically when I say
 
00:31:37.549 --> 00:31:37.559 align:start position:0%
that that's normally young people who
 
00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
are there pending adult charges so if
 
00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:40.860 align:start position:0%
you come in and act like murder and
 
00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
you're pending adult charges you could
 
00:31:44.149 --> 00:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
be there for a very long time on a
 
00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
detained status because those charges
 
00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
you'll end up going through like a
 
00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:50.100 align:start position:0%
process to determine whether you can be
 
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
tried as an adult and then another full
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
those Trials take a long time they
 
00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
they'll end up in a detained status for
 
00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
a very long time and then even if they
 
00:31:59.690 --> 00:31:59.700 align:start position:0%
end up being convicted they'll remain
 
00:32:01.789 --> 00:32:01.799 align:start position:0%
with us until they turn 18. so those
 
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
young people in our books anyway they'll
 
00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:04.860 align:start position:0%
still show up as a detained youth
 
00:32:06.529 --> 00:32:06.539 align:start position:0%
throughout the entirety of their stay
 
00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
with us the other category that'll show
 
00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:11.100 align:start position:0%
up in our numbers as a detained youth is
 
00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:14.700 align:start position:0%
what's called an icj a uh
 
00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:15.370 align:start position:0%
what's called an icj a uh
um

00:32:15.370 --> 00:32:15.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
interstate compact for juvenile youth
 
00:32:19.490 --> 00:32:19.500 align:start position:0%
that's when a youth from another state
 
00:32:22.010 --> 00:32:22.020 align:start position:0%
gets arrested in New Hampshire that
 
00:32:23.389 --> 00:32:23.399 align:start position:0%
could be a youth who's arrested in New
 
00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for committing a crime in New
 
00:32:27.889 --> 00:32:27.899 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or it could be a youth who has
 
00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:29.220 align:start position:0%
a warrant from another state who gets
 
00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
arrested in New Hampshire and gets held
 
00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire pending return to their
 
00:32:33.169 --> 00:32:33.179 align:start position:0%
home state
 
00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:34.860 align:start position:0%
those numbers also show up in the
 
00:32:36.769 --> 00:32:36.779 align:start position:0%
detained numbers but the typical
 
00:32:39.889 --> 00:32:39.899 align:start position:0%
detained youth it's a short-term stay
 
00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:42.440 align:start position:0%
either pending their hearing
 
00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes just pending a preliminary
 
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
hearing so it could often just be 24
 
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
hours or a couple days and other times
 
00:32:51.169 --> 00:32:51.179 align:start position:0%
it might be a couple weeks you know
 
00:32:53.389 --> 00:32:53.399 align:start position:0%
pending their uh adjudicatory hearing
 
00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
and then you have the committed
 
00:32:57.049 --> 00:32:57.059 align:start position:0%
population which is a post hearing a
 
00:32:58.370 --> 00:32:58.380 align:start position:0%
judge determines that they should be
 
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
committed to the facility and committed
 
00:33:03.769 --> 00:33:03.779 align:start position:0%
youth are sent for two sentences you
 
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
know if it's a a more serious offense it
 
00:33:09.769 --> 00:33:09.779 align:start position:0%
could be six months and then parole if
 
00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
it's a less serious offense although
 
00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:13.620 align:start position:0%
like I said you know in New Hampshire
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty pretty high bar compared
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
to other states to be committed at all
 
00:33:20.029 --> 00:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
it's three months and then parole or
 
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
then you're eligible for parole you know
 
00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:23.460 align:start position:0%
they could decide the parole board could
 
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
determine that you're not ready to be
 
00:33:26.509 --> 00:33:26.519 align:start position:0%
released at that point but the typical
 
00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
length of stay for a young person who's
 
00:33:30.110 --> 00:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
committed really is about three months
 
00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:32.700 align:start position:0%
it's unusual for committed youth to to
 
00:33:34.669 --> 00:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
not make parole
 
00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
um it does happen but it's not typical
 
00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:40.740 align:start position:0%
so again if we look at the chart you do
 
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
see kind of that detained and committed
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
population bounce up and down
 
00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:48.360 align:start position:0%
um over the past really since the start
 
00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:50.700 align:start position:0%
of 2020 when you did see we were over 20
 
00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:53.580 align:start position:0%
youth we've never really exceeded 18
 
00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:55.940 align:start position:0%
youth since that time
 
00:33:58.909 --> 00:33:58.919 align:start position:0%
the lowest we've gotten was five total
 
00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:00.720 align:start position:0%
Youth and that was actually in November
 
00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:01.980 align:start position:0%
of this year
 
00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:04.740 align:start position:0%
the highest we've gotten was 18 Youth
 
00:34:07.549 --> 00:34:07.559 align:start position:0%
and that was two not even two weeks ago
 
00:34:09.589 --> 00:34:09.599 align:start position:0%
so the census can swing radically
 
00:34:12.649 --> 00:34:12.659 align:start position:0%
quickly so you know if we're talking
 
00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:15.419 align:start position:0%
about projections for June I don't see
 
00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:16.919 align:start position:0%
June as being any different than what
 
00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
we've seen for the past two or three
 
00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:20.700 align:start position:0%
years in terms of you know we could be
 
00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:22.919 align:start position:0%
at 18 or we could be at five but we
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
would be somewhere in that range the
 
00:34:26.570 --> 00:34:26.580 align:start position:0%
other variables in there that you have
 
00:34:29.329 --> 00:34:29.339 align:start position:0%
to consider is you know male and female
 
00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:30.419 align:start position:0%
um you know typically the female
 
00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:32.220 align:start position:0%
population is relatively low for the
 
00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:33.899 align:start position:0%
past year we've had rarely had more than
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
one female at a time in the building but
 
00:34:38.329 --> 00:34:38.339 align:start position:0%
we did have a period
 
00:34:39.889 --> 00:34:39.899 align:start position:0%
for the first time I think in the
 
00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:42.060 align:start position:0%
history of the facility not this past
 
00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:43.740 align:start position:0%
October the prior October where there
 
00:34:44.930 --> 00:34:44.940 align:start position:0%
were eight females in the building and
 
00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:47.220 align:start position:0%
only six males so we actually had a time
 
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
where there were more females than males
 
00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
for I think the first time ever
 
00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:53.220 align:start position:0%
so there are there are shifts in the
 
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
census and population that are that are
 
00:34:57.190 --> 00:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
unpredictable do you have a follow-up
 
00:34:59.630 --> 00:34:59.640 align:start position:0%
okay okay I'm getting ready to go to
 
00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner but I I just have
 
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
a quick question on the icjs
 
00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:05.210 align:start position:0%
a quick question on the icjs
um

00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:05.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
can can you this feels like a very small
 
00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
number uh of the of the detained but
 
00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
could you give us some idea of of the
 
00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
type of typical arrests because I I
 
00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:21.060 align:start position:0%
would think it would be very rare that
 
00:35:23.089 --> 00:35:23.099 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire would want to arrest a kid
 
00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:25.400 align:start position:0%
from out of state to hold them for
 
00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:28.980 align:start position:0%
transfer so what what kind of what kind
 
00:35:31.849 --> 00:35:31.859 align:start position:0%
of cases are those generally it's it is
 
00:35:31.859 --> 00:35:33.109 align:start position:0%
of cases are those generally it's it is
rare

00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
rare
 
00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:34.980 align:start position:0%
um probably only happens maybe three or
 
00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:37.140 align:start position:0%
four times a year
 
00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
um you know the most recent one was out
 
00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:40.740 align:start position:0%
of Massachusetts and it was you know
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
some serious gang-related offenses you
 
00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
know um violence and and narcotics
 
00:35:49.849 --> 00:35:49.859 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative walner did
 
00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:51.900 align:start position:0%
you still have a question I did and just
 
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry just to go back just to finish
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
the icj conversation uh the compact
 
00:35:59.150 --> 00:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
requires that the sen that the state uh
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
the state of origin must retrieve the
 
00:36:02.329 --> 00:36:02.339 align:start position:0%
child within five days although
 
00:36:04.730 --> 00:36:04.740 align:start position:0%
typically it's faster than that I think
 
00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:06.180 align:start position:0%
it's five days because the idea that
 
00:36:07.370 --> 00:36:07.380 align:start position:0%
perhaps they're coming from all the way
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
across the country although I don't
 
00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
think we've actually seen any of that
 
00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:12.020 align:start position:0%
it's normally the neighboring states
 
00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
good clarification thank you go ahead
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
representative walner
 
00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:19.140 align:start position:0%
since we aren't going to be able to
 
00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:21.060 align:start position:0%
predict what the future is going to hold
 
00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:25.380 align:start position:0%
this employment situation I mean it's
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
not just it's not just at the sununu
 
00:36:31.550 --> 00:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
center it's all across every employer
 
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:34.079 align:start position:0%
you talk to is having a hard time hiring
 
00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
people and I I mean I don't know I have
 
00:36:39.890 --> 00:36:39.900 align:start position:0%
no idea what the what's going to happen
 
00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
um so we might anticipate that hiring
 
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
people to work at a facility is going to
 
00:36:50.829 --> 00:36:50.839 align:start position:0%
continue to be a struggle
 
00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:55.020 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't we also at the same time
 
00:36:57.829 --> 00:36:57.839 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to look at
 
00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:00.300 align:start position:0%
having enough people
 
00:37:02.329 --> 00:37:02.339 align:start position:0%
to care for the kids wouldn't we be
 
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
looking at further ways of reducing the
 
00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:06.300 align:start position:0%
number of children who are in the
 
00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:07.310 align:start position:0%
number of children who are in the
facility

00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
facility
 
00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:09.060 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:11.180 align:start position:0%
the you're 17
 
00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:13.980 align:start position:0%
would have a more appropriate number of
 
00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:16.980 align:start position:0%
children to be cared for yeah I think we
 
00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
should yeah I mean I think we should
 
00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
always be looking at and I think we are
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
actively always looking at ways to
 
00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:23.460 align:start position:0%
reduce the number of children right so
 
00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:25.380 align:start position:0%
you know I described the work that we're
 
00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
doing through what was SB 94 I've talked
 
00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
about the work we're doing with the
 
00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:29.940 align:start position:0%
system of care not in as much detail as
 
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
I could part of the system of care work
 
00:37:34.130 --> 00:37:34.140 align:start position:0%
is the use of something that's fairly
 
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
new which is the use of Care Management
 
00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:39.300 align:start position:0%
entities so those are those are groups
 
00:37:40.849 --> 00:37:40.859 align:start position:0%
who you do Behavioral Health Care work
 
00:37:42.349 --> 00:37:42.359 align:start position:0%
they use a high fidelity wraparound
 
00:37:44.089 --> 00:37:44.099 align:start position:0%
model to help work with families to be
 
00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:45.660 align:start position:0%
able to transition kids to their next
 
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
step kids that get detained and
 
00:37:49.849 --> 00:37:49.859 align:start position:0%
committed to sysc are on the priority
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
list to get a care manager identified
 
00:37:54.650 --> 00:37:54.660 align:start position:0%
for them immediately and quickly so that
 
00:37:56.089 --> 00:37:56.099 align:start position:0%
they could help transition those kids
 
00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
out as quickly as possible sometimes
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
that's a step down to a residential
 
00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:00.900 align:start position:0%
program sometimes that's back to the
 
00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:03.300 align:start position:0%
community so we're doing a lot of work
 
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
to try to get these kids out I think
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
what I would what I would say to that
 
00:38:10.849 --> 00:38:10.859 align:start position:0%
though is I do you think that we can get
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
this census down I don't think there's a
 
00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
lot of precedent anywhere in the country
 
00:38:17.349 --> 00:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
to get much lower than we are though
 
00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
and I did bring copies of report if
 
00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:21.420 align:start position:0%
folks are interested that shows that
 
00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
we're already
 
00:38:25.069 --> 00:38:25.079 align:start position:0%
the second lowest number of detained
 
00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:26.700 align:start position:0%
kids in the country and the second
 
00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
lowest number of committed kids in the
 
00:38:30.950 --> 00:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
country and we are the lowest combined
 
00:38:32.569 --> 00:38:32.579 align:start position:0%
detained and committed
 
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
census in the country
 
00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:37.500 align:start position:0%
so you know from at least precedence
 
00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:40.380 align:start position:0%
within this country it's hard to it's
 
00:38:42.349 --> 00:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
hard to see where there's a whole lot of
 
00:38:44.569 --> 00:38:44.579 align:start position:0%
room for shrinking although I absolutely
 
00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:47.820 align:start position:0%
believe that we want to have as few kids
 
00:38:51.589 --> 00:38:51.599 align:start position:0%
in a detained or committed setting as as
 
00:38:51.599 --> 00:38:53.750 align:start position:0%
in a detained or committed setting as as
possible

00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:38:56.089 --> 00:38:56.099 align:start position:0%
could I just follow up with one further
 
00:38:58.430 --> 00:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
question about that the report that
 
00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
you're referring to does it take into
 
00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:03.839 align:start position:0%
consideration the population of the
 
00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:06.060 align:start position:0%
states yes I mean because New Hampshire
 
00:39:08.329 --> 00:39:08.339 align:start position:0%
is a fairly small population yeah it's a
 
00:39:08.339 --> 00:39:09.710 align:start position:0%
is a fairly small population yeah it's a
rate

00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:09.720 align:start position:0%
rate
 
00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:17.569 --> 00:39:17.579 align:start position:0%
representative Holt thank you chairman
 
00:39:17.579 --> 00:39:19.190 align:start position:0%
representative Holt thank you chairman
so

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:21.540 align:start position:0%
um looking at the numbers currently
 
00:39:21.540 --> 00:39:22.430 align:start position:0%
um looking at the numbers currently
right

00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
there are about I don't know seven eight
 
00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
maybe nine sorry
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
um four or five that are committed and
 
00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
then eight nine that are detained
 
00:39:34.069 --> 00:39:34.079 align:start position:0%
currently in this
 
00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:36.660 align:start position:0%
do you have the durations for those that
 
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
are committed time-wise do you know how
 
00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
long are these people that are in there
 
00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:42.780 align:start position:0%
right there
 
00:39:44.510 --> 00:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
miners who are going to be there through
 
00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:45.900 align:start position:0%
18 we know that they're going to be
 
00:39:47.329 --> 00:39:47.339 align:start position:0%
there for a while because of the crimes
 
00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:49.140 align:start position:0%
they've committed you know the committed
 
00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:51.660 align:start position:0%
population actually very is not is not
 
00:39:53.089 --> 00:39:53.099 align:start position:0%
typically there till they're 18. the
 
00:39:54.109 --> 00:39:54.119 align:start position:0%
only young people who are typically
 
00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
there until age 18 are the ones who are
 
00:39:58.670 --> 00:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
there pending adult charges right so we
 
00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:00.060 align:start position:0%
do have a couple young people who are
 
00:40:02.569 --> 00:40:02.579 align:start position:0%
there pending adult charges and um you
 
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
know our
 
00:40:06.290 --> 00:40:06.300 align:start position:0%
it's unusual you know it's you know you
 
00:40:07.849 --> 00:40:07.859 align:start position:0%
hear in other states that you know this
 
00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
is something that gets taken advantage
 
00:40:10.609 --> 00:40:10.619 align:start position:0%
of and you have lots of kids you know
 
00:40:12.170 --> 00:40:12.180 align:start position:0%
locked up through their minority pending
 
00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
adult charges
 
00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:15.180 align:start position:0%
um that's not something that I've seen
 
00:40:16.609 --> 00:40:16.619 align:start position:0%
since I've been here we have two kids
 
00:40:18.829 --> 00:40:18.839 align:start position:0%
spending adult charges and
 
00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:20.460 align:start position:0%
um they're they're serious charges that
 
00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
they're pending
 
00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:25.260 align:start position:0%
so so I would like to take a timeout
 
00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:28.260 align:start position:0%
here real quick with the committee
 
00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:30.660 align:start position:0%
um this is good conversation it's good
 
00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
context it's going to be useful in other
 
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
discussions that we're going to have but
 
00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:38.460 align:start position:0%
I I think we're I I think what we need
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
to focus on for a moment is just to make
 
00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
sure that all your questions relative to
 
00:40:47.630 --> 00:40:47.640 align:start position:0%
whether or not you think HP 49 is a good
 
00:40:50.290 --> 00:40:50.300 align:start position:0%
bill or needs to be changed in some way
 
00:40:54.589 --> 00:40:54.599 align:start position:0%
uh let's let's let's just make sure that
 
00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:58.079 align:start position:0%
we know what we know about 49 and and
 
00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
assuming that we might then I would like
 
00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
to start in bringing forward the any
 
00:41:06.589 --> 00:41:06.599 align:start position:0%
amendments that there may be 249 so that
 
00:41:08.690 --> 00:41:08.700 align:start position:0%
we can expand the discussion and then
 
00:41:12.849 --> 00:41:12.859 align:start position:0%
kind of a orderly way is there anyone
 
00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
who wants more a representative or
 
00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so along those lines
 
00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
of understanding what
 
00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:25.320 align:start position:0%
we need
 
00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:28.500 align:start position:0%
if with the current facility you
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned that with the evidence-based
 
00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:31.740 align:start position:0%
trauma informed I believe what you were
 
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:34.260 align:start position:0%
saying was
 
00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:35.940 align:start position:0%
you there was some bills that were
 
00:41:38.150 --> 00:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
flowing through the system now that had
 
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
components of them that addressed those
 
00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:42.060 align:start position:0%
needs is that first of all is that
 
00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
accurate is that accurate in my part yes
 
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
yeah both Senate bill one and hb120
 
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
include language for that yes okay
 
00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:52.380 align:start position:0%
um you don't do this right now but could
 
00:41:54.109 --> 00:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
you draw our attention to because
 
00:41:56.390 --> 00:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
obviously those bills go a lot more than
 
00:41:58.430 --> 00:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
that in them could you draw could you
 
00:41:59.810 --> 00:41:59.820 align:start position:0%
let us know which are the components of
 
00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:01.740 align:start position:0%
those bills that are the pieces you're
 
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
talking about that are specific to the
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
the evidence-based trauma-informed uh
 
00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:08.160 align:start position:0%
treatment like needs Hood I don't have a
 
00:42:11.569 --> 00:42:11.579 align:start position:0%
cup and I really want him to to do that
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
and I I can anticipate him doing it in
 
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
about 15 minutes I just want to make
 
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
sure that we've moved methodically
 
00:42:22.190 --> 00:42:22.200 align:start position:0%
through if we if we've got our HP 49
 
00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:24.660 align:start position:0%
issues identified and if we're ready to
 
00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
take on the Amendments if I can respond
 
00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
to that yes sir that's why I asked the
 
00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:30.420 align:start position:0%
question because
 
00:42:32.569 --> 00:42:32.579 align:start position:0%
um I see where HP 49
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
if it says vehicle to get us beyond the
 
00:42:40.069 --> 00:42:40.079 align:start position:0%
deadline and uh in the past Mr ribson
 
00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:42.540 align:start position:0%
has mentioned how important it is to get
 
00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:44.460 align:start position:0%
the evidence-based training going
 
00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps those need to be could be
 
00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:49.790 align:start position:0%
perhaps those need to be could be
married

00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
oh okay so HP 49 is an extension of four
 
00:42:56.290 --> 00:42:56.300 align:start position:0%
months and based on their personnel
 
00:42:59.870 --> 00:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
situation I I don't imagine that they'll
 
00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:02.700 align:start position:0%
be able to do much other than not get
 
00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:06.200 align:start position:0%
worse is the goal and just
 
00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
I I I I I think we need to get to some
 
00:43:12.829 --> 00:43:12.839 align:start position:0%
discussions around the design components
 
00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:15.780 align:start position:0%
and model desires
 
00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:18.300 align:start position:0%
when we begin to talk about amendments
 
00:43:22.849 --> 00:43:22.859 align:start position:0%
so can can okay so so yes sir do you
 
00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
have an HP 49 Centric question I do
 
00:43:28.849 --> 00:43:28.859 align:start position:0%
if I understand correctly there might be
 
00:43:30.349 --> 00:43:30.359 align:start position:0%
amendments that representative Wallner
 
00:43:33.050 --> 00:43:33.060 align:start position:0%
has that we could start discussing and
 
00:43:35.809 --> 00:43:35.819 align:start position:0%
then see amongst those and potentially
 
00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
others right what's in play to discuss
 
00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:39.230 align:start position:0%
others right what's in play to discuss
today

00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
today
 
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
so so you're right representative Waller
 
00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
I think has two and I have two so we
 
00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:47.460 align:start position:0%
have we have lots of amendments that we
 
00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:49.380 align:start position:0%
can discuss and we're not going to come
 
00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
out of here with any decisions today but
 
00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:53.220 align:start position:0%
I hopefully we're going to come out of
 
00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:57.060 align:start position:0%
here smarter so uh do you do you want to
 
00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:00.540 align:start position:0%
pick one of your amendments and
 
00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
oh uh I I don't have a copy of your
 
00:44:07.069 --> 00:44:07.079 align:start position:0%
Amendment do I
 
00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:09.420 align:start position:0%
I think Kevin does have
 
00:44:12.109 --> 00:44:12.119 align:start position:0%
copies for everybody okay
 
00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
I get I guess I I will bring in
 
00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:31.980 align:start position:0%
M yeah that's the longer one
 
00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:34.260 align:start position:0%
these are two numbers I mentioned on the
 
00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:41.940 align:start position:0%
great thank you uh Mr arlinghaus do you
 
00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:44.220 align:start position:0%
have a time where you have to leave I
 
00:44:46.130 --> 00:44:46.140 align:start position:0%
want to respect your time and the fact
 
00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
that you're here for some specific
 
00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:54.950 align:start position:0%
that you're here for some specific
testimony

00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:57.770 --> 00:44:57.780 align:start position:0%
I I I don't I don't want to do that I
 
00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I'm I might twist our process a
 
00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
little bit to get you up here uh so that
 
00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:07.380 align:start position:0%
your you have some flexibility but
 
00:45:10.069 --> 00:45:10.079 align:start position:0%
uh all right thank you
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
go ahead represent Waller well I think
 
00:45:14.809 --> 00:45:14.819 align:start position:0%
it might be I mean I think it might be
 
00:45:16.490 --> 00:45:16.500 align:start position:0%
helpful to hear from Mr Arlington
 
00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
because the amendment that I have before
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
that I brought in was one that I talked
 
00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
to um the chairman about yesterday and
 
00:45:29.450 --> 00:45:29.460 align:start position:0%
it puts the date out by two years and
 
00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
gives the department
 
00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:32.930 align:start position:0%
gives the department
um

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:32.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:35.809 --> 00:45:35.819 align:start position:0%
I just pulled two million dollars out of
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
a hat and Mr arlinghaus will be able to
 
00:45:39.829 --> 00:45:39.839 align:start position:0%
help us with that
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
um to start the
 
00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:43.500 align:start position:0%
um architectural design and the
 
00:45:46.849 --> 00:45:46.859 align:start position:0%
evaluation of the sites so
 
00:45:46.859 --> 00:45:48.410 align:start position:0%
evaluation of the sites so
um

00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:48.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
it seems like this might be interesting
 
00:45:52.970 --> 00:45:52.980 align:start position:0%
to hear from him yes ma'am let's let's
 
00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:56.220 align:start position:0%
not have you leave Mr ripson uh let's
 
00:45:58.130 --> 00:45:58.140 align:start position:0%
let's have you become buddies with Mr
 
00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
arlinghouse because I I I think we're
 
00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:02.700 align:start position:0%
going to bounce back and forth from one
 
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:19.010 --> 00:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
um I'm Charlie arlinghaus I'm the
 
00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:20.220 align:start position:0%
commission of administrative services
 
00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:22.740 align:start position:0%
and with me is Ted kupper who's director
 
00:46:25.010 --> 00:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
of Public Works um
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
and the can you spell the things I think
 
00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
we can
 
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
add to your list is that um
 
00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:34.740 align:start position:0%
hold on just one second
 
00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:37.140 align:start position:0%
um we're gonna we're gonna get to you
 
00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
very quickly I I want to understand the
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
intent of the of the amendment uh I uh
 
00:46:49.190 --> 00:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
the the first items online five and six
 
00:46:52.849 --> 00:46:52.859 align:start position:0%
are obvious instead of you know moving
 
00:46:54.829 --> 00:46:54.839 align:start position:0%
this out four months you're proposing
 
00:46:58.190 --> 00:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
moving it out 28 months but this this is
 
00:47:00.829 --> 00:47:00.839 align:start position:0%
essentially the status quo this is
 
00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:03.560 align:start position:0%
without the replacement
 
00:47:06.250 --> 00:47:06.260 align:start position:0%
until you get to
 
00:47:09.170 --> 00:47:09.180 align:start position:0%
your appropriation and in the
 
00:47:13.390 --> 00:47:13.400 align:start position:0%
appropriation you're you're adding more
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
than is is this two million dollars is
 
00:47:18.829 --> 00:47:18.839 align:start position:0%
this intended for just this fiscal year
 
00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:22.740 align:start position:0%
or is this intended between now and 25
 
00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:29.270 --> 00:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
it would be non-lapsing and it would get
 
00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:31.200 align:start position:0%
it would be available to the department
 
00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:33.240 align:start position:0%
my idea was to have it available to the
 
00:47:35.569 --> 00:47:35.579 align:start position:0%
department so they could get started on
 
00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
site evaluation because we still have
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
not heard where it's going to be and
 
00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:43.740 align:start position:0%
some of the architectural consulting
 
00:47:47.809 --> 00:47:47.819 align:start position:0%
which is where just how I made it up and
 
00:47:49.849 --> 00:47:49.859 align:start position:0%
the development of design
 
00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
just just to get them you know so that
 
00:47:55.069 --> 00:47:55.079 align:start position:0%
they would have some
 
00:47:58.609 --> 00:47:58.619 align:start position:0%
money to start that process so because
 
00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:00.060 align:start position:0%
at this point I don't think it's been
 
00:48:02.569 --> 00:48:02.579 align:start position:0%
started so so if I if I may just more
 
00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:05.700 align:start position:0%
clarification what what this what your
 
00:48:09.050 --> 00:48:09.060 align:start position:0%
Amendment does is it which is good in my
 
00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
view is we're getting them started on
 
00:48:14.089 --> 00:48:14.099 align:start position:0%
the planning and everything but I don't
 
00:48:17.569 --> 00:48:17.579 align:start position:0%
see operations money in this so so we
 
00:48:19.490 --> 00:48:19.500 align:start position:0%
wouldn't they still need operations
 
00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:22.260 align:start position:0%
money to get through this fiscal year
 
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
I had in this amendment I hadn't dealt
 
00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
with that I had a separate conversation
 
00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:32.040 align:start position:0%
with the LBA about it and actually Kevin
 
00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
just handed me a piece of paper that we
 
00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:37.020 align:start position:0%
can take a look at and maybe he can
 
00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:38.930 align:start position:0%
can take a look at and maybe he can
explain

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:38.940 align:start position:0%
explain
 
00:48:41.690 --> 00:48:41.700 align:start position:0%
where he thinks we are on the spin down
 
00:48:45.650 --> 00:48:45.660 align:start position:0%
okay based on earlier testimony you're
 
00:48:48.290 --> 00:48:48.300 align:start position:0%
going to get talking in 20 seconds but
 
00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
uh based on earlier testimony the 1.5 to
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
get from through the next four months
 
00:48:59.870 --> 00:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
appeared to be a good enough estimate
 
00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:01.260 align:start position:0%
come on
 
00:49:06.829 --> 00:49:06.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
um the 1.5 was enough to get us through
 
00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:12.780 align:start position:0%
the next four months on an operational
 
00:49:17.589 --> 00:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
perspective and so if we were to accept
 
00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:19.700 align:start position:0%
representative Walter's Amendment
 
00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't would wouldn't we need to also
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
make reference to the 1.5 million of
 
00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
operation in addition to her
 
00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
introduction of the two million dollars
 
00:49:35.089 --> 00:49:35.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
you may and that would be the committee
 
00:49:39.050 --> 00:49:39.060 align:start position:0%
up to the committee but what I provided
 
00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
to representative Wallner was a look at
 
00:49:42.589 --> 00:49:42.599 align:start position:0%
what this was actually spent on the
 
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
sununu center in fiscal 22. uh so in
 
00:49:48.829 --> 00:49:48.839 align:start position:0%
fiscal 22 in total funds uh this new
 
00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:51.720 align:start position:0%
center spent 9.1 million dollars
 
00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
their budget in 23 is 9 million of
 
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
General funds and another 1 million of
 
00:49:57.410 --> 00:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
other funds for a total of 10 million
 
00:49:57.420 --> 00:49:58.490 align:start position:0%
other funds for a total of 10 million
dollars

00:49:58.490 --> 00:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:50:00.290 --> 00:50:00.300 align:start position:0%
um as Mr ribson mentioned some of those
 
00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:03.060 align:start position:0%
other funds may not be available this
 
00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal year but what's in the budget
 
00:50:08.450 --> 00:50:08.460 align:start position:0%
covers what was spent last year I'll put
 
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
it that way there may be rising costs
 
00:50:12.829 --> 00:50:12.839 align:start position:0%
there may be a lack of other funds but
 
00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:15.540 align:start position:0%
when you say that what's in the budget
 
00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:18.180 align:start position:0%
do you mean the budget that expires at
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
the end of June or the budget that
 
00:50:22.250 --> 00:50:22.260 align:start position:0%
begins July 1.
 
00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:24.900 align:start position:0%
the budget for fiscal year 23 that we're
 
00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:26.700 align:start position:0%
currently in contains 10 million dollars
 
00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:28.740 align:start position:0%
total 9 million General funds and 1
 
00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:31.140 align:start position:0%
million other funds so as a summary of
 
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
your analysis is that the the funds are
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
already adequate if we just extend the
 
00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:37.560 align:start position:0%
by four months so we don't need
 
00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:39.780 align:start position:0%
additional operational money between now
 
00:50:42.349 --> 00:50:42.359 align:start position:0%
and then I will leave that decision to
 
00:50:44.089 --> 00:50:44.099 align:start position:0%
you based on what I've provided and I
 
00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:45.540 align:start position:0%
can provide to you the same paper that I
 
00:50:47.329 --> 00:50:47.339 align:start position:0%
gave to representative good I'm just
 
00:50:49.730 --> 00:50:49.740 align:start position:0%
looking for your analysis I have high
 
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
faith in your ability to do that but do
 
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
do we have enough of your of the of what
 
00:50:58.730 --> 00:50:58.740 align:start position:0%
you gave representative Waller I'll have
 
00:50:59.870 --> 00:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
to make copies for the rest of the
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
committee but I can do that okay well
 
00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:04.020 align:start position:0%
we'll pause that part
 
00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
I think we've done enough though to to
 
00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:11.220 align:start position:0%
introduce A New Concept here is that HB
 
00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:14.940 align:start position:0%
49 might be improved if we put two
 
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
million dollars in so that the
 
00:51:22.069 --> 00:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
department could begin to do site
 
00:51:22.079 --> 00:51:23.890 align:start position:0%
department could begin to do site
evaluation

00:51:23.890 --> 00:51:23.900 align:start position:0%
evaluation
 
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
architectural consultation development
 
00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:30.420 align:start position:0%
design to look for some options for the
 
00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:33.180 align:start position:0%
replacement facility and that that money
 
00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:34.980 align:start position:0%
would be non-lapsing so if we
 
00:51:37.690 --> 00:51:37.700 align:start position:0%
appropriated it now you could use it
 
00:51:43.670 --> 00:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
so with that I think Mr arlinghaus now
 
00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:48.480 align:start position:0%
you have an opportunity to start talking
 
00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
about money is is what what is your
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
reaction to the 2 million to do
 
00:51:58.670 --> 00:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
um site evaluation which I assume should
 
00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:01.140 align:start position:0%
include site coordination going out and
 
00:52:03.470 --> 00:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
talking to the towns and municipalities
 
00:52:06.049 --> 00:52:06.059 align:start position:0%
site evaluation architectural
 
00:52:09.170 --> 00:52:09.180 align:start position:0%
consultation and development design for
 
00:52:11.710 --> 00:52:11.720 align:start position:0%
two at least two options
 
00:52:14.809 --> 00:52:14.819 align:start position:0%
and the two options that I think we're
 
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
going to talk about is a you know on a
 
00:52:21.890 --> 00:52:21.900 align:start position:0%
Goldilocks model the you know the the
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
smaller model and the bigger model and
 
00:52:27.650 --> 00:52:27.660 align:start position:0%
the smaller model maybe six to eight the
 
00:52:33.049 --> 00:52:33.059 align:start position:0%
bigger model might be 12 to 18. so so
 
00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:35.700 align:start position:0%
the idea might be that we would ask them
 
00:52:38.569 --> 00:52:38.579 align:start position:0%
to come up with two designs so that we
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
have information later to evaluate which
 
00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
option makes more sense that's a new new
 
00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:46.980 align:start position:0%
thing for you I know you've not heard
 
00:52:50.329 --> 00:52:50.339 align:start position:0%
that before but but uh but go ahead well
 
00:52:52.069 --> 00:52:52.079 align:start position:0%
let me let me start by telling you what
 
00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:53.460 align:start position:0%
I do know
 
00:52:55.549 --> 00:52:55.559 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't include the concept of
 
00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
two designs but
 
00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:00.540 align:start position:0%
um so let me do that as an addendum
 
00:53:03.049 --> 00:53:03.059 align:start position:0%
um we have and I will leave with
 
00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:05.940 align:start position:0%
probably with Kevin with Mr Ripple
 
00:53:08.569 --> 00:53:08.579 align:start position:0%
um the two sheets of paper for you it it
 
00:53:11.569 --> 00:53:11.579 align:start position:0%
it happenstance is that we were
 
00:53:14.450 --> 00:53:14.460 align:start position:0%
called to ask to stop by Senator
 
00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:17.460 align:start position:0%
Bradley's office yesterday and uh and
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
present him numbers how much does one of
 
00:53:22.010 --> 00:53:22.020 align:start position:0%
these things actually cost and so last
 
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
night I I sent um
 
00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:26.460 align:start position:0%
I sent a couple of people a document
 
00:53:28.069 --> 00:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
which is the estimated cost of a new 18
 
00:53:31.370 --> 00:53:31.380 align:start position:0%
bed Juvenile Justice Facility treatment
 
00:53:33.530 --> 00:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
facility whatever we're calling it
 
00:53:34.849 --> 00:53:34.859 align:start position:0%
um so I can tell you how much it would
 
00:53:36.589 --> 00:53:36.599 align:start position:0%
cost to build a
 
00:53:38.809 --> 00:53:38.819 align:start position:0%
a 12 to 18 bed facility which means an
 
00:53:41.569 --> 00:53:41.579 align:start position:0%
18 bed facility and and how much that
 
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
would cost to build all in which is
 
00:53:47.329 --> 00:53:47.339 align:start position:0%
about 21 let's call it 21.5 million I
 
00:53:50.569 --> 00:53:50.579 align:start position:0%
can also tell you what's it cost to get
 
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
us to bidable documents that is to say
 
00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
if we hired and we're on the verge of we
 
00:53:56.870 --> 00:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
would be on the verge of hiring an
 
00:53:59.630 --> 00:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
architecture an engineering firm to do
 
00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:01.740 align:start position:0%
the design work under the typical State
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
process what would it cost to to do that
 
00:54:06.890 --> 00:54:06.900 align:start position:0%
and design contingency and and
 
00:54:09.530 --> 00:54:09.540 align:start position:0%
commissioning fees Etc and it would be
 
00:54:11.329 --> 00:54:11.339 align:start position:0%
just under two million dollars so so
 
00:54:14.450 --> 00:54:14.460 align:start position:0%
that number we came up with 1.7 to 1.8
 
00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:16.190 align:start position:0%
that number we came up with 1.7 to 1.8
million

00:54:16.190 --> 00:54:16.200 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:17.270 align:start position:0%
million
um

00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
so let me put it this way let me let me
 
00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:22.020 align:start position:0%
break this up into bite-sized pieces if
 
00:54:24.710 --> 00:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:27.900 align:start position:0%
if today we are deciding to build an
 
00:54:29.930 --> 00:54:29.940 align:start position:0%
18-bed facility
 
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
which is 12 because if you build a 12
 
00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:34.020 align:start position:0%
bed facility that can accommodate 18
 
00:54:36.650 --> 00:54:36.660 align:start position:0%
it's from a construction standpoint not
 
00:54:39.589 --> 00:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
programming it's an 18 bed facility if
 
00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
today we build an 18 bed facility and we
 
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
start the Contracting process of getting
 
00:54:46.790 --> 00:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
a firm getting to GNC in the next few
 
00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:48.470 align:start position:0%
a firm getting to GNC in the next few
meetings

00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
00:54:50.870 --> 00:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
um it would be from about now until we
 
00:54:53.569 --> 00:54:53.579 align:start position:0%
until we bid about a year
 
00:54:56.809 --> 00:54:56.819 align:start position:0%
and you know not 365 days but about a
 
00:54:56.819 --> 00:54:57.890 align:start position:0%
and you know not 365 days but about a
year

00:54:57.890 --> 00:54:57.900 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:54:59.450 --> 00:54:59.460 align:start position:0%
um and then the construction phase of
 
00:55:00.829 --> 00:55:00.839 align:start position:0%
that would be another
 
00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
um let's call it a year and a half if
 
00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
you ask me for a ballpark
 
00:55:06.589 --> 00:55:06.599 align:start position:0%
um I think Ted would say we would
 
00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:09.359 align:start position:0%
anticipate a building if we got started
 
00:55:12.170 --> 00:55:12.180 align:start position:0%
more or less today uh to be ready to
 
00:55:14.930 --> 00:55:14.940 align:start position:0%
transfer to HHS for
 
00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
occupancy or whatever roughly September
 
00:55:22.130 --> 00:55:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
um that's a that's a that's a very good
 
00:55:26.270 --> 00:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
ballpark number I mean obviously
 
00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
that that's that sounds like a
 
00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
consistent number that you've been
 
00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
sharing with people before and and in
 
00:55:35.450 --> 00:55:35.460 align:start position:0%
the sb1 I think Senator Carson added a
 
00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
little Kentucky windage to that and made
 
00:55:40.849 --> 00:55:40.859 align:start position:0%
it November of of 25 is is that your
 
00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
understanding yeah I uh never opposed A
 
00:55:45.770 --> 00:55:45.780 align:start position:0%
little bit of Kentucky windage added to
 
00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
construction is unpredictable so yes and
 
00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
in the sb1 they also included the
 
00:55:54.589 --> 00:55:54.599 align:start position:0%
governor could uh go for an additional
 
00:55:59.210 --> 00:55:59.220 align:start position:0%
year to 2026 I believe I'm sure I've
 
00:56:01.069 --> 00:56:01.079 align:start position:0%
read the final draft of that bill as it
 
00:56:04.849 --> 00:56:04.859 align:start position:0%
passed yeah so so I'm happy that our
 
00:56:06.829 --> 00:56:06.839 align:start position:0%
timelines are lining up and I'm happy
 
00:56:10.250 --> 00:56:10.260 align:start position:0%
that you've said that uh you think the
 
00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
the work that's stipulated in Amendment
 
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
zero three one one of the walner
 
00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:19.190 align:start position:0%
zero three one one of the walner
amendment

00:56:19.190 --> 00:56:19.200 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:56:22.329 --> 00:56:22.339 align:start position:0%
um that that work for site evaluation
 
00:56:24.770 --> 00:56:24.780 align:start position:0%
architectural consultation development
 
00:56:26.450 --> 00:56:26.460 align:start position:0%
and design options for the replacement
 
00:56:29.450 --> 00:56:29.460 align:start position:0%
facility that that that that that could
 
00:56:31.490 --> 00:56:31.500 align:start position:0%
be that a two million dollar estimate is
 
00:56:34.790 --> 00:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
a good estimate it may be a little high
 
00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
so so wouldn't we
 
00:56:40.250 --> 00:56:40.260 align:start position:0%
assuming it is a little high wouldn't we
 
00:56:42.530 --> 00:56:42.540 align:start position:0%
want to just put another sentence in
 
00:56:44.809 --> 00:56:44.819 align:start position:0%
there to say that any money left over
 
00:56:46.970 --> 00:56:46.980 align:start position:0%
can be contributed towards con
 
00:56:50.210 --> 00:56:50.220 align:start position:0%
construction should we go forward
 
00:56:52.790 --> 00:56:52.800 align:start position:0%
or or not
 
00:56:54.950 --> 00:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
well if if it's less than two million
 
00:56:59.510 --> 00:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:02.349 --> 00:57:02.359 align:start position:0%
it goes back into the general
 
00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
funds we'd laugh let me let me just get
 
00:57:07.549 --> 00:57:07.559 align:start position:0%
if I can I want I want Ted to give you
 
00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
just a couple seconds on what this
 
00:57:12.109 --> 00:57:12.119 align:start position:0%
estimate does entail and doesn't entail
 
00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
in case there's some stuff you want done
 
00:57:16.849 --> 00:57:16.859 align:start position:0%
that we're not complete can you spell
 
00:57:22.849 --> 00:57:22.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
first name is Theodore
 
00:57:28.130 --> 00:57:28.140 align:start position:0%
um so I'm a professional engineer
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
employed by the state working for the
 
00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
division of Public Works
 
00:57:33.119 --> 00:57:34.609 align:start position:0%
division of Public Works
and

00:57:34.609 --> 00:57:34.619 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:37.849 --> 00:57:37.859 align:start position:0%
um we're we're right now on the verge of
 
00:57:40.130 --> 00:57:40.140 align:start position:0%
approving and negotiate a contract with
 
00:57:41.630 --> 00:57:41.640 align:start position:0%
a consultant
 
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
and that contract
 
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
would be to evaluate potentially three
 
00:57:53.030 --> 00:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
sites and the evaluation would simply be
 
00:57:57.290 --> 00:57:57.300 align:start position:0%
to select the site that the design would
 
00:57:59.750 --> 00:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
be completed for
 
00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:00.349 align:start position:0%
be completed for
um

00:58:00.349 --> 00:58:00.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
so we're looking at evaluating three
 
00:58:05.089 --> 00:58:05.099 align:start position:0%
sites and then proceeding into the
 
00:58:07.370 --> 00:58:07.380 align:start position:0%
design phase of the project which
 
00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
Charlie mentioned would be about 11
 
00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:10.309 align:start position:0%
Charlie mentioned would be about 11
months

00:58:10.309 --> 00:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
months
 
00:58:14.030 --> 00:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
at the end of that design phase and an
 
00:58:17.349 --> 00:58:17.359 align:start position:0%
expenditure of about 1.8 million dollars
 
00:58:21.530 --> 00:58:21.540 align:start position:0%
we would have in our hands a full set of
 
00:58:23.210 --> 00:58:23.220 align:start position:0%
construction documents and
 
00:58:26.329 --> 00:58:26.339 align:start position:0%
specifications that we would be ready to
 
00:58:26.339 --> 00:58:27.530 align:start position:0%
specifications that we would be ready to
bid

00:58:27.530 --> 00:58:27.540 align:start position:0%
bid
 
00:58:30.230 --> 00:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
if we had an appropriation that would
 
00:58:34.670 --> 00:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:36.829 --> 00:58:36.839 align:start position:0%
well well that's a lot there's some
 
00:58:39.049 --> 00:58:39.059 align:start position:0%
breaking news in there I think for some
 
00:58:42.170 --> 00:58:42.180 align:start position:0%
of us that that you all are ready to go
 
00:58:44.809 --> 00:58:44.819 align:start position:0%
ahead and let a contract to begin the
 
00:58:46.789 --> 00:58:46.799 align:start position:0%
design work I think there's a good news
 
00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
aspect to that the the other side of it
 
00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:50.809 align:start position:0%
aspect to that the the other side of it
is

00:58:50.809 --> 00:58:50.819 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:58:50.819 --> 00:58:51.370 align:start position:0%
is
um

00:58:51.370 --> 00:58:51.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:55.309 --> 00:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
what what design assumptions will go
 
00:58:57.890 --> 00:58:57.900 align:start position:0%
into that there's a lot of language in
 
00:59:00.589 --> 00:59:00.599 align:start position:0%
sb1 and there was in the committee a
 
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
conference about the things that we
 
00:59:05.089 --> 00:59:05.099 align:start position:0%
wanted to do have you have you decided
 
00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
that you would issue those as the design
 
00:59:12.530 --> 00:59:12.540 align:start position:0%
assumptions to help bound or scope the
 
00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:14.809 align:start position:0%
assumptions to help bound or scope the
project

00:59:14.809 --> 00:59:14.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure that I know exactly
 
00:59:22.549 --> 00:59:22.559 align:start position:0%
what's in sb1 but I can outline for you
 
00:59:25.069 --> 00:59:25.079 align:start position:0%
very basically what the scope of the
 
00:59:27.890 --> 00:59:27.900 align:start position:0%
work for them would be well please do
 
00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:30.180 align:start position:0%
um it would be a 12 bed facility that
 
00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:33.180 align:start position:0%
would surge to 18 which is Charlie just
 
00:59:35.089 --> 00:59:35.099 align:start position:0%
mentioned please please don't use the
 
00:59:36.849 --> 00:59:36.859 align:start position:0%
word search
 
00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:39.780 align:start position:0%
it's it's an inside thing don't use the
 
00:59:41.809 --> 00:59:41.819 align:start position:0%
word search but what we have is a
 
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
maximum capacity of 18. a maximum
 
00:59:46.910 --> 00:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
capacity of 18 Beds which as Charlie
 
00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:48.650 align:start position:0%
capacity of 18 Beds which as Charlie
mentioned

00:59:48.650 --> 00:59:48.660 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
um is uh from our perspective an 18 bed
 
00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:54.049 align:start position:0%
um is uh from our perspective an 18 bed
facility

00:59:54.049 --> 00:59:54.059 align:start position:0%
facility
 
00:59:57.349 --> 00:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh we we're not quite sure how all of
 
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
those 18 beds would be used
 
01:00:02.030 --> 01:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
um and that's something that in the
 
01:00:05.690 --> 01:00:05.700 align:start position:0%
design process will determine
 
01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:08.700 align:start position:0%
um you know there's as uh Joe mentioned
 
01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:11.640 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
01:00:15.170 --> 01:00:15.180 align:start position:0%
combination of uh males and females in
 
01:00:19.370 --> 01:00:19.380 align:start position:0%
the facility uh there might be a reason
 
01:00:23.089 --> 01:00:23.099 align:start position:0%
to isolate some of those populations
 
01:00:26.750 --> 01:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
because they're sick or because perhaps
 
01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:29.220 align:start position:0%
they're violent but all of that will be
 
01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:30.650 align:start position:0%
they're violent but all of that will be
determined

01:00:30.650 --> 01:00:30.660 align:start position:0%
determined
 
01:00:32.569 --> 01:00:32.579 align:start position:0%
um you know when when we get through the
 
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
design how those 18 beds will be used
 
01:00:38.809 --> 01:00:38.819 align:start position:0%
and how they'll be segregated
 
01:00:40.849 --> 01:00:40.859 align:start position:0%
um so it would be the design of a core
 
01:00:40.859 --> 01:00:42.170 align:start position:0%
um so it would be the design of a core
facility

01:00:42.170 --> 01:00:42.180 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
that would manage the 18 beds of about
 
01:00:49.309 --> 01:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
5620 square feet
 
01:00:53.109 --> 01:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
there'd be housing that would represent
 
01:00:55.370 --> 01:00:55.380 align:start position:0%
7640 square feet
 
01:00:57.710 --> 01:00:57.720 align:start position:0%
there'd be a recreational component to
 
01:01:00.530 --> 01:01:00.540 align:start position:0%
the facility that would represent 3 500
 
01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
square feet
 
01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
there'd be maintenance portions of the
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
facility in order to maintain the
 
01:01:08.589 --> 01:01:08.599 align:start position:0%
facility about a thousand square feet
 
01:01:11.089 --> 01:01:11.099 align:start position:0%
and then mechanical electrical
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
circulation security walls the grossing
 
01:01:17.349 --> 01:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
Factor if you will for any building
 
01:01:19.630 --> 01:01:19.640 align:start position:0%
is about 8
 
01:01:25.210 --> 01:01:25.220 align:start position:0%
335 square feet for a grand total of 25
 
01:01:28.309 --> 01:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
140 square feet
 
01:01:30.289 --> 01:01:30.299 align:start position:0%
um we're indicating to the consultant
 
01:01:33.349 --> 01:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
we'd like them to use 25 000 square feet
 
01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
and because you're reading off of
 
01:01:41.809 --> 01:01:41.819 align:start position:0%
something there's something you could
 
01:01:43.609 --> 01:01:43.619 align:start position:0%
provide to the community this is the
 
01:01:46.190 --> 01:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
document that Mr Arlington uh said that
 
01:01:48.829 --> 01:01:48.839 align:start position:0%
he would provide okay and I'm going to
 
01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
say something extreme and over simple to
 
01:01:54.530 --> 01:01:54.540 align:start position:0%
give you a chance to correct it
 
01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:55.190 align:start position:0%
give you a chance to correct it
um

01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:57.770 --> 01:01:57.780 align:start position:0%
what I think I heard you say is that
 
01:02:01.309 --> 01:02:01.319 align:start position:0%
within available funds already within
 
01:02:04.490 --> 01:02:04.500 align:start position:0%
the department you have about 1.8
 
01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:07.559 align:start position:0%
million dollars to fund this design work
 
01:02:10.849 --> 01:02:10.859 align:start position:0%
this is what I think I heard and that
 
01:02:13.970 --> 01:02:13.980 align:start position:0%
you already have adequate design
 
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
criteria to to begin the analysis and
 
01:02:21.109 --> 01:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
and if that's the case that
 
01:02:24.410 --> 01:02:24.420 align:start position:0%
shifts what Our obligation is on what we
 
01:02:27.650 --> 01:02:27.660 align:start position:0%
need to get out into into law so I want
 
01:02:29.809 --> 01:02:29.819 align:start position:0%
to hear that very carefully that do you
 
01:02:31.730 --> 01:02:31.740 align:start position:0%
already have the money to do this or do
 
01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
you need this two million dollars that's
 
01:02:37.789 --> 01:02:37.799 align:start position:0%
in the okay I believe there is
 
01:02:40.970 --> 01:02:40.980 align:start position:0%
um there's no money appropriated yet for
 
01:02:44.270 --> 01:02:44.280 align:start position:0%
this we're proceeding
 
01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
um with the idea that money would be
 
01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:48.010 align:start position:0%
um with the idea that money would be
appropriated

01:02:48.010 --> 01:02:48.020 align:start position:0%
appropriated
 
01:02:52.010 --> 01:02:52.020 align:start position:0%
and uh and the task that was assigned to
 
01:02:55.490 --> 01:02:55.500 align:start position:0%
us to develop these documents was how
 
01:02:58.849 --> 01:02:58.859 align:start position:0%
much for an all-in 18 bed facility
 
01:03:02.510 --> 01:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
What's the total price and of that total
 
01:03:05.329 --> 01:03:05.339 align:start position:0%
price we've estimated that we're going
 
01:03:09.530 --> 01:03:09.540 align:start position:0%
to require about 1.8 million dollars to
 
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
begin the design and Analysis uh thank
 
01:03:14.569 --> 01:03:14.579 align:start position:0%
you for that do you think there's any
 
01:03:17.870 --> 01:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
additional costs associated with sort of
 
01:03:20.569 --> 01:03:20.579 align:start position:0%
this two-step process or maybe it's a
 
01:03:22.609 --> 01:03:22.619 align:start position:0%
it's more effective and efficient but
 
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
but this would put us on a path of a
 
01:03:28.010 --> 01:03:28.020 align:start position:0%
two-step process of going and doing the
 
01:03:30.109 --> 01:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
design and Analysis and getting all the
 
01:03:32.089 --> 01:03:32.099 align:start position:0%
documentation ready
 
01:03:33.770 --> 01:03:33.780 align:start position:0%
full stop
 
01:03:36.289 --> 01:03:36.299 align:start position:0%
second phase would be the construction
 
01:03:38.329 --> 01:03:38.339 align:start position:0%
phase where we would issue another
 
01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
contract to go build the thing
 
01:03:44.329 --> 01:03:44.339 align:start position:0%
okay is that is is there a two-step
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
process implied and what you're thinking
 
01:03:48.109 --> 01:03:48.119 align:start position:0%
you're going to do and and and what does
 
01:03:50.270 --> 01:03:50.280 align:start position:0%
the two-step process do in terms of
 
01:03:52.849 --> 01:03:52.859 align:start position:0%
which which is better good government
 
01:03:55.130 --> 01:03:55.140 align:start position:0%
I think I understand your question
 
01:03:59.690 --> 01:03:59.700 align:start position:0%
um we see it more like a pause rather
 
01:04:01.970 --> 01:04:01.980 align:start position:0%
than a full stop so what we're
 
01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
anticipating is that
 
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
um we might receive an appropriation of
 
01:04:09.770 --> 01:04:09.780 align:start position:0%
1.8 million dollars that would begin the
 
01:04:11.710 --> 01:04:11.720 align:start position:0%
design process
 
01:04:15.289 --> 01:04:15.299 align:start position:0%
and in or about the time that we're
 
01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
ready to bid the project so that 1.8
 
01:04:22.849 --> 01:04:22.859 align:start position:0%
million has been expended and we're in
 
01:04:25.549 --> 01:04:25.559 align:start position:0%
possession of the construction documents
 
01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:28.200 align:start position:0%
that were ready to bid
 
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
um prior to that or on or about that
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
time there would be another
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
appropriation that would fund the
 
01:04:36.109 --> 01:04:36.119 align:start position:0%
construction and we'd be able to roll
 
01:04:38.809 --> 01:04:38.819 align:start position:0%
right into the bid to the bidding
 
01:04:38.819 --> 01:04:40.010 align:start position:0%
right into the bid to the bidding
process

01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:04:43.849 --> 01:04:43.859 align:start position:0%
now in our 1.8 million dollar estimate
 
01:04:46.430 --> 01:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
we've provided a a very small
 
01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:48.289 align:start position:0%
we've provided a a very small
contingency

01:04:48.289 --> 01:04:48.299 align:start position:0%
contingency
 
01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
that he anticipates a delay in the
 
01:04:52.849 --> 01:04:52.859 align:start position:0%
funding of the construction
 
01:04:52.859 --> 01:04:54.650 align:start position:0%
funding of the construction
appropriation

01:04:54.650 --> 01:04:54.660 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
01:04:58.010 --> 01:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
and that contingency would allow the
 
01:05:00.289 --> 01:05:00.299 align:start position:0%
architectural firm that's working on
 
01:05:03.890 --> 01:05:03.900 align:start position:0%
this design to go back and review the
 
01:05:06.890 --> 01:05:06.900 align:start position:0%
design to make sure that when
 
01:05:09.829 --> 01:05:09.839 align:start position:0%
construction money is appropriated that
 
01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
all the current codes that we would bid
 
01:05:15.770 --> 01:05:15.780 align:start position:0%
the project under would be met
 
01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
we see it more like a pause and even if
 
01:05:22.970 --> 01:05:22.980 align:start position:0%
there is a hard stop and a small delay
 
01:05:25.549 --> 01:05:25.559 align:start position:0%
before we proceed
 
01:05:25.559 --> 01:05:26.150 align:start position:0%
before we proceed
um

01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:28.970 --> 01:05:28.980 align:start position:0%
we see that perhaps there might be some
 
01:05:31.370 --> 01:05:31.380 align:start position:0%
advantage to this approach
 
01:05:33.589 --> 01:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
the construction Market out there right
 
01:05:36.170 --> 01:05:36.180 align:start position:0%
now is very volatile and very
 
01:05:39.589 --> 01:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
unpredictable and the pricing associated
 
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
with that on our projects that we're
 
01:05:44.450 --> 01:05:44.460 align:start position:0%
bidding currently are very uh difficult
 
01:05:46.430 --> 01:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
to anticipate
 
01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
going through a full design which would
 
01:05:52.789 --> 01:05:52.799 align:start position:0%
include a cost estimate based on current
 
01:05:56.990 --> 01:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:01.970 --> 01:06:01.980 align:start position:0%
would alert us to what we believe the
 
01:06:04.010 --> 01:06:04.020 align:start position:0%
cost of that facility would be at that
 
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
time right before we go out to bid but
 
01:06:10.250 --> 01:06:10.260 align:start position:0%
having said that we're anticipating that
 
01:06:12.589 --> 01:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
the 21 point
 
01:06:15.770 --> 01:06:15.780 align:start position:0%
five as Mr Arling house had summarized
 
01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:17.030 align:start position:0%
five as Mr Arling house had summarized
it

01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:06:20.510 --> 01:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
um is adequate to build this facility of
 
01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
18 beds can I can I pause here
 
01:06:25.490 --> 01:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
I understand part of your question would
 
01:06:26.930 --> 01:06:26.940 align:start position:0%
be the notion of
 
01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
two contracts versus one like design
 
01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
build versus we we anticipate an
 
01:06:33.230 --> 01:06:33.240 align:start position:0%
engineering contract and then a
 
01:06:35.089 --> 01:06:35.099 align:start position:0%
Construction contract a year later and I
 
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
think you're asking about that yes
 
01:06:41.349 --> 01:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
that's it I I I heard Ted answer that
 
01:06:44.029 --> 01:06:44.039 align:start position:0%
you can you can I I just wanted to say
 
01:06:45.770 --> 01:06:45.780 align:start position:0%
that this is actually typical of large
 
01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
projects that we do that there's a
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
design contract separate and it is it is
 
01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:52.799 align:start position:0%
uh on occasion we do design build where
 
01:06:54.650 --> 01:06:54.660 align:start position:0%
it's one contract right they design and
 
01:06:56.450 --> 01:06:56.460 align:start position:0%
build it together it's typically much
 
01:06:58.370 --> 01:06:58.380 align:start position:0%
smaller projects and the bigger projects
 
01:07:00.410 --> 01:07:00.420 align:start position:0%
so this is consistent with the
 
01:07:02.569 --> 01:07:02.579 align:start position:0%
traditional State process so so this
 
01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
this is uh this is great I I um as I'm
 
01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
looking at sb1 and I'm jumping around a
 
01:07:11.029 --> 01:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
little bit on you but this is also going
 
01:07:12.890 --> 01:07:12.900 align:start position:0%
to show up in an amendment here today I
 
01:07:14.510 --> 01:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
think is
 
01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:17.150 align:start position:0%
think is
um

01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:20.890 --> 01:07:20.900 align:start position:0%
I think sb1 anticipates a design build
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
concept are you familiar with sb1 enough
 
01:07:27.049 --> 01:07:27.059 align:start position:0%
to validate that there they they're
 
01:07:29.029 --> 01:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
looking design build and what we're
 
01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
hearing today is the the notion of a
 
01:07:33.589 --> 01:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
design and then a separate build
 
01:07:33.599 --> 01:07:36.470 align:start position:0%
design and then a separate build
contract

01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
I believe we changed that language in
 
01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:41.700 align:start position:0%
sb1 do you have the final amended
 
01:07:43.549 --> 01:07:43.559 align:start position:0%
version that went through well it shows
 
01:07:46.010 --> 01:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
the the sum of 15 million for a fiscal
 
01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:46.990 align:start position:0%
the the sum of 15 million for a fiscal
year

01:07:46.990 --> 01:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:07:49.849 --> 01:07:49.859 align:start position:0%
appropriated for the design and
 
01:07:52.370 --> 01:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
construction of the new facility as
 
01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
described in two so they it literally
 
01:07:58.730 --> 01:07:58.740 align:start position:0%
says design and construction I think the
 
01:08:00.829 --> 01:08:00.839 align:start position:0%
our interpretation of language like that
 
01:08:04.309 --> 01:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
would be that the well the appropriation
 
01:08:05.930 --> 01:08:05.940 align:start position:0%
think of that like a capital budget
 
01:08:07.730 --> 01:08:07.740 align:start position:0%
appropriation where that's typically how
 
01:08:09.170 --> 01:08:09.180 align:start position:0%
the capital budget is appropriated
 
01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
here's 15 million dollars to accomplish
 
01:08:14.329 --> 01:08:14.339 align:start position:0%
this and you and the two separate
 
01:08:15.770 --> 01:08:15.780 align:start position:0%
contracts both come out of that one
 
01:08:18.050 --> 01:08:18.060 align:start position:0%
appropriation and that that's my read of
 
01:08:20.209 --> 01:08:20.219 align:start position:0%
that where they're not it doesn't
 
01:08:22.490 --> 01:08:22.500 align:start position:0%
specify you must do the design build
 
01:08:24.169 --> 01:08:24.179 align:start position:0%
process you can't do design bid build
 
01:08:27.110 --> 01:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you for educating me on
 
01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:27.829 align:start position:0%
okay okay thank you for educating me on
that

01:08:27.829 --> 01:08:27.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:08:32.030 --> 01:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
um and then I I think one of my fears uh
 
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
is that uh nsb1 due to the timing issue
 
01:08:38.749 --> 01:08:38.759 align:start position:0%
they they say that the governor shall
 
01:08:41.269 --> 01:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
first use any available discretionary
 
01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
funds appropriated in the American
 
01:08:47.209 --> 01:08:47.219 align:start position:0%
Rescue plan Act of 2021 and I'm I'm just
 
01:08:49.370 --> 01:08:49.380 align:start position:0%
curious if this approach of doing the
 
01:08:51.709 --> 01:08:51.719 align:start position:0%
design and the methodical way and then
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
the the build part if that's going to
 
01:08:58.370 --> 01:08:58.380 align:start position:0%
cause us to lose access to the arpa
 
01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:01.140 align:start position:0%
money and and that is is that a question
 
01:09:03.410 --> 01:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
you can address Mr Arlington what do you
 
01:09:05.269 --> 01:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
what do you think can we can we write
 
01:09:08.329 --> 01:09:08.339 align:start position:0%
this in a way where you so you could in
 
01:09:11.090 --> 01:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
the on the arpa money our timeline for
 
01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
finishing the work meets with when you
 
01:09:15.650 --> 01:09:15.660 align:start position:0%
must finish the arpa work by
 
01:09:18.289 --> 01:09:18.299 align:start position:0%
um and I think the the arpa funds would
 
01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:20.699 align:start position:0%
have to be committed by and I I don't
 
01:09:22.249 --> 01:09:22.259 align:start position:0%
claim to have any clue as to whether
 
01:09:24.650 --> 01:09:24.660 align:start position:0%
legislative leaders are or the governor
 
01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
wants to use arpa funds or not but
 
01:09:30.349 --> 01:09:30.359 align:start position:0%
um you could do it in addition to that
 
01:09:32.090 --> 01:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
the approach that we're describing
 
01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:33.550 align:start position:0%
the approach that we're describing
doesn't

01:09:33.550 --> 01:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
presuppose that you must do it as two
 
01:09:38.329 --> 01:09:38.339 align:start position:0%
separate Appropriations you could do it
 
01:09:39.829 --> 01:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
as one appropriation
 
01:09:42.829 --> 01:09:42.839 align:start position:0%
all right and and I I think I think we
 
01:09:44.749 --> 01:09:44.759 align:start position:0%
agreed though that the 15 million that's
 
01:09:48.229 --> 01:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
in sb1 is too low and and I just want to
 
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
understand your 21.6 estimate and the
 
01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
1.8 estimate is that is is that is a
 
01:09:59.870 --> 01:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
21.6 estimate inclusive of the 1.8 it is
 
01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
okay so it's not an additive it's not
 
01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
2.16 plus 1.8 okay all right uh Mr
 
01:10:08.510 --> 01:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
ribson you had a comment I just yeah I
 
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
just want to add a couple things um and
 
01:10:11.930 --> 01:10:11.940 align:start position:0%
certainly you can you can list a
 
01:10:13.850 --> 01:10:13.860 align:start position:0%
testimony yourself but the governor's
 
01:10:15.770 --> 01:10:15.780 align:start position:0%
budget director did come before Senate
 
01:10:17.689 --> 01:10:17.699 align:start position:0%
Finance to testify on these issues and
 
01:10:19.430 --> 01:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
said that there was 15 million dollars
 
01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
in arpa reserved for this purpose
 
01:10:24.770 --> 01:10:24.780 align:start position:0%
um that the it was anticipated that the
 
01:10:27.229 --> 01:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
timeline that has been discussed the
 
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
funds would be available to to support
 
01:10:31.850 --> 01:10:31.860 align:start position:0%
the construction that 50 million would
 
01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:33.239 align:start position:0%
be available to support the construction
 
01:10:35.570 --> 01:10:35.580 align:start position:0%
design in that timeline and then I would
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
just want to comment that if if it was a
 
01:10:39.649 --> 01:10:39.659 align:start position:0%
two-step appropriation that required
 
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
legislative action in the middle I would
 
01:10:43.850 --> 01:10:43.860 align:start position:0%
be concerned that you wouldn't be able
 
01:10:45.830 --> 01:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
to hit that timeline right if there was
 
01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
something if there was you know some
 
01:10:49.790 --> 01:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
other bill that had to happen or some
 
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
other thing that had to happen in the
 
01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
middle that would be another
 
01:10:55.610 --> 01:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
process that would slow down the the
 
01:10:58.370 --> 01:10:58.380 align:start position:0%
ability to reach that arpa deadline so
 
01:11:00.830 --> 01:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
so representative Weiler
 
01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I have a question
 
01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
while we have Mr cupper here
 
01:11:07.490 --> 01:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
has there been an analysis thinking long
 
01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
terms when this
 
01:11:11.450 --> 01:11:11.460 align:start position:0%
Youth Center is empty
 
01:11:13.729 --> 01:11:13.739 align:start position:0%
there's been an analysis of what it
 
01:11:15.770 --> 01:11:15.780 align:start position:0%
could be used for say a secure
 
01:11:19.610 --> 01:11:19.620 align:start position:0%
psychiatric unit or drug treatment
 
01:11:21.410 --> 01:11:21.420 align:start position:0%
facility have those
 
01:11:23.209 --> 01:11:23.219 align:start position:0%
things been looked at because obviously
 
01:11:24.950 --> 01:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
with the construction costs we're
 
01:11:26.930 --> 01:11:26.940 align:start position:0%
talking that building was built for 20
 
01:11:29.149 --> 01:11:29.159 align:start position:0%
million now here we're coming out with
 
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
something much smaller for 20 million so
 
01:11:33.970 --> 01:11:33.980 align:start position:0%
it would seem a waste to not try to
 
01:11:37.010 --> 01:11:37.020 align:start position:0%
utilize a facility for something that
 
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
would be a project that's in the works
 
01:11:42.709 --> 01:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:45.169 --> 01:11:45.179 align:start position:0%
um I'll say this we we have not done any
 
01:11:47.930 --> 01:11:47.940 align:start position:0%
evaluation of what the sununu center
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
could be used for
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
but we have determined that the two the
 
01:11:55.010 --> 01:11:55.020 align:start position:0%
sununu center
 
01:11:57.649 --> 01:11:57.659 align:start position:0%
um is not appropriate as a replacement
 
01:11:59.689 --> 01:11:59.699 align:start position:0%
for this facility
 
01:12:02.630 --> 01:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
but but we don't know what the sununu
 
01:12:04.250 --> 01:12:04.260 align:start position:0%
center could be used for we haven't
 
01:12:05.450 --> 01:12:05.460 align:start position:0%
looked at that
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
is it possible you could do that
 
01:12:07.199 --> 01:12:09.350 align:start position:0%
is it possible you could do that
analysis

01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
01:12:12.290 --> 01:12:12.300 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we could thank you
 
01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:13.870 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we could thank you
foreign

01:12:13.870 --> 01:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:12:16.490 --> 01:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner I I just was
 
01:12:18.910 --> 01:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
looking for where to to address
 
01:12:22.850 --> 01:12:22.860 align:start position:0%
representative Wilder's comment there I
 
01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
think there's a section in here where uh
 
01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
in sb1 and then maybe in this amendment
 
01:12:33.169 --> 01:12:33.179 align:start position:0%
we have given to das some legislative
 
01:12:35.149 --> 01:12:35.159 align:start position:0%
priorities on what to do with that
 
01:12:37.669 --> 01:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
property and as the way I recall what's
 
01:12:41.229 --> 01:12:41.239 align:start position:0%
in the legislation the bill
 
01:12:46.250 --> 01:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
says that when we dispose of it that we
 
01:12:48.649 --> 01:12:48.659 align:start position:0%
should try to be putting a high priority
 
01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080 align:start position:0%
on getting local uh tax relief to
 
01:12:54.530 --> 01:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
Manchester into the state that that
 
01:12:56.450 --> 01:12:56.460 align:start position:0%
that's what's in the amendment that we
 
01:12:58.910 --> 01:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
can talk about later and maybe modify
 
01:13:01.729 --> 01:13:01.739 align:start position:0%
but well I think it's a mistake to get
 
01:13:04.010 --> 01:13:04.020 align:start position:0%
rid of a building that was designed to
 
01:13:07.070 --> 01:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
be secure that we have other things to
 
01:13:09.169 --> 01:13:09.179 align:start position:0%
do and look at the construction costs
 
01:13:11.209 --> 01:13:11.219 align:start position:0%
from what it was 11 12 years ago
 
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
whenever it was built versus now it
 
01:13:15.290 --> 01:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
would seem to be such a waste if we
 
01:13:17.630 --> 01:13:17.640 align:start position:0%
don't make proper use of it or a state
 
01:13:20.330 --> 01:13:20.340 align:start position:0%
facility thank you I would say that
 
01:13:22.669 --> 01:13:22.679 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler that I I do
 
01:13:24.370 --> 01:13:24.380 align:start position:0%
understand that and in our Capital
 
01:13:27.890 --> 01:13:27.900 align:start position:0%
planning processes it is something we we
 
01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely take into account
 
01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:31.500 align:start position:0%
um it's not something that that we've
 
01:13:34.250 --> 01:13:34.260 align:start position:0%
looked at directly and nobody's made any
 
01:13:35.810 --> 01:13:35.820 align:start position:0%
decisions about the future use of that
 
01:13:37.970 --> 01:13:37.980 align:start position:0%
property and you know I don't know
 
01:13:39.290 --> 01:13:39.300 align:start position:0%
people are going to want to sell it or
 
01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
whatnot but but whatever we would do
 
01:13:44.090 --> 01:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
it's something where we're we routinely
 
01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
look at every vacant building we have
 
01:13:48.050 --> 01:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
and and whether it's
 
01:13:50.330 --> 01:13:50.340 align:start position:0%
fixable or tear downable
 
01:13:54.290 --> 01:13:54.300 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Waller did you
 
01:13:56.750 --> 01:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh yes so I didn't know we were gonna
 
01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
I'm whipping up to
 
01:14:02.450 --> 01:14:02.460 align:start position:0%
Senate bill one I didn't know we were
 
01:14:04.870 --> 01:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
talking about Senate bill one today so
 
01:14:07.729 --> 01:14:07.739 align:start position:0%
we're in here I see the appropriation
 
01:14:07.739 --> 01:14:09.169 align:start position:0%
we're in here I see the appropriation
for

01:14:09.169 --> 01:14:09.179 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:14:12.050 --> 01:14:12.060 align:start position:0%
15 million which is
 
01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
01:14:18.410 --> 01:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:20.870 --> 01:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
where's the rest of the funding coming
 
01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:23.689 align:start position:0%
where's the rest of the funding coming
from

01:14:23.689 --> 01:14:23.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:27.470 --> 01:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
I I think what I would say is that
 
01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:29.330 align:start position:0%
I I think what I would say is that
um

01:14:29.330 --> 01:14:29.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:31.850 --> 01:14:31.860 align:start position:0%
so the I'm aware that the Senate has
 
01:14:33.290 --> 01:14:33.300 align:start position:0%
passed the bill that has 15 million
 
01:14:35.950 --> 01:14:35.960 align:start position:0%
dollars in it for this purpose and and
 
01:14:39.169 --> 01:14:39.179 align:start position:0%
uh what I've been asked is uh for the
 
01:14:40.970 --> 01:14:40.980 align:start position:0%
purpose has defined what would it cost
 
01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
and I would tell you that that number is
 
01:14:48.830 --> 01:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
um not 15. it's uh 21 and a half
 
01:14:50.090 --> 01:14:50.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:14:52.810 --> 01:14:52.820 align:start position:0%
and I have I have one other question
 
01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
over the years I've always heard that
 
01:14:59.149 --> 01:14:59.159 align:start position:0%
the federal government had given us the
 
01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
money to build the original sununu
 
01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
Center and that
 
01:15:06.290 --> 01:15:06.300 align:start position:0%
we have to pay them back if we don't use
 
01:15:10.610 --> 01:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
it for children it has to be a facility
 
01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
I'm not even I'm not even clear what the
 
01:15:14.570 --> 01:15:14.580 align:start position:0%
words are whether it's children who are
 
01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:17.940 align:start position:0%
incarcerated or what it is
 
01:15:20.149 --> 01:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
um what do we know about that and how
 
01:15:22.729 --> 01:15:22.739 align:start position:0%
much is that costing to return the
 
01:15:26.570 --> 01:15:26.580 align:start position:0%
building to the to turn funding to the
 
01:15:28.669 --> 01:15:28.679 align:start position:0%
feds yeah I can answer that I actually
 
01:15:31.070 --> 01:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
have good news this story has changed
 
01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
since I think the last time Mr Ripple
 
01:15:34.850 --> 01:15:34.860 align:start position:0%
has investigated it for for the
 
01:15:36.410 --> 01:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
committee that reviewed this matter 18
 
01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
months ago
 
01:15:42.169 --> 01:15:42.179 align:start position:0%
um so uh There Are Rules around the
 
01:15:45.169 --> 01:15:45.179 align:start position:0%
requirement to repay arpa funds um if
 
01:15:47.450 --> 01:15:47.460 align:start position:0%
you stop using it for a youth related
 
01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
purpose however they issued new guidance
 
01:15:53.390 --> 01:15:53.400 align:start position:0%
in May of 2022 and they still require
 
01:15:54.830 --> 01:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
you to go back to the feds to get
 
01:15:57.910 --> 01:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
approval but they basically say that the
 
01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
federal interest in a facility is 15
 
01:16:04.689 --> 01:16:04.699 align:start position:0%
years or the end of the usable
 
01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
life of the facility and that time frame
 
01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
has now passed
 
01:16:13.430 --> 01:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
because you said
 
01:16:16.209 --> 01:16:16.219 align:start position:0%
repay arpa funds but I'm sorry
 
01:16:19.130 --> 01:16:19.140 align:start position:0%
I meant to say voidance funds okay great
 
01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
I was like the funding streams are just
 
01:16:24.110 --> 01:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
mixing up I meant to say voidance funds
 
01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
so you do anticipate that you won't have
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
to pay back that's what the new guidance
 
01:16:31.550 --> 01:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
that came out in May of 2022 suggests
 
01:16:35.209 --> 01:16:35.219 align:start position:0%
although the prior guidance does say you
 
01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
have to go back to the feds once you've
 
01:16:38.209 --> 01:16:38.219 align:start position:0%
decided what your course of action is
 
01:16:40.490 --> 01:16:40.500 align:start position:0%
and get them to approve your plan but
 
01:16:41.689 --> 01:16:41.699 align:start position:0%
according to the guidance that they
 
01:16:45.050 --> 01:16:45.060 align:start position:0%
issued in May of 2022 their interest in
 
01:16:47.390 --> 01:16:47.400 align:start position:0%
the property and in the repayment only
 
01:16:50.450 --> 01:16:50.460 align:start position:0%
lasts for 15 years or the usable
 
01:16:52.250 --> 01:16:52.260 align:start position:0%
lifespan of the property and we've
 
01:16:54.770 --> 01:16:54.780 align:start position:0%
passed the 15 years at this point great
 
01:16:56.930 --> 01:16:56.940 align:start position:0%
thank you yep
 
01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
so you you raised a valid question about
 
01:17:03.910 --> 01:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
are we talking about sb1 uh
 
01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
no there's two amendments I have that I
 
01:17:09.530 --> 01:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
haven't introduced yet because we're
 
01:17:11.390 --> 01:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
still on your Amendment but the two
 
01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
amendments I have have that language in
 
01:17:17.570 --> 01:17:17.580 align:start position:0%
it so I I use the shorthand of sb1
 
01:17:19.910 --> 01:17:19.920 align:start position:0%
because more people have read it and are
 
01:17:21.530 --> 01:17:21.540 align:start position:0%
familiar with it than they are these
 
01:17:24.290 --> 01:17:24.300 align:start position:0%
amendments that the ink is still wet
 
01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:26.149 align:start position:0%
amendments that the ink is still wet
so

01:17:26.149 --> 01:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:17:29.149 --> 01:17:29.159 align:start position:0%
um all right so let's come back let's
 
01:17:32.330 --> 01:17:32.340 align:start position:0%
loop back around to
 
01:17:35.030 --> 01:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
um representative walners Amendment zero
 
01:17:36.790 --> 01:17:36.800 align:start position:0%
three one one
 
01:17:41.209 --> 01:17:41.219 align:start position:0%
and what what I think
 
01:17:44.270 --> 01:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
would I think I picked up is that is
 
01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:17:49.729 --> 01:17:49.739 align:start position:0%
this amendment probably needs to have a
 
01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
section on it Mr Ripple I'm kind of like
 
01:17:54.530 --> 01:17:54.540 align:start position:0%
talking to you as we go through this if
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
we if we were to do another amendment
 
01:17:56.400 --> 01:18:00.410 align:start position:0%
we if we were to do another amendment
that

01:18:00.410 --> 01:18:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:00.420 --> 01:18:01.669 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:18:01.669 --> 01:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
that we probably need to add a paragraph
 
01:18:05.930 --> 01:18:05.940 align:start position:0%
So that we have operations money to get
 
01:18:09.130 --> 01:18:09.140 align:start position:0%
through the end of this fiscal year
 
01:18:12.890 --> 01:18:12.900 align:start position:0%
that uh as long as if if we if we're not
 
01:18:15.229 --> 01:18:15.239 align:start position:0%
going to do sb1 and we're going to do
 
01:18:17.090 --> 01:18:17.100 align:start position:0%
something with 49 it's going to have to
 
01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
go back to the Senate
 
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
um so if we wanted to representative
 
01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
Waller here to your point about the 15
 
01:18:27.229 --> 01:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
million dollars is probably inadequate
 
01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
and that we should put I I what I think
 
01:18:31.490 --> 01:18:31.500 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing you say is that we ought to
 
01:18:34.189 --> 01:18:34.199 align:start position:0%
put the right number in in there so that
 
01:18:36.530 --> 01:18:36.540 align:start position:0%
there's some transparency right now it
 
01:18:38.450 --> 01:18:38.460 align:start position:0%
says 15 million and although we want
 
01:18:41.149 --> 01:18:41.159 align:start position:0%
them to prioritize arpa it may be that
 
01:18:43.070 --> 01:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
we need to supplement that with some
 
01:18:46.250 --> 01:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
additional funding that I I I that's
 
01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
what I think where you're going with
 
01:18:51.050 --> 01:18:51.060 align:start position:0%
that no I just I just wanted I all I
 
01:18:52.490 --> 01:18:52.500 align:start position:0%
wanted to do was
 
01:18:55.970 --> 01:18:55.980 align:start position:0%
no if in well we're not supposed to talk
 
01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
about it but Senate Bill won if there
 
01:19:00.709 --> 01:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
was some place in that bill where there
 
01:19:02.630 --> 01:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
was the additional funding to get it up
 
01:19:05.570 --> 01:19:05.580 align:start position:0%
to the 21. and there is not so when we
 
01:19:07.130 --> 01:19:07.140 align:start position:0%
get to my Amendment you'll see it and
 
01:19:10.610 --> 01:19:10.620 align:start position:0%
then it's a lift from sb1 anyway so
 
01:19:14.209 --> 01:19:14.219 align:start position:0%
um okay so just as a as a marker we'll
 
01:19:16.610 --> 01:19:16.620 align:start position:0%
talk about whether or not extra funds
 
01:19:18.530 --> 01:19:18.540 align:start position:0%
are needed
 
01:19:20.390 --> 01:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
um I I and although the department has a
 
01:19:27.530 --> 01:19:27.540 align:start position:0%
proposal ready to go is there any
 
01:19:30.530 --> 01:19:30.540 align:start position:0%
requirement or necessity or is it's just
 
01:19:34.090 --> 01:19:34.100 align:start position:0%
better practice if we passed
 
01:19:39.649 --> 01:19:39.659 align:start position:0%
some design criteria to you so that
 
01:19:42.530 --> 01:19:42.540 align:start position:0%
there's backup for your proposal or or
 
01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
is that just a moot action at this point
 
01:19:47.570 --> 01:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
traditionally to do design of any
 
01:19:49.310 --> 01:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
building what we would do is consult
 
01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
with the using agency about the
 
01:19:52.430 --> 01:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate design and to the extent
 
01:19:54.590 --> 01:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
that you're you and they are comfortable
 
01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
that that you're both on the same page
 
01:19:59.209 --> 01:19:59.219 align:start position:0%
there's no need for it I've got no
 
01:20:02.630 --> 01:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
pushback on the Design Concepts I've
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
gotten pushback on the capacity
 
01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
so our capacity we would we would take
 
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
lead from you on and then and if there's
 
01:20:14.030 --> 01:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
no language we would then consult with
 
01:20:16.250 --> 01:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
with Joe and his team about about
 
01:20:18.649 --> 01:20:18.659 align:start position:0%
specifics of Design Within the
 
01:20:22.370 --> 01:20:22.380 align:start position:0%
appropriated money so so for purposes of
 
01:20:25.970 --> 01:20:25.980 align:start position:0%
discussion and thinking I I think the
 
01:20:28.669 --> 01:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
the sort of the new new thing for you
 
01:20:30.350 --> 01:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
all is that
 
01:20:32.510 --> 01:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
um I think we need to think in terms of
 
01:20:35.330 --> 01:20:35.340 align:start position:0%
uh at least two probably just two
 
01:20:38.090 --> 01:20:38.100 align:start position:0%
Alternatives independent of which of the
 
01:20:40.189 --> 01:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
three sites it goes on but just on the
 
01:20:43.729 --> 01:20:43.739 align:start position:0%
building wherever it goes that in one
 
01:20:45.950 --> 01:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
option the building should be for a
 
01:20:49.250 --> 01:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
smaller capacity say six to eight uh
 
01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
with the anticipation that should the
 
01:20:55.930 --> 01:20:55.940 align:start position:0%
need arise we could readily build
 
01:20:59.630 --> 01:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
additional capability adjacent to that
 
01:21:01.910 --> 01:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
building so there would need to be sort
 
01:21:04.850 --> 01:21:04.860 align:start position:0%
of a plan to you know build a hallway
 
01:21:10.850 --> 01:21:10.860 align:start position:0%
and to a a site that's not yet been
 
01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
built but could be if we decided to the
 
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
second one is the one that you're
 
01:21:19.610 --> 01:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
already all over the 12 to 18. so so the
 
01:21:21.890 --> 01:21:21.900 align:start position:0%
introduction here today to A New Concept
 
01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
is we might want to take a look at a
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
smaller design so that we understand the
 
01:21:30.010 --> 01:21:30.020 align:start position:0%
cost differentials we would
 
01:21:32.750 --> 01:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
I would ask that we could get back to
 
01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
you with a different number than if the
 
01:21:35.930 --> 01:21:35.940 align:start position:0%
if the design team is going to do a
 
01:21:37.010 --> 01:21:37.020 align:start position:0%
couple of buildings and I understand
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
that there's some similarities so it's
 
01:21:40.490 --> 01:21:40.500 align:start position:0%
not like doubling the cost or anything
 
01:21:43.610 --> 01:21:43.620 align:start position:0%
but it's it's an additional an addition
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
to the scope of work if they do two
 
01:21:46.970 --> 01:21:46.980 align:start position:0%
buildings not one so let me figure out
 
01:21:48.050 --> 01:21:48.060 align:start position:0%
what that's going to cost and get back
 
01:21:51.550 --> 01:21:51.560 align:start position:0%
to you with it right right the questions
 
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
representative hole thank you Mr chair I
 
01:21:57.590 --> 01:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
guess when I'm hearing three potential
 
01:22:00.770 --> 01:22:00.780 align:start position:0%
sites it's my assumption that does not
 
01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
include redoing something either at the
 
01:22:05.390 --> 01:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
current city new center location or
 
01:22:08.570 --> 01:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
retrofitting the current sununu Center
 
01:22:11.570 --> 01:22:11.580 align:start position:0%
is that a correct assumption
 
01:22:14.510 --> 01:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that's sure the three
 
01:22:17.810 --> 01:22:17.820 align:start position:0%
potential sites are the current site not
 
01:22:18.890 --> 01:22:18.900 align:start position:0%
the current building so it's not
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
retrofitting the current building but
 
01:22:22.130 --> 01:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
somewhere on the current campus
 
01:22:24.590 --> 01:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
somewhere in Concord in proximity to New
 
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital so that you could
 
01:22:27.950 --> 01:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
have shared services there or in
 
01:22:29.689 --> 01:22:29.699 align:start position:0%
Hampstead and proximity to Hampstead
 
01:22:30.830 --> 01:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
Hospital so you could have shared
 
01:22:34.310 --> 01:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:35.930 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:22:35.930 --> 01:22:35.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:39.470 --> 01:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
hearing the cost per child in these are
 
01:22:40.970 --> 01:22:40.980 align:start position:0%
naive questions because I'm coming at
 
01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:42.110 align:start position:0%
naive questions because I'm coming at
this

01:22:42.110 --> 01:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:22:44.930 --> 01:22:44.940 align:start position:0%
um kind of out of the blue
 
01:22:48.169 --> 01:22:48.179 align:start position:0%
the cost to renovate might be less
 
01:22:51.350 --> 01:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
can we at least look at that again and I
 
01:22:52.490 --> 01:22:52.500 align:start position:0%
don't know whether you can do that
 
01:22:55.729 --> 01:22:55.739 align:start position:0%
concurrently but to take a facility that
 
01:22:59.870 --> 01:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
was significantly larger in size
 
01:23:02.149 --> 01:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
right is there any way and I've never
 
01:23:03.470 --> 01:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
walked through it I've actually never
 
01:23:05.689 --> 01:23:05.699 align:start position:0%
been on the property so there this might
 
01:23:08.450 --> 01:23:08.460 align:start position:0%
be completely impossible but is there a
 
01:23:10.850 --> 01:23:10.860 align:start position:0%
way to take a look at that as one of the
 
01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:12.530 align:start position:0%
way to take a look at that as one of the
options

01:23:12.530 --> 01:23:12.540 align:start position:0%
options
 
01:23:14.030 --> 01:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
I think it's something we can look at
 
01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
although I don't know that the cost of
 
01:23:17.390 --> 01:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
renovating a building that's not
 
01:23:20.450 --> 01:23:20.460 align:start position:0%
currently up to standards is there are
 
01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:22.140 align:start position:0%
dramatic savings from that I mean I
 
01:23:24.830 --> 01:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
renovation is sometimes cheaper and in a
 
01:23:27.410 --> 01:23:27.420 align:start position:0%
case like this though the the
 
01:23:29.209 --> 01:23:29.219 align:start position:0%
you know the this we're not building an
 
01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
office building and so if it's if it's
 
01:23:33.530 --> 01:23:33.540 align:start position:0%
not substantial we would be essentially
 
01:23:36.050 --> 01:23:36.060 align:start position:0%
replicating and then adding a demo cost
 
01:23:38.090 --> 01:23:38.100 align:start position:0%
to it and so it's probably a push
 
01:23:40.729 --> 01:23:40.739 align:start position:0%
I would still miss rips just one moment
 
01:23:43.790 --> 01:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
uh we've already talked we have talked
 
01:23:45.410 --> 01:23:45.420 align:start position:0%
about this option I don't know the
 
01:23:47.330 --> 01:23:47.340 align:start position:0%
extent to which we have a historical
 
01:23:49.310 --> 01:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
record or the depth on it but just so
 
01:23:53.689 --> 01:23:53.699 align:start position:0%
you know when on your on your diagram uh
 
01:23:55.669 --> 01:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
where it says that we attempted to
 
01:23:57.410 --> 01:23:57.420 align:start position:0%
resolve this in the sununu replacement
 
01:23:59.930 --> 01:23:59.940 align:start position:0%
committee we had five people and four
 
01:24:02.570 --> 01:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
recommendations one of them was the
 
01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
renovation of the existing site to
 
01:24:07.729 --> 01:24:07.739 align:start position:0%
basically try to rescope it re-rebuild
 
01:24:11.270 --> 01:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
it on the interior to make it nice and
 
01:24:14.030 --> 01:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
um so so so the it's come up in
 
01:24:16.310 --> 01:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
conversation before I don't know how
 
01:24:18.530 --> 01:24:18.540 align:start position:0%
much homework it would take to go pull
 
01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
any of that back out but so I'm sorry to
 
01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
interrupt you I just wanted to get the
 
01:24:26.270 --> 01:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
historical context yeah no that's that's
 
01:24:27.709 --> 01:24:27.719 align:start position:0%
helpful and yeah I was going to say that
 
01:24:29.870 --> 01:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
was that was thoroughly examined during
 
01:24:31.790 --> 01:24:31.800 align:start position:0%
the committee about 18 months ago that
 
01:24:33.290 --> 01:24:33.300 align:start position:0%
that was examining kind of what to do
 
01:24:36.530 --> 01:24:36.540 align:start position:0%
next the other the other piece of this
 
01:24:40.070 --> 01:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
is well one you know sb1 one and HP 120
 
01:24:41.450 --> 01:24:41.460 align:start position:0%
and the legislation from last year all
 
01:24:42.649 --> 01:24:42.659 align:start position:0%
kind of anticipated really moving this
 
01:24:44.090 --> 01:24:44.100 align:start position:0%
into a more of a therapeutic type
 
01:24:46.189 --> 01:24:46.199 align:start position:0%
setting which the current design is and
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
I understand what you're saying is
 
01:24:49.070 --> 01:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
really kind of refashioning it in a way
 
01:24:50.090 --> 01:24:50.100 align:start position:0%
that would kind of move into more of a
 
01:24:51.709 --> 01:24:51.719 align:start position:0%
therapeutic space the other thing that's
 
01:24:53.149 --> 01:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
really key about this if you're talking
 
01:24:56.209 --> 01:24:56.219 align:start position:0%
it from from an economic perspective is
 
01:24:56.219 --> 01:24:56.750 align:start position:0%
it from from an economic perspective is
um

01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:59.689 --> 01:24:59.699 align:start position:0%
is the long-term operational costs I
 
01:25:01.729 --> 01:25:01.739 align:start position:0%
think are are really key when you're
 
01:25:04.370 --> 01:25:04.380 align:start position:0%
trying to balance the the cost of this
 
01:25:05.750 --> 01:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
it's not just the cost of renovation
 
01:25:07.370 --> 01:25:07.380 align:start position:0%
versus the cost of a new build but it's
 
01:25:10.610 --> 01:25:10.620 align:start position:0%
also the savings year after year from a
 
01:25:12.830 --> 01:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
co-located model one of the real
 
01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
challenges of sysc has been that as the
 
01:25:18.110 --> 01:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
census has declined which is I think a
 
01:25:19.790 --> 01:25:19.800 align:start position:0%
great thing from a public policy and a
 
01:25:21.530 --> 01:25:21.540 align:start position:0%
treatment of Youth perspective the
 
01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
economies of scale have gotten to the
 
01:25:24.410 --> 01:25:24.420 align:start position:0%
point that it's really really hard to
 
01:25:26.810 --> 01:25:26.820 align:start position:0%
operate in a way that makes much sense
 
01:25:28.850 --> 01:25:28.860 align:start position:0%
um and and by Able by being able to
 
01:25:30.649 --> 01:25:30.659 align:start position:0%
co-locate to have some shared services
 
01:25:32.270 --> 01:25:32.280 align:start position:0%
with another facility that does some
 
01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:33.830 align:start position:0%
with another facility that does some
comparable

01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
comparable
 
01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
um work you're able to at least realize
 
01:25:39.050 --> 01:25:39.060 align:start position:0%
somewhat better operational efficiencies
 
01:25:41.209 --> 01:25:41.219 align:start position:0%
over time to reduce some of those
 
01:25:42.590 --> 01:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
recurring costs that happen year after
 
01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:45.250 align:start position:0%
recurring costs that happen year after
year

01:25:45.250 --> 01:25:45.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
who had a question
 
01:25:48.890 --> 01:25:48.900 align:start position:0%
representative Waller you have another
 
01:25:48.900 --> 01:25:50.510 align:start position:0%
representative Waller you have another
question

01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:25:51.830 --> 01:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
no I think
 
01:25:53.390 --> 01:25:53.400 align:start position:0%
um the question I was going to ask I
 
01:25:55.970 --> 01:25:55.980 align:start position:0%
answered thank you okay so let's let's
 
01:25:57.830 --> 01:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
do a time check
 
01:26:00.229 --> 01:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
um we've got about
 
01:26:03.050 --> 01:26:03.060 align:start position:0%
um five minutes until we hit 12 30.
 
01:26:05.570 --> 01:26:05.580 align:start position:0%
what's Magic about 12 30. if we break at
 
01:26:07.910 --> 01:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
12 30 that gives everyone 30 minutes to
 
01:26:10.669 --> 01:26:10.679 align:start position:0%
go get lunch and Shake It Off and and
 
01:26:14.090 --> 01:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
then we we reconvene as a division at 1
 
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
pm to start hitting some briefings
 
01:26:19.750 --> 01:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
prepared by the department
 
01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh we are not done here obviously we're
 
01:26:26.930 --> 01:26:26.940 align:start position:0%
going to have to uh schedule additional
 
01:26:29.570 --> 01:26:29.580 align:start position:0%
time based on the pace of what we've
 
01:26:32.810 --> 01:26:32.820 align:start position:0%
done today it feels to me like we need
 
01:26:35.810 --> 01:26:35.820 align:start position:0%
to find another three hour work session
 
01:26:39.110 --> 01:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
at some point Mr Ripple if you could you
 
01:26:42.250 --> 01:26:42.260 align:start position:0%
know begin to work on that
 
01:26:46.430 --> 01:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
I I would like to go ahead and
 
01:26:48.229 --> 01:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
foreshadow do you do you have one more
 
01:26:49.910 --> 01:26:49.920 align:start position:0%
amendment that you you want to share
 
01:26:52.669 --> 01:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
with us publicly or or not
 
01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:54.719 align:start position:0%
no the other amendment was just a date
 
01:26:54.719 --> 01:26:55.490 align:start position:0%
no the other amendment was just a date
change

01:26:55.490 --> 01:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
change
 
01:26:57.709 --> 01:26:57.719 align:start position:0%
oh the real simple one yeah the real the
 
01:26:59.689 --> 01:26:59.699 align:start position:0%
real story just the first paragraph yeah
 
01:27:03.229 --> 01:27:03.239 align:start position:0%
no I thought so that was the simple one
 
01:27:05.930 --> 01:27:05.940 align:start position:0%
could I ask Mr rip someone let me finish
 
01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:08.280 align:start position:0%
this one point then so what I want to
 
01:27:10.850 --> 01:27:10.860 align:start position:0%
let everyone know is I I have two
 
01:27:13.910 --> 01:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
amendments that are incredibly uh close
 
01:27:18.850 --> 01:27:18.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
20203 h i I don't know if you all have a
 
01:27:25.790 --> 01:27:25.800 align:start position:0%
copy of it or is uh zero one nine two
 
01:27:28.970 --> 01:27:28.980 align:start position:0%
the essence of both of these would be to
 
01:27:33.410 --> 01:27:33.420 align:start position:0%
take 49 very close to sb1 language and
 
01:27:35.990 --> 01:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
there's some small nuances there were
 
01:27:38.629 --> 01:27:38.639 align:start position:0%
some Advocates that came to me after
 
01:27:41.629 --> 01:27:41.639 align:start position:0%
children and family law and and insisted
 
01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
that uh some word Precision was needed
 
01:27:50.750 --> 01:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
um and uh and so I deferred to their
 
01:27:53.090 --> 01:27:53.100 align:start position:0%
judgment so these amendments are
 
01:27:57.129 --> 01:27:57.139 align:start position:0%
extremely close to sb1
 
01:28:02.450 --> 01:28:02.460 align:start position:0%
with a few semantic tweaks so so next
 
01:28:04.430 --> 01:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
time we get to be together in the work
 
01:28:07.010 --> 01:28:07.020 align:start position:0%
session I would like to pick up and be
 
01:28:09.950 --> 01:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
able to to really start hitting these
 
01:28:13.010 --> 01:28:13.020 align:start position:0%
the these amendments so that we can make
 
01:28:15.229 --> 01:28:15.239 align:start position:0%
sure that whatever we do is
 
01:28:19.370 --> 01:28:19.380 align:start position:0%
um is uh as thorough as it needs to be
 
01:28:23.390 --> 01:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
go ahead Mr ripson I I wondered have you
 
01:28:24.590 --> 01:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
done some
 
01:28:27.169 --> 01:28:27.179 align:start position:0%
um estimates of what
 
01:28:29.810 --> 01:28:29.820 align:start position:0%
the operational cost of the facility
 
01:28:32.750 --> 01:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
will be and then my other question for
 
01:28:34.070 --> 01:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
you and maybe you don't want to answer
 
01:28:36.290 --> 01:28:36.300 align:start position:0%
it today but just get some information
 
01:28:38.689 --> 01:28:38.699 align:start position:0%
for us for our our next time that we
 
01:28:43.310 --> 01:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
need the other thing I was wondering is
 
01:28:45.169 --> 01:28:45.179 align:start position:0%
sometimes I feel like we put the cart
 
01:28:47.870 --> 01:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
before the horse because
 
01:28:49.970 --> 01:28:49.980 align:start position:0%
um even you were saying that you
 
01:28:52.910 --> 01:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
anticipate that the population
 
01:28:55.550 --> 01:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
will go down and so we've been running
 
01:28:57.590 --> 01:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
let's say at the maximum we've been
 
01:28:59.209 --> 01:28:59.219 align:start position:0%
running 18.
 
01:29:01.870 --> 01:29:01.880 align:start position:0%
mostly closer to 12
 
01:29:05.149 --> 01:29:05.159 align:start position:0%
and here we are building a building for
 
01:29:06.410 --> 01:29:06.420 align:start position:0%
the maximum
 
01:29:08.570 --> 01:29:08.580 align:start position:0%
I I happen to have been one of the
 
01:29:11.570 --> 01:29:11.580 align:start position:0%
people I was here right here when we
 
01:29:13.790 --> 01:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
built the sununu center
 
01:29:16.189 --> 01:29:16.199 align:start position:0%
and look what happened there we over
 
01:29:16.199 --> 01:29:17.810 align:start position:0%
and look what happened there we over
built

01:29:17.810 --> 01:29:17.820 align:start position:0%
built
 
01:29:21.590 --> 01:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
um and so I'm wondering is are you what
 
01:29:24.229 --> 01:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
are you doing about thinking about
 
01:29:27.290 --> 01:29:27.300 align:start position:0%
um as this population is going down are
 
01:29:31.070 --> 01:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
we really needing to build at 18 and how
 
01:29:32.510 --> 01:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
much could we
 
01:29:35.930 --> 01:29:35.940 align:start position:0%
possibly save by not building at 18.
 
01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:38.400 align:start position:0%
so I I have a few thoughts on that one
 
01:29:40.370 --> 01:29:40.380 align:start position:0%
on the operational costs and I have some
 
01:29:41.390 --> 01:29:41.400 align:start position:0%
information that I imagine
 
01:29:43.370 --> 01:29:43.380 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards was alluding to
 
01:29:44.689 --> 01:29:44.699 align:start position:0%
that I'll be that I'll share when we
 
01:29:47.810 --> 01:29:47.820 align:start position:0%
come back around potential cost savings
 
01:29:50.149 --> 01:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
largely largely through the ability to
 
01:29:51.950 --> 01:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
co-locate and share Services through
 
01:29:53.870 --> 01:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
with another facility is where much most
 
01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
of those savings come from
 
01:29:58.129 --> 01:29:58.139 align:start position:0%
um and uh and I'll go into more detail
 
01:29:59.270 --> 01:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
about that so I do have some information
 
01:30:01.610 --> 01:30:01.620 align:start position:0%
about that in terms of the size and
 
01:30:03.530 --> 01:30:03.540 align:start position:0%
savings right I think
 
01:30:05.629 --> 01:30:05.639 align:start position:0%
um so obviously our colleagues here
 
01:30:07.250 --> 01:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
could talk about in terms of building a
 
01:30:09.410 --> 01:30:09.420 align:start position:0%
building for six beds versus 18 beds
 
01:30:11.149 --> 01:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
right but in terms of building a
 
01:30:13.669 --> 01:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
building for six beds versus 18 beds we
 
01:30:15.229 --> 01:30:15.239 align:start position:0%
saw a little taste of this last year
 
01:30:16.970 --> 01:30:16.980 align:start position:0%
through two fiscal notes right we had a
 
01:30:19.370 --> 01:30:19.380 align:start position:0%
fiscal note for an 18 bed facility and a
 
01:30:20.990 --> 01:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal note for a six bed facility and
 
01:30:22.189 --> 01:30:22.199 align:start position:0%
the difference was about two million
 
01:30:24.350 --> 01:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
dollars between building those two it
 
01:30:26.209 --> 01:30:26.219 align:start position:0%
wasn't that big because the core of
 
01:30:27.290 --> 01:30:27.300 align:start position:0%
those two facilities was pretty
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
comparable the other thing that I would
 
01:30:31.430 --> 01:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
say is
 
01:30:33.590 --> 01:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
um one right the data nationally shows
 
01:30:35.570 --> 01:30:35.580 align:start position:0%
us that we're already pretty low
 
01:30:38.209 --> 01:30:38.219 align:start position:0%
two what we're looking to build here is
 
01:30:40.189 --> 01:30:40.199 align:start position:0%
not the same as an sysc and I know
 
01:30:41.270 --> 01:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
that's something that I hear people keep
 
01:30:43.550 --> 01:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
saying this is just a mini sysc it's not
 
01:30:44.930 --> 01:30:44.940 align:start position:0%
what we're looking to build here is a
 
01:30:47.570 --> 01:30:47.580 align:start position:0%
facility that really is designed to be a
 
01:30:49.550 --> 01:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
treatment facility and a trauma-informed
 
01:30:51.890 --> 01:30:51.900 align:start position:0%
facility and that if the day comes and I
 
01:30:53.390 --> 01:30:53.400 align:start position:0%
hope it does that we that this building
 
01:30:55.729 --> 01:30:55.739 align:start position:0%
is too big it would be appropriate to
 
01:30:57.530 --> 01:30:57.540 align:start position:0%
transition into a therapeutic program it
 
01:30:58.610 --> 01:30:58.620 align:start position:0%
would be appropriate to become a
 
01:30:59.689 --> 01:30:59.699 align:start position:0%
psychiatric residential treatment
 
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
facility and that's one of the things
 
01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
that when we went through the process of
 
01:31:04.430 --> 01:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
interviewing Architects that that we
 
01:31:06.050 --> 01:31:06.060 align:start position:0%
were thinking about that we want to be
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
able to design this building to be
 
01:31:09.830 --> 01:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
something that could convert into a
 
01:31:11.930 --> 01:31:11.940 align:start position:0%
treatment program in the future if we do
 
01:31:13.310 --> 01:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
get to that day where it turns out that
 
01:31:15.890 --> 01:31:15.900 align:start position:0%
we don't need 18 beds anymore I don't
 
01:31:17.450 --> 01:31:17.460 align:start position:0%
know that we will get to that day but if
 
01:31:20.930 --> 01:31:20.940 align:start position:0%
we do I'll be happy and if we do we can
 
01:31:23.090 --> 01:31:23.100 align:start position:0%
use this for a better purpose one of the
 
01:31:25.070 --> 01:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
big problems with sysc and I hear
 
01:31:27.649 --> 01:31:27.659 align:start position:0%
chairman Weiler you know is
 
01:31:29.570 --> 01:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
it's hard to find another good purpose
 
01:31:31.310 --> 01:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
for it because it was built for a
 
01:31:33.950 --> 01:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
correctional purpose and it's actually
 
01:31:35.810 --> 01:31:35.820 align:start position:0%
not really you know when we tried to put
 
01:31:38.209 --> 01:31:38.219 align:start position:0%
a treatment program in there Proprietors
 
01:31:39.530 --> 01:31:39.540 align:start position:0%
didn't want to go in it that's one of
 
01:31:41.390 --> 01:31:41.400 align:start position:0%
the reasons why it was why it didn't
 
01:31:43.250 --> 01:31:43.260 align:start position:0%
work right providers didn't want to use
 
01:31:44.570 --> 01:31:44.580 align:start position:0%
that space for a treatment purpose
 
01:31:46.129 --> 01:31:46.139 align:start position:0%
because it feels Correctional it feels
 
01:31:47.629 --> 01:31:47.639 align:start position:0%
heavy no matter how much we try to dress
 
01:31:49.010 --> 01:31:49.020 align:start position:0%
it up
 
01:31:51.169 --> 01:31:51.179 align:start position:0%
um and uh that's not what this will be
 
01:31:52.610 --> 01:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
and that's not what this will look like
 
01:31:53.689 --> 01:31:53.699 align:start position:0%
this is going to look like something
 
01:31:55.250 --> 01:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
that could be approved by a joint
 
01:31:57.290 --> 01:31:57.300 align:start position:0%
committee uh you know a Jayco approval
 
01:31:59.930 --> 01:31:59.940 align:start position:0%
for a hospital if it was to be used for
 
01:32:02.270 --> 01:32:02.280 align:start position:0%
that purpose in the future because I
 
01:32:03.649 --> 01:32:03.659 align:start position:0%
think we need to anticipate that maybe
 
01:32:06.350 --> 01:32:06.360 align:start position:0%
we do become the state that that is able
 
01:32:07.970 --> 01:32:07.980 align:start position:0%
to get our numbers down so low that we
 
01:32:10.129 --> 01:32:10.139 align:start position:0%
don't need 18 beds anymore and I also
 
01:32:11.870 --> 01:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
want to say you know 18 beds is not
 
01:32:13.850 --> 01:32:13.860 align:start position:0%
because I anticipate us having 18 kids I
 
01:32:17.090 --> 01:32:17.100 align:start position:0%
regularly our census is on average 12.
 
01:32:18.410 --> 01:32:18.420 align:start position:0%
and I think our average will probably
 
01:32:20.209 --> 01:32:20.219 align:start position:0%
get down to 10 probably single digits in
 
01:32:22.490 --> 01:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
the next five years but sometimes we
 
01:32:24.229 --> 01:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
have more kids and we often need to
 
01:32:26.450 --> 01:32:26.460 align:start position:0%
separate kids you know and if you have
 
01:32:28.610 --> 01:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
three units and you only have one girl
 
01:32:30.350 --> 01:32:30.360 align:start position:0%
and she's taking up five beds because
 
01:32:31.790 --> 01:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
you have one girl in a five bed unit
 
01:32:33.350 --> 01:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
then you don't have a whole lot of beds
 
01:32:34.850 --> 01:32:34.860 align:start position:0%
for the rest of the boys right so it's
 
01:32:37.310 --> 01:32:37.320 align:start position:0%
it's about flexibility more than it is
 
01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
about the number of beds so you know all
 
01:32:42.830 --> 01:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
that's to say is you know I have given
 
01:32:44.689 --> 01:32:44.699 align:start position:0%
thought to that and I think you know the
 
01:32:46.010 --> 01:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
way that we think about that is being a
 
01:32:47.870 --> 01:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
little bit more thoughtful about next
 
01:32:55.370 --> 01:32:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
no that that I figured you I figured you
 
01:33:01.129 --> 01:33:01.139 align:start position:0%
had some anticipated costs that you
 
01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
would be bringing to us I do know that
 
01:33:04.850 --> 01:33:04.860 align:start position:0%
there are
 
01:33:07.669 --> 01:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
our former chairman
 
01:33:09.890 --> 01:33:09.900 align:start position:0%
um Mr Kirk is in the audience and he
 
01:33:09.900 --> 01:33:10.790 align:start position:0%
um Mr Kirk is in the audience and he
spent

01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
spent
 
01:33:13.790 --> 01:33:13.800 align:start position:0%
years working on this and I
 
01:33:15.649 --> 01:33:15.659 align:start position:0%
I know he's been sitting out there all
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
day I wondered if you would maybe let
 
01:33:20.510 --> 01:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
him give some thoughts he spent many
 
01:33:23.149 --> 01:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
years on this subject thank you for the
 
01:33:25.610 --> 01:33:25.620 align:start position:0%
suggestion I I think I was channeling
 
01:33:27.709 --> 01:33:27.719 align:start position:0%
you because as I was looking in the
 
01:33:30.050 --> 01:33:30.060 align:start position:0%
audience I see our speakers here I see
 
01:33:32.149 --> 01:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
The Honorable Neil Kirk I see other
 
01:33:35.229 --> 01:33:35.239 align:start position:0%
people and uh you know
 
01:33:39.050 --> 01:33:39.060 align:start position:0%
Mr Mr Kirk or do you do you have an
 
01:33:40.790 --> 01:33:40.800 align:start position:0%
interest in coming and speaking of the
 
01:33:43.430 --> 01:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
committee about your perspective and and
 
01:33:47.110 --> 01:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
your view of the history your your we're
 
01:33:49.610 --> 01:33:49.620 align:start position:0%
blind signing you a little bit that you
 
01:33:53.330 --> 01:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
and I talked a tiny bit yesterday
 
01:33:59.990 --> 01:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:02.750 --> 01:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
just just uh Mr arlinghaus before you
 
01:34:04.430 --> 01:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
guys go just if we can have your
 
01:34:07.570 --> 01:34:07.580 align:start position:0%
documents with your numbers on it okay
 
01:34:10.430 --> 01:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
outstanding and thank you are you going
 
01:34:12.410 --> 01:34:12.420 align:start position:0%
to stay or go
 
01:34:15.709 --> 01:34:15.719 align:start position:0%
okay thanks uh thank you Mr chairman
 
01:34:17.330 --> 01:34:17.340 align:start position:0%
members of the committee it's always a
 
01:34:19.610 --> 01:34:19.620 align:start position:0%
pleasure to be here and an opportunity
 
01:34:21.770 --> 01:34:21.780 align:start position:0%
to give you a perhaps a different
 
01:34:21.780 --> 01:34:23.810 align:start position:0%
to give you a perhaps a different
perspective

01:34:23.810 --> 01:34:23.820 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
01:34:23.820 --> 01:34:24.350 align:start position:0%
perspective
um

01:34:24.350 --> 01:34:24.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:27.169 --> 01:34:27.179 align:start position:0%
I started working on this seriously in
 
01:34:30.350 --> 01:34:30.360 align:start position:0%
2016 and we had hopes that this problem
 
01:34:33.770 --> 01:34:33.780 align:start position:0%
would be resolved many years ago
 
01:34:35.450 --> 01:34:35.460 align:start position:0%
for a whole variety of reasons that
 
01:34:37.550 --> 01:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
hasn't happened
 
01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:38.229 align:start position:0%
hasn't happened
um

01:34:38.229 --> 01:34:38.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:40.910 --> 01:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
let me give you my perspective and I can
 
01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
justify it later if you want but just as
 
01:34:45.169 --> 01:34:45.179 align:start position:0%
an overall thing
 
01:34:45.179 --> 01:34:46.430 align:start position:0%
an overall thing
um

01:34:46.430 --> 01:34:46.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:47.990 --> 01:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
there's a great deal of contention
 
01:34:49.910 --> 01:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
between the house and the Senators to
 
01:34:51.709 --> 01:34:51.719 align:start position:0%
the size of this facility the Senate
 
01:34:55.550 --> 01:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
wants 18 the house wants 60 wants six it
 
01:34:58.970 --> 01:34:58.980 align:start position:0%
was a compromise at 12 that failed in
 
01:35:00.530 --> 01:35:00.540 align:start position:0%
conference committee for a variety of
 
01:35:03.169 --> 01:35:03.179 align:start position:0%
reasons the senates now come back with
 
01:35:05.510 --> 01:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
18 the same proposal they had last time
 
01:35:07.490 --> 01:35:07.500 align:start position:0%
and there seems to be a great deal of
 
01:35:09.770 --> 01:35:09.780 align:start position:0%
pressure to on on this committee and the
 
01:35:12.709 --> 01:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
house to get this through immediately
 
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
the problem is that the situation is
 
01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:16.430 align:start position:0%
the problem is that the situation is
changing

01:35:16.430 --> 01:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
changing
 
01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:18.350 align:start position:0%
changing
and

01:35:18.350 --> 01:35:18.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 1 and House Bill 120 are
 
01:35:23.510 --> 01:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
designed to deal with a static situation
 
01:35:26.270 --> 01:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
not a changing situation
 
01:35:28.310 --> 01:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
the situation is changing because this
 
01:35:30.530 --> 01:35:30.540 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate have changed the
 
01:35:34.149 --> 01:35:34.159 align:start position:0%
rules as to who as to which children go
 
01:35:38.750 --> 01:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
to the sununu center or its replacement
 
01:35:43.310 --> 01:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
as you saw from Mr ribson's chart those
 
01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
numbers drop precipitously if the house
 
01:35:48.709 --> 01:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
version of what was at one point House
 
01:35:51.610 --> 01:35:51.620 align:start position:0%
Bill 254 had been adopted
 
01:35:54.110 --> 01:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
that would go those numbers would go
 
01:35:56.689 --> 01:35:56.699 align:start position:0%
down even faster because it would only
 
01:35:59.830 --> 01:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
allow the most severe children
 
01:36:02.510 --> 01:36:02.520 align:start position:0%
most violent children to go to the
 
01:36:03.830 --> 01:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
sununa center
 
01:36:07.070 --> 01:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
so at the end of the day it seems to me
 
01:36:08.629 --> 01:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
that you folks are faced with a
 
01:36:10.490 --> 01:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
situation now where you're trying to
 
01:36:11.930 --> 01:36:11.940 align:start position:0%
build a building
 
01:36:15.229 --> 01:36:15.239 align:start position:0%
and deal with a situation based on last
 
01:36:16.729 --> 01:36:16.739 align:start position:0%
year's numbers
 
01:36:19.490 --> 01:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
and the situation is evolving so that
 
01:36:21.770 --> 01:36:21.780 align:start position:0%
next year's numbers will be different
 
01:36:24.050 --> 01:36:24.060 align:start position:0%
why would we want to build a building as
 
01:36:25.729 --> 01:36:25.739 align:start position:0%
we've done in the past as representative
 
01:36:27.310 --> 01:36:27.320 align:start position:0%
Wallner suggested
 
01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:29.460 align:start position:0%
the sununa center was built to
 
01:36:31.850 --> 01:36:31.860 align:start position:0%
accommodate 144 it never had that
 
01:36:35.750 --> 01:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
population and now it has what 18 to 12
 
01:36:38.990 --> 01:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
or 6 according to Mr ribsum
 
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
the situation is changing as a result of
 
01:36:43.129 --> 01:36:43.139 align:start position:0%
the changes this house has made and if
 
01:36:45.169 --> 01:36:45.179 align:start position:0%
some future if some other changes are
 
01:36:47.810 --> 01:36:47.820 align:start position:0%
made these numbers will go down further
 
01:36:50.870 --> 01:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
so my suggestion is that this committee
 
01:36:53.050 --> 01:36:53.060 align:start position:0%
paused the process
 
01:36:55.490 --> 01:36:55.500 align:start position:0%
representative walner's amendment is a
 
01:36:57.169 --> 01:36:57.179 align:start position:0%
start to do that let's start planning
 
01:36:58.850 --> 01:36:58.860 align:start position:0%
for something but not actually do it
 
01:37:01.790 --> 01:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
till we see the numbers next year the
 
01:37:02.750 --> 01:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
numbers are going to be different
 
01:37:04.550 --> 01:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
probably lower the year after the
 
01:37:06.590 --> 01:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
numbers are going to still be lower
 
01:37:09.590 --> 01:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
so we what we don't want to do is to
 
01:37:12.169 --> 01:37:12.179 align:start position:0%
create a third sununu Center we have the
 
01:37:15.590 --> 01:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
first one YDC and that was a disaster in
 
01:37:17.229 --> 01:37:17.239 align:start position:0%
terms of
 
01:37:20.689 --> 01:37:20.699 align:start position:0%
accusations of inappropriate behavior by
 
01:37:22.669 --> 01:37:22.679 align:start position:0%
staff we know we've said a hundred
 
01:37:25.310 --> 01:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
million dollars aside for the problems
 
01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
with the sununu center itself and staff
 
01:37:30.290 --> 01:37:30.300 align:start position:0%
do we really want to create a third
 
01:37:32.510 --> 01:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
sununu Center we all know what the
 
01:37:34.610 --> 01:37:34.620 align:start position:0%
definition of insanity is
 
01:37:36.590 --> 01:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
doing the same thing again and again and
 
01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:41.930 --> 01:37:41.940 align:start position:0%
I would slow down the process at this
 
01:37:43.729 --> 01:37:43.739 align:start position:0%
point I would not go with Senate bill
 
01:37:46.030 --> 01:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
one I would not go with House Bill
 
01:37:49.370 --> 01:37:49.380 align:start position:0%
120 I would slow down the process start
 
01:37:51.709 --> 01:37:51.719 align:start position:0%
some design work
 
01:37:54.169 --> 01:37:54.179 align:start position:0%
but not actually make a commitment as to
 
01:37:56.750 --> 01:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
the size until in the future we see what
 
01:37:59.450 --> 01:37:59.460 align:start position:0%
the numbers might be
 
01:37:59.460 --> 01:38:02.990 align:start position:0%
the numbers might be
um

01:38:02.990 --> 01:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:04.790 --> 01:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
I'd hate for us to make
 
01:38:07.250 --> 01:38:07.260 align:start position:0%
uh to repeat history and make the same
 
01:38:09.590 --> 01:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
mistake that we've made twice
 
01:38:11.870 --> 01:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
and that's what Senate bill I believe
 
01:38:14.689 --> 01:38:14.699 align:start position:0%
what Senate bill and one and House Bill
 
01:38:17.930 --> 01:38:17.940 align:start position:0%
120 do so
 
01:38:19.850 --> 01:38:19.860 align:start position:0%
I'd be pleased to answer questions but
 
01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
my advice is to to slow this down and
 
01:38:25.370 --> 01:38:25.380 align:start position:0%
not at this time make the ultimate
 
01:38:27.110 --> 01:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
decision which is what those two bills I
 
01:38:28.430 --> 01:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned does
 
01:38:31.010 --> 01:38:31.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:38:35.270 --> 01:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
that I I just um I I want to read just a
 
01:38:38.149 --> 01:38:38.159 align:start position:0%
small snippet of of what is an sb1
 
01:38:41.870 --> 01:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
relative to their capacity uh they they
 
01:38:44.750 --> 01:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
said that they wanted to have a maximum
 
01:38:48.169 --> 01:38:48.179 align:start position:0%
physical capacity of 18 with an
 
01:38:51.530 --> 01:38:51.540 align:start position:0%
operational plan to support 12. and so
 
01:38:54.709 --> 01:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
the extra six beds there are intended to
 
01:38:57.470 --> 01:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
be for Flex use due to the things that
 
01:38:59.810 --> 01:38:59.820 align:start position:0%
Mr ribson has talked about I don't I
 
01:39:02.209 --> 01:39:02.219 align:start position:0%
don't think any of us are wanting to
 
01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
have 18 in there on a permanent basis
 
01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:05.629 align:start position:0%
have 18 in there on a permanent basis
that's

01:39:05.629 --> 01:39:05.639 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:39:07.910 --> 01:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's just my interpretation of that
 
01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
and then and then have you have you ever
 
01:39:12.890 --> 01:39:12.900 align:start position:0%
talked to Representative Bob Lin about
 
01:39:17.450 --> 01:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
254 and his reservations about uh the
 
01:39:19.850 --> 01:39:19.860 align:start position:0%
viability of of those changes to the
 
01:39:22.970 --> 01:39:22.980 align:start position:0%
juvenile law yes representative Lynn has
 
01:39:25.070 --> 01:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
a much more expansive view of the kinds
 
01:39:27.350 --> 01:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
of children who should go to sununu then
 
01:39:29.590 --> 01:39:29.600 align:start position:0%
I think the legislature has historically
 
01:39:33.950 --> 01:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
and in several builds there was to deal
 
01:39:36.350 --> 01:39:36.360 align:start position:0%
with the situation he raised because his
 
01:39:38.810 --> 01:39:38.820 align:start position:0%
concern was legitimate there was a
 
01:39:40.729 --> 01:39:40.739 align:start position:0%
position a provision for what's called a
 
01:39:42.290 --> 01:39:42.300 align:start position:0%
Judicial override
 
01:39:45.050 --> 01:39:45.060 align:start position:0%
so that despite the statute if the if a
 
01:39:47.030 --> 01:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
judge felt that a particular child who
 
01:39:48.649 --> 01:39:48.659 align:start position:0%
didn't meet the criteria to go to the
 
01:39:50.930 --> 01:39:50.940 align:start position:0%
sununu center would nonetheless be
 
01:39:53.030 --> 01:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate there then the judge could
 
01:39:56.149 --> 01:39:56.159 align:start position:0%
place the student that that child in the
 
01:39:59.030 --> 01:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
replacement facility
 
01:40:01.250 --> 01:40:01.260 align:start position:0%
um I don't know that that satisfies uh
 
01:40:03.110 --> 01:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn completely but it
 
01:40:06.290 --> 01:40:06.300 align:start position:0%
certainly would deal with the uh odd
 
01:40:09.530 --> 01:40:09.540 align:start position:0%
case that comes up where a juvenile is
 
01:40:11.510 --> 01:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
extremely violent but yet has not done
 
01:40:13.370 --> 01:40:13.380 align:start position:0%
one of the acts that would require
 
01:40:16.129 --> 01:40:16.139 align:start position:0%
detention or commitment to sununu yeah
 
01:40:19.189 --> 01:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
yes sir and so are you aware of any
 
01:40:21.890 --> 01:40:21.900 align:start position:0%
bills that we may have in the house that
 
01:40:24.290 --> 01:40:24.300 align:start position:0%
would do what 254 was going to do
 
01:40:27.649 --> 01:40:27.659 align:start position:0%
because we didn't pass 254 the
 
01:40:30.649 --> 01:40:30.659 align:start position:0%
provisions of 254 that were in in the
 
01:40:33.010 --> 01:40:33.020 align:start position:0%
committee a conference that didn't pass
 
01:40:37.570 --> 01:40:37.580 align:start position:0%
and there are no 254 like Precision
 
01:40:42.229 --> 01:40:42.239 align:start position:0%
positions in sb1 so so I don't know that
 
01:40:45.290 --> 01:40:45.300 align:start position:0%
we have any legislative direction to
 
01:40:48.649 --> 01:40:48.659 align:start position:0%
implement the changes that were hoped to
 
01:40:51.709 --> 01:40:51.719 align:start position:0%
reduce the population are am I missing
 
01:40:54.229 --> 01:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
one I don't know of any Bills currently
 
01:40:55.850 --> 01:40:55.860 align:start position:0%
filed but this committee can certainly
 
01:40:58.010 --> 01:40:58.020 align:start position:0%
produce an amendment to do that and Tack
 
01:40:59.570 --> 01:40:59.580 align:start position:0%
it on to
 
01:41:02.030 --> 01:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
um house bill Senate bill one or tack it
 
01:41:04.970 --> 01:41:04.980 align:start position:0%
on to more appropriately I think to
 
01:41:08.930 --> 01:41:08.940 align:start position:0%
perhaps to house spill 49 although I'm
 
01:41:12.350 --> 01:41:12.360 align:start position:0%
concerned my thought was that 49 would
 
01:41:15.770 --> 01:41:15.780 align:start position:0%
be a stop Gap you would amend 49 the way
 
01:41:17.570 --> 01:41:17.580 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner is suggesting for
 
01:41:19.490 --> 01:41:19.500 align:start position:0%
example plus the money that you need if
 
01:41:21.110 --> 01:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
in fact you need it
 
01:41:24.290 --> 01:41:24.300 align:start position:0%
based on what Mr Ripple said you would
 
01:41:26.270 --> 01:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
put that into this bill and you would
 
01:41:28.669 --> 01:41:28.679 align:start position:0%
get the process going without making a
 
01:41:31.310 --> 01:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
direct commitment then you'd retain one
 
01:41:34.430 --> 01:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
as a child and family law has retained
 
01:41:38.270 --> 01:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
120. and work on and work on those over
 
01:41:40.430 --> 01:41:40.440 align:start position:0%
the next biennium putting money in the
 
01:41:41.890 --> 01:41:41.900 align:start position:0%
budget this year
 
01:41:44.450 --> 01:41:44.460 align:start position:0%
for the next two years where these
 
01:41:46.370 --> 01:41:46.380 align:start position:0%
children in under any circumstances are
 
01:41:48.010 --> 01:41:48.020 align:start position:0%
still going to be at the sununu center
 
01:41:51.410 --> 01:41:51.420 align:start position:0%
unless you decided to have them go
 
01:41:54.530 --> 01:41:54.540 align:start position:0%
elsewhere on a per diem basis
 
01:41:58.129 --> 01:41:58.139 align:start position:0%
so I was hoping to see
 
01:42:00.709 --> 01:42:00.719 align:start position:0%
House Bill 49 to go forward as an
 
01:42:02.209 --> 01:42:02.219 align:start position:0%
interim step
 
01:42:04.970 --> 01:42:04.980 align:start position:0%
and give the committee either through
 
01:42:06.530 --> 01:42:06.540 align:start position:0%
the budget process which would give you
 
01:42:08.810 --> 01:42:08.820 align:start position:0%
another three months to work on this or
 
01:42:11.149 --> 01:42:11.159 align:start position:0%
through some bills in the next session
 
01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:13.679 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to make the longer term
 
01:42:16.790 --> 01:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
commitment when facts became clearer
 
01:42:19.250 --> 01:42:19.260 align:start position:0%
as and as I say you certainly could
 
01:42:22.129 --> 01:42:22.139 align:start position:0%
amend this bill to put in some of House
 
01:42:24.709 --> 01:42:24.719 align:start position:0%
Bill 54 if you needed to which would of
 
01:42:26.990 --> 01:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
course speed the process to eliminating
 
01:42:30.169 --> 01:42:30.179 align:start position:0%
or decreasing the population in the
 
01:42:31.790 --> 01:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
short term and that would save the state
 
01:42:34.729 --> 01:42:34.739 align:start position:0%
a considerable amount of money which has
 
01:42:35.990 --> 01:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
been one of the things that I've been
 
01:42:38.270 --> 01:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
concerned about we've been spending 13
 
01:42:40.070 --> 01:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year for a long time
 
01:42:42.229 --> 01:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
at the sununu center I understand that
 
01:42:44.390 --> 01:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
this new facility would cost about 9
 
01:42:48.169 --> 01:42:48.179 align:start position:0%
million or so a year on the 12 to 18 bed
 
01:42:51.290 --> 01:42:51.300 align:start position:0%
depending on what the numbers are which
 
01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
is some somewhat of a saving but there's
 
01:42:55.790 --> 01:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
a considerable saving to be made if for
 
01:42:58.850 --> 01:42:58.860 align:start position:0%
example we were to put these children
 
01:43:00.950 --> 01:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
into facilities either in the private
 
01:43:03.530 --> 01:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
sector or in other states on a per diem
 
01:43:03.540 --> 01:43:05.330 align:start position:0%
sector or in other states on a per diem
basis

01:43:05.330 --> 01:43:05.340 align:start position:0%
basis
 
01:43:08.770 --> 01:43:08.780 align:start position:0%
um it's it's interesting to note that um
 
01:43:10.729 --> 01:43:10.739 align:start position:0%
if there are
 
01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
let's see six children in in in this
 
01:43:16.310 --> 01:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
facility on average we're spending a
 
01:43:18.410 --> 01:43:18.420 align:start position:0%
million and a half a year
 
01:43:20.209 --> 01:43:20.219 align:start position:0%
um if there are at nine million a year
 
01:43:22.669 --> 01:43:22.679 align:start position:0%
on the operating costs
 
01:43:24.830 --> 01:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
um if there are more children the per
 
01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
child cost goes down but I've always
 
01:43:29.810 --> 01:43:29.820 align:start position:0%
been concerned Mr chairman about the
 
01:43:31.490 --> 01:43:31.500 align:start position:0%
operating cost of the facility because
 
01:43:33.410 --> 01:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
that's what that's what hits the budget
 
01:43:36.590 --> 01:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
the one-time expense for the for the
 
01:43:38.689 --> 01:43:38.699 align:start position:0%
construction whether it's 15 million or
 
01:43:40.910 --> 01:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
20 million or something like that
 
01:43:43.870 --> 01:43:43.880 align:start position:0%
in the long run is a relatively small
 
01:43:46.310 --> 01:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
operating cost if you look at this from
 
01:43:48.290 --> 01:43:48.300 align:start position:0%
a business perspective if this building
 
01:43:50.330 --> 01:43:50.340 align:start position:0%
has a life of 50 years and it's a 25
 
01:43:53.330 --> 01:43:53.340 align:start position:0%
million dollar building it's costing you
 
01:43:56.810 --> 01:43:56.820 align:start position:0%
what half a million a year
 
01:43:58.030 --> 01:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
um to
 
01:44:00.350 --> 01:44:00.360 align:start position:0%
depreciate the building and add that to
 
01:44:02.510 --> 01:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
your quote operating costs
 
01:44:04.970 --> 01:44:04.980 align:start position:0%
but it whatever this committee can do to
 
01:44:06.830 --> 01:44:06.840 align:start position:0%
reduce the operating costs benefits the
 
01:44:08.570 --> 01:44:08.580 align:start position:0%
taxpayers of New Hampshire
 
01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
and building a larger facility with a
 
01:44:13.729 --> 01:44:13.739 align:start position:0%
higher operating cost to me is not in
 
01:44:16.189 --> 01:44:16.199 align:start position:0%
the best interest of taxpayers and as an
 
01:44:18.950 --> 01:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
ex-finance guy that's one of the things
 
01:44:20.689 --> 01:44:20.699 align:start position:0%
that really concerns me will you will
 
01:44:23.390 --> 01:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
you take another question sure okay so
 
01:44:26.930 --> 01:44:26.940 align:start position:0%
let's let's say we built for X whatever
 
01:44:29.810 --> 01:44:29.820 align:start position:0%
X is and
 
01:44:33.830 --> 01:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
although we have plans and and
 
01:44:36.649 --> 01:44:36.659 align:start position:0%
approaches to try to reduce the number
 
01:44:41.570 --> 01:44:41.580 align:start position:0%
from y to X let's say in the future that
 
01:44:44.510 --> 01:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen for whatever reason what
 
01:44:47.990 --> 01:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
what would be the backup plan to deal
 
01:44:52.129 --> 01:44:52.139 align:start position:0%
with any number that needed to be taken
 
01:44:56.090 --> 01:44:56.100 align:start position:0%
care of above X would you what would you
 
01:44:58.970 --> 01:44:58.980 align:start position:0%
do with uh
 
01:45:02.930 --> 01:45:02.940 align:start position:0%
a census larger than what the facility
 
01:45:06.410 --> 01:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
design can accommodate
 
01:45:08.870 --> 01:45:08.880 align:start position:0%
um that's a problem that would occur
 
01:45:11.570 --> 01:45:11.580 align:start position:0%
whether the facility is 12 beds to 18
 
01:45:14.270 --> 01:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
beds or six beds to eight beds yes sir
 
01:45:15.890 --> 01:45:15.900 align:start position:0%
what do you do if you have a surgeon
 
01:45:18.169 --> 01:45:18.179 align:start position:0%
excuse me for using that dirty word what
 
01:45:19.609 --> 01:45:19.619 align:start position:0%
would happen if you had a surge in
 
01:45:23.090 --> 01:45:23.100 align:start position:0%
population and the answer is you would
 
01:45:24.649 --> 01:45:24.659 align:start position:0%
do the same thing that Vermont and some
 
01:45:26.810 --> 01:45:26.820 align:start position:0%
other states have done Vermont put many
 
01:45:29.330 --> 01:45:29.340 align:start position:0%
of their children out into New Hampshire
 
01:45:31.370 --> 01:45:31.380 align:start position:0%
and we took care of them New Hampshire
 
01:45:32.990 --> 01:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
can place some of its children in
 
01:45:34.910 --> 01:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts state facilities or Maine
 
01:45:36.470 --> 01:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
State facilities although Maine is
 
01:45:38.030 --> 01:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
having a problem at that moment at the
 
01:45:39.950 --> 01:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
moment there are also private sector
 
01:45:41.870 --> 01:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
facilities that can take these children
 
01:45:44.870 --> 01:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
if we wanted to either on a permanent or
 
01:45:47.629 --> 01:45:47.639 align:start position:0%
short-term basis so I think there are
 
01:45:50.510 --> 01:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
ways that regardless of the size of the
 
01:45:54.410 --> 01:45:54.420 align:start position:0%
facility we could place children who for
 
01:45:56.270 --> 01:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
a short period of time exceeded the
 
01:45:58.430 --> 01:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
capacity of the facility whether it's
 
01:46:01.850 --> 01:46:01.860 align:start position:0%
six beds 12 beds or 18 beds
 
01:46:03.890 --> 01:46:03.900 align:start position:0%
that's a good question Mr chairman but I
 
01:46:05.330 --> 01:46:05.340 align:start position:0%
think there is a reasonable answer for
 
01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
that regardless of facility size right
 
01:46:11.450 --> 01:46:11.460 align:start position:0%
and would you believe that after like 20
 
01:46:14.209 --> 01:46:14.219 align:start position:0%
to 30 hours of hearings on this subject
 
01:46:17.149 --> 01:46:17.159 align:start position:0%
you're the first person that has ever
 
01:46:19.370 --> 01:46:19.380 align:start position:0%
answered the question or been asked the
 
01:46:22.129 --> 01:46:22.139 align:start position:0%
question I think of what do we do if we
 
01:46:24.229 --> 01:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
have an uh the rare instance of
 
01:46:26.750 --> 01:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
exceeding the capacity of our building
 
01:46:28.729 --> 01:46:28.739 align:start position:0%
what's what's what's the worst case
 
01:46:32.930 --> 01:46:32.940 align:start position:0%
fallback plan and and and so I think
 
01:46:34.550 --> 01:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
we're going to need to have one that
 
01:46:36.050 --> 01:46:36.060 align:start position:0%
that needs to be part of what our
 
01:46:38.510 --> 01:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
considerations are and whether that's
 
01:46:41.450 --> 01:46:41.460 align:start position:0%
and do we enter into a relationship to
 
01:46:42.770 --> 01:46:42.780 align:start position:0%
send them out of state to another
 
01:46:45.950 --> 01:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
facility or or what do we do in state so
 
01:46:47.810 --> 01:46:47.820 align:start position:0%
I I don't think we have an answer but I
 
01:46:50.570 --> 01:46:50.580 align:start position:0%
appreciate you you know opening us up
 
01:46:54.290 --> 01:46:54.300 align:start position:0%
with a an idea thank you Mr chairman you
 
01:46:55.550 --> 01:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
might consider checking with the
 
01:46:57.109 --> 01:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
Department because there are probably
 
01:46:59.330 --> 01:46:59.340 align:start position:0%
occasions in the past when for a variety
 
01:47:01.790 --> 01:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
of reasons some of our children have had
 
01:47:03.770 --> 01:47:03.780 align:start position:0%
have been placed elsewhere other than in
 
01:47:06.770 --> 01:47:06.780 align:start position:0%
sununu you might want to inquire about
 
01:47:09.169 --> 01:47:09.179 align:start position:0%
that to see what options the department
 
01:47:11.149 --> 01:47:11.159 align:start position:0%
currently has available to deal with
 
01:47:13.370 --> 01:47:13.380 align:start position:0%
these situations yes sir thank you so
 
01:47:15.109 --> 01:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
much are there are other questions for
 
01:47:18.890 --> 01:47:18.900 align:start position:0%

some way so thank you sir all right
 
01:47:31.910 --> 01:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
um okay so uh last time we did a time
 
01:47:34.010 --> 01:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
check we were getting close to 12 30.
 
01:47:35.410 --> 01:47:35.420 align:start position:0%
we're at 12
 
01:47:38.689 --> 01:47:38.699 align:start position:0%
46. so as I look at what we're going to
 
01:47:41.390 --> 01:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
do this afternoon I'm going to go ahead
 
01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:43.510 align:start position:0%
do this afternoon I'm going to go ahead
and

01:47:43.510 --> 01:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:46.010 --> 01:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
if there are no objections from the
 
01:47:49.209 --> 01:47:49.219 align:start position:0%
committee put us into recess
 
01:47:52.430 --> 01:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
I think I have to kick back off at one
 
01:47:54.530 --> 01:47:54.540 align:start position:0%
o'clock in order to comply with a
 
01:47:54.540 --> 01:47:55.370 align:start position:0%
o'clock in order to comply with a
calendar

01:47:55.370 --> 01:47:55.380 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
01:47:58.310 --> 01:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
I will come back at one o'clock and I
 
01:48:01.010 --> 01:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
will open the hearing and then I will
 
01:48:03.770 --> 01:48:03.780 align:start position:0%
recess the hearing so that you all can
 
01:48:06.709 --> 01:48:06.719 align:start position:0%
come back at say 1 20 and then you've
 
01:48:08.930 --> 01:48:08.940 align:start position:0%
got you still have about 30 minutes to
 
01:48:10.430 --> 01:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
stretch your legs and try to get
 
01:48:13.490 --> 01:48:13.500 align:start position:0%
something to eat so so that's that's my
 
01:48:15.530 --> 01:48:15.540 align:start position:0%
game plan will will officially open
 
01:48:17.629 --> 01:48:17.639 align:start position:0%
again at one but I'll just put that into
 
01:48:21.229 --> 01:48:21.239 align:start position:0%
recess till 1 20.
 
01:48:25.430 --> 01:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
no no complaints all right okay so Mr
 
01:48:26.689 --> 01:48:26.699 align:start position:0%
Ripple if you could help me with this
 
01:48:32.629 --> 01:48:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:34.430 --> 01:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
um I think that's fine for now I think
 
01:48:35.930 --> 01:48:35.940 align:start position:0%
exactly the plan that you just said is
 
01:48:37.490 --> 01:48:37.500 align:start position:0%
what you should do come back in at one
 
01:48:39.830 --> 01:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
and recess until 1 20. that's that's
 
01:48:42.109 --> 01:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
what I want to do I just don't know what
 
01:48:44.990 --> 01:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
sign gets put up on the YouTube oh
 
01:48:47.149 --> 01:48:47.159 align:start position:0%

okay all right if somebody dials in at
 
01:48:55.669 --> 01:48:55.679 align:start position:0%
105 I want them to know that they're not
 
01:48:57.109 --> 01:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
alone I think it'll just say the
 
01:48:58.729 --> 01:48:58.739 align:start position:0%
committee is in recess and we'll resume
 
01:49:00.050 --> 01:49:00.060 align:start position:0%

um a side-by-side of explanation of the
 
02:27:54.370 --> 02:27:54.380 align:start position:0%
differences and the similarities between
 
02:27:58.490 --> 02:27:58.500 align:start position:0%

we're only focused on New Hampshire
 
02:28:21.830 --> 02:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
rapid response in our crisis system but
 
02:28:23.990 --> 02:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
there'll be other programs that we'll be
 
02:28:25.969 --> 02:28:25.979 align:start position:0%
talking about as we enter into the
 
02:28:29.990 --> 02:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
budget cycle so all of this is driven in
 
02:28:35.510 --> 02:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
our guiding Stars so to speak is these
 
02:28:37.849 --> 02:28:37.859 align:start position:0%
plans that have been created with
 
02:28:40.370 --> 02:28:40.380 align:start position:0%
myriads of stakeholders including

02:28:49.370 --> 02:28:49.380 align:start position:0%
second page you'll find that list we
 
02:28:51.410 --> 02:28:51.420 align:start position:0%
have the 10-year plan which we made
 
02:28:54.590 --> 02:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
available to you we have the children's
 
02:28:58.849 --> 02:28:58.859 align:start position:0%
system of care which is actually RSA 135
 
02:29:02.150 --> 02:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
F and was created as part of Senate bill
 
02:29:05.870 --> 02:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
2. I mean Senate bill 14
 
02:29:08.870 --> 02:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
um we also have a strategic plan from
 
02:29:10.910 --> 02:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
the governor's Commission on Alcohol and
 
02:29:13.790 --> 02:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
Other Drugs as well as a suicide
 
02:29:16.550 --> 02:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
prevention strategic plan which was
 
02:29:19.370 --> 02:29:19.380 align:start position:0%
developed under the auspices of our
 
02:29:21.950 --> 02:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
Suicide Prevention Council
 
02:29:24.050 --> 02:29:24.060 align:start position:0%
and so then you can see what our vision
 
02:29:27.190 --> 02:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
statement is as we move forward and work
 
02:29:31.969 --> 02:29:31.979 align:start position:0%
to fulfill the vision of all of these
 
02:29:34.190 --> 02:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
plans with keeping all of them in mind
 
02:29:36.969 --> 02:29:36.979 align:start position:0%
and driving our work
 
02:29:39.710 --> 02:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to tell you I'm I just want
 
02:29:41.030 --> 02:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure I'm looking at the right
 
02:29:43.550 --> 02:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
sheet of paper sure I started looking at
 
02:29:46.130 --> 02:29:46.140 align:start position:0%
the the behavioral health that's stapled
 
02:29:48.770 --> 02:29:48.780 align:start position:0%
it's got multiple slides is that what
 
02:29:50.990 --> 02:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
we're on yes that's what we're on okay
 
02:29:53.030 --> 02:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
so that's actually the one that has
 
02:29:55.309 --> 02:29:55.319 align:start position:0%
um the overview okay and with our names
 
02:29:58.130 --> 02:29:58.140 align:start position:0%
on it February 3rd and for those of you
 
02:30:00.710 --> 02:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
who are looking for this online it's in
 
02:30:03.050 --> 02:30:03.060 align:start position:0%
the division three area under the LBA
 
02:30:05.929 --> 02:30:05.939 align:start position:0%
all of our documents should be posted I
 
02:30:07.969 --> 02:30:07.979 align:start position:0%
think these are all posted right
 
02:30:12.110 --> 02:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
yep okay okay I'm I'm getting back in
 
02:30:13.849 --> 02:30:13.859 align:start position:0%
sync with you what what page are you on
 
02:30:17.389 --> 02:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:17.399 --> 02:30:19.670 align:start position:0%
 
three

02:30:19.670 --> 02:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:30:21.590 --> 02:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
this is our coordinated Continuum of
 
02:30:24.230 --> 02:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
Care again today we're talking about the
 
02:30:27.590 --> 02:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
right hand side which is our crisis and
 
02:30:30.590 --> 02:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
inpatient services but we wanted to also
 
02:30:32.750 --> 02:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
share this with you so that you see our
 
02:30:35.450 --> 02:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
full Continuum of Care and this actually
 
02:30:37.550 --> 02:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
carries across not just for mental
 
02:30:40.130 --> 02:30:40.140 align:start position:0%
health services but also for substance
 
02:30:44.270 --> 02:30:44.280 align:start position:0%
misuse services and uh for our other
 
02:30:46.250 --> 02:30:46.260 align:start position:0%
programs in fact you might be able to
 
02:30:48.469 --> 02:30:48.479 align:start position:0%
apply this across many of our programs
 
02:30:50.690 --> 02:30:50.700 align:start position:0%
across the department not just within
 
02:30:53.389 --> 02:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
the division for Behavioral Health so we
 
02:30:56.030 --> 02:30:56.040 align:start position:0%
have Community Education we have
 
02:30:58.750 --> 02:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
prevention and early intervention
 
02:31:01.190 --> 02:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
Outpatient Treatment
 
02:31:04.130 --> 02:31:04.140 align:start position:0%
step up and step down which is really
 
02:31:08.450 --> 02:31:08.460 align:start position:0%
references to Transitions in care and
 
02:31:10.849 --> 02:31:10.859 align:start position:0%
then again the crisis in inpatient
 
02:31:12.650 --> 02:31:12.660 align:start position:0%
Services which we're here to talk about
 
02:31:12.660 --> 02:31:13.910 align:start position:0%
Services which we're here to talk about
today

02:31:13.910 --> 02:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:31:22.130 --> 02:31:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:24.950 --> 02:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
so the next slide slide four just shows
 
02:31:26.990 --> 02:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
a more detailed overview of our crisis
 
02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:28.330 align:start position:0%
a more detailed overview of our crisis
system

02:31:28.330 --> 02:31:28.340 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:31:31.550 --> 02:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
starting with our crisis contact center
 
02:31:35.330 --> 02:31:35.340 align:start position:0%
so it goes from at least least most
 
02:31:37.670 --> 02:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
community-based to inpatient beds so we
 
02:31:39.670 --> 02:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
have the full Continuum crisis services
 
02:31:42.050 --> 02:31:42.060 align:start position:0%
including mobile response teams around
 
02:31:45.370 --> 02:31:45.380 align:start position:0%
the state we have peer operated programs
 
02:31:47.870 --> 02:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
throughout the state for Step Up step
 
02:31:49.790 --> 02:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
down as well as rapid respite services
 
02:31:52.429 --> 02:31:52.439 align:start position:0%
we have crisis residential in three
 
02:31:53.750 --> 02:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
regions of the state that are available
 
02:31:56.570 --> 02:31:56.580 align:start position:0%
Statewide crisis Apartments then of
 
02:31:58.210 --> 02:31:58.220 align:start position:0%
course we have our Hospital Systems
 
02:32:00.889 --> 02:32:00.899 align:start position:0%
State operated inpatient beds as well as
 
02:32:03.530 --> 02:32:03.540 align:start position:0%
other community-based inpatient beds
 
02:32:05.929 --> 02:32:05.939 align:start position:0%
can I say something here
 
02:32:08.809 --> 02:32:08.819 align:start position:0%
um okay just just just to make sure you
 
02:32:09.969 --> 02:32:09.979 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:32:13.610 --> 02:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
why you were invited as a special topic
 
02:32:16.490 --> 02:32:16.500 align:start position:0%
on mobile Behavioral Health
 
02:32:18.530 --> 02:32:18.540 align:start position:0%
um and everything you're doing is great
 
02:32:20.630 --> 02:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not I don't want to throw you off of
 
02:32:23.510 --> 02:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
what you intended to say but I I just
 
02:32:26.630 --> 02:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
want to want you to know that from a
 
02:32:28.630 --> 02:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
financial perspective one of the things
 
02:32:31.690 --> 02:32:31.700 align:start position:0%
that has
 
02:32:34.190 --> 02:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
bothered me a little bit just because
 
02:32:36.590 --> 02:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
that's the way I am is
 
02:32:39.770 --> 02:32:39.780 align:start position:0%
um we have in different budgets and
 
02:32:41.630 --> 02:32:41.640 align:start position:0%
different sections it seems like we have
 
02:32:44.450 --> 02:32:44.460 align:start position:0%
multiple areas in which these mobile
 
02:32:46.910 --> 02:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
response teams this second bullet down
 
02:32:50.330 --> 02:32:50.340 align:start position:0%
the mobile crisis response teams it felt
 
02:32:52.790 --> 02:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
to me like there were six total units
 
02:32:54.849 --> 02:32:54.859 align:start position:0%
and they were spread over four different
 
02:32:58.309 --> 02:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
areas and uh and there weren't any
 
02:33:01.190 --> 02:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
common metrics for all six of them and
 
02:33:03.710 --> 02:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
and so because these are valuable
 
02:33:07.550 --> 02:33:07.560 align:start position:0%
important critical assets in the
 
02:33:12.230 --> 02:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
entirety of our Continuum I I wanted to
 
02:33:14.690 --> 02:33:14.700 align:start position:0%
drill down and really understand
 
02:33:17.630 --> 02:33:17.640 align:start position:0%
how many of these do we have how many of
 
02:33:20.690 --> 02:33:20.700 align:start position:0%
them are really Vans you know what kind
 
02:33:23.870 --> 02:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
of stuff goes into a typical van you
 
02:33:27.170 --> 02:33:27.180 align:start position:0%
know how many calls do they go on I I
 
02:33:28.750 --> 02:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
really wanted to understand
 
02:33:33.170 --> 02:33:33.180 align:start position:0%
operationally what it how these are are
 
02:33:35.870 --> 02:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
are are are viewed within the department
 
02:33:39.530 --> 02:33:39.540 align:start position:0%
and managed so Mr chair
 
02:33:41.570 --> 02:33:41.580 align:start position:0%
um we're getting there if you flip to
 
02:33:43.429 --> 02:33:43.439 align:start position:0%
your next Slide the rest of our
 
02:33:45.349 --> 02:33:45.359 align:start position:0%
presentation is all about the mobile
 
02:33:46.849 --> 02:33:46.859 align:start position:0%
teams that you're referencing yeah I
 
02:33:49.010 --> 02:33:49.020 align:start position:0%
fell for this yesterday I I did actually
 
02:33:53.030 --> 02:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
look ahead are coming and I'm not seeing
 
02:33:55.130 --> 02:33:55.140 align:start position:0%
the slides I was anticipating in my head
 
02:33:57.349 --> 02:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
but it's okay you just stay the course
 
02:33:58.670 --> 02:33:58.680 align:start position:0%
you're doing great
 
02:34:01.130 --> 02:34:01.140 align:start position:0%
and and we know that there are new
 
02:34:03.889 --> 02:34:03.899 align:start position:0%
members of this committee so we know
 
02:34:06.889 --> 02:34:06.899 align:start position:0%
that um your Keen focus on this but we
 
02:34:08.570 --> 02:34:08.580 align:start position:0%
wanted to give at least some background
 
02:34:11.450 --> 02:34:11.460 align:start position:0%
on context for what we do especially
 
02:34:13.550 --> 02:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire hospital coming
 
02:34:16.910 --> 02:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
um right behind us because our whole
 
02:34:19.130 --> 02:34:19.140 align:start position:0%
point of our community-based services is
 
02:34:22.490 --> 02:34:22.500 align:start position:0%
to ensure that people do not need to get
 
02:34:25.130 --> 02:34:25.140 align:start position:0%
to the level of the acute care we want
 
02:34:27.349 --> 02:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
to intervene sooner and so there are
 
02:34:29.630 --> 02:34:29.640 align:start position:0%
other programs other than mobile
 
02:34:31.429 --> 02:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
response so we just wanted to embed it
 
02:34:33.950 --> 02:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
in that so I apologize if we didn't say
 
02:34:35.809 --> 02:34:35.819 align:start position:0%
that up front no apology necessary
 
02:34:37.910 --> 02:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
you're doing great I'm just letting you
 
02:34:40.309 --> 02:34:40.319 align:start position:0%
know that by the end of the budget cycle
 
02:34:43.670 --> 02:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
I want to have a crystal clear view of
 
02:34:47.750 --> 02:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
of what a unit of mobile response crisis
 
02:34:50.030 --> 02:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
team looks like because I understand
 
02:34:52.010 --> 02:34:52.020 align:start position:0%
that there are different iterations or
 
02:34:55.250 --> 02:34:55.260 align:start position:0%
versions of them you know I I I just I
 
02:34:56.450 --> 02:34:56.460 align:start position:0%
want to get into the details
 
02:34:58.490 --> 02:34:58.500 align:start position:0%
representative pilersky thank you so
 
02:35:01.790 --> 02:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
much I just for my own benefit a little
 
02:35:04.190 --> 02:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
definition work I hear things often
 
02:35:06.349 --> 02:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
about peer support I see peer operated
 
02:35:07.910 --> 02:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
beds and peer respite can you just give
 
02:35:09.349 --> 02:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
me a quick definition of what that
 
02:35:11.570 --> 02:35:11.580 align:start position:0%
actually means thanks
 
02:35:14.570 --> 02:35:14.580 align:start position:0%
yes so for the context of of these
 
02:35:16.790 --> 02:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
Services here what we mean by peer is an
 
02:35:19.130 --> 02:35:19.140 align:start position:0%
individual who identifies as having a
 
02:35:20.570 --> 02:35:20.580 align:start position:0%
lived experience or personal experience
 
02:35:22.670 --> 02:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
with a mental health condition who is
 
02:35:24.770 --> 02:35:24.780 align:start position:0%
you know living in recovery and gone
 
02:35:27.950 --> 02:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
through a specific training curriculum
 
02:35:30.110 --> 02:35:30.120 align:start position:0%
to be a certified peer
 
02:35:51.950 --> 02:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:53.630 --> 02:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:35:56.809 --> 02:35:56.819 align:start position:0%
I just need to interject it's a sphere
 
02:35:58.910 --> 02:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
warning or weather warning kind of thing
 
02:36:01.849 --> 02:36:01.859 align:start position:0%
the temperatures are dropping rapidly if
 
02:36:04.610 --> 02:36:04.620 align:start position:0%
we have anyone who's parked over at the
 
02:36:08.090 --> 02:36:08.100 align:start position:0%
stores a parking garage you're invited
 
02:36:11.210 --> 02:36:11.220 align:start position:0%
at any point to go move your car while
 
02:36:13.730 --> 02:36:13.740 align:start position:0%
there's still some warmth in the air and
 
02:36:16.910 --> 02:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
you can relocate your car into the lob
 
02:36:18.889 --> 02:36:18.899 align:start position:0%
parking lot there's some spaces on the
 
02:36:20.570 --> 02:36:20.580 align:start position:0%
upper part of that and they're yellow
 
02:36:23.150 --> 02:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
bags around the yellow bee that you can
 
02:36:25.190 --> 02:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
park in those spots without a ticket
 
02:36:29.030 --> 02:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
it's no trick you can actually do it so
 
02:36:31.370 --> 02:36:31.380 align:start position:0%
um so that's your severe weather update
 
02:36:34.250 --> 02:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
it's going to get very very cold sorry
 
02:36:37.190 --> 02:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
to interrupt you so um Mr chair I just
 
02:36:38.870 --> 02:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to say we hope that you walk out
 
02:36:41.030 --> 02:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
with that information today and not have
 
02:36:43.070 --> 02:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
to wait through till March to find out
 
02:36:45.170 --> 02:36:45.180 align:start position:0%
that information so that's what our hope
 
02:36:47.210 --> 02:36:47.220 align:start position:0%
is today to share this information find
 
02:36:49.010 --> 02:36:49.020 align:start position:0%
out what additional information you want
 
02:36:54.410 --> 02:36:54.420 align:start position:0%
and bring that back in a rapid manner
 
02:36:57.410 --> 02:36:57.420 align:start position:0%
okay okay so the New Hampshire rapid
 
02:36:59.570 --> 02:36:59.580 align:start position:0%
response is is
 
02:37:01.490 --> 02:37:01.500 align:start position:0%
um our comprehensive crisis response
 
02:37:03.230 --> 02:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
system community-based crisis response
 
02:37:05.830 --> 02:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
system it's comprised of a 24 7
 
02:37:08.690 --> 02:37:08.700 align:start position:0%
centralized contact center and so by
 
02:37:11.030 --> 02:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
contact we mean it's accessible via
 
02:37:15.230 --> 02:37:15.240 align:start position:0%
phone text and chat so we have one phone
 
02:37:18.050 --> 02:37:18.060 align:start position:0%
number that is available Statewide so
 
02:37:19.849 --> 02:37:19.859 align:start position:0%
folks call into the
 
02:37:23.929 --> 02:37:23.939 align:start position:0%
access point and the majority of the
 
02:37:26.270 --> 02:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
time their needs are met over the phone
 
02:37:29.450 --> 02:37:29.460 align:start position:0%
or through the access point when so as a
 
02:37:30.950 --> 02:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
member of the public should I just know
 
02:37:34.389 --> 02:37:34.399 align:start position:0%
that number like I know 911
 
02:37:36.530 --> 02:37:36.540 align:start position:0%
you would love it if you could schedule
 
02:37:39.469 --> 02:37:39.479 align:start position:0%
it into your phone absolutely so what is
 
02:37:41.929 --> 02:37:41.939 align:start position:0%
the phone number
 
02:37:44.750 --> 02:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
so you can find that in some of the
 
02:37:46.870 --> 02:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
materials that we handed out
 
02:37:51.290 --> 02:37:51.300 align:start position:0%
so in both of those pieces of
 
02:37:53.510 --> 02:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
information including the national 988
 
02:37:56.630 --> 02:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
suicide and Crisis Line information it
 
02:37:59.450 --> 02:37:59.460 align:start position:0%
shows that number so the the boxes one
 
02:38:03.130 --> 02:38:03.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:06.230 --> 02:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
833-710-6477 you got it so that's longer
 
02:38:07.730 --> 02:38:07.740 align:start position:0%
than 9-1-1
 
02:38:12.290 --> 02:38:12.300 align:start position:0%
it is how how are we going to make sure
 
02:38:15.290 --> 02:38:15.300 align:start position:0%
that the public knows that remembers it
 
02:38:18.170 --> 02:38:18.180 align:start position:0%
can use it because because I think this
 
02:38:20.570 --> 02:38:20.580 align:start position:0%
is a it qualifies as a number but I
 
02:38:23.450 --> 02:38:23.460 align:start position:0%
don't know if it qualifies as a easy to
 
02:38:23.460 --> 02:38:26.830 align:start position:0%
don't know if it qualifies as a easy to
access

02:38:26.830 --> 02:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:30.290 --> 02:38:30.300 align:start position:0%
are all the good numbers taken
 
02:38:32.330 --> 02:38:32.340 align:start position:0%
two one one
 
02:38:35.030 --> 02:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:38:37.790 --> 02:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
and out here that talks about 988 so 988
 
02:38:39.349 --> 02:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
is the national
 
02:38:42.050 --> 02:38:42.060 align:start position:0%
um crisis and suicide Lifeline that has
 
02:38:44.929 --> 02:38:44.939 align:start position:0%
always been exist in existence but um it
 
02:38:47.330 --> 02:38:47.340 align:start position:0%
did it used to be a 10 digit number and
 
02:38:49.070 --> 02:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
it was simplified to an easy to remember
 
02:38:52.450 --> 02:38:52.460 align:start position:0%
988 so that is a number that's available
 
02:38:55.490 --> 02:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
to folks here in New Hampshire headrest
 
02:38:58.130 --> 02:38:58.140 align:start position:0%
and Beacon Health are the vendors here
 
02:38:59.510 --> 02:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that will answer those
 
02:39:02.750 --> 02:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
calls the only caveat is that at high
 
02:39:05.690 --> 02:39:05.700 align:start position:0%
volume times if the teams employed by
 
02:39:07.550 --> 02:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
those agencies are not able to answer
 
02:39:09.830 --> 02:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
the phone it rolls over to the National
 
02:39:09.840 --> 02:39:11.090 align:start position:0%
the phone it rolls over to the National
backup

02:39:11.090 --> 02:39:11.100 align:start position:0%
backup
 
02:39:13.190 --> 02:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
and so we can't guarantee that every
 
02:39:16.090 --> 02:39:16.100 align:start position:0%
time someone calls 988 They will receive
 
02:39:20.510 --> 02:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
a new hampshire-based call center that
 
02:39:22.190 --> 02:39:22.200 align:start position:0%
has the capability of deploying our
 
02:39:23.809 --> 02:39:23.819 align:start position:0%
mobile response teams or scheduling
 
02:39:26.750 --> 02:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up appointments so while we are
 
02:39:28.070 --> 02:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
trying to work with our national
 
02:39:31.910 --> 02:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
Partners to figure out how to embed
 
02:39:34.610 --> 02:39:34.620 align:start position:0%
those modalities nationally we are still
 
02:39:36.670 --> 02:39:36.680 align:start position:0%
referring folks to that 10 digit number
 
02:39:39.170 --> 02:39:39.180 align:start position:0%
we are working with a public relations
 
02:39:42.070 --> 02:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
firm to try and do some more targeted
 
02:39:43.969 --> 02:39:43.979 align:start position:0%
community-based Outreach and education
 
02:39:46.010 --> 02:39:46.020 align:start position:0%
about the availability of New Hampshire
 
02:39:49.010 --> 02:39:49.020 align:start position:0%
rapid response we wanted to make sure we
 
02:39:51.410 --> 02:39:51.420 align:start position:0%
had some of those operations more fully
 
02:39:53.510 --> 02:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
functional before doing a more broad
 
02:39:56.270 --> 02:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
Outreach to the general public thank you
 
02:39:59.270 --> 02:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
and through our efforts in standing up
 
02:40:01.130 --> 02:40:01.140 align:start position:0%
9A Dade and having the New Hampshire
 
02:40:04.330 --> 02:40:04.340 align:start position:0%
aspect of that we have brought together
 
02:40:08.210 --> 02:40:08.220 align:start position:0%
2-1-1 and 9-1-1 so there are protocols
 
02:40:11.030 --> 02:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
and policies in place so that if someone
 
02:40:13.670 --> 02:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
calls the wrong number so to speak that
 
02:40:16.429 --> 02:40:16.439 align:start position:0%
there will be follow-up action to get
 
02:40:17.929 --> 02:40:17.939 align:start position:0%
them to the right the right number
 
02:40:23.090 --> 02:40:23.100 align:start position:0%
remember me what 2-1-1 does so 211 is a
 
02:40:26.150 --> 02:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
information and referral line I should
 
02:40:29.929 --> 02:40:29.939 align:start position:0%
give it a plug today because it is a
 
02:40:32.030 --> 02:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
place where people for example if you
 
02:40:34.670 --> 02:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
need a warm place to go if you need a
 
02:40:38.530 --> 02:40:38.540 align:start position:0%
warming station there being
 
02:40:42.170 --> 02:40:42.180 align:start position:0%
advertised as the place to call so they
 
02:40:44.809 --> 02:40:44.819 align:start position:0%
do a variety of services they're how you
 
02:40:47.630 --> 02:40:47.640 align:start position:0%
access the doorway system in New
 
02:40:49.670 --> 02:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they provide information about
 
02:40:53.210 --> 02:40:53.220 align:start position:0%
housing it's it's quite broad what they
 
02:40:55.370 --> 02:40:55.380 align:start position:0%
provide for information and referral
 
02:40:59.750 --> 02:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:02.330 --> 02:41:02.340 align:start position:0%
so when someone reaches out to the
 
02:41:04.190 --> 02:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
access point and it's determined that
 
02:41:06.429 --> 02:41:06.439 align:start position:0%
they they need a higher level of support
 
02:41:09.050 --> 02:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
the access point is able to deploy our
 
02:41:10.730 --> 02:41:10.740 align:start position:0%
mobile response teams they have
 
02:41:12.410 --> 02:41:12.420 align:start position:0%
Technology Solutions that's able to
 
02:41:14.270 --> 02:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
identify the closest available team
 
02:41:17.630 --> 02:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
within a one hour radius so a team of
 
02:41:19.969 --> 02:41:19.979 align:start position:0%
two specialty trained responders will go
 
02:41:21.770 --> 02:41:21.780 align:start position:0%
and meet someone in the community of you
 
02:41:23.830 --> 02:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
know of their choice
 
02:41:26.570 --> 02:41:26.580 align:start position:0%
and so that's the way our mobile
 
02:41:30.410 --> 02:41:30.420 align:start position:0%
response system is set up we do have
 
02:41:32.210 --> 02:41:32.220 align:start position:0%
some bullet points on slide eight but
 
02:41:34.309 --> 02:41:34.319 align:start position:0%
what I can say is that
 
02:41:36.889 --> 02:41:36.899 align:start position:0%
it is designed can you take a question I
 
02:41:38.809 --> 02:41:38.819 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know representative Hull
 
02:41:42.349 --> 02:41:42.359 align:start position:0%
do you have a question I do so on on the
 
02:41:44.330 --> 02:41:44.340 align:start position:0%
mobile response teams are these
 
02:41:47.030 --> 02:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
contracted services are these Direct
 
02:41:49.070 --> 02:41:49.080 align:start position:0%
Services internal
 
02:41:51.290 --> 02:41:51.300 align:start position:0%
so these are contracted Services through
 
02:41:55.370 --> 02:41:55.380 align:start position:0%
our 10 Community Mental Health Centers
 
02:41:56.929 --> 02:41:56.939 align:start position:0%
and uh to
 
02:41:56.939 --> 02:41:58.130 align:start position:0%
and uh to
um

02:41:58.130 --> 02:41:58.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:00.830 --> 02:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
Mr chair your question earlier there are
 
02:42:02.510 --> 02:42:02.520 align:start position:0%
ten so we have 10 committee Mental
 
02:42:05.330 --> 02:42:05.340 align:start position:0%
Health Centers each one has a team
 
02:42:08.929 --> 02:42:08.939 align:start position:0%
and that's an update right wasn't it six
 
02:42:11.929 --> 02:42:11.939 align:start position:0%
just two years ago no we
 
02:42:14.710 --> 02:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
oh pardon me
 
02:42:18.170 --> 02:42:18.180 align:start position:0%
so we've had a mobile crisis as part of
 
02:42:19.610 --> 02:42:19.620 align:start position:0%
our community mental health agreement
 
02:42:22.070 --> 02:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
which is the Amanda D settlement we had
 
02:42:24.830 --> 02:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
the requirement that we contract
 
02:42:27.050 --> 02:42:27.060 align:start position:0%
um in stand-up services in the three
 
02:42:29.870 --> 02:42:29.880 align:start position:0%
major cities Nashua Manchester and
 
02:42:32.570 --> 02:42:32.580 align:start position:0%
Concord so those have been in place for
 
02:42:35.450 --> 02:42:35.460 align:start position:0%
a number of years and then with support
 
02:42:37.309 --> 02:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
from the governor and the legislature
 
02:42:41.150 --> 02:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
through the budget process we were able
 
02:42:43.490 --> 02:42:43.500 align:start position:0%
to stand up the additional crisis teams
 
02:42:46.130 --> 02:42:46.140 align:start position:0%
and that also was supported through the
 
02:42:49.250 --> 02:42:49.260 align:start position:0%
system of care funding so so it's always
 
02:42:52.730 --> 02:42:52.740 align:start position:0%
been 10. uh so it was always three and
 
02:42:54.530 --> 02:42:54.540 align:start position:0%
everyone said well what about me and
 
02:42:57.290 --> 02:42:57.300 align:start position:0%
through some excellent advocacy work
 
02:43:01.610 --> 02:43:01.620 align:start position:0%
um we were able to see this become
 
02:43:06.410 --> 02:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
Statewide and when we say 10 centers we
 
02:43:08.750 --> 02:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
also know that there may be a sender
 
02:43:09.910 --> 02:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
that has
 
02:43:13.670 --> 02:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
a bigger need and may have a couple
 
02:43:15.650 --> 02:43:15.660 align:start position:0%
things going on at this same time a
 
02:43:18.290 --> 02:43:18.300 align:start position:0%
couple of deployments so it truly is
 
02:43:20.770 --> 02:43:20.780 align:start position:0%
Statewide where they're able to deploy
 
02:43:23.809 --> 02:43:23.819 align:start position:0%
another mobile team that's nearby that's
 
02:43:26.330 --> 02:43:26.340 align:start position:0%
in a nearby region
 
02:43:28.670 --> 02:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
and I want to address the issue of
 
02:43:31.070 --> 02:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
whether there are Vans or not a couple
 
02:43:33.710 --> 02:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
of the Centers do have Vans but they're
 
02:43:35.990 --> 02:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
not always van so as you can imagine
 
02:43:39.469 --> 02:43:39.479 align:start position:0%
with two people on call they're not
 
02:43:41.809 --> 02:43:41.819 align:start position:0%
going to necessarily come together get
 
02:43:44.630 --> 02:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
in a van and then deploy it really
 
02:43:47.990 --> 02:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
depends on the region and it depends on
 
02:43:49.610 --> 02:43:49.620 align:start position:0%
what the need is and where they'll be
 
02:43:49.620 --> 02:43:59.030 align:start position:0%
what the need is and where they'll be
going

02:43:59.030 --> 02:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:00.710 --> 02:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
okay before you get going I think
 
02:44:03.770 --> 02:44:03.780 align:start position:0%
representative erf has a question just a
 
02:44:04.910 --> 02:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
quick question in relation to what you
 
02:44:07.010 --> 02:44:07.020 align:start position:0%
just said so essentially these are the
 
02:44:08.210 --> 02:44:08.220 align:start position:0%
people that show up it's not like
 
02:44:09.710 --> 02:44:09.720 align:start position:0%
equipment showing up with them so these
 
02:44:11.570 --> 02:44:11.580 align:start position:0%
they've been driving their cars and be
 
02:44:13.010 --> 02:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
there to help the person that they're
 
02:44:15.410 --> 02:44:15.420 align:start position:0%
interacting with yeah that's that's the
 
02:44:16.910 --> 02:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
idea and there are a lot of questions
 
02:44:18.950 --> 02:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
about whether law enforcement deploys
 
02:44:20.990 --> 02:44:21.000 align:start position:0%
with them again it's based on the
 
02:44:24.050 --> 02:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
circumstances and who is making the call
 
02:44:26.270 --> 02:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
whether it's a school it could be a
 
02:44:28.910 --> 02:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
school and um they're responding to a
 
02:44:31.910 --> 02:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
school it could be at a police station
 
02:44:34.610 --> 02:44:34.620 align:start position:0%
where they're asking rather than have a
 
02:44:36.650 --> 02:44:36.660 align:start position:0%
higher level intervention that they have
 
02:44:39.469 --> 02:44:39.479 align:start position:0%
this team come this trained team come
 
02:44:44.410 --> 02:44:44.420 align:start position:0%
and um and meet with them so yeah
 
02:44:47.630 --> 02:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
and so so you because you mentioned that
 
02:44:49.429 --> 02:44:49.439 align:start position:0%
sometimes they may need to deploy with
 
02:44:50.710 --> 02:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
police support
 
02:44:53.630 --> 02:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
do we have any experiences where one of
 
02:44:55.370 --> 02:44:55.380 align:start position:0%
these teams has been launched and
 
02:44:57.050 --> 02:44:57.060 align:start position:0%
they've ended up in the middle of a
 
02:44:58.969 --> 02:44:58.979 align:start position:0%
domestic violence dispute of some kind
 
02:45:01.849 --> 02:45:01.859 align:start position:0%
or I'm just you just got me worried
 
02:45:04.490 --> 02:45:04.500 align:start position:0%
about the safety aspect for the team
 
02:45:11.330 --> 02:45:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:13.550 --> 02:45:13.560 align:start position:0%
information at the moment but nationally
 
02:45:16.429 --> 02:45:16.439 align:start position:0%
what what is seen is less than two
 
02:45:18.650 --> 02:45:18.660 align:start position:0%
percent of mobile deployments
 
02:45:21.650 --> 02:45:21.660 align:start position:0%
require police presence so most of the
 
02:45:23.150 --> 02:45:23.160 align:start position:0%
time when a mobile team is going out
 
02:45:25.070 --> 02:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
there have been safety assessments on
 
02:45:27.290 --> 02:45:27.300 align:start position:0%
the phone with the access point when the
 
02:45:29.270 --> 02:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
mobile team is enroute they call and
 
02:45:30.710 --> 02:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
make contact with the individual to
 
02:45:32.750 --> 02:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
again get more detail more information
 
02:45:35.389 --> 02:45:35.399 align:start position:0%
and do additional safety assessments and
 
02:45:37.570 --> 02:45:37.580 align:start position:0%
and so it very rarely
 
02:45:40.490 --> 02:45:40.500 align:start position:0%
escalates to that level
 
02:45:42.650 --> 02:45:42.660 align:start position:0%
but it certainly does include law
 
02:45:45.290 --> 02:45:45.300 align:start position:0%
enforcement when it's necessary
 
02:45:47.809 --> 02:45:47.819 align:start position:0%
if we had anyone hurt
 
02:45:51.650 --> 02:45:51.660 align:start position:0%
going on a deployment like that
 
02:45:53.809 --> 02:45:53.819 align:start position:0%
um not to my knowledge
 
02:45:56.090 --> 02:45:56.100 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
02:45:58.130 --> 02:45:58.140 align:start position:0%
and I will say my reference to law
 
02:46:00.530 --> 02:46:00.540 align:start position:0%
enforcement is sometimes we respond so
 
02:46:02.870 --> 02:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
the mobile team responds at the request
 
02:46:04.910 --> 02:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
of law enforcement which has identified
 
02:46:08.690 --> 02:46:08.700 align:start position:0%
that there doesn't need to be uh uh um a
 
02:46:10.670 --> 02:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
Justice involved situation that it's
 
02:46:12.650 --> 02:46:12.660 align:start position:0%
just a matter of of needing to address
 
02:46:21.650 --> 02:46:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:24.110 --> 02:46:24.120 align:start position:0%
so the next two slides just go on to
 
02:46:26.510 --> 02:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
give a little bit of very high level
 
02:46:28.849 --> 02:46:28.859 align:start position:0%
data we've had this system up and
 
02:46:31.130 --> 02:46:31.140 align:start position:0%
running for a year now and so our
 
02:46:34.190 --> 02:46:34.200 align:start position:0%
contact center has engaged with over 22
 
02:46:37.190 --> 02:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
000 individuals Statewide approximately
 
02:46:39.950 --> 02:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
17 of those are individuals under the
 
02:46:42.230 --> 02:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
age of 18.
 
02:46:44.210 --> 02:46:44.220 align:start position:0%
um and all you know from all regions of
 
02:46:46.250 --> 02:46:46.260 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:46:49.849 --> 02:46:49.859 align:start position:0%
of those 22 000 contacts about 7 000
 
02:46:52.190 --> 02:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
deployments have resulted so there has
 
02:46:53.990 --> 02:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
been an assessed need to have someone
 
02:46:56.389 --> 02:46:56.399 align:start position:0%
come out in person
 
02:46:58.610 --> 02:46:58.620 align:start position:0%
um so that's about 31 which is a little
 
02:47:00.830 --> 02:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
bit higher than the national average but
 
02:47:00.840 --> 02:47:01.550 align:start position:0%
bit higher than the national average but
um

02:47:01.550 --> 02:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:03.290 --> 02:47:03.300 align:start position:0%
is is very much in line with the
 
02:47:05.450 --> 02:47:05.460 align:start position:0%
national expectations of of what we
 
02:47:07.550 --> 02:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
would see for mobile deployments and
 
02:47:10.550 --> 02:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
again for our mobile deployments we see
 
02:47:12.950 --> 02:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
a quite a significantly higher rate for
 
02:47:14.750 --> 02:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
deployments for youth so about 42
 
02:47:16.429 --> 02:47:16.439 align:start position:0%
percent of those mobile deployments were
 
02:47:20.690 --> 02:47:20.700 align:start position:0%
for youth as opposed to 18 for adults
 
02:47:22.910 --> 02:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
um and again as we said you know it uh
 
02:47:24.230 --> 02:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
the teams are available Statewide
 
02:47:27.130 --> 02:47:27.140 align:start position:0%
they're deploying Statewide part of the
 
02:47:30.050 --> 02:47:30.060 align:start position:0%
advantage of this model is that as we
 
02:47:32.270 --> 02:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
see Workforce challenges and Staffing
 
02:47:34.490 --> 02:47:34.500 align:start position:0%
variations amongst the teams they're
 
02:47:37.070 --> 02:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
able to support and cover when people
 
02:47:38.809 --> 02:47:38.819 align:start position:0%
really need those deployments across
 
02:47:38.819 --> 02:47:42.349 align:start position:0%
really need those deployments across
regions

02:47:42.349 --> 02:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:44.690 --> 02:47:44.700 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair you're going to have to
 
02:47:47.750 --> 02:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
um forgive us for including dollars in
 
02:47:50.750 --> 02:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
this next slide no I just don't want you
 
02:47:53.690 --> 02:47:53.700 align:start position:0%
to get in trouble with Mr White that was
 
02:47:56.030 --> 02:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
that was the promise
 
02:47:56.040 --> 02:47:58.429 align:start position:0%
that was the promise
um

02:47:58.429 --> 02:47:58.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:01.730 --> 02:48:01.740 align:start position:0%
I I just I just there are dollars there
 
02:48:03.469 --> 02:48:03.479 align:start position:0%
on slide six
 
02:48:06.110 --> 02:48:06.120 align:start position:0%
or eight there's a question
 
02:48:07.849 --> 02:48:07.859 align:start position:0%
oh go ahead
 
02:48:10.490 --> 02:48:10.500 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you can you give me an idea
 
02:48:13.130 --> 02:48:13.140 align:start position:0%
when a when a team responds to a a
 
02:48:16.790 --> 02:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
situation of someone in crisis
 
02:48:20.809 --> 02:48:20.819 align:start position:0%
um what often is the resolution or how
 
02:48:23.210 --> 02:48:23.220 align:start position:0%
often does it involve taking that person
 
02:48:26.450 --> 02:48:26.460 align:start position:0%
to a safe location and how often is it
 
02:48:29.690 --> 02:48:29.700 align:start position:0%
you know talking them talking them to a
 
02:48:31.969 --> 02:48:31.979 align:start position:0%
good place and reuniting them with a
 
02:48:33.410 --> 02:48:33.420 align:start position:0%
safe person to make sure that they're
 
02:48:36.349 --> 02:48:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:38.570 --> 02:48:38.580 align:start position:0%
so that is data we are still in the
 
02:48:41.150 --> 02:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
process of trying to about evaluate and
 
02:48:43.429 --> 02:48:43.439 align:start position:0%
ensure it's it's valid as you can
 
02:48:44.990 --> 02:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
imagine when we stand up any new program
 
02:48:46.969 --> 02:48:46.979 align:start position:0%
it takes some time to ensure our data is
 
02:48:46.979 --> 02:48:48.530 align:start position:0%
it takes some time to ensure our data is
accurate

02:48:48.530 --> 02:48:48.540 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
02:48:51.650 --> 02:48:51.660 align:start position:0%
um so I don't have those numbers today
 
02:48:51.660 --> 02:48:52.670 align:start position:0%
um so I don't have those numbers today
um

02:48:52.670 --> 02:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:54.290 --> 02:48:54.300 align:start position:0%
but that's something we can look into
 
02:48:55.790 --> 02:48:55.800 align:start position:0%
sharing as soon as we have something
 
02:48:57.830 --> 02:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
that that seems to reflective that our
 
02:49:00.050 --> 02:49:00.060 align:start position:0%
data team feels like we can share and
 
02:49:02.110 --> 02:49:02.120 align:start position:0%
and is appropriate
 
02:49:05.150 --> 02:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
the majority I can say anecdotally the
 
02:49:07.010 --> 02:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
majority of contacts do remain in the
 
02:49:07.020 --> 02:49:08.050 align:start position:0%
majority of contacts do remain in the
community

02:49:08.050 --> 02:49:08.060 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:49:10.730 --> 02:49:10.740 align:start position:0%
once the team is deployed in the
 
02:49:13.730 --> 02:49:13.740 align:start position:0%
community or or where you met them in
 
02:49:16.190 --> 02:49:16.200 align:start position:0%
the residents or the because it's
 
02:49:19.030 --> 02:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
different right the community could be
 
02:49:22.070 --> 02:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
somewhere not at home
 
02:49:23.870 --> 02:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
yes so
 
02:49:25.730 --> 02:49:25.740 align:start position:0%
um they find some resolution where they
 
02:49:28.309 --> 02:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
can have their needs met
 
02:49:30.650 --> 02:49:30.660 align:start position:0%
at home or you know where where they're
 
02:49:32.170 --> 02:49:32.180 align:start position:0%
at at their workplace
 
02:49:35.570 --> 02:49:35.580 align:start position:0%
and we representative
 
02:49:37.969 --> 02:49:37.979 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to understand the slide
 
02:49:40.010 --> 02:49:40.020 align:start position:0%
seven percentages so it says about a
 
02:49:42.110 --> 02:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
third of the seven thousand result in
 
02:49:44.210 --> 02:49:44.220 align:start position:0%
Mobile requests but then it talks about
 
02:49:47.570 --> 02:49:47.580 align:start position:0%
42 percent and 18 percent
 
02:49:49.910 --> 02:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of breakouts for kids and
 
02:49:58.450 --> 02:49:58.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:02.570 --> 02:50:02.580 align:start position:0%
yes so but that adds up to like six
 
02:50:04.670 --> 02:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
sixty percent
 
02:50:06.830 --> 02:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
of that seven thousand
 
02:50:08.510 --> 02:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
but only thirty percent
 
02:50:13.790 --> 02:50:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:17.809 --> 02:50:17.819 align:start position:0%
it's so if I may is the 31 of the total
 
02:50:19.790 --> 02:50:19.800 align:start position:0%
twenty two thousand to get down to the
 
02:50:21.830 --> 02:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
seven thousand yes okay that's how I
 
02:50:23.630 --> 02:50:23.640 align:start position:0%
read it oh okay that's oh that's
 
02:50:25.130 --> 02:50:25.140 align:start position:0%
different slide
 
02:50:25.140 --> 02:50:27.050 align:start position:0%
different slide
gotcha

02:50:27.050 --> 02:50:27.060 align:start position:0%
gotcha
 
02:50:29.809 --> 02:50:29.819 align:start position:0%
I will check that second statistic
 
02:50:31.849 --> 02:50:31.859 align:start position:0%
and we'll make it more clear because
 
02:50:35.809 --> 02:50:35.819 align:start position:0%
that that's a very good point thank you
 
02:50:38.570 --> 02:50:38.580 align:start position:0%
the um other thing Mr chair I wanted to
 
02:50:41.809 --> 02:50:41.819 align:start position:0%
mention is that we also have some
 
02:50:45.349 --> 02:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
limited crisis Apartments so if a mobile
 
02:50:49.910 --> 02:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
team has access to that that may be a
 
02:50:51.650 --> 02:50:51.660 align:start position:0%
result of where someone can go so that
 
02:50:53.750 --> 02:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
they can be safe until they can take the
 
02:50:56.990 --> 02:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
next step so those are stays that are
 
02:51:00.230 --> 02:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
about up to up to seven days where
 
02:51:03.950 --> 02:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
someone can be safe and not have to
 
02:51:08.090 --> 02:51:08.100 align:start position:0%
re-enter an unsafe location
 
02:51:10.670 --> 02:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
so so you're challenging one of my
 
02:51:12.950 --> 02:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
assumptions I I have thought of the
 
02:51:15.170 --> 02:51:15.180 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health crisis response team
 
02:51:19.550 --> 02:51:19.560 align:start position:0%
as moving to help an individual
 
02:51:23.450 --> 02:51:23.460 align:start position:0%
experiencing Behavioral Health crisis
 
02:51:26.210 --> 02:51:26.220 align:start position:0%
removing them from their environment
 
02:51:28.429 --> 02:51:28.439 align:start position:0%
where there may be other people involved
 
02:51:31.969 --> 02:51:31.979 align:start position:0%
who are aggravating that is is one thing
 
02:51:34.190 --> 02:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
but but then you but then you're
 
02:51:36.170 --> 02:51:36.180 align:start position:0%
suggesting that just putting them in an
 
02:51:39.050 --> 02:51:39.060 align:start position:0%
apartment for seven day up to seven days
 
02:51:42.170 --> 02:51:42.180 align:start position:0%
may actually help stabilize a Behavioral
 
02:51:44.330 --> 02:51:44.340 align:start position:0%
Health crisis I I don't I don't get that
 
02:51:47.570 --> 02:51:47.580 align:start position:0%
absolutely it's staffed those are those
 
02:51:49.250 --> 02:51:49.260 align:start position:0%
crisis apartments aren't just apartments
 
02:51:51.230 --> 02:51:51.240 align:start position:0%
that are empty and waiting they're
 
02:51:53.510 --> 02:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
stabbed so they have the opportunity to
 
02:51:56.510 --> 02:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
have continued services and then they
 
02:51:58.910 --> 02:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
also can get appointments with the
 
02:52:00.530 --> 02:52:00.540 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Center for that
 
02:52:03.830 --> 02:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
stabilization or are they staffed 24 7
 
02:52:06.469 --> 02:52:06.479 align:start position:0%
are they just as needed so if you have
 
02:52:08.889 --> 02:52:08.899 align:start position:0%
somebody who needs it you can staff it
 
02:52:11.929 --> 02:52:11.939 align:start position:0%
based on that or are we paying for
 
02:52:13.370 --> 02:52:13.380 align:start position:0%
somebody to hang out at the apartment
 
02:52:16.849 --> 02:52:16.859 align:start position:0%
all the time no well um we are not
 
02:52:20.510 --> 02:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
paying for Staffing 24 7 if they're if
 
02:52:23.750 --> 02:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's empty but they do bring in people
 
02:52:26.990 --> 02:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
when there are people who are in need of
 
02:52:28.670 --> 02:52:28.680 align:start position:0%
that service
 
02:52:32.030 --> 02:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
so if I recall the way the mobile
 
02:52:34.730 --> 02:52:34.740 align:start position:0%
Response Team conversation one is every
 
02:52:36.769 --> 02:52:36.779 align:start position:0%
legislator would say okay that's great
 
02:52:38.330 --> 02:52:38.340 align:start position:0%
but where's mine
 
02:52:40.809 --> 02:52:40.819 align:start position:0%
so are these apartments
 
02:52:43.730 --> 02:52:43.740 align:start position:0%
distributed enough to where all the
 
02:52:45.349 --> 02:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
senators are going to be happy that
 
02:52:47.330 --> 02:52:47.340 align:start position:0%
there's adequate apartment availability
 
02:52:49.250 --> 02:52:49.260 align:start position:0%
in their neighborhood
 
02:52:53.150 --> 02:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
not at this time those were required as
 
02:52:55.849 --> 02:52:55.859 align:start position:0%
part of the standing those up for the
 
02:52:57.950 --> 02:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement in those three
 
02:53:00.050 --> 02:53:00.060 align:start position:0%
communities and those are all state
 
02:53:01.550 --> 02:53:01.560 align:start position:0%
funded those aren't are they
 
02:53:04.790 --> 02:53:04.800 align:start position:0%
supplemented by federal money no there
 
02:53:14.389 --> 02:53:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:16.550 --> 02:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
okay where there'd be the be that
 
02:53:20.809 --> 02:53:20.819 align:start position:0%
federal funds okay and and and and so do
 
02:53:23.269 --> 02:53:23.279 align:start position:0%
you haven't not today but just so you
 
02:53:25.550 --> 02:53:25.560 align:start position:0%
know when we're talking about money I'm
 
02:53:27.290 --> 02:53:27.300 align:start position:0%
I'm probably going to want to ask you if
 
02:53:29.389 --> 02:53:29.399 align:start position:0%
you have any sort of performance metrics
 
02:53:32.090 --> 02:53:32.100 align:start position:0%
if we're spending a million dollars a
 
02:53:34.610 --> 02:53:34.620 align:start position:0%
year on apartments how do we know that
 
02:53:36.710 --> 02:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
that's money being spent effectively did
 
02:53:38.990 --> 02:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
we positively influence the outcome of
 
02:53:41.150 --> 02:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
that patient you know
 
02:53:43.670 --> 02:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
um just an Effectiveness metric of some
 
02:53:46.070 --> 02:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
kind but uh representative Hull
 
02:53:47.690 --> 02:53:47.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:53:50.210 --> 02:53:50.220 align:start position:0%
um on this slide seven again right I I
 
02:53:51.889 --> 02:53:51.899 align:start position:0%
can understand how you got to the 31
 
02:53:54.170 --> 02:53:54.180 align:start position:0%
percent that math was pretty clear the
 
02:53:56.690 --> 02:53:56.700 align:start position:0%
42 and 18 though
 
02:53:59.210 --> 02:53:59.220 align:start position:0%
wasn't real clear where what you were
 
02:54:00.950 --> 02:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
basing that number on so when you update
 
02:54:03.170 --> 02:54:03.180 align:start position:0%
this slide I'm assuming that's the
 
02:54:05.330 --> 02:54:05.340 align:start position:0%
percentage of of the seven thousand
 
02:54:08.330 --> 02:54:08.340 align:start position:0%
eighty four contacts is split but that
 
02:54:10.730 --> 02:54:10.740 align:start position:0%
math doesn't work so exactly thank you
 
02:54:13.990 --> 02:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:18.650 --> 02:54:18.660 align:start position:0%
okay this is really helpful I I we would
 
02:54:20.450 --> 02:54:20.460 align:start position:0%
be doing this if we had a spreadsheet in
 
02:54:22.010 --> 02:54:22.020 align:start position:0%
front of us too so I'm glad we're
 
02:54:25.490 --> 02:54:25.500 align:start position:0%
getting this done a little earlier so
 
02:54:27.530 --> 02:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
so would you like us to go over the
 
02:54:29.450 --> 02:54:29.460 align:start position:0%
finances we're just talking about as
 
02:54:31.490 --> 02:54:31.500 align:start position:0%
they relate to contracts
 
02:54:33.469 --> 02:54:33.479 align:start position:0%
and if you don't want us to that's fine
 
02:54:36.469 --> 02:54:36.479 align:start position:0%
no I'm okay with that I I just uh what
 
02:54:39.830 --> 02:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
the way I describe this uh to to Mr
 
02:54:41.570 --> 02:54:41.580 align:start position:0%
White is that we know the governor's
 
02:54:44.030 --> 02:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
budget hasn't come out you know that we
 
02:54:46.070 --> 02:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
know that you got an agency request that
 
02:54:49.490 --> 02:54:49.500 align:start position:0%
the governor may change and and so we
 
02:54:50.809 --> 02:54:50.819 align:start position:0%
just didn't want to get you in an
 
02:54:52.910 --> 02:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
awkward spot getting you out on the line
 
02:54:54.230 --> 02:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
about money
 
02:54:57.290 --> 02:54:57.300 align:start position:0%
that might be different so so I wanted
 
02:54:58.849 --> 02:54:58.859 align:start position:0%
to hear everything you wanted to say
 
02:55:01.190 --> 02:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
about the program and the effectiveness
 
02:55:03.590 --> 02:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
and your concerns and you know where you
 
02:55:05.630 --> 02:55:05.640 align:start position:0%
see new money going where you see we
 
02:55:08.510 --> 02:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
could cut back without converting it to
 
02:55:08.520 --> 02:55:09.590 align:start position:0%
could cut back without converting it to
dollars

02:55:09.590 --> 02:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:55:12.950 --> 02:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
so we then should just wrap it up with
 
02:55:15.050 --> 02:55:15.060 align:start position:0%
um talking about the model that we
 
02:55:17.330 --> 02:55:17.340 align:start position:0%
modeled this after and the three pillars
 
02:55:19.790 --> 02:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
of that model which I will have Julianne
 
02:55:23.570 --> 02:55:23.580 align:start position:0%
explain and where that request is to
 
02:55:26.570 --> 02:55:26.580 align:start position:0%
fulfill those three pillars okay
 
02:55:28.849 --> 02:55:28.859 align:start position:0%
so this model was built after it's
 
02:55:30.650 --> 02:55:30.660 align:start position:0%
called the national crisis now model
 
02:55:32.809 --> 02:55:32.819 align:start position:0%
it's the national best practice for
 
02:55:35.870 --> 02:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
crisis services and what and it's
 
02:55:37.790 --> 02:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
comprised of these three kind of pillars
 
02:55:39.830 --> 02:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
of Crisis Support so the access do we
 
02:55:41.750 --> 02:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
have a picture on one of the handouts
 
02:55:48.349 --> 02:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:50.990 --> 02:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
yeah represent the three pillars so it's
 
02:55:53.809 --> 02:55:53.819 align:start position:0%
the someone to call text or chat someone
 
02:55:56.630 --> 02:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
to respond and somewhere to go so in New
 
02:55:58.010 --> 02:55:58.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we've done an excellent job
 
02:55:59.570 --> 02:55:59.580 align:start position:0%
we're really ahead of the curve in in
 
02:56:01.910 --> 02:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
building out our crisis contact center
 
02:56:04.010 --> 02:56:04.020 align:start position:0%
our mobile deployment teams and so it's
 
02:56:06.830 --> 02:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
that third pillar of somewhere to go one
 
02:56:08.990 --> 02:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
thing I I want to underscore about the
 
02:56:10.670 --> 02:56:10.680 align:start position:0%
importance of this system is that the
 
02:56:12.230 --> 02:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
messaging around it is that we want
 
02:56:15.050 --> 02:56:15.060 align:start position:0%
people to call early and call often that
 
02:56:16.670 --> 02:56:16.680 align:start position:0%
we don't want people to get to a point
 
02:56:18.650 --> 02:56:18.660 align:start position:0%
where they are in such acute stress that
 
02:56:20.269 --> 02:56:20.279 align:start position:0%
they feel like they need Hospital level
 
02:56:22.969 --> 02:56:22.979 align:start position:0%
of care or a mobile deployment team the
 
02:56:24.769 --> 02:56:24.779 align:start position:0%
point of this system really is for
 
02:56:27.230 --> 02:56:27.240 align:start position:0%
people to reach out and for us to help
 
02:56:31.309 --> 02:56:31.319 align:start position:0%
engage them earlier on in in their
 
02:56:34.730 --> 02:56:34.740 align:start position:0%
struggles and so our Focus moving into
 
02:56:37.429 --> 02:56:37.439 align:start position:0%
this next year is evaluating our current
 
02:56:39.650 --> 02:56:39.660 align:start position:0%
system how you know how how is it
 
02:56:41.450 --> 02:56:41.460 align:start position:0%
running to date and looking for
 
02:56:42.950 --> 02:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
opportunities to expand these
 
02:56:46.490 --> 02:56:46.500 align:start position:0%
location-based centers which means
 
02:56:48.769 --> 02:56:48.779 align:start position:0%
um just as it sounds it's a it's a
 
02:56:51.290 --> 02:56:51.300 align:start position:0%
building where individuals can walk in
 
02:56:53.809 --> 02:56:53.819 align:start position:0%
and see people that day that time it's
 
02:56:55.550 --> 02:56:55.560 align:start position:0%
potentially an opportunity for law
 
02:56:57.710 --> 02:56:57.720 align:start position:0%
enforcement to drop off
 
02:57:00.410 --> 02:57:00.420 align:start position:0%
um as opposed to a jail or a hospital
 
02:57:03.710 --> 02:57:03.720 align:start position:0%
and so we are exploring models that
 
02:57:07.130 --> 02:57:07.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:09.830 --> 02:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
do you do you think your budget Maps
 
02:57:11.870 --> 02:57:11.880 align:start position:0%
into these three pillars like if I
 
02:57:14.510 --> 02:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to know okay show me the part of
 
02:57:16.610 --> 02:57:16.620 align:start position:0%
the budget that deals with the text Chat
 
02:57:18.530 --> 02:57:18.540 align:start position:0%
Show me the part of the budget dealing
 
02:57:22.309 --> 02:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
with the response is just do do the does
 
02:57:24.410 --> 02:57:24.420 align:start position:0%
the budget align with your
 
02:57:27.830 --> 02:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
organizational three pillar concept
 
02:57:31.969 --> 02:57:31.979 align:start position:0%
I should defer to our CFO on that but
 
02:57:34.670 --> 02:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
you will see them as part of our
 
02:57:37.070 --> 02:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
contracts with providers so they're
 
02:57:39.530 --> 02:57:39.540 align:start position:0%
embedded with that within that but we
 
02:57:41.510 --> 02:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
certainly are going to pull out
 
02:57:42.950 --> 02:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
um something like this so that you have
 
02:57:46.190 --> 02:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to to see where it sits
 
02:57:48.349 --> 02:57:48.359 align:start position:0%
okay did you have yes go ahead
 
02:57:51.170 --> 02:57:51.180 align:start position:0%
representative Waller thank you
 
02:57:53.570 --> 02:57:53.580 align:start position:0%
so I mean we hear a lot about the
 
02:57:56.210 --> 02:57:56.220 align:start position:0%
numbers of people waiting in the
 
02:57:58.849 --> 02:57:58.859 align:start position:0%
emergency rooms of our hospitals
 
02:58:01.790 --> 02:58:01.800 align:start position:0%
how has this affected that number
 
02:58:05.330 --> 02:58:05.340 align:start position:0%
and do you go sometimes to the do you
 
02:58:07.730 --> 02:58:07.740 align:start position:0%
get called to the emergency rooms
 
02:58:10.130 --> 02:58:10.140 align:start position:0%
so to answer your second question first
 
02:58:10.140 --> 02:58:11.929 align:start position:0%
so to answer your second question first
yes

02:58:11.929 --> 02:58:11.939 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:58:14.090 --> 02:58:14.100 align:start position:0%
um we want to see that less and less and
 
02:58:17.269 --> 02:58:17.279 align:start position:0%
less but it does happen and to answer
 
02:58:20.150 --> 02:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
your first question I think that New
 
02:58:22.490 --> 02:58:22.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital will be presenting
 
02:58:25.849 --> 02:58:25.859 align:start position:0%
just behind us we believe that there
 
02:58:26.990 --> 02:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
have been
 
02:58:30.290 --> 02:58:30.300 align:start position:0%
um hundreds of diversions and we just
 
02:58:32.450 --> 02:58:32.460 align:start position:0%
know the demand is really high right now
 
02:58:34.849 --> 02:58:34.859 align:start position:0%
and I I know that the Community Mental
 
02:58:36.050 --> 02:58:36.060 align:start position:0%
Health Centers have been talking about
 
02:58:38.590 --> 02:58:38.600 align:start position:0%
the Staffing challenges that they have
 
02:58:42.469 --> 02:58:42.479 align:start position:0%
and that part of that challenge
 
02:58:46.250 --> 02:58:46.260 align:start position:0%
um a uh really impacts what's known as
 
02:58:48.410 --> 02:58:48.420 align:start position:0%
the back door of New Hampshire hospital
 
02:58:52.250 --> 02:58:52.260 align:start position:0%
and again I I think that um Jasper can
 
02:58:55.190 --> 02:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
respond to that as well but we I mean
 
02:58:56.769 --> 02:58:56.779 align:start position:0%
that's the whole point of this program
 
02:58:59.750 --> 02:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
is and as Julianne said we want people
 
02:59:01.370 --> 02:59:01.380 align:start position:0%
to call
 
02:59:02.870 --> 02:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
um earlier
 
02:59:04.550 --> 02:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
um in the process so that they don't
 
02:59:07.190 --> 02:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
have to be hospitalized and go on that
 
02:59:09.050 --> 02:59:09.060 align:start position:0%
trajectory to New Hampshire hospital on
 
02:59:10.610 --> 02:59:10.620 align:start position:0%
a higher level of care
 
02:59:12.650 --> 02:59:12.660 align:start position:0%
so so far we're going to guess an answer
 
02:59:14.630 --> 02:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
to representative Waller's question I
 
02:59:16.849 --> 02:59:16.859 align:start position:0%
would say at least the one I heard is
 
02:59:19.670 --> 02:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
that is that the presence of these
 
02:59:23.990 --> 02:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
mobile response crisis teams probably as
 
02:59:27.010 --> 02:59:27.020 align:start position:0%
the unintended consequence of driving up
 
02:59:31.370 --> 02:59:31.380 align:start position:0%
the backlog of people in the ERS waiting
 
02:59:34.130 --> 02:59:34.140 align:start position:0%
to get to the New Hampshire hospital not
 
02:59:36.110 --> 02:59:36.120 align:start position:0%
because you're creating additional
 
02:59:38.750 --> 02:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
patients but because you're bringing
 
02:59:42.050 --> 02:59:42.060 align:start position:0%
additional patients into the the full
 
02:59:45.530 --> 02:59:45.540 align:start position:0%
patient flow and and although it's not a
 
02:59:48.110 --> 02:59:48.120 align:start position:0%
desirable outcome one of the unintended
 
02:59:51.530 --> 02:59:51.540 align:start position:0%
outcomes is in fact we're this is an
 
02:59:54.110 --> 02:59:54.120 align:start position:0%
area where we may be exacerbating a
 
02:59:57.710 --> 02:59:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:00.110 --> 03:00:00.120 align:start position:0%
I would not characterize it as that I
 
03:00:01.849 --> 03:00:01.859 align:start position:0%
think there are other factors that are
 
03:00:04.490 --> 03:00:04.500 align:start position:0%
going on that are creating that wait
 
03:00:06.110 --> 03:00:06.120 align:start position:0%
list and again
 
03:00:08.870 --> 03:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
um the experts are behind me however
 
03:00:11.389 --> 03:00:11.399 align:start position:0%
they has been limited
 
03:00:14.929 --> 03:00:14.939 align:start position:0%
um staffing issues that have um that uh
 
03:00:16.969 --> 03:00:16.979 align:start position:0%
have impacted the number of beds that
 
03:00:20.210 --> 03:00:20.220 align:start position:0%
are available as well as housing you
 
03:00:22.070 --> 03:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
know when you want to do a throughput
 
03:00:25.010 --> 03:00:25.020 align:start position:0%
and you have an emergency room you have
 
03:00:28.250 --> 03:00:28.260 align:start position:0%
an acute Psychiatric Center and then you
 
03:00:30.650 --> 03:00:30.660 align:start position:0%
have housing so you do a throughput when
 
03:00:34.809 --> 03:00:34.819 align:start position:0%
you have a diminished capacity
 
03:00:38.330 --> 03:00:38.340 align:start position:0%
in any one of those then you have you
 
03:00:42.530 --> 03:00:42.540 align:start position:0%
have an issue so we know that there has
 
03:00:45.290 --> 03:00:45.300 align:start position:0%
to be a focus on that housing piece as
 
03:00:48.830 --> 03:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
people transition and housing is is an
 
03:00:51.230 --> 03:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
area of great focus and great need right
 
03:00:51.240 --> 03:00:52.790 align:start position:0%
area of great focus and great need right
now

03:00:52.790 --> 03:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:00:54.950 --> 03:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh representative Mooney have been
 
03:00:54.960 --> 03:00:56.090 align:start position:0%
uh representative Mooney have been
waiting

03:00:56.090 --> 03:00:56.100 align:start position:0%
waiting
 
03:00:57.590 --> 03:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you both for being
 
03:00:59.510 --> 03:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
here speaking of housing this is a good
 
03:01:01.610 --> 03:01:01.620 align:start position:0%
segue do you have a breakdown of how
 
03:01:04.610 --> 03:01:04.620 align:start position:0%
many those without homes use service
 
03:01:08.389 --> 03:01:08.399 align:start position:0%
through your mobile crisis unit
 
03:01:10.190 --> 03:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
so that's something that we would have
 
03:01:12.050 --> 03:01:12.060 align:start position:0%
to come back so you mean individuals who
 
03:01:15.230 --> 03:01:15.240 align:start position:0%
are unhoused who come who so are we
 
03:01:17.870 --> 03:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
responding for individuals who are
 
03:01:20.929 --> 03:01:20.939 align:start position:0%
homeless correct yeah we all have to get
 
03:01:22.849 --> 03:01:22.859 align:start position:0%
that data thank you very much
 
03:01:22.859 --> 03:01:25.429 align:start position:0%
that data thank you very much
representative

03:01:25.429 --> 03:01:25.439 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:01:27.830 --> 03:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
back to your budget breakdown so can we
 
03:01:29.929 --> 03:01:29.939 align:start position:0%
expect now that you've been through
 
03:01:31.490 --> 03:01:31.500 align:start position:0%
someone to call someone to respond and
 
03:01:32.809 --> 03:01:32.819 align:start position:0%
you've got numbers for those can we
 
03:01:33.769 --> 03:01:33.779 align:start position:0%
expect to see in the budget that's
 
03:01:35.330 --> 03:01:35.340 align:start position:0%
coming forth for somewhere to go
 
03:01:36.950 --> 03:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
component as well
 
03:01:39.290 --> 03:01:39.300 align:start position:0%
we hope so
 
03:01:41.450 --> 03:01:41.460 align:start position:0%
um so we'll put it there so it's in our
 
03:01:43.969 --> 03:01:43.979 align:start position:0%
prioritized need which you'll see
 
03:01:46.130 --> 03:01:46.140 align:start position:0%
um when you when you get the budget
 
03:01:48.650 --> 03:01:48.660 align:start position:0%
details so we did include some funding
 
03:01:50.809 --> 03:01:50.819 align:start position:0%
for that
 
03:01:50.819 --> 03:01:51.889 align:start position:0%
for that
hmm

03:01:51.889 --> 03:01:51.899 align:start position:0%
hmm
 
03:01:55.010 --> 03:01:55.020 align:start position:0%
you have exactly 10 mobile response
 
03:01:58.010 --> 03:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
teams one perk
 
03:01:58.020 --> 03:01:59.769 align:start position:0%
teams one perk
area

03:01:59.769 --> 03:01:59.779 align:start position:0%
area
 
03:02:03.230 --> 03:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
so are you collecting the metrics to
 
03:02:05.210 --> 03:02:05.220 align:start position:0%
where you could come in here and make an
 
03:02:06.950 --> 03:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
argument that we need a second one
 
03:02:09.469 --> 03:02:09.479 align:start position:0%
somewhere or or you know what we don't
 
03:02:13.130 --> 03:02:13.140 align:start position:0%
really need that one there so the three
 
03:02:15.290 --> 03:02:15.300 align:start position:0%
um regions Concord Manchester and Nashua
 
03:02:18.469 --> 03:02:18.479 align:start position:0%
technically have two teams it's they
 
03:02:20.269 --> 03:02:20.279 align:start position:0%
have a higher Staffing ratio than the
 
03:02:22.670 --> 03:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
other regions of the state so our our
 
03:02:24.469 --> 03:02:24.479 align:start position:0%
regions are adjusting their Staffing
 
03:02:26.750 --> 03:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
ratios based on the deployment requests
 
03:02:28.730 --> 03:02:28.740 align:start position:0%
that they're getting but every region is
 
03:02:31.429 --> 03:02:31.439 align:start position:0%
contracted for at least one full and by
 
03:02:33.830 --> 03:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
following you know a 24 7 Staffing
 
03:02:37.610 --> 03:02:37.620 align:start position:0%
structure for one at least one team
 
03:02:41.929 --> 03:02:41.939 align:start position:0%
all right any other questions
 
03:02:44.510 --> 03:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
okay so this was really good this is
 
03:02:47.870 --> 03:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
very useful uh before you go is are you
 
03:02:50.090 --> 03:02:50.100 align:start position:0%
the one that that gave us the New
 
03:02:53.330 --> 03:02:53.340 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 10-year mental health plan
 
03:02:56.929 --> 03:02:56.939 align:start position:0%
okay so so we have uh some new people to
 
03:02:59.330 --> 03:02:59.340 align:start position:0%
the committee would you just give us you
 
03:03:01.429 --> 03:03:01.439 align:start position:0%
know the sort of an executive summary of
 
03:03:03.950 --> 03:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
what this is and what it does without
 
03:03:08.750 --> 03:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:11.510 --> 03:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
so yes the 10-year mental health plan it
 
03:03:14.690 --> 03:03:14.700 align:start position:0%
was published in January 2019 as a way
 
03:03:18.110 --> 03:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
for us to examine gaps and opportunities
 
03:03:19.670 --> 03:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
in our mental health system so it really
 
03:03:21.670 --> 03:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
set the vision it was driven by
 
03:03:24.650 --> 03:03:24.660 align:start position:0%
legislative desire and Advocates to
 
03:03:27.170 --> 03:03:27.180 align:start position:0%
really see a plan for how we address the
 
03:03:29.090 --> 03:03:29.100 align:start position:0%
mental health needs of our state and so
 
03:03:31.610 --> 03:03:31.620 align:start position:0%
it set forward core recommendations as
 
03:03:33.170 --> 03:03:33.180 align:start position:0%
well as overarching goals that we have
 
03:03:36.110 --> 03:03:36.120 align:start position:0%
been working to accomplish since it's it
 
03:03:38.389 --> 03:03:38.399 align:start position:0%
was published and so what you see in
 
03:03:41.210 --> 03:03:41.220 align:start position:0%
terms of the one-page handout are the
 
03:03:42.889 --> 03:03:42.899 align:start position:0%
accomplishments to date and it's very
 
03:03:45.290 --> 03:03:45.300 align:start position:0%
comprehensive in some areas very
 
03:03:46.910 --> 03:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
aspirational but we've been able to
 
03:03:49.910 --> 03:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
focus on some concrete areas that span
 
03:03:51.650 --> 03:03:51.660 align:start position:0%
the full Continuum of care for
 
03:03:54.650 --> 03:03:54.660 align:start position:0%
individuals across the lifespan
 
03:03:57.590 --> 03:03:57.600 align:start position:0%
look okay so I got distracted by the
 
03:03:59.690 --> 03:03:59.700 align:start position:0%
word uh recommendation at each of them
 
03:04:01.790 --> 03:04:01.800 align:start position:0%
so this is a previous recommendation
 
03:04:04.730 --> 03:04:04.740 align:start position:0%
from the an earlier time frame and then
 
03:04:06.650 --> 03:04:06.660 align:start position:0%
the bullets underneath it are meant to
 
03:04:08.809 --> 03:04:08.819 align:start position:0%
say what the success was of those
 
03:04:08.819 --> 03:04:10.130 align:start position:0%
say what the success was of those
recommendations

03:04:10.130 --> 03:04:10.140 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
03:04:12.950 --> 03:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
so so then this sort of what's the
 
03:04:16.250 --> 03:04:16.260 align:start position:0%
appetite to say what are what are the
 
03:04:19.610 --> 03:04:19.620 align:start position:0%
fresh recommendations and of the fresh
 
03:04:21.650 --> 03:04:21.660 align:start position:0%
recommendations where are they and and
 
03:04:24.469 --> 03:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
which ones do you need or think you need
 
03:04:28.510 --> 03:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:30.950 --> 03:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that question because
 
03:04:32.809 --> 03:04:32.819 align:start position:0%
this is something that we want to engage
 
03:04:36.230 --> 03:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
in we want to attend your plans a
 
03:04:37.910 --> 03:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
10-year plan and we don't want to put it
 
03:04:39.469 --> 03:04:39.479 align:start position:0%
on a shelf and we need to take another
 
03:04:42.050 --> 03:04:42.060 align:start position:0%
look at it this was pre-covered
 
03:04:45.469 --> 03:04:45.479 align:start position:0%
obviously and it was you know three
 
03:04:49.130 --> 03:04:49.140 align:start position:0%
years ago seems like a real I guess yeah
 
03:04:51.469 --> 03:04:51.479 align:start position:0%
um four years ago is a really long time
 
03:04:53.570 --> 03:04:53.580 align:start position:0%
and things change on the ground
 
03:04:57.410 --> 03:04:57.420 align:start position:0%
situations change so we want to take a
 
03:05:00.469 --> 03:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
fresh look at it to see what's missing
 
03:05:05.349 --> 03:05:05.359 align:start position:0%
we currently have a contract with um our
 
03:05:09.830 --> 03:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
going to be doing a study of looking at
 
03:05:12.769 --> 03:05:12.779 align:start position:0%
the gaps in our current system not just
 
03:05:14.630 --> 03:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
for mental health services but for
 
03:05:17.450 --> 03:05:17.460 align:start position:0%
substance misuse Services as well so
 
03:05:20.929 --> 03:05:20.939 align:start position:0%
that may inform and really help Drive
 
03:05:23.510 --> 03:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
our plans going forward so we don't want
 
03:05:25.670 --> 03:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
to say oh look you know
 
03:05:27.889 --> 03:05:27.899 align:start position:0%
four years ago we sat around and here's
 
03:05:30.050 --> 03:05:30.060 align:start position:0%
what we planned we want to refresh it
 
03:05:32.870 --> 03:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
and and look at it anew
 
03:05:35.510 --> 03:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
so I think that's all brilliant I I just
 
03:05:37.550 --> 03:05:37.560 align:start position:0%
see it out of sync with the budget cycle
 
03:05:41.210 --> 03:05:41.220 align:start position:0%
so how are we going to connect this to a
 
03:05:43.010 --> 03:05:43.020 align:start position:0%
budget cycle are we going to wait two
 
03:05:46.910 --> 03:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
years to hear that or you you can't you
 
03:05:49.010 --> 03:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
can't get it to us by the end of March
 
03:05:49.020 --> 03:05:50.570 align:start position:0%
can't get it to us by the end of March
probably

03:05:50.570 --> 03:05:50.580 align:start position:0%
probably
 
03:05:50.580 --> 03:05:52.429 align:start position:0%
probably
so

03:05:52.429 --> 03:05:52.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:05:53.990 --> 03:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
um I'll probably be kicked for saying
 
03:05:56.210 --> 03:05:56.220 align:start position:0%
this but not all of this would require
 
03:05:59.510 --> 03:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
additional dollars any changes some
 
03:06:02.090 --> 03:06:02.100 align:start position:0%
changes we love hearing that you can say
 
03:06:04.610 --> 03:06:04.620 align:start position:0%
that yeah but behind me they may so it
 
03:06:06.650 --> 03:06:06.660 align:start position:0%
may be redirecting dollars and seeing
 
03:06:08.510 --> 03:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
what our efforts have been and where
 
03:06:10.190 --> 03:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
they need to go
 
03:06:13.610 --> 03:06:13.620 align:start position:0%
um and and so no it doesn't perfectly
 
03:06:17.090 --> 03:06:17.100 align:start position:0%
align for new budgetary items but it
 
03:06:20.210 --> 03:06:20.220 align:start position:0%
certainly is something that we can't set
 
03:06:24.050 --> 03:06:24.060 align:start position:0%
aside for two years so you'll see our
 
03:06:27.469 --> 03:06:27.479 align:start position:0%
efforts around the location-based
 
03:06:29.630 --> 03:06:29.640 align:start position:0%
Services we're going to try to do that
 
03:06:33.650 --> 03:06:33.660 align:start position:0%
within some given dollars and within the
 
03:06:36.650 --> 03:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
budget and not necessarily ask for huge
 
03:06:40.130 --> 03:06:40.140 align:start position:0%
new amounts of dollars so we'll see that
 
03:06:42.590 --> 03:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
play out but we really need to get
 
03:06:44.750 --> 03:06:44.760 align:start position:0%
stakeholder input on where the efforts
 
03:06:47.510 --> 03:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
need to okay fantastic thank you
 
03:06:47.520 --> 03:06:49.309 align:start position:0%
need to okay fantastic thank you
representative

03:06:49.309 --> 03:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:06:52.550 --> 03:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so I was I'd actually
 
03:06:54.830 --> 03:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
read your summary sheet previously and I
 
03:06:56.330 --> 03:06:56.340 align:start position:0%
just went and tied it to the actual
 
03:06:58.849 --> 03:06:58.859 align:start position:0%
10-year plan which has
 
03:07:01.190 --> 03:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
14 recommendations so have you actually
 
03:07:02.929 --> 03:07:02.939 align:start position:0%
made progress on all the recommendations
 
03:07:07.550 --> 03:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:09.410 --> 03:07:09.420 align:start position:0%
yes to some extent yeah that's awesome
 
03:07:11.570 --> 03:07:11.580 align:start position:0%
yeah that's fantastic
 
03:07:15.170 --> 03:07:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:19.070 --> 03:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the legislators
 
03:07:22.929 --> 03:07:22.939 align:start position:0%
uh any final parting thoughts for us
 
03:07:25.550 --> 03:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
just that I really want to give all the
 
03:07:28.130 --> 03:07:28.140 align:start position:0%
credit to our providers and to our
 
03:07:29.630 --> 03:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
communities who have stood up these
 
03:07:31.309 --> 03:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
services and are working every single
 
03:07:34.130 --> 03:07:34.140 align:start position:0%
day to address the needs they're the
 
03:07:35.929 --> 03:07:35.939 align:start position:0%
ones out there doing it we we're the
 
03:07:38.330 --> 03:07:38.340 align:start position:0%
ones who get to be appearing before you
 
03:07:40.130 --> 03:07:40.140 align:start position:0%
and talking about it but I just want to
 
03:07:41.750 --> 03:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
give them credit
 
03:07:45.170 --> 03:07:45.180 align:start position:0%
so do you do you to what extent
 
03:07:48.490 --> 03:07:48.500 align:start position:0%
are you concerned or unconcerned about
 
03:07:52.490 --> 03:07:52.500 align:start position:0%
the the ebbing of the federal money that
 
03:07:54.230 --> 03:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
we've been pumping into the communities
 
03:07:57.889 --> 03:07:57.899 align:start position:0%
to help build out the support systems in
 
03:07:59.690 --> 03:07:59.700 align:start position:0%
the communities and with that money
 
03:08:02.050 --> 03:08:02.060 align:start position:0%
going away
 
03:08:04.849 --> 03:08:04.859 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen to our
 
03:08:07.670 --> 03:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
community-based services do you what do
 
03:08:09.110 --> 03:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
you think about that just general
 
03:08:09.120 --> 03:08:10.790 align:start position:0%
you think about that just general
problem

03:08:10.790 --> 03:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
problem
 
03:08:13.010 --> 03:08:13.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question it's um one
 
03:08:15.889 --> 03:08:15.899 align:start position:0%
that we wanted to address on the front
 
03:08:19.210 --> 03:08:19.220 align:start position:0%
end of receiving those dollars we were
 
03:08:22.490 --> 03:08:22.500 align:start position:0%
given in the fiscal committee approved
 
03:08:24.830 --> 03:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
accepted additional funds for our
 
03:08:26.929 --> 03:08:26.939 align:start position:0%
supplemental block grant dollars which
 
03:08:29.929 --> 03:08:29.939 align:start position:0%
you'll see when it comes into this
 
03:08:33.170 --> 03:08:33.180 align:start position:0%
division we made the decision conscious
 
03:08:36.110 --> 03:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
decision to use those as one-time funds
 
03:08:38.809 --> 03:08:38.819 align:start position:0%
and really invest them in infrastructure
 
03:08:41.929 --> 03:08:41.939 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be ongoing costs so in
 
03:08:43.730 --> 03:08:43.740 align:start position:0%
almost every instance that's where we
 
03:08:47.929 --> 03:08:47.939 align:start position:0%
did we didn't just expand services and
 
03:08:52.010 --> 03:08:52.020 align:start position:0%
with the knowledge that that could be
 
03:08:54.349 --> 03:08:54.359 align:start position:0%
you know that there's an end and we
 
03:08:56.450 --> 03:08:56.460 align:start position:0%
didn't want to have a cliff so we made
 
03:08:59.450 --> 03:08:59.460 align:start position:0%
those as investment dollars
 
03:09:01.550 --> 03:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
that's outstanding that sounds like
 
03:09:03.410 --> 03:09:03.420 align:start position:0%
something I heard the governor say once
 
03:09:04.849 --> 03:09:04.859 align:start position:0%
that we were going to use one-time money
 
03:09:06.590 --> 03:09:06.600 align:start position:0%
for one-time Investments it's really
 
03:09:08.389 --> 03:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
great that it got to the operational
 
03:09:11.150 --> 03:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
level thank you thank you so much
 
03:09:13.309 --> 03:09:13.319 align:start position:0%
okay with that I think we're ready for
 
03:09:17.110 --> 03:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:19.370 --> 03:09:19.380 align:start position:0%
thank you uh you're you're leaving
 
03:09:20.929 --> 03:09:20.939 align:start position:0%
representative hole
 
03:09:23.150 --> 03:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
who did we designate to take your place
 
03:09:28.849 --> 03:09:28.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:32.210 --> 03:09:32.220 align:start position:0%
are you going to watch the video
 
03:09:34.550 --> 03:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
could you could you just augment your
 
03:09:36.170 --> 03:09:36.180 align:start position:0%
notes with what you pick up in the video
 
03:09:38.570 --> 03:09:38.580 align:start position:0%
I don't know that we have a time crunch
 
03:09:41.510 --> 03:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
for turning in arm okay
 
03:09:44.590 --> 03:09:44.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:48.410 --> 03:09:48.420 align:start position:0%

giving us the opportunity to tell you a
 
03:10:04.610 --> 03:10:04.620 align:start position:0%
little bit about what we do we're going
 
03:10:05.750 --> 03:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
to start with talking about New
 
03:10:07.550 --> 03:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital of course but you're
 
03:10:10.670 --> 03:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
receiving two PowerPoint presentations
 
03:10:12.830 --> 03:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
the first is New Hampshire hospital and
 
03:10:15.830 --> 03:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
the second is Glen Cliff home
 
03:10:18.710 --> 03:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
in my role I oversee not only New
 
03:10:20.570 --> 03:10:20.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital but also Glenn Cliff
 
03:10:23.809 --> 03:10:23.819 align:start position:0%
home as well as the 16 bed transitional
 
03:10:26.630 --> 03:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
housing program in the Philbrook
 
03:10:30.190 --> 03:10:30.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:33.710 --> 03:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
and soon to be overseeing once it's
 
03:10:36.290 --> 03:10:36.300 align:start position:0%
built and occupied the New Hampshire
 
03:10:38.389 --> 03:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
forensic Hospital which you'll also hear
 
03:10:40.550 --> 03:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
a little bit about as part of the New
 
03:10:43.670 --> 03:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital presentation
 
03:10:46.790 --> 03:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
so I'll start us off on the first slide
 
03:10:48.710 --> 03:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire hospital just a little
 
03:10:51.830 --> 03:10:51.840 align:start position:0%
bit about who we are we are a secure
 
03:10:54.309 --> 03:10:54.319 align:start position:0%
inpatient psychiatric treatment facility
 
03:10:57.110 --> 03:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
supporting adult citizens who suffer
 
03:10:59.330 --> 03:10:59.340 align:start position:0%
from acute severe and persistent mental
 
03:11:02.870 --> 03:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
illness we do not serve youth or
 
03:11:04.969 --> 03:11:04.979 align:start position:0%
adolescent population at New Hampshire
 
03:11:08.150 --> 03:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
hospital any longer I understand you
 
03:11:10.309 --> 03:11:10.319 align:start position:0%
heard from Hampstead Hospital at some
 
03:11:12.469 --> 03:11:12.479 align:start position:0%
point in the recent history and that is
 
03:11:14.510 --> 03:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
where that population is currently
 
03:11:16.610 --> 03:11:16.620 align:start position:0%
served in the state
 
03:11:18.530 --> 03:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital is the largest
 
03:11:20.330 --> 03:11:20.340 align:start position:0%
psychiatric Treatment Facility in New
 
03:11:22.550 --> 03:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we are equipped to care
 
03:11:24.230 --> 03:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
for the most severely mental ill
 
03:11:26.630 --> 03:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
patients in the state there are six
 
03:11:28.610 --> 03:11:28.620 align:start position:0%
other designated receiving facilities
 
03:11:31.010 --> 03:11:31.020 align:start position:0%
seven actually if you include Hampstead
 
03:11:31.020 --> 03:11:32.050 align:start position:0%
seven actually if you include Hampstead
Hospital

03:11:32.050 --> 03:11:32.060 align:start position:0%
Hospital
 
03:11:35.570 --> 03:11:35.580 align:start position:0%
and the capacity that they have is
 
03:11:39.469 --> 03:11:39.479 align:start position:0%
between 6 to 16 beds so obviously
 
03:11:41.570 --> 03:11:41.580 align:start position:0%
relatively small capacity in comparison
 
03:11:43.429 --> 03:11:43.439 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire hospital
 
03:11:45.469 --> 03:11:45.479 align:start position:0%
our mission at New Hampshire hospital is
 
03:11:47.210 --> 03:11:47.220 align:start position:0%
to help citizens with acute mental
 
03:11:49.429 --> 03:11:49.439 align:start position:0%
illness stabilize their conditions and
 
03:11:51.830 --> 03:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
live their best lives
 
03:11:55.250 --> 03:11:55.260 align:start position:0%
our vision at New Hampshire I'm sorry I
 
03:11:57.230 --> 03:11:57.240 align:start position:0%
think you may have said it but I'm I'm a
 
03:12:00.050 --> 03:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
visual person what does did you tell us
 
03:12:04.490 --> 03:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
what uh your census is designed for and
 
03:12:06.290 --> 03:12:06.300 align:start position:0%
what you're what your current capability
 
03:12:12.650 --> 03:12:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:15.830 --> 03:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
that our current um stuffing our current
 
03:12:18.230 --> 03:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
capacity from a clinical perspective is
 
03:12:21.230 --> 03:12:21.240 align:start position:0%
to serve adults with severe and
 
03:12:23.330 --> 03:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
persistent mental illness in the state
 
03:12:26.510 --> 03:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
and I'll talk more about our capacity as
 
03:12:28.429 --> 03:12:28.439 align:start position:0%
well as our Staffing Resources as we
 
03:12:30.469 --> 03:12:30.479 align:start position:0%
move forward okay
 
03:12:32.210 --> 03:12:32.220 align:start position:0%
um so not to read to you the entire
 
03:12:34.610 --> 03:12:34.620 align:start position:0%
vision statement but please know that
 
03:12:36.530 --> 03:12:36.540 align:start position:0%
our vision statement is important to us
 
03:12:39.050 --> 03:12:39.060 align:start position:0%
and part of our vision statement has to
 
03:12:41.809 --> 03:12:41.819 align:start position:0%
do with supporting our staff and really
 
03:12:45.170 --> 03:12:45.180 align:start position:0%
wanting to be an employer of choice to
 
03:12:48.830 --> 03:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
be able to attract and maintain Staffing
 
03:12:51.170 --> 03:12:51.180 align:start position:0%
numbers that can help support this
 
03:12:53.750 --> 03:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
significant level of care our core
 
03:12:56.330 --> 03:12:56.340 align:start position:0%
values of course are also very embedded
 
03:12:58.190 --> 03:12:58.200 align:start position:0%
in the work that we do you can see those
 
03:13:02.150 --> 03:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
here on that slide and we really take
 
03:13:05.330 --> 03:13:05.340 align:start position:0%
those into account when we're making a
 
03:13:07.790 --> 03:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
hospital-wide decisions in how we care
 
03:13:10.910 --> 03:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:12.349 --> 03:13:12.359 align:start position:0%
um so here's the slide that talks a
 
03:13:13.790 --> 03:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
little bit more about New Hampshire
 
03:13:17.030 --> 03:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
hospital staff in current state there
 
03:13:17.040 --> 03:13:17.769 align:start position:0%
hospital staff in current state there
are

03:13:17.769 --> 03:13:17.779 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:13:23.090 --> 03:13:23.100 align:start position:0%
733 total staff members of which 624 of
 
03:13:25.910 --> 03:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
them are New Hampshire hospital or state
 
03:13:28.969 --> 03:13:28.979 align:start position:0%
staff members state employees of Cindy
 
03:13:32.630 --> 03:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
and I being two of them and 109 of them
 
03:13:35.750 --> 03:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
are Dartmouth or other agency staff
 
03:13:40.150 --> 03:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
members so Dartmouth is our clinical
 
03:13:43.670 --> 03:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
provider contract provider and they
 
03:13:47.389 --> 03:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
serve in the capacity of all of the MDS
 
03:13:49.610 --> 03:13:49.620 align:start position:0%
that are providing patient care at New
 
03:13:52.370 --> 03:13:52.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital so all of the
 
03:13:52.380 --> 03:13:53.710 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital so all of the
um

03:13:53.710 --> 03:13:53.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:56.990 --> 03:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
psychologists all of the family medicine
 
03:14:00.230 --> 03:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
and clinical practice doctors all of
 
03:14:02.269 --> 03:14:02.279 align:start position:0%
them are Dartmouth employees
 
03:14:05.870 --> 03:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
state employees can be made up of some
 
03:14:08.269 --> 03:14:08.279 align:start position:0%
aprns we have some medical aprns that
 
03:14:10.250 --> 03:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
are state employees but the remainder of
 
03:14:13.070 --> 03:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
the aprns are also also Dartmouth
 
03:14:15.290 --> 03:14:15.300 align:start position:0%
employees so that's why you see such a
 
03:14:19.070 --> 03:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
high number of Dartmouth employees but
 
03:14:21.110 --> 03:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
one thing that we're really proud of is
 
03:14:23.870 --> 03:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
how seamlessly the two organizations
 
03:14:26.090 --> 03:14:26.100 align:start position:0%
work together to provide patient care
 
03:14:29.150 --> 03:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
and our medical director his name is at
 
03:14:31.550 --> 03:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the slide here Dr Jeff
 
03:14:34.130 --> 03:14:34.140 align:start position:0%
Federer he is also a Dartmouth employee
 
03:14:37.370 --> 03:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
but he serves as an executive team
 
03:14:39.469 --> 03:14:39.479 align:start position:0%
member at New Hampshire hospital so
 
03:14:41.570 --> 03:14:41.580 align:start position:0%
they're represented at that layer as
 
03:14:44.570 --> 03:14:44.580 align:start position:0%
well so I don't think any of us can help
 
03:14:46.490 --> 03:14:46.500 align:start position:0%
but to look at a staff number these days
 
03:14:49.010 --> 03:14:49.020 align:start position:0%
and immediately wonder what the vacancy
 
03:14:51.230 --> 03:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
rate is sure thank you for that question
 
03:14:53.990 --> 03:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
so we do have some significant vacancy
 
03:14:56.570 --> 03:14:56.580 align:start position:0%
rates throughout the hospital our most
 
03:14:58.370 --> 03:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
significant which is actually on an
 
03:15:01.610 --> 03:15:01.620 align:start position:0%
upcoming slide in a moment in terms of
 
03:15:04.190 --> 03:15:04.200 align:start position:0%
some of our barriers at the hospital our
 
03:15:07.309 --> 03:15:07.319 align:start position:0%
social workers which Cindy oversees as
 
03:15:11.150 --> 03:15:11.160 align:start position:0%
well as RNs we have thankfully slowly
 
03:15:13.550 --> 03:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
been able to make some slight progress
 
03:15:16.070 --> 03:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
in terms of registered nurses However
 
03:15:19.130 --> 03:15:19.140 align:start position:0%
unfortunately with social workers that
 
03:15:20.929 --> 03:15:20.939 align:start position:0%
has not been the case and it's actually
 
03:15:23.450 --> 03:15:23.460 align:start position:0%
gone in the wrong direction for several
 
03:15:25.969 --> 03:15:25.979 align:start position:0%
factors some of them being vitally
 
03:15:28.070 --> 03:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
important increase Community Health
 
03:15:30.650 --> 03:15:30.660 align:start position:0%
needs throughout the state such as in
 
03:15:32.990 --> 03:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
the school systems we've had some
 
03:15:35.630 --> 03:15:35.640 align:start position:0%
employees leave to go to other areas of
 
03:15:38.690 --> 03:15:38.700 align:start position:0%
service to meet mental health needs but
 
03:15:40.670 --> 03:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
of course that's impacted us at New
 
03:15:42.530 --> 03:15:42.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital which is significant
 
03:15:45.950 --> 03:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
in many ways because the social workers
 
03:15:47.929 --> 03:15:47.939 align:start position:0%
are really the ones that create
 
03:15:49.790 --> 03:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
discharge plans
 
03:15:52.610 --> 03:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
a number for vacancy rate vacancy rates
 
03:15:55.670 --> 03:15:55.680 align:start position:0%
for nurses is about 45 percent currently
 
03:15:58.910 --> 03:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
vacancy rates for social workers Cindy
 
03:16:00.790 --> 03:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
65 percent
 
03:16:06.050 --> 03:16:06.060 align:start position:0%
you are at a 55 vacancy rate for social
 
03:16:10.610 --> 03:16:10.620 align:start position:0%
workers 65 65 vacancy so that means you
 
03:16:12.410 --> 03:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
don't you barely have a third of your
 
03:16:14.570 --> 03:16:14.580 align:start position:0%
social workers correct
 
03:16:14.580 --> 03:16:16.730 align:start position:0%
social workers correct
couch

03:16:16.730 --> 03:16:16.740 align:start position:0%
couch
 
03:16:20.710 --> 03:16:20.720 align:start position:0%
okay so in terms of the clinical teams
 
03:16:24.290 --> 03:16:24.300 align:start position:0%
who are providing direct patient care
 
03:16:26.929 --> 03:16:26.939 align:start position:0%
you can see some of the professions that
 
03:16:30.250 --> 03:16:30.260 align:start position:0%
are listed on there RNS what we call
 
03:16:32.990 --> 03:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
mhws or mental health workers social
 
03:16:35.690 --> 03:16:35.700 align:start position:0%
workers psychiatric practitioners and of
 
03:16:38.510 --> 03:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
course we also have rehab staff members
 
03:16:42.110 --> 03:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
inclusive of Occupational therapists
 
03:16:44.990 --> 03:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
um and other other disciplines then of
 
03:16:47.150 --> 03:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
course we have both clinical and
 
03:16:49.250 --> 03:16:49.260 align:start position:0%
operational teams you can see there are
 
03:16:51.410 --> 03:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
several departments listed there we do
 
03:16:53.210 --> 03:16:53.220 align:start position:0%
have vacancies in these other
 
03:16:55.670 --> 03:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
departments as well but not nearly as
 
03:16:57.830 --> 03:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
significant as the two disciplines that
 
03:16:59.990 --> 03:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
we just spoke about
 
03:17:01.490 --> 03:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
um at the bottom of this slide you can
 
03:17:03.590 --> 03:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
see the executive team myself at the
 
03:17:05.630 --> 03:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
very bottom as the chief executive
 
03:17:08.630 --> 03:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
officer Cindy is also on that team and
 
03:17:10.010 --> 03:17:10.020 align:start position:0%
then there's just some additional names
 
03:17:13.070 --> 03:17:13.080 align:start position:0%
on there for you if you needed to
 
03:17:14.870 --> 03:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
contact anyone at the hospital you would
 
03:17:20.450 --> 03:17:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:22.490 --> 03:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
um the next slide just speaks to the
 
03:17:24.650 --> 03:17:24.660 align:start position:0%
delivery system of the inpatient mental
 
03:17:27.050 --> 03:17:27.060 align:start position:0%
health care system in the state of New
 
03:17:29.929 --> 03:17:29.939 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for serious mental illness we
 
03:17:31.429 --> 03:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
don't have to go through it and find
 
03:17:33.710 --> 03:17:33.720 align:start position:0%
detail but of course you can see a
 
03:17:36.190 --> 03:17:36.200 align:start position:0%
citizen might be experiencing a concern
 
03:17:39.290 --> 03:17:39.300 align:start position:0%
and they go to an emergency room and
 
03:17:41.450 --> 03:17:41.460 align:start position:0%
they can get sent to let's say Hampstead
 
03:17:44.450 --> 03:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
Hospital if they meet criteria for there
 
03:17:46.849 --> 03:17:46.859 align:start position:0%
another designated receiving facility
 
03:17:49.250 --> 03:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
which I spoke about briefly or New
 
03:17:51.410 --> 03:17:51.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital and then you can also
 
03:17:54.410 --> 03:17:54.420 align:start position:0%
see the additional branches that folks
 
03:17:57.050 --> 03:17:57.060 align:start position:0%
end up being sent to from these
 
03:17:57.060 --> 03:18:01.910 align:start position:0%
end up being sent to from these
locations

03:18:01.910 --> 03:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:03.469 --> 03:18:03.479 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to talk a little bit about
 
03:18:05.510 --> 03:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
census before I hand it over to Cindy
 
03:18:07.849 --> 03:18:07.859 align:start position:0%
for the next couple of slides our
 
03:18:09.830 --> 03:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
current total building capacity for
 
03:18:14.389 --> 03:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
patients is 185. we have 31 beds offline
 
03:18:16.490 --> 03:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
due to the workforce shortage which we
 
03:18:19.730 --> 03:18:19.740 align:start position:0%
meant mentioned moments ago our current
 
03:18:24.050 --> 03:18:24.060 align:start position:0%
adjusted capacity is 154 that fluctuates
 
03:18:26.150 --> 03:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
slightly related to covid we're coming
 
03:18:29.389 --> 03:18:29.399 align:start position:0%
out of a covid concern currently so we
 
03:18:32.570 --> 03:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
are closer to 150 as of today but we
 
03:18:35.210 --> 03:18:35.220 align:start position:0%
work very hard at maintaining as high of
 
03:18:37.370 --> 03:18:37.380 align:start position:0%
a census as possible to make sure that
 
03:18:39.469 --> 03:18:39.479 align:start position:0%
some of those throughput concerns which
 
03:18:41.750 --> 03:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
we've already talked about are being
 
03:18:44.210 --> 03:18:44.220 align:start position:0%
addressed to the best of our ability we
 
03:18:46.190 --> 03:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
of course continue to prioritize our
 
03:18:47.929 --> 03:18:47.939 align:start position:0%
efforts not only to increase our
 
03:18:50.150 --> 03:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
staffing but also to ensure we're using
 
03:18:52.070 --> 03:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
our resources to the best of our ability
 
03:18:54.590 --> 03:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
in an attempt to bring additional beds
 
03:18:58.490 --> 03:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
back online early in January we were at
 
03:19:02.830 --> 03:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
a capacity of 145 and we move moved to
 
03:19:05.929 --> 03:19:05.939 align:start position:0%
154 that wasn't because we had a
 
03:19:08.330 --> 03:19:08.340 align:start position:0%
significant influx of Staff but that was
 
03:19:11.269 --> 03:19:11.279 align:start position:0%
because we really Dove deeply to look at
 
03:19:13.849 --> 03:19:13.859 align:start position:0%
the resources that we had and how they
 
03:19:15.230 --> 03:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
were being utilized throughout the
 
03:19:17.809 --> 03:19:17.819 align:start position:0%
hospital and through that decision
 
03:19:19.610 --> 03:19:19.620 align:start position:0%
making we were able to bring those nine
 
03:19:22.010 --> 03:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
additional beds back online and be able
 
03:19:23.990 --> 03:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
to use our resources in a way that could
 
03:19:25.910 --> 03:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
safely support that
 
03:19:28.610 --> 03:19:28.620 align:start position:0%
we continue to try to make every effort
 
03:19:30.469 --> 03:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
but of course we don't want to
 
03:19:33.590 --> 03:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
compromise safety in any way as well so
 
03:19:36.110 --> 03:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry it just seems to me like
 
03:19:38.210 --> 03:19:38.220 align:start position:0%
something has got to give right if you
 
03:19:41.090 --> 03:19:41.100 align:start position:0%
if you if you're dealing with
 
03:19:43.610 --> 03:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
um you've only closed off somewhere
 
03:19:45.469 --> 03:19:45.479 align:start position:0%
around 20 percent of your beds you're
 
03:19:47.450 --> 03:19:47.460 align:start position:0%
dealing with vacancy rates depending on
 
03:19:47.460 --> 03:19:48.230 align:start position:0%
dealing with vacancy rates depending on
the

03:19:48.230 --> 03:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:19:52.370 --> 03:19:52.380 align:start position:0%
skill set of 45 to 65 percent that's a
 
03:19:54.290 --> 03:19:54.300 align:start position:0%
huge vacancy rate
 
03:19:57.349 --> 03:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
so so if the the bed count is high and
 
03:20:01.070 --> 03:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
the Staffing is low you one would wonder
 
03:20:03.830 --> 03:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
about quality are we starting to we've
 
03:20:06.290 --> 03:20:06.300 align:start position:0%
got to see some quality issues if we
 
03:20:10.010 --> 03:20:10.020 align:start position:0%
don't have the prescribed Staffing level
 
03:20:14.150 --> 03:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
for a staff to bet what to talk to us
 
03:20:15.830 --> 03:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
about that sure thank you for that
 
03:20:18.950 --> 03:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
question so I feel from a clinical
 
03:20:22.309 --> 03:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
perspective we have you know with the
 
03:20:23.870 --> 03:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
nurses and mental health workers and the
 
03:20:25.610 --> 03:20:25.620 align:start position:0%
clinical team members that I mentioned
 
03:20:28.490 --> 03:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
we have people who are very dedicated to
 
03:20:31.070 --> 03:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
the safety of the patients and really
 
03:20:32.990 --> 03:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
paying attention we have a daily safety
 
03:20:36.050 --> 03:20:36.060 align:start position:0%
huddle every morning during the week to
 
03:20:38.150 --> 03:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
talk about any safety concerns as
 
03:20:39.590 --> 03:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
they're being presented throughout the
 
03:20:41.809 --> 03:20:41.819 align:start position:0%
hospital all of the executive team
 
03:20:44.389 --> 03:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
participates in that in terms of some of
 
03:20:46.429 --> 03:20:46.439 align:start position:0%
the areas that we are seeing more
 
03:20:48.290 --> 03:20:48.300 align:start position:0%
significant concerns related to these
 
03:20:50.510 --> 03:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
vacancies we'll talk about in a minute
 
03:20:52.730 --> 03:20:52.740 align:start position:0%
in terms of some of our barriers to
 
03:20:56.990 --> 03:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
discharge I would say that our vacancies
 
03:20:59.690 --> 03:20:59.700 align:start position:0%
directly relate to some of the barriers
 
03:21:01.309 --> 03:21:01.319 align:start position:0%
that we're having to be able to move
 
03:21:03.469 --> 03:21:03.479 align:start position:0%
patients out of New Hampshire hospital
 
03:21:06.170 --> 03:21:06.180 align:start position:0%
into another level of care either a step
 
03:21:08.690 --> 03:21:08.700 align:start position:0%
down or into the community to be able to
 
03:21:10.910 --> 03:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
be a community a member of their
 
03:21:12.070 --> 03:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
Community again
 
03:21:15.290 --> 03:21:15.300 align:start position:0%
so you know in terms of clinical quality
 
03:21:17.450 --> 03:21:17.460 align:start position:0%
we are joint commission accredited we
 
03:21:19.969 --> 03:21:19.979 align:start position:0%
work as you know extremely hard in the
 
03:21:21.710 --> 03:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
safety and care of the patients I don't
 
03:21:23.450 --> 03:21:23.460 align:start position:0%
feel like we've seen significant
 
03:21:26.410 --> 03:21:26.420 align:start position:0%
clinical quality concerns
 
03:21:29.870 --> 03:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
or thankfully an increase in staff
 
03:21:32.389 --> 03:21:32.399 align:start position:0%
injuries or things of that nature but I
 
03:21:32.399 --> 03:21:33.110 align:start position:0%
injuries or things of that nature but I
am

03:21:33.110 --> 03:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
am
 
03:21:35.510 --> 03:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
fearful in that if we aren't able to
 
03:21:37.849 --> 03:21:37.859 align:start position:0%
make some Headway in some of these areas
 
03:21:40.969 --> 03:21:40.979 align:start position:0%
of Staffing that that is a could be a
 
03:21:43.010 --> 03:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
reality that none of us want to face
 
03:21:45.650 --> 03:21:45.660 align:start position:0%
sure so the other way that could present
 
03:21:49.370 --> 03:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
if it's not a quality issue is on a
 
03:21:53.269 --> 03:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
um a length of stay issue so are you
 
03:21:55.429 --> 03:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
because of the staffing issues do you
 
03:21:58.010 --> 03:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
see pressure on increased length of stay
 
03:21:59.750 --> 03:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
as a result
 
03:22:03.230 --> 03:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
yeah um I'll I'll let so we have a slide
 
03:22:04.969 --> 03:22:04.979 align:start position:0%
about that in a moment
 
03:22:09.769 --> 03:22:09.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:13.309 --> 03:22:13.319 align:start position:0%
representative Waller so are you using a
 
03:22:16.429 --> 03:22:16.439 align:start position:0%
lot of overtime yes we're using a lot of
 
03:22:18.590 --> 03:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
overtime for nurses and mental health
 
03:22:21.050 --> 03:22:21.060 align:start position:0%
workers and social workers uh in
 
03:22:23.630 --> 03:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
particular yes we also have agency Staff
 
03:22:25.429 --> 03:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
Agency nurses
 
03:22:28.429 --> 03:22:28.439 align:start position:0%
um in the facility we recently adjusted
 
03:22:30.889 --> 03:22:30.899 align:start position:0%
we got some feedback from the nursing
 
03:22:34.070 --> 03:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
staff our chief nursing officer Rosie
 
03:22:37.610 --> 03:22:37.620 align:start position:0%
did a really thorough review at what you
 
03:22:38.990 --> 03:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
know what what would make her nurses
 
03:22:41.269 --> 03:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
happy right what what makes you stay how
 
03:22:43.070 --> 03:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
can we help support you better so
 
03:22:45.650 --> 03:22:45.660 align:start position:0%
through that there was a change in their
 
03:22:48.469 --> 03:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
hours and their shifts that has yielded
 
03:22:50.330 --> 03:22:50.340 align:start position:0%
some positive results as far as
 
03:22:53.090 --> 03:22:53.100 align:start position:0%
retention and even recruitment for us
 
03:22:56.269 --> 03:22:56.279 align:start position:0%
but that only goes so far
 
03:22:58.670 --> 03:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
could I have a follow-up
 
03:23:01.070 --> 03:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
um how many agency nurses are you using
 
03:23:02.690 --> 03:23:02.700 align:start position:0%
at this point I think currently I don't
 
03:23:04.490 --> 03:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
have the exact number but I believe it's
 
03:23:07.370 --> 03:23:07.380 align:start position:0%
close to 18.
 
03:23:10.130 --> 03:23:10.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:12.170 --> 03:23:12.180 align:start position:0%
um so some of this we already talked
 
03:23:14.090 --> 03:23:14.100 align:start position:0%
about and I know um you just had some
 
03:23:16.729 --> 03:23:16.739 align:start position:0%
questions that we will get to in these
 
03:23:19.130 --> 03:23:19.140 align:start position:0%
next couple of slides so
 
03:23:22.070 --> 03:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
um Cindy why don't you take it away
 
03:23:24.170 --> 03:23:24.180 align:start position:0%
so again I'm Cindy I'm the Social Work
 
03:23:25.550 --> 03:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
Director at New Hampshire hospital I've
 
03:23:28.130 --> 03:23:28.140 align:start position:0%
been there 22 years so I've seen a lot
 
03:23:31.250 --> 03:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
of change over time bringing us to where
 
03:23:33.170 --> 03:23:33.180 align:start position:0%
we are today
 
03:23:33.180 --> 03:23:33.889 align:start position:0%
we are today
um

03:23:33.889 --> 03:23:33.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:36.530 --> 03:23:36.540 align:start position:0%
just to kind of Orient you to admissions
 
03:23:38.630 --> 03:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
at New Hampshire hospital virtually all
 
03:23:41.330 --> 03:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
of our admissions are involuntary as the
 
03:23:42.950 --> 03:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
patients have been deemed too dangerous
 
03:23:45.530 --> 03:23:45.540 align:start position:0%
for other settings
 
03:23:45.540 --> 03:23:46.490 align:start position:0%
for other settings
um

03:23:46.490 --> 03:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:48.410 --> 03:23:48.420 align:start position:0%
we primarily accept patients from
 
03:23:49.790 --> 03:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
hospital emergency departments
 
03:23:52.250 --> 03:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
throughout the state via iaea petition
 
03:23:54.469 --> 03:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
we also occasionally accept patients
 
03:23:56.870 --> 03:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
from County jails in the spu secure
 
03:23:58.269 --> 03:23:58.279 align:start position:0%
psychiatric unit
 
03:24:01.309 --> 03:24:01.319 align:start position:0%
by Statute we do not accept patients who
 
03:24:02.990 --> 03:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
are dangerous due to substance use
 
03:24:05.050 --> 03:24:05.060 align:start position:0%
disorder or intellectual disability
 
03:24:08.090 --> 03:24:08.100 align:start position:0%
however a lot of patients with mental
 
03:24:10.429 --> 03:24:10.439 align:start position:0%
illness have co-occurring disorders so a
 
03:24:11.510 --> 03:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
lot of the folks at New Hampshire
 
03:24:13.309 --> 03:24:13.319 align:start position:0%
hospital also are dealing with those
 
03:24:13.319 --> 03:24:15.410 align:start position:0%
hospital also are dealing with those
challenges

03:24:15.410 --> 03:24:15.420 align:start position:0%
challenges
 
03:24:17.450 --> 03:24:17.460 align:start position:0%
um while designated receiving facilities
 
03:24:20.030 --> 03:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
are able to accept iea admissions they
 
03:24:21.950 --> 03:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
defer to New Hampshire hospital for the
 
03:24:28.490 --> 03:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:30.710 --> 03:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
barriers to discharge
 
03:24:33.530 --> 03:24:33.540 align:start position:0%
in 2022 the monthly average number of
 
03:24:33.540 --> 03:24:34.610 align:start position:0%
in 2022 the monthly average number of
patients

03:24:34.610 --> 03:24:34.620 align:start position:0%
patients
 
03:24:36.889 --> 03:24:36.899 align:start position:0%
stable and awaiting discharge for
 
03:24:40.190 --> 03:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
greater than 15 days was 62. so every
 
03:24:42.170 --> 03:24:42.180 align:start position:0%
month that average number of patients
 
03:24:45.170 --> 03:24:45.180 align:start position:0%
who we are treatment teams deemed no
 
03:24:47.330 --> 03:24:47.340 align:start position:0%
longer requiring New Hampshire hospital
 
03:24:51.830 --> 03:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
level of care the average number was 62.
 
03:24:54.410 --> 03:24:54.420 align:start position:0%
so the lowest month was 57 the highest
 
03:24:56.269 --> 03:24:56.279 align:start position:0%
was 72.
 
03:24:58.550 --> 03:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
these numbers adequately represent data
 
03:25:01.130 --> 03:25:01.140 align:start position:0%
going back prior to 2018 which is when I
 
03:25:03.170 --> 03:25:03.180 align:start position:0%
started collecting the data
 
03:25:05.870 --> 03:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
so pre-covered
 
03:25:07.550 --> 03:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
the number of patients awaiting
 
03:25:09.710 --> 03:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
discharge has consistently exceeded the
 
03:25:11.290 --> 03:25:11.300 align:start position:0%
number of patients awaiting admission
 
03:25:14.330 --> 03:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
commonly known as the queue
 
03:25:16.670 --> 03:25:16.680 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm just a little slow at a
 
03:25:18.769 --> 03:25:18.779 align:start position:0%
connection mental dots
 
03:25:22.630 --> 03:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
is okay with an adjusted capacity of 154
 
03:25:25.610 --> 03:25:25.620 align:start position:0%
and the number of patients that are
 
03:25:28.370 --> 03:25:28.380 align:start position:0%
stable and just awaiting discharge
 
03:25:30.710 --> 03:25:30.720 align:start position:0%
issues of 62
 
03:25:34.790 --> 03:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
does does that imply a simple math a 154
 
03:25:37.790 --> 03:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
minus 62 yes you get something in the
 
03:25:40.130 --> 03:25:40.140 align:start position:0%
90s for those who are being actively
 
03:25:42.650 --> 03:25:42.660 align:start position:0%
treated and the rest are you know
 
03:25:47.090 --> 03:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
basically being given room and board
 
03:25:49.969 --> 03:25:49.979 align:start position:0%
yes okay well thank you for letting me
 
03:25:52.429 --> 03:25:52.439 align:start position:0%
just say it plainly
 
03:25:54.050 --> 03:25:54.060 align:start position:0%
um the vast majority of stable patients
 
03:25:55.670 --> 03:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
awaiting discharge are awaiting
 
03:25:57.530 --> 03:25:57.540 align:start position:0%
long-term placement in supported
 
03:26:00.710 --> 03:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
residential settings as they are two at
 
03:26:02.630 --> 03:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
Baseline when they're as well as they're
 
03:26:05.450 --> 03:26:05.460 align:start position:0%
going to be they're unable to remain
 
03:26:07.849 --> 03:26:07.859 align:start position:0%
stable in independent settings even with
 
03:26:09.469 --> 03:26:09.479 align:start position:0%
the most intensive outpatient support
 
03:26:11.210 --> 03:26:11.220 align:start position:0%
provided by the Community Mental Health
 
03:26:14.570 --> 03:26:14.580 align:start position:0%
Center so we have folks who you know
 
03:26:17.150 --> 03:26:17.160 align:start position:0%
even with the the right medications are
 
03:26:19.250 --> 03:26:19.260 align:start position:0%
still going to require a certain level
 
03:26:22.130 --> 03:26:22.140 align:start position:0%
of supervision in the community 24-hour
 
03:26:24.229 --> 03:26:24.239 align:start position:0%
supervision such as a community
 
03:26:27.010 --> 03:26:27.020 align:start position:0%
residence a licensed nursing home
 
03:26:30.370 --> 03:26:30.380 align:start position:0%
assisted living facility
 
03:26:32.990 --> 03:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
the following are types of supported
 
03:26:35.809 --> 03:26:35.819 align:start position:0%
housing that exist but are very limited
 
03:26:37.729 --> 03:26:37.739 align:start position:0%
and it creates wait times that are
 
03:26:39.550 --> 03:26:39.560 align:start position:0%
several months or longer
 
03:26:42.650 --> 03:26:42.660 align:start position:0%
as I previously said 24-hour supervised
 
03:26:44.090 --> 03:26:44.100 align:start position:0%
mental health housing such as Community
 
03:26:46.370 --> 03:26:46.380 align:start position:0%
residents or what some people refer to
 
03:26:48.830 --> 03:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
as transitional housing nursing home and
 
03:26:51.469 --> 03:26:51.479 align:start position:0%
assisted living beds and specialized in
 
03:26:52.910 --> 03:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
supervised housing for people with
 
03:26:56.750 --> 03:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:59.389 --> 03:26:59.399 align:start position:0%
and to just to get back to your question
 
03:27:01.190 --> 03:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
about the impact of the Staffing
 
03:27:03.830 --> 03:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
shortage on discharge planning in
 
03:27:06.229 --> 03:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
particular the the resources in the
 
03:27:07.790 --> 03:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
community are very limited New Hampshire
 
03:27:09.710 --> 03:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
hospital has
 
03:27:11.510 --> 03:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
what should be a large social work
 
03:27:13.309 --> 03:27:13.319 align:start position:0%
department because it requires social
 
03:27:16.070 --> 03:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
workers to find the right resources for
 
03:27:18.110 --> 03:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
these folks in the community and when
 
03:27:19.849 --> 03:27:19.859 align:start position:0%
the resources are so limited you really
 
03:27:22.130 --> 03:27:22.140 align:start position:0%
need to be Johnny on the spot when the
 
03:27:23.510 --> 03:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
bed comes up
 
03:27:25.550 --> 03:27:25.560 align:start position:0%
and so I don't you're not as much Johnny
 
03:27:28.910 --> 03:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
on the spot if you have 13 cases instead
 
03:27:31.010 --> 03:27:31.020 align:start position:0%
of six
 
03:27:32.690 --> 03:27:32.700 align:start position:0%
um and that's where we're edging up
 
03:27:34.370 --> 03:27:34.380 align:start position:0%
towards I since I've been at the
 
03:27:35.990 --> 03:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
hospital most of my career has been in
 
03:27:38.809 --> 03:27:38.819 align:start position:0%
Direct Care doing the discharge planning
 
03:27:40.670 --> 03:27:40.680 align:start position:0%
six patients is about what you should
 
03:27:43.610 --> 03:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
have as a social worker at New Hampshire
 
03:27:45.229 --> 03:27:45.239 align:start position:0%
hospital these are the most dangerous
 
03:27:46.969 --> 03:27:46.979 align:start position:0%
people in the state with mental illness
 
03:27:49.309 --> 03:27:49.319 align:start position:0%
they need a lot of support they need a
 
03:27:51.710 --> 03:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
lot of good critical thinking and
 
03:27:53.570 --> 03:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
professionalism and understanding of the
 
03:27:53.580 --> 03:27:55.190 align:start position:0%
professionalism and understanding of the
systems

03:27:55.190 --> 03:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
systems
 
03:27:55.200 --> 03:27:55.729 align:start position:0%
systems
um

03:27:55.729 --> 03:27:55.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:58.010 --> 03:27:58.020 align:start position:0%
so our caseloads going higher and higher
 
03:27:59.570 --> 03:27:59.580 align:start position:0%
slows down
 
03:28:02.030 --> 03:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
the frequency that we can call all of
 
03:28:03.830 --> 03:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
these places in the community you know
 
03:28:05.929 --> 03:28:05.939 align:start position:0%
instead of calling every day to say do
 
03:28:07.070 --> 03:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
you have a bed do you have a bed do you
 
03:28:08.990 --> 03:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
have a bed it's maybe every few days
 
03:28:11.389 --> 03:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
that you can make that call and it's
 
03:28:14.349 --> 03:28:14.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:17.510 --> 03:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
so I'm trying to imagine a average day
 
03:28:19.550 --> 03:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
in the life of a New Hampshire hospital
 
03:28:24.849 --> 03:28:24.859 align:start position:0%
social worker with a a patient count of
 
03:28:27.830 --> 03:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
13. does that mean every day there's
 
03:28:30.530 --> 03:28:30.540 align:start position:0%
they need to spend some at least one
 
03:28:34.190 --> 03:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
unit of time with each patient
 
03:28:36.769 --> 03:28:36.779 align:start position:0%
during that day they're they're spending
 
03:28:38.809 --> 03:28:38.819 align:start position:0%
some time every day with every patient
 
03:28:41.150 --> 03:28:41.160 align:start position:0%
under their charge
 
03:28:43.010 --> 03:28:43.020 align:start position:0%
that would be ideal but it doesn't
 
03:28:45.410 --> 03:28:45.420 align:start position:0%
that's not practically how it ends up
 
03:28:47.870 --> 03:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
working out because 13 is a big number
 
03:28:51.229 --> 03:28:51.239 align:start position:0%
13's too many so and and then when
 
03:28:53.389 --> 03:28:53.399 align:start position:0%
they're not interacting directly with a
 
03:28:56.450 --> 03:28:56.460 align:start position:0%
patient it sounds like they're
 
03:28:58.450 --> 03:28:58.460 align:start position:0%
attempting to coordinate
 
03:29:01.550 --> 03:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
the services the social determinants of
 
03:29:03.590 --> 03:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
Health kinds of things exactly we're
 
03:29:05.990 --> 03:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
finding housing we're referring to group
 
03:29:08.510 --> 03:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
homes we're calling the landlord to say
 
03:29:10.370 --> 03:29:10.380 align:start position:0%
please don't evict them we will pay your
 
03:29:12.050 --> 03:29:12.060 align:start position:0%
back rent for three months just so that
 
03:29:13.429 --> 03:29:13.439 align:start position:0%
you don't evict them so they have a
 
03:29:15.530 --> 03:29:15.540 align:start position:0%
place to go when they leave we're
 
03:29:16.729 --> 03:29:16.739 align:start position:0%
calling the Community Mental Health
 
03:29:18.889 --> 03:29:18.899 align:start position:0%
Center to say hey please come in and
 
03:29:21.229 --> 03:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
visit your patient so that you can see
 
03:29:22.790 --> 03:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
that they're doing well we're updating
 
03:29:24.410 --> 03:29:24.420 align:start position:0%
them on how their patients are doing
 
03:29:26.630 --> 03:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
while they're in the hospital we're
 
03:29:28.550 --> 03:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
coordinating with those outpatient teams
 
03:29:31.130 --> 03:29:31.140 align:start position:0%
to set up all of the appointments that
 
03:29:34.370 --> 03:29:34.380 align:start position:0%
the patient needs you know to help make
 
03:29:35.990 --> 03:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
those recommendations that this person
 
03:29:37.729 --> 03:29:37.739 align:start position:0%
may need an act team they may need daily
 
03:29:39.830 --> 03:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
Med monitoring we're drafting their
 
03:29:41.809 --> 03:29:41.819 align:start position:0%
conditions for discharge we're making
 
03:29:44.389 --> 03:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
referrals for guardianships we're making
 
03:29:46.429 --> 03:29:46.439 align:start position:0%
referrals for probate commitments we're
 
03:29:49.130 --> 03:29:49.140 align:start position:0%
calling defense attorneys to work out
 
03:29:50.990 --> 03:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
whatever legal problems are getting in
 
03:29:53.030 --> 03:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
the way of their discharge or the AG's
 
03:29:55.370 --> 03:29:55.380 align:start position:0%
office to say hey we're letting you know
 
03:29:56.870 --> 03:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
this person that you said we have to
 
03:29:59.150 --> 03:29:59.160 align:start position:0%
notify you about when they leave is
 
03:29:59.160 --> 03:30:00.950 align:start position:0%
notify you about when they leave is
leaving

03:30:00.950 --> 03:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
leaving
 
03:30:04.670 --> 03:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
okay so how's morale I I gotta imagine
 
03:30:07.729 --> 03:30:07.739 align:start position:0%
in an environment where people are just
 
03:30:09.950 --> 03:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
really wanting to help and that they're
 
03:30:09.960 --> 03:30:11.150 align:start position:0%
really wanting to help and that they're
facing

03:30:11.150 --> 03:30:11.160 align:start position:0%
facing
 
03:30:14.870 --> 03:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
these sort of daily burdens morale's got
 
03:30:18.170 --> 03:30:18.180 align:start position:0%
to be suffering what what how would you
 
03:30:20.510 --> 03:30:20.520 align:start position:0%
characterize morale how would you what
 
03:30:23.590 --> 03:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
are you doing to ameliorate it and and
 
03:30:26.870 --> 03:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
because the big thing you need is just
 
03:30:29.210 --> 03:30:29.220 align:start position:0%
more people right but but until then
 
03:30:31.610 --> 03:30:31.620 align:start position:0%
what are you doing
 
03:30:34.670 --> 03:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
I am reinforcing that patient care is
 
03:30:36.469 --> 03:30:36.479 align:start position:0%
first and foremost and quality of care
 
03:30:38.510 --> 03:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
is first and foremost and so if it takes
 
03:30:41.690 --> 03:30:41.700 align:start position:0%
you an extra 24 or 48 hours to make that
 
03:30:43.490 --> 03:30:43.500 align:start position:0%
safe discharge plan happen then that's
 
03:30:45.650 --> 03:30:45.660 align:start position:0%
what you need to do because what really
 
03:30:48.530 --> 03:30:48.540 align:start position:0%
hits us the hardest with morale is when
 
03:30:50.510 --> 03:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
we set up a discharge plan that fails
 
03:30:52.070 --> 03:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
and someone doesn't do well when they
 
03:30:54.530 --> 03:30:54.540 align:start position:0%
leave the hospital
 
03:30:58.130 --> 03:30:58.140 align:start position:0%
so Morel is okay because I support my
 
03:30:58.140 --> 03:30:59.690 align:start position:0%
so Morel is okay because I support my
staff

03:30:59.690 --> 03:30:59.700 align:start position:0%
staff
 
03:31:01.969 --> 03:31:01.979 align:start position:0%
and and you you have good feedback
 
03:31:04.550 --> 03:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
mechanisms once they leave the hospital
 
03:31:06.769 --> 03:31:06.779 align:start position:0%
and go back to the community you have
 
03:31:09.710 --> 03:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
good feedback mechanisms to know how
 
03:31:11.330 --> 03:31:11.340 align:start position:0%
that one of my roles at New Hampshire
 
03:31:13.490 --> 03:31:13.500 align:start position:0%
hospital as part of the exact team and
 
03:31:15.229 --> 03:31:15.239 align:start position:0%
the director of social work is that I do
 
03:31:17.570 --> 03:31:17.580 align:start position:0%
a lot of collaborative meetings with the
 
03:31:19.130 --> 03:31:19.140 align:start position:0%
community mental health centers on every
 
03:31:19.140 --> 03:31:20.690 align:start position:0%
community mental health centers on every
level

03:31:20.690 --> 03:31:20.700 align:start position:0%
level
 
03:31:23.269 --> 03:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
um and so we get feedback regularly from
 
03:31:25.309 --> 03:31:25.319 align:start position:0%
all 10 Community Mental Health Centers
 
03:31:27.830 --> 03:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
area agencies that serve people with
 
03:31:30.530 --> 03:31:30.540 align:start position:0%
intellectual disabilities on how things
 
03:31:32.450 --> 03:31:32.460 align:start position:0%
are going in terms of our discharge
 
03:31:32.460 --> 03:31:33.950 align:start position:0%
are going in terms of our discharge
planning

03:31:33.950 --> 03:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
planning
 
03:31:36.349 --> 03:31:36.359 align:start position:0%
um and and how patients are doing as
 
03:31:38.210 --> 03:31:38.220 align:start position:0%
they leave the hospital and post
 
03:31:38.220 --> 03:31:39.710 align:start position:0%
they leave the hospital and post
discharge

03:31:39.710 --> 03:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
discharge
 
03:31:42.110 --> 03:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
in your techniques your approaches to
 
03:31:44.389 --> 03:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
efficiency are the same as they probably
 
03:31:48.170 --> 03:31:48.180 align:start position:0%
were 30 years ago keeping notes on a
 
03:31:49.929 --> 03:31:49.939 align:start position:0%
piece of paper making phone calls
 
03:31:53.330 --> 03:31:53.340 align:start position:0%
traveling to do site visits is there
 
03:31:55.969 --> 03:31:55.979 align:start position:0%
anything about today's technology or the
 
03:31:58.610 --> 03:31:58.620 align:start position:0%
technology in the next five years to
 
03:32:00.830 --> 03:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
enable that sort of feedback mechanism
 
03:32:03.650 --> 03:32:03.660 align:start position:0%
to to be more efficient
 
03:32:06.170 --> 03:32:06.180 align:start position:0%
well I think covid in a way has helped
 
03:32:08.389 --> 03:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
us with that at New Hampshire hospital
 
03:32:08.399 --> 03:32:09.170 align:start position:0%
us with that at New Hampshire hospital
um

03:32:09.170 --> 03:32:09.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:12.229 --> 03:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
Zoom has been wonderful we serve the
 
03:32:14.090 --> 03:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
entire State of New Hampshire and so we
 
03:32:15.830 --> 03:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
have patients from every part of New
 
03:32:18.050 --> 03:32:18.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in the hospital and so we
 
03:32:20.510 --> 03:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
often now now that we've got
 
03:32:23.510 --> 03:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
um the capability with technology we'll
 
03:32:27.650 --> 03:32:27.660 align:start position:0%
do community meetings via Zoom so you
 
03:32:29.750 --> 03:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
know the patient's family their
 
03:32:31.790 --> 03:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
Guardians their Community Mental Health
 
03:32:34.190 --> 03:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
Center can all participate in those
 
03:32:36.050 --> 03:32:36.060 align:start position:0%
meetings more easily they don't have to
 
03:32:36.060 --> 03:32:37.070 align:start position:0%
meetings more easily they don't have to
drive

03:32:37.070 --> 03:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
drive
 
03:32:39.229 --> 03:32:39.239 align:start position:0%
long distances to come to New Hampshire
 
03:32:41.870 --> 03:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
hospital to be part of that meeting we
 
03:32:44.090 --> 03:32:44.100 align:start position:0%
can also do intake appointments that way
 
03:32:48.410 --> 03:32:48.420 align:start position:0%
so in summary what what is what are your
 
03:32:50.269 --> 03:32:50.279 align:start position:0%
top two or three between the two of you
 
03:32:52.090 --> 03:32:52.100 align:start position:0%
what are your top two or three
 
03:32:54.710 --> 03:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
legislature hear us this is what we need
 
03:32:58.729 --> 03:32:58.739 align:start position:0%
from from you what what what what what
 
03:33:04.130 --> 03:33:04.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:05.630 --> 03:33:05.640 align:start position:0%
um I think that that's a really good
 
03:33:08.389 --> 03:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
question I would say that your support
 
03:33:11.870 --> 03:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
of additional housing throughout the
 
03:33:15.229 --> 03:33:15.239 align:start position:0%
state is a number one priority to be
 
03:33:16.969 --> 03:33:16.979 align:start position:0%
able to support the patient population
 
03:33:19.370 --> 03:33:19.380 align:start position:0%
and having safe and appropriate
 
03:33:23.450 --> 03:33:23.460 align:start position:0%
locations to return to in the community
 
03:33:25.849 --> 03:33:25.859 align:start position:0%
um and you know if they're if you're
 
03:33:28.610 --> 03:33:28.620 align:start position:0%
faced with decisions I would say the
 
03:33:30.290 --> 03:33:30.300 align:start position:0%
second one is if you're faced with
 
03:33:33.229 --> 03:33:33.239 align:start position:0%
decisions in terms of
 
03:33:35.690 --> 03:33:35.700 align:start position:0%
um you know budgets for Staffing and for
 
03:33:38.570 --> 03:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
rates and for anything having to do with
 
03:33:41.210 --> 03:33:41.220 align:start position:0%
the support of our employees in that
 
03:33:43.190 --> 03:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
regard that would also be vitally
 
03:33:43.200 --> 03:33:44.269 align:start position:0%
regard that would also be vitally
important

03:33:44.269 --> 03:33:44.279 align:start position:0%
important
 
03:33:46.849 --> 03:33:46.859 align:start position:0%
so just to be clear when you say housing
 
03:33:50.150 --> 03:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
it's not just housing it's it's in your
 
03:33:52.190 --> 03:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
in this patient mix you need housing
 
03:33:54.530 --> 03:33:54.540 align:start position:0%
with some wrap around Support Services
 
03:33:57.110 --> 03:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
almost like a staffed bed you need
 
03:33:58.490 --> 03:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
something the equivalent you need
 
03:34:01.309 --> 03:34:01.319 align:start position:0%
staffed housing to help discharge these
 
03:34:03.650 --> 03:34:03.660 align:start position:0%
people back in the community or is it
 
03:34:09.050 --> 03:34:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:10.790 --> 03:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
um the folks at the Bureau of mental
 
03:34:11.990 --> 03:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
health which you've already heard from
 
03:34:14.809 --> 03:34:14.819 align:start position:0%
in in the initiatives in the 10-year
 
03:34:16.010 --> 03:34:16.020 align:start position:0%
mental health plan
 
03:34:18.410 --> 03:34:18.420 align:start position:0%
are going to help us with that I mean we
 
03:34:20.210 --> 03:34:20.220 align:start position:0%
work collaboratively with the Bureau of
 
03:34:21.650 --> 03:34:21.660 align:start position:0%
mental health because they really
 
03:34:24.170 --> 03:34:24.180 align:start position:0%
support those Services being stood up in
 
03:34:26.809 --> 03:34:26.819 align:start position:0%
the community so when they're coming to
 
03:34:28.910 --> 03:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
ask for support in the services that
 
03:34:30.229 --> 03:34:30.239 align:start position:0%
they're providing that's actually
 
03:34:32.690 --> 03:34:32.700 align:start position:0%
helping New Hampshire hospital
 
03:34:34.790 --> 03:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
okay are there are there other questions
 
03:34:37.729 --> 03:34:37.739 align:start position:0%
go ahead represent Waller these are just
 
03:34:39.469 --> 03:34:39.479 align:start position:0%
two really quick ones
 
03:34:41.090 --> 03:34:41.100 align:start position:0%
um I wondered how many social workers
 
03:34:42.290 --> 03:34:42.300 align:start position:0%
there are I'm sure it's in here
 
03:34:44.870 --> 03:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
someplace but I've missed it and are
 
03:34:48.290 --> 03:34:48.300 align:start position:0%
they all msws or are we are psychiatric
 
03:34:50.570 --> 03:34:50.580 align:start position:0%
social workers are all Master's level
 
03:34:53.389 --> 03:34:53.399 align:start position:0%
social workers msws and a good number of
 
03:34:56.150 --> 03:34:56.160 align:start position:0%
them are licensed social workers and I
 
03:35:00.469 --> 03:35:00.479 align:start position:0%
feel very strongly about the MSW as the
 
03:35:02.929 --> 03:35:02.939 align:start position:0%
proper person for the position because
 
03:35:05.269 --> 03:35:05.279 align:start position:0%
as I stated before it requires a certain
 
03:35:07.309 --> 03:35:07.319 align:start position:0%
level of professional development and
 
03:35:09.889 --> 03:35:09.899 align:start position:0%
systems theory
 
03:35:11.630 --> 03:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
um to understand all of the different
 
03:35:13.729 --> 03:35:13.739 align:start position:0%
factors everything from benefits to
 
03:35:15.170 --> 03:35:15.180 align:start position:0%
housing to
 
03:35:17.330 --> 03:35:17.340 align:start position:0%
knowing all of the different human
 
03:35:19.090 --> 03:35:19.100 align:start position:0%
resources in the community
 
03:35:21.229 --> 03:35:21.239 align:start position:0%
are really important and they need to
 
03:35:23.030 --> 03:35:23.040 align:start position:0%
have that ability to practice
 
03:35:23.040 --> 03:35:24.650 align:start position:0%
have that ability to practice
independently

03:35:24.650 --> 03:35:24.660 align:start position:0%
independently
 
03:35:28.070 --> 03:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
without without me looking over their
 
03:35:28.080 --> 03:35:29.450 align:start position:0%
without without me looking over their
shoulder

03:35:29.450 --> 03:35:29.460 align:start position:0%
shoulder
 
03:35:31.870 --> 03:35:31.880 align:start position:0%
where are we recruiting
 
03:35:33.889 --> 03:35:33.899 align:start position:0%
msws from
 
03:35:37.849 --> 03:35:37.859 align:start position:0%
a lot of msws come around here from UNH
 
03:35:41.990 --> 03:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
they have a wonderful MSW program but as
 
03:35:43.849 --> 03:35:43.859 align:start position:0%
with the Mental Health crisis nationally
 
03:35:46.969 --> 03:35:46.979 align:start position:0%
social workers are in short supply
 
03:35:49.309 --> 03:35:49.319 align:start position:0%
there's not fewer I don't think it's
 
03:35:51.830 --> 03:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
just that we need more of them
 
03:35:54.769 --> 03:35:54.779 align:start position:0%
and how many are how many how many
 
03:35:56.450 --> 03:35:56.460 align:start position:0%
positions do you have for social workers
 
03:36:00.550 --> 03:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
so in my department there are roughly
 
03:36:03.590 --> 03:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
32 positions
 
03:36:06.650 --> 03:36:06.660 align:start position:0%
um but a lot of them are empty now so
 
03:36:07.969 --> 03:36:07.979 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:36:10.610 --> 03:36:10.620 align:start position:0%
and then if you throw in their
 
03:36:12.889 --> 03:36:12.899 align:start position:0%
the experience of covet in the last
 
03:36:14.630 --> 03:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
couple years when you know someone has
 
03:36:17.990 --> 03:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
to be out for a week and a half
 
03:36:20.389 --> 03:36:20.399 align:start position:0%
for covid and then folks need vacations
 
03:36:24.250 --> 03:36:24.260 align:start position:0%
because we don't want them to burn out
 
03:36:28.969 --> 03:36:28.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:28.979 --> 03:36:30.410 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

03:36:30.410 --> 03:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
03:36:30.420 --> 03:36:31.849 align:start position:0%
thanks
um

03:36:31.849 --> 03:36:31.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:34.370 --> 03:36:34.380 align:start position:0%
I'm from Nashua so I know that we my
 
03:36:37.729 --> 03:36:37.739 align:start position:0%
community must have a large or not a
 
03:36:39.050 --> 03:36:39.060 align:start position:0%
large number must have Supportive
 
03:36:41.150 --> 03:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
Housing that exists
 
03:36:41.160 --> 03:36:42.110 align:start position:0%
Housing that exists
um

03:36:42.110 --> 03:36:42.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:46.070 --> 03:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
is that housing which is or one of the
 
03:36:48.469 --> 03:36:48.479 align:start position:0%
end goals to get these patients
 
03:36:51.050 --> 03:36:51.060 align:start position:0%
um out of New Hampshire hospital
 
03:36:52.429 --> 03:36:52.439 align:start position:0%
is it
 
03:36:55.309 --> 03:36:55.319 align:start position:0%
other opportunities relatively balanced
 
03:36:57.050 --> 03:36:57.060 align:start position:0%
around the state or are there certain
 
03:36:58.969 --> 03:36:58.979 align:start position:0%
communities that sort of bear the brunt
 
03:37:01.010 --> 03:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
simply because they have the facilities
 
03:37:04.070 --> 03:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
Manchester Nashua uh maybe you know on
 
03:37:06.889 --> 03:37:06.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:08.750 --> 03:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
um I think it's gotten a little bit
 
03:37:11.269 --> 03:37:11.279 align:start position:0%
better recently but you're right I mean
 
03:37:13.429 --> 03:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
there's some communities especially you
 
03:37:15.830 --> 03:37:15.840 align:start position:0%
know the North country that don't have
 
03:37:18.170 --> 03:37:18.180 align:start position:0%
as many resources
 
03:37:18.180 --> 03:37:19.190 align:start position:0%
as many resources
um

03:37:19.190 --> 03:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:21.769 --> 03:37:21.779 align:start position:0%
so to some extent it does happen I mean
 
03:37:23.210 --> 03:37:23.220 align:start position:0%
patients have the
 
03:37:24.650 --> 03:37:24.660 align:start position:0%
patients at New Hampshire hospital have
 
03:37:26.030 --> 03:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
the right to live wherever they want to
 
03:37:27.950 --> 03:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
live I don't I would never tell them
 
03:37:30.229 --> 03:37:30.239 align:start position:0%
where they have to live but as a matter
 
03:37:32.990 --> 03:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
of practicality if someone's homeless
 
03:37:35.690 --> 03:37:35.700 align:start position:0%
you know if if one Community is say it
 
03:37:37.670 --> 03:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
be Nashua or Manchester or Concord
 
03:37:40.610 --> 03:37:40.620 align:start position:0%
happens to have more housing inventory
 
03:37:42.710 --> 03:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
our housings I have someone whose only
 
03:37:45.349 --> 03:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
job is searching for apartments at New
 
03:37:46.790 --> 03:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital
 
03:37:48.889 --> 03:37:48.899 align:start position:0%
and she knows where they're available in
 
03:37:50.210 --> 03:37:50.220 align:start position:0%
the state
 
03:37:50.220 --> 03:37:50.929 align:start position:0%
the state
um

03:37:50.929 --> 03:37:50.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:52.550 --> 03:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
we're going to tell the patient hey I
 
03:37:53.870 --> 03:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
know you want to leave and you're ready
 
03:37:55.729 --> 03:37:55.739 align:start position:0%
to leave there's an apartment in
 
03:37:57.650 --> 03:37:57.660 align:start position:0%
Claremont right now would do are you
 
03:37:59.929 --> 03:37:59.939 align:start position:0%
interested in living in Claremont and so
 
03:38:01.370 --> 03:38:01.380 align:start position:0%
that happens
 
03:38:01.380 --> 03:38:02.269 align:start position:0%
that happens
um

03:38:02.269 --> 03:38:02.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:03.950 --> 03:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess I'm just acknowledging that
 
03:38:06.590 --> 03:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
you know it's probably often in the
 
03:38:08.090 --> 03:38:08.100 align:start position:0%
patient's best interest to go back to
 
03:38:09.889 --> 03:38:09.899 align:start position:0%
their home Community where they have the
 
03:38:11.809 --> 03:38:11.819 align:start position:0%
support network so I'm just true
 
03:38:13.969 --> 03:38:13.979 align:start position:0%
wondering how wide that web was but
 
03:38:16.250 --> 03:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for your answer
 
03:38:18.410 --> 03:38:18.420 align:start position:0%
all right do you want to do the forensic
 
03:38:21.349 --> 03:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
Hospital sure thank you
 
03:38:23.389 --> 03:38:23.399 align:start position:0%
um as some of you may know New Hampshire
 
03:38:25.670 --> 03:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
hospital has been working on for the
 
03:38:28.370 --> 03:38:28.380 align:start position:0%
past year and a half or so with a
 
03:38:32.630 --> 03:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
architect design firm to design uh the
 
03:38:36.469 --> 03:38:36.479 align:start position:0%
forensic hospital we were approved for a
 
03:38:38.030 --> 03:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
24 bed
 
03:38:40.370 --> 03:38:40.380 align:start position:0%
facility that's going to be physically
 
03:38:42.530 --> 03:38:42.540 align:start position:0%
attached to New Hampshire hospital so it
 
03:38:44.269 --> 03:38:44.279 align:start position:0%
won't be a freestanding forensic
 
03:38:46.309 --> 03:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
hospital it will be an additional unit
 
03:38:48.950 --> 03:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire hospital however it
 
03:38:51.950 --> 03:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
will have its own Staffing model its own
 
03:38:54.530 --> 03:38:54.540 align:start position:0%
training and education components Etc
 
03:38:56.690 --> 03:38:56.700 align:start position:0%
that are specific to the forensic
 
03:38:56.700 --> 03:38:58.969 align:start position:0%
that are specific to the forensic
population

03:38:58.969 --> 03:38:58.979 align:start position:0%
population
 
03:39:01.610 --> 03:39:01.620 align:start position:0%
um so I put the wrong slide down
 
03:39:04.070 --> 03:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
so with different you know I think we
 
03:39:05.690 --> 03:39:05.700 align:start position:0%
may have plunged into this just a little
 
03:39:09.229 --> 03:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
quickly okay let's come back and for
 
03:39:11.870 --> 03:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
people who have not heard the term
 
03:39:15.170 --> 03:39:15.180 align:start position:0%
forensic hospital but let's let's talk
 
03:39:17.050 --> 03:39:17.060 align:start position:0%
about what that is
 
03:39:19.729 --> 03:39:19.739 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the criminally insane
 
03:39:23.150 --> 03:39:23.160 align:start position:0%
category isn't it so um
 
03:39:25.130 --> 03:39:25.140 align:start position:0%
there are patients that are involved in
 
03:39:27.530 --> 03:39:27.540 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice system and are
 
03:39:29.090 --> 03:39:29.100 align:start position:0%
suffering from a severe mental illness
 
03:39:31.070 --> 03:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
that could be folks that are incompetent
 
03:39:33.650 --> 03:39:33.660 align:start position:0%
to strand trial Not Guilty by reason of
 
03:39:33.660 --> 03:39:35.389 align:start position:0%
to strand trial Not Guilty by reason of
insanity

03:39:35.389 --> 03:39:35.399 align:start position:0%
insanity
 
03:39:37.670 --> 03:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
um patients who haven't committed
 
03:39:39.769 --> 03:39:39.779 align:start position:0%
unlawful acts but because of their
 
03:39:41.570 --> 03:39:41.580 align:start position:0%
mental illness are too dangerous to be
 
03:39:42.889 --> 03:39:42.899 align:start position:0%
treated in a conventional hospital
 
03:39:45.950 --> 03:39:45.960 align:start position:0%
patients of that nature okay and so to
 
03:39:48.050 --> 03:39:48.060 align:start position:0%
fast forward through the history that
 
03:39:50.090 --> 03:39:50.100 align:start position:0%
currently they've been at the state
 
03:39:53.030 --> 03:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
hospital excuse me State Prison we've
 
03:39:55.309 --> 03:39:55.319 align:start position:0%
had lots of issues with lawsuits and
 
03:39:57.229 --> 03:39:57.239 align:start position:0%
whether or not we think it meets our own
 
03:39:59.750 --> 03:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
standards of care and so the
 
03:40:01.370 --> 03:40:01.380 align:start position:0%
determination was made in the last
 
03:40:04.490 --> 03:40:04.500 align:start position:0%
legislature to go ahead and and build a
 
03:40:07.010 --> 03:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
replacement Center for for this we
 
03:40:08.809 --> 03:40:08.819 align:start position:0%
decided to co-locate it with the New
 
03:40:10.490 --> 03:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital to gain some
 
03:40:13.210 --> 03:40:13.220 align:start position:0%
efficiencies of scale and cooperation
 
03:40:15.769 --> 03:40:15.779 align:start position:0%
and and if that's all a good summary
 
03:40:18.170 --> 03:40:18.180 align:start position:0%
then I'll just ask you
 
03:40:21.170 --> 03:40:21.180 align:start position:0%
um how we're doing are we on track when
 
03:40:22.910 --> 03:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
when is this thing going to open are we
 
03:40:25.429 --> 03:40:25.439 align:start position:0%
on time are we on budget
 
03:40:27.590 --> 03:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for those questions so
 
03:40:30.290 --> 03:40:30.300 align:start position:0%
according to the original timeline we
 
03:40:33.349 --> 03:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
had the opening slated with occupancy
 
03:40:35.630 --> 03:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
for the summer of next year the summer
 
03:40:39.590 --> 03:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
of 2024. at this point in time we are
 
03:40:42.050 --> 03:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
nearing the end of our design and
 
03:40:44.510 --> 03:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
development phase of the project through
 
03:40:46.490 --> 03:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
that design and development we have
 
03:40:47.750 --> 03:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
determined that there's some
 
03:40:50.870 --> 03:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
foundational work that needs to occur to
 
03:40:52.610 --> 03:40:52.620 align:start position:0%
be able to ensure obviously the
 
03:40:55.090 --> 03:40:55.100 align:start position:0%
foundation of the facility being secure
 
03:40:57.469 --> 03:40:57.479 align:start position:0%
and that foundational work will take
 
03:40:59.809 --> 03:40:59.819 align:start position:0%
some additional time based on the fact
 
03:41:01.250 --> 03:41:01.260 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire hospital is already
 
03:41:03.530 --> 03:41:03.540 align:start position:0%
occupied and we don't want to limit or
 
03:41:05.570 --> 03:41:05.580 align:start position:0%
minimize the occupancy of New Hampshire
 
03:41:08.389 --> 03:41:08.399 align:start position:0%
hospital due to this project the other
 
03:41:10.250 --> 03:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
component that is being taken into
 
03:41:12.650 --> 03:41:12.660 align:start position:0%
consideration now that we're getting
 
03:41:14.510 --> 03:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
closer to putting the project out to bid
 
03:41:16.790 --> 03:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
within the next couple of weeks with the
 
03:41:19.309 --> 03:41:19.319 align:start position:0%
construction company is that the current
 
03:41:21.590 --> 03:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
environment and current state in terms
 
03:41:24.530 --> 03:41:24.540 align:start position:0%
of construction and resources and
 
03:41:26.510 --> 03:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
availability of products and materials
 
03:41:31.250 --> 03:41:31.260 align:start position:0%
is still constrained so as far as DHHS
 
03:41:33.910 --> 03:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
in our planning to operate New Hampshire
 
03:41:37.190 --> 03:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
the forensic facility we're on target
 
03:41:40.969 --> 03:41:40.979 align:start position:0%
get with that but due to some of these
 
03:41:43.849 --> 03:41:43.859 align:start position:0%
concerns it will take more than likely
 
03:41:47.510 --> 03:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
an additional year to be able to occupy
 
03:41:49.670 --> 03:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
it and have it be completely constructed
 
03:41:52.130 --> 03:41:52.140 align:start position:0%
so that's the summer of 25. since we're
 
03:41:55.490 --> 03:41:55.500 align:start position:0%
trying to build this in a swamp yeah uh
 
03:41:57.769 --> 03:41:57.779 align:start position:0%
I understand the foundational issues is
 
03:41:59.510 --> 03:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
there a possibility that somebody could
 
03:42:01.010 --> 03:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
say this isn't going to work we need
 
03:42:03.590 --> 03:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
another site no I don't think so I I
 
03:42:05.330 --> 03:42:05.340 align:start position:0%
think that they feel confident the
 
03:42:07.849 --> 03:42:07.859 align:start position:0%
majority of the concern has to do with
 
03:42:09.590 --> 03:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
the fact that New Hampshire hospital is
 
03:42:11.570 --> 03:42:11.580 align:start position:0%
already occupied and some of the
 
03:42:13.309 --> 03:42:13.319 align:start position:0%
drilling and boring and things that they
 
03:42:15.710 --> 03:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
have to do would be very disruptive so
 
03:42:17.510 --> 03:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
they have to go about it in a way that
 
03:42:19.250 --> 03:42:19.260 align:start position:0%
makes sense to accommodate the current
 
03:42:22.210 --> 03:42:22.220 align:start position:0%
need so I'm not I'm not looking to like
 
03:42:24.950 --> 03:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
beat anyone up but we're you're we're
 
03:42:26.630 --> 03:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
going to end up being a year behind the
 
03:42:28.190 --> 03:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
original plan behind the original
 
03:42:32.090 --> 03:42:32.100 align:start position:0%
timeline yes yeah okay all right
 
03:42:32.100 --> 03:42:32.769 align:start position:0%
timeline yes yeah okay all right
um

03:42:32.769 --> 03:42:32.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:35.990 --> 03:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative Waller when when it
 
03:42:39.710 --> 03:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
finally is finished and we move the um
 
03:42:42.769 --> 03:42:42.779 align:start position:0%
people from the prison over to the
 
03:42:46.030 --> 03:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
facility will the staff from the prison
 
03:42:49.309 --> 03:42:49.319 align:start position:0%
come to the facility with them or do you
 
03:42:53.030 --> 03:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
anticipate hiring new staff for the
 
03:42:56.330 --> 03:42:56.340 align:start position:0%
forensic unit that's a great question so
 
03:43:00.410 --> 03:43:00.420 align:start position:0%
in terms of the forensic hospital and
 
03:43:03.349 --> 03:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
the S the current spu there's only a
 
03:43:06.769 --> 03:43:06.779 align:start position:0%
portion of spu patients who are actually
 
03:43:08.450 --> 03:43:08.460 align:start position:0%
going to be transitioning to New
 
03:43:10.190 --> 03:43:10.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital and those are the
 
03:43:11.929 --> 03:43:11.939 align:start position:0%
patients that meet the criteria that I
 
03:43:13.429 --> 03:43:13.439 align:start position:0%
just talked about in terms of their
 
03:43:15.889 --> 03:43:15.899 align:start position:0%
mental illness there still will be an
 
03:43:18.950 --> 03:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
existence and a necessity of the spu to
 
03:43:21.050 --> 03:43:21.060 align:start position:0%
continue to operate based on the
 
03:43:23.030 --> 03:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Corrections needs and the
 
03:43:25.330 --> 03:43:25.340 align:start position:0%
needs of that population that they serve
 
03:43:28.910 --> 03:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
so we don't anticipate
 
03:43:31.190 --> 03:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
um having you know we're not planning to
 
03:43:33.349 --> 03:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
have any staff from Doc we don't want to
 
03:43:35.870 --> 03:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
we don't wanna you know further limit
 
03:43:38.330 --> 03:43:38.340 align:start position:0%
their their ability to deliver the
 
03:43:40.490 --> 03:43:40.500 align:start position:0%
services that they deliver either so we
 
03:43:42.229 --> 03:43:42.239 align:start position:0%
would be looking to hire
 
03:43:43.849 --> 03:43:43.859 align:start position:0%
um our own staff to be able to support
 
03:43:50.750 --> 03:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:54.650 --> 03:43:54.660 align:start position:0%
I just have a comment for you and it
 
03:43:57.410 --> 03:43:57.420 align:start position:0%
goes back to the first slide on on our
 
03:43:57.420 --> 03:43:58.490 align:start position:0%
goes back to the first slide on on our
mission

03:43:58.490 --> 03:43:58.500 align:start position:0%
mission
 
03:44:01.429 --> 03:44:01.439 align:start position:0%
okay so so what I think your mission
 
03:44:03.769 --> 03:44:03.779 align:start position:0%
includes it's not in here
 
03:44:06.229 --> 03:44:06.239 align:start position:0%
is because you're you're in the middle
 
03:44:09.469 --> 03:44:09.479 align:start position:0%
of the patient throughput from the
 
03:44:12.650 --> 03:44:12.660 align:start position:0%
emergency rooms into the community you
 
03:44:15.769 --> 03:44:15.779 align:start position:0%
see the the sort of the input problems
 
03:44:18.889 --> 03:44:18.899 align:start position:0%
you have and back up at the ERS you see
 
03:44:20.870 --> 03:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
the output problems that you have we're
 
03:44:23.389 --> 03:44:23.399 align:start position:0%
trying to find places in the community
 
03:44:26.690 --> 03:44:26.700 align:start position:0%
it's not in your mission but my
 
03:44:29.929 --> 03:44:29.939 align:start position:0%
expectation on HHS oversight and in here
 
03:44:32.809 --> 03:44:32.819 align:start position:0%
is that you you all are in the very best
 
03:44:36.349 --> 03:44:36.359 align:start position:0%
position to be observing and managing
 
03:44:40.309 --> 03:44:40.319 align:start position:0%
and coordinating that workflow problem
 
03:44:42.889 --> 03:44:42.899 align:start position:0%
you know and so although it's probably
 
03:44:47.510 --> 03:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
nowhere in the statutory Charter for you
 
03:44:50.750 --> 03:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
to be worried about you know knowing
 
03:44:52.610 --> 03:44:52.620 align:start position:0%
what you need to know about that ER
 
03:44:55.429 --> 03:44:55.439 align:start position:0%
backlog or knowing what you need to know
 
03:44:57.590 --> 03:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
about the ability to of community
 
03:45:00.229 --> 03:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
services I don't know anyone else that
 
03:45:02.330 --> 03:45:02.340 align:start position:0%
would be in a better position than you
 
03:45:05.809 --> 03:45:05.819 align:start position:0%
all to get be able to give us feedback
 
03:45:08.570 --> 03:45:08.580 align:start position:0%
because we got to get that system
 
03:45:11.150 --> 03:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
straightened out and cleaned out so that
 
03:45:13.790 --> 03:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
we can move people you know into the
 
03:45:15.469 --> 03:45:15.479 align:start position:0%
level of service they need when they
 
03:45:18.010 --> 03:45:18.020 align:start position:0%
need it without delay
 
03:45:21.229 --> 03:45:21.239 align:start position:0%
and and and so I know that's not your
 
03:45:23.809 --> 03:45:23.819 align:start position:0%
official Charter but I I just would hope
 
03:45:27.170 --> 03:45:27.180 align:start position:0%
that you would you would own that
 
03:45:27.180 --> 03:45:28.550 align:start position:0%
that you would you would own that
just

03:45:28.550 --> 03:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:45:33.650 --> 03:45:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:36.469 --> 03:45:36.479 align:start position:0%
the social work department and
 
03:45:38.450 --> 03:45:38.460 align:start position:0%
the code of ethics for social work is
 
03:45:39.830 --> 03:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
that people should be treated in the
 
03:45:41.630 --> 03:45:41.640 align:start position:0%
least restrictive environment possible
 
03:45:45.469 --> 03:45:45.479 align:start position:0%
that's so that they can live the
 
03:45:47.870 --> 03:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
their life as independently as they
 
03:45:49.130 --> 03:45:49.140 align:start position:0%
deserve to
 
03:45:51.290 --> 03:45:51.300 align:start position:0%
so that's that's not a new part of our
 
03:45:53.809 --> 03:45:53.819 align:start position:0%
mission it's been part of what we do for
 
03:45:55.370 --> 03:45:55.380 align:start position:0%
as long as I've worked there and long
 
03:45:59.349 --> 03:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:01.610 --> 03:46:01.620 align:start position:0%
that's part of your kind of your
 
03:46:04.250 --> 03:46:04.260 align:start position:0%
clinical Mission your altruistic Mission
 
03:46:06.590 --> 03:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
you know I'm talking about Mission and
 
03:46:10.250 --> 03:46:10.260 align:start position:0%
the Army sense you know thou Thou shalt
 
03:46:12.349 --> 03:46:12.359 align:start position:0%
be able to deliver reports on demand
 
03:46:15.110 --> 03:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
about the status of the throughput you
 
03:46:17.570 --> 03:46:17.580 align:start position:0%
know that that that level is what I'm
 
03:46:19.849 --> 03:46:19.859 align:start position:0%
talking about and that's not your
 
03:46:22.969 --> 03:46:22.979 align:start position:0%
obligation but we do we are working on
 
03:46:25.070 --> 03:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
those metrics so to be able to report
 
03:46:26.929 --> 03:46:26.939 align:start position:0%
out on what the barriers are to
 
03:46:28.610 --> 03:46:28.620 align:start position:0%
discharge how many people are waiting
 
03:46:31.370 --> 03:46:31.380 align:start position:0%
for each of those levels of care okay
 
03:46:34.070 --> 03:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
um that stuff that it that we do have
 
03:46:37.370 --> 03:46:37.380 align:start position:0%
some of now and can and working actively
 
03:46:39.830 --> 03:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
to develop more thank you representative
 
03:46:41.630 --> 03:46:41.640 align:start position:0%
Mooney thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:46:43.370 --> 03:46:43.380 align:start position:0%
again both for being here I know we're
 
03:46:44.870 --> 03:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
all busy
 
03:46:46.370 --> 03:46:46.380 align:start position:0%
um however I get the sense that you have
 
03:46:49.370 --> 03:46:49.380 align:start position:0%

um let's let's get through Glen Cliff
 
03:47:50.450 --> 03:47:50.460 align:start position:0%
it's sort of a slightly higher level
 
03:47:52.670 --> 03:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
because there's more details in the
 
03:47:56.389 --> 03:47:56.399 align:start position:0%
slides and and so talk to us about the
 
03:47:59.510 --> 03:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
uniqueness of the of the mission tell us
 
03:48:02.210 --> 03:48:02.220 align:start position:0%

03:48:11.030 --> 03:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
next five years on Building Maintenance
 
03:48:11.040 --> 03:48:12.370 align:start position:0%
next five years on Building Maintenance
replacement

03:48:12.370 --> 03:48:12.380 align:start position:0%
replacement
 
03:48:16.550 --> 03:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
expansion you know uh more more more
 
03:48:19.309 --> 03:48:19.319 align:start position:0%

sure absolutely thank you so
 
03:48:24.830 --> 03:48:24.840 align:start position:0%
um I as you as I previously mentioned I
 
03:48:27.290 --> 03:48:27.300 align:start position:0%
help oversee Glenn Cliff home um Todd
 
03:48:29.210 --> 03:48:29.220 align:start position:0%
Bickford is the long-term care
 
03:48:31.309 --> 03:48:31.319 align:start position:0%
administrator there he has a leadership
 
03:48:34.070 --> 03:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
team who also supports him
 
03:48:35.630 --> 03:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
um and they start their mission is to
 
03:48:37.790 --> 03:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
strive to provide a Continuum of service
 
03:48:39.469 --> 03:48:39.479 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire's developmentally
 
03:48:42.050 --> 03:48:42.060 align:start position:0%
disabled and or mentally ill population
 
03:48:44.809 --> 03:48:44.819 align:start position:0%
in the home-like atmosphere with an
 
03:48:46.969 --> 03:48:46.979 align:start position:0%
emphasis on Independence dignity and
 
03:48:49.670 --> 03:48:49.680 align:start position:0%
acceptance I would invite anyone and
 
03:48:52.190 --> 03:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
Todd Todd would say the same if he were
 
03:48:54.530 --> 03:48:54.540 align:start position:0%
here to go up to Glencliff if you ever
 
03:48:57.110 --> 03:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
had the chance he loves to host visitors
 
03:48:58.910 --> 03:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
it's a beautiful campus beautiful
 
03:49:01.849 --> 03:49:01.859 align:start position:0%
facility in self-sustained which I'll
 
03:49:04.130 --> 03:49:04.140 align:start position:0%
talk about more in a second are these
 
03:49:06.650 --> 03:49:06.660 align:start position:0%
folks there on an involuntary invitation
 
03:49:09.110 --> 03:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
or are they all voluntary through a
 
03:49:11.389 --> 03:49:11.399 align:start position:0%
guardian of some kind
 
03:49:13.429 --> 03:49:13.439 align:start position:0%
um they are their generally voluntary
 
03:49:15.469 --> 03:49:15.479 align:start position:0%
through a guardian and obviously
 
03:49:17.389 --> 03:49:17.399 align:start position:0%
requiring a nursing home level of care
 
03:49:19.670 --> 03:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
that that is provided in that
 
03:49:23.690 --> 03:49:23.700 align:start position:0%
environment so only only residing there
 
03:49:25.610 --> 03:49:25.620 align:start position:0%
um via having the need to reside in that
 
03:49:28.309 --> 03:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
environment not kind of a at a directive
 
03:49:30.229 --> 03:49:30.239 align:start position:0%
of of anyone
 
03:49:30.239 --> 03:49:33.050 align:start position:0%
of of anyone
okay

03:49:33.050 --> 03:49:33.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:34.610 --> 03:49:34.620 align:start position:0%
um so glencliffe home is a healthcare
 
03:49:36.830 --> 03:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
facility it provides a Continuum of
 
03:49:38.870 --> 03:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
services for New Hampshire residents as
 
03:49:41.150 --> 03:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
I mentioned previously
 
03:49:43.429 --> 03:49:43.439 align:start position:0%
um they are a center for Medicare and
 
03:49:46.849 --> 03:49:46.859 align:start position:0%
Medicaid services certified facility and
 
03:49:50.030 --> 03:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
as I previously mentioned in terms of
 
03:49:52.729 --> 03:49:52.739 align:start position:0%
Eligibility there has to be a pass are
 
03:49:55.309 --> 03:49:55.319 align:start position:0%
or a long-term care eligibility approval
 
03:49:57.290 --> 03:49:57.300 align:start position:0%
screening in order for them to be able
 
03:49:59.510 --> 03:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
to reside there
 
03:50:01.790 --> 03:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
um they are located 69 miles Northwest
 
03:50:04.910 --> 03:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
of Concord uh nestled on the side of
 
03:50:07.610 --> 03:50:07.620 align:start position:0%
Mount mussolak in the town of Benton it
 
03:50:09.969 --> 03:50:09.979 align:start position:0%
was the facility in itself was built in
 
03:50:13.610 --> 03:50:13.620 align:start position:0%
1906 and they are off the grid so
 
03:50:16.070 --> 03:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
they're a self-sustained campus which
 
03:50:18.110 --> 03:50:18.120 align:start position:0%
produces all of their own electricity
 
03:50:20.630 --> 03:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
using a combination of hydropower and
 
03:50:23.030 --> 03:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
diesel generators they also produce all
 
03:50:25.370 --> 03:50:25.380 align:start position:0%
their own hot water and a steam heating
 
03:50:28.610 --> 03:50:28.620 align:start position:0%
bio generator power plant has its own
 
03:50:30.710 --> 03:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
potable water supply and sewage system
 
03:50:32.809 --> 03:50:32.819 align:start position:0%
so they maintain a very independent
 
03:50:32.819 --> 03:50:34.670 align:start position:0%
so they maintain a very independent
campus

03:50:34.670 --> 03:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
campus
 
03:50:37.010 --> 03:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
uh you can see in the next slide similar
 
03:50:38.090 --> 03:50:38.100 align:start position:0%
to the New Hampshire hospital
 
03:50:40.849 --> 03:50:40.859 align:start position:0%
presentation where they fall in the
 
03:50:43.429 --> 03:50:43.439 align:start position:0%
mental health system
 
03:50:45.650 --> 03:50:45.660 align:start position:0%
and I won't go through each individual
 
03:50:47.690 --> 03:50:47.700 align:start position:0%
but they're all very highly skilled you
 
03:50:50.210 --> 03:50:50.220 align:start position:0%
can see the title in the tenures of the
 
03:50:53.269 --> 03:50:53.279 align:start position:0%
Glencliff comb um key leaders I do want
 
03:50:54.889 --> 03:50:54.899 align:start position:0%
to spend a moment talking about their
 
03:50:56.570 --> 03:50:56.580 align:start position:0%
staff and their vacancies which you
 
03:50:59.990 --> 03:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
asked about Mr chairman they have 168
 
03:51:02.510 --> 03:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
full-time State positions currently
 
03:51:05.210 --> 03:51:05.220 align:start position:0%
there's 60 vacancies or a 36 percent
 
03:51:06.650 --> 03:51:06.660 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate
 
03:51:10.130 --> 03:51:10.140 align:start position:0%
51 part-time State positions they have
 
03:51:12.110 --> 03:51:12.120 align:start position:0%
51 part-time State positions and
 
03:51:15.469 --> 03:51:15.479 align:start position:0%
currently 32 vacancies or a 63 vacancy
 
03:51:15.479 --> 03:51:16.309 align:start position:0%
currently 32 vacancies or a 63 vacancy
rate

03:51:16.309 --> 03:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
rate
 
03:51:18.469 --> 03:51:18.479 align:start position:0%
currently they have five contracted
 
03:51:20.769 --> 03:51:20.779 align:start position:0%
nurses as well as the medical director
 
03:51:23.269 --> 03:51:23.279 align:start position:0%
their medical director is also a
 
03:51:25.429 --> 03:51:25.439 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth employee similar to New
 
03:51:27.290 --> 03:51:27.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospitals set up
 
03:51:29.570 --> 03:51:29.580 align:start position:0%
other non-employee providers include
 
03:51:31.910 --> 03:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
their Primary Care aprns registered
 
03:51:33.889 --> 03:51:33.899 align:start position:0%
dietitians and of course their rehab
 
03:51:33.899 --> 03:51:36.729 align:start position:0%
dietitians and of course their rehab
staff

03:51:36.729 --> 03:51:36.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:39.469 --> 03:51:39.479 align:start position:0%
eligibility we don't have to obviously
 
03:51:41.990 --> 03:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
go through these in detail but there is
 
03:51:44.150 --> 03:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
specific eligibility that needs to be
 
03:51:46.370 --> 03:51:46.380 align:start position:0%
met in order for someone to reside at
 
03:51:47.990 --> 03:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
Glen Cliff home
 
03:51:48.000 --> 03:51:49.130 align:start position:0%
Glen Cliff home
um

03:51:49.130 --> 03:51:49.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:51.950 --> 03:51:51.960 align:start position:0%
one of those is really
 
03:51:54.229 --> 03:51:54.239 align:start position:0%
you know significant in that these
 
03:51:56.269 --> 03:51:56.279 align:start position:0%
individuals are referred to other
 
03:51:58.370 --> 03:51:58.380 align:start position:0%
nursing homes throughout the state and
 
03:52:00.349 --> 03:52:00.359 align:start position:0%
need to be declined admission to those
 
03:52:02.630 --> 03:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
facilities before becoming eligible to
 
03:52:04.490 --> 03:52:04.500 align:start position:0%
be at Glencliff home
 
03:52:07.070 --> 03:52:07.080 align:start position:0%
um obviously the department in the state
 
03:52:09.050 --> 03:52:09.060 align:start position:0%
works hard as was previously mentioned
 
03:52:11.510 --> 03:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
having these individuals reside in their
 
03:52:12.849 --> 03:52:12.859 align:start position:0%
community of choice
 
03:52:16.190 --> 03:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
so at times they end up needing to
 
03:52:19.610 --> 03:52:19.620 align:start position:0%
reside at Glencliff home due to criteria
 
03:52:23.090 --> 03:52:23.100 align:start position:0%
that other nursing facilities aren't
 
03:52:25.729 --> 03:52:25.739 align:start position:0%
capable of managing and oftentimes that
 
03:52:27.830 --> 03:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
has to do with their mental illness or
 
03:52:27.840 --> 03:52:30.889 align:start position:0%
has to do with their mental illness or
disabilities

03:52:30.889 --> 03:52:30.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:33.110 --> 03:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
um there are currents on the wait I'm
 
03:52:34.910 --> 03:52:34.920 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm just jumping ahead on the wait
 
03:52:38.150 --> 03:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
list where there's 26 on the wait list
 
03:52:41.330 --> 03:52:41.340 align:start position:0%
that that don't work were those 26 you
 
03:52:44.510 --> 03:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
got 38 and then 12 of them are in the
 
03:52:47.090 --> 03:52:47.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital what what's going
 
03:52:49.370 --> 03:52:49.380 align:start position:0%
on with the other 26. so my
 
03:52:51.349 --> 03:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
understanding of the other 26 are
 
03:52:54.410 --> 03:52:54.420 align:start position:0%
individuals who are residing in other
 
03:52:57.410 --> 03:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
nursing homes currently in those nursing
 
03:52:58.790 --> 03:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
homes believe that they need a different
 
03:53:01.429 --> 03:53:01.439 align:start position:0%
level of care to support their mental
 
03:53:04.070 --> 03:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
illness they also could be residing in
 
03:53:06.170 --> 03:53:06.180 align:start position:0%
hospitals needing long-term care
 
03:53:08.330 --> 03:53:08.340 align:start position:0%
placement but being those hospitals
 
03:53:10.729 --> 03:53:10.739 align:start position:0%
being unsuccessful in their ability to
 
03:53:12.710 --> 03:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
discharge them to other community
 
03:53:15.710 --> 03:53:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:15.720 --> 03:53:16.849 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:53:16.849 --> 03:53:16.859 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:53:16.859 --> 03:53:22.570 align:start position:0%
foreign
unattended

03:53:22.570 --> 03:53:22.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:24.650 --> 03:53:24.660 align:start position:0%
independent and to the point where
 
03:53:26.990 --> 03:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
they're danger to themselves or others
 
03:53:29.870 --> 03:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
no um generally those individuals who
 
03:53:31.250 --> 03:53:31.260 align:start position:0%
would be a danger to themselves or
 
03:53:32.389 --> 03:53:32.399 align:start position:0%
others would be at New Hampshire
 
03:53:34.550 --> 03:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
hospital first and they would make up
 
03:53:36.170 --> 03:53:36.180 align:start position:0%
the 12 individuals that you see
 
03:53:39.469 --> 03:53:39.479 align:start position:0%
currently on the wait list thank you
 
03:53:41.690 --> 03:53:41.700 align:start position:0%
um so their current census as of
 
03:53:45.170 --> 03:53:45.180 align:start position:0%
yesterday is 70 when they are fully
 
03:53:48.830 --> 03:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
staffed they have the capacity for 120.
 
03:53:51.830 --> 03:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
currently they're capped capacity is at
 
03:53:55.790 --> 03:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
75 and that is due to their Staffing
 
03:53:57.790 --> 03:53:57.800 align:start position:0%
constraints that I previously mentioned
 
03:54:02.269 --> 03:54:02.279 align:start position:0%
primarily nursing staff RN and LPN staff
 
03:54:06.290 --> 03:54:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:08.929 --> 03:54:08.939 align:start position:0%
um they do receive numerous calls and
 
03:54:11.570 --> 03:54:11.580 align:start position:0%
inquiries about the availability
 
03:54:14.269 --> 03:54:14.279 align:start position:0%
um but they but glencliffe home does
 
03:54:16.729 --> 03:54:16.739 align:start position:0%
have to inform individuals that there is
 
03:54:19.010 --> 03:54:19.020 align:start position:0%
often a wait time up to or sometimes
 
03:54:21.469 --> 03:54:21.479 align:start position:0%
over a year for individuals to be able
 
03:54:24.769 --> 03:54:24.779 align:start position:0%
to receive a bet at glencliffe
 
03:54:27.410 --> 03:54:27.420 align:start position:0%
some other important information which
 
03:54:30.170 --> 03:54:30.180 align:start position:0%
speaks to some of the capital needs and
 
03:54:32.809 --> 03:54:32.819 align:start position:0%
some of the facilities maintenance and
 
03:54:34.849 --> 03:54:34.859 align:start position:0%
sustainability that you asked about Mr
 
03:54:34.859 --> 03:54:36.250 align:start position:0%
sustainability that you asked about Mr
chair

03:54:36.250 --> 03:54:36.260 align:start position:0%
chair
 
03:54:38.809 --> 03:54:38.819 align:start position:0%
they have a number of ongoing Capital
 
03:54:42.469 --> 03:54:42.479 align:start position:0%
project needs currently one of them is a
 
03:54:44.349 --> 03:54:44.359 align:start position:0%
roofing project
 
03:54:48.229 --> 03:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
and that is inclusive of half of the
 
03:54:50.210 --> 03:54:50.220 align:start position:0%
resident housing portion of their main
 
03:54:50.220 --> 03:54:51.170 align:start position:0%
resident housing portion of their main
building

03:54:51.170 --> 03:54:51.180 align:start position:0%
building
 
03:54:54.830 --> 03:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
they also are working on an electrical
 
03:54:56.929 --> 03:54:56.939 align:start position:0%
enhancement which will double double
 
03:55:00.410 --> 03:55:00.420 align:start position:0%
their hydroelectric output and
 
03:55:03.830 --> 03:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
um desire to install Steam turbines and
 
03:55:06.889 --> 03:55:06.899 align:start position:0%
that goal is to support 85 percent of
 
03:55:08.050 --> 03:55:08.060 align:start position:0%
the campus
 
03:55:11.570 --> 03:55:11.580 align:start position:0%
electricity will be renewable or free
 
03:55:12.769 --> 03:55:12.779 align:start position:0%
which is
 
03:55:12.779 --> 03:55:14.450 align:start position:0%
which is
important

03:55:14.450 --> 03:55:14.460 align:start position:0%
important
 
03:55:16.490 --> 03:55:16.500 align:start position:0%
um and their potable water upgrade for
 
03:55:18.469 --> 03:55:18.479 align:start position:0%
three million dollars which creates a
 
03:55:20.389 --> 03:55:20.399 align:start position:0%
more secure system with backup sources
 
03:55:23.090 --> 03:55:23.100 align:start position:0%
so so these are literally in the capital
 
03:55:25.550 --> 03:55:25.560 align:start position:0%
budget and not we're not doing General
 
03:55:27.170 --> 03:55:27.180 align:start position:0%
funds on any of these this is
 
03:55:28.969 --> 03:55:28.979 align:start position:0%
situational awareness so we know what's
 
03:55:32.689 --> 03:55:32.699 align:start position:0%
going on correct okay that's good do we
 
03:55:37.070 --> 03:55:37.080 align:start position:0%
um what what sort of the the long-term
 
03:55:40.510 --> 03:55:40.520 align:start position:0%
planning on facility replacement
 
03:55:43.790 --> 03:55:43.800 align:start position:0%
are we 20 years away from needing a new
 
03:55:45.830 --> 03:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
building a different building are we 50
 
03:55:48.290 --> 03:55:48.300 align:start position:0%
years I mean if this was built in 1906
 
03:55:52.309 --> 03:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
this is an aging real estate stock
 
03:55:55.610 --> 03:55:55.620 align:start position:0%
yeah um it I'm not I'm not really sure I
 
03:55:59.150 --> 03:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
can answer that question but I can say
 
03:56:02.809 --> 03:56:02.819 align:start position:0%
that you know the department does
 
03:56:05.689 --> 03:56:05.699 align:start position:0%
try to put Capital needs forward and be
 
03:56:07.729 --> 03:56:07.739 align:start position:0%
able to get them addressed via the
 
03:56:09.410 --> 03:56:09.420 align:start position:0%
capital budget to continue to help
 
03:56:11.570 --> 03:56:11.580 align:start position:0%
support Glenn Cliff's operational
 
03:56:14.809 --> 03:56:14.819 align:start position:0%
capability there is a budget that was
 
03:56:16.790 --> 03:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
put forth in this most recent budget
 
03:56:20.389 --> 03:56:20.399 align:start position:0%
cycle that fully funds their continued
 
03:56:24.469 --> 03:56:24.479 align:start position:0%
operations so yes it is aging and yes
 
03:56:27.349 --> 03:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
they are starting to see some increased
 
03:56:31.130 --> 03:56:31.140 align:start position:0%
facility based needs however
 
03:56:32.809 --> 03:56:32.819 align:start position:0%
you know the the department is
 
03:56:34.550 --> 03:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
supporting those needs to the best of
 
03:56:37.670 --> 03:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
its ability to keep them operational
 
03:56:40.729 --> 03:56:40.739 align:start position:0%
okay so someday I'd like to hear when we
 
03:56:41.750 --> 03:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
think we're going to have to start
 
03:56:44.229 --> 03:56:44.239 align:start position:0%
replacing buildings
 
03:56:47.450 --> 03:56:47.460 align:start position:0%
all right do we have any other questions
 
03:56:49.910 --> 03:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
you do you think you hit the high high
 
03:56:51.349 --> 03:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
points uh
 
03:56:53.090 --> 03:56:53.100 align:start position:0%
I think so uh
 
03:56:55.250 --> 03:56:55.260 align:start position:0%
you know if folks have questions about
 
03:56:58.070 --> 03:56:58.080 align:start position:0%
Glencliff home um Todd Bickford is
 
03:57:00.229 --> 03:57:00.239 align:start position:0%
always happy to talk about the facility
 
03:57:02.150 --> 03:57:02.160 align:start position:0%
always happy to give tours it's a
 
03:57:04.729 --> 03:57:04.739 align:start position:0%
beautiful campus they do a really a
 
03:57:06.469 --> 03:57:06.479 align:start position:0%
tremendous job up there in their care
 
03:57:08.990 --> 03:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
and support of what are sometimes very
 
03:57:11.510 --> 03:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
challenging and difficult residents to
 
03:57:14.450 --> 03:57:14.460 align:start position:0%
care for and
 
03:57:17.330 --> 03:57:17.340 align:start position:0%
yeah they do a phenomenal job so because
 
03:57:19.490 --> 03:57:19.500 align:start position:0%
you're so isolated I gotta imagine you
 
03:57:22.969 --> 03:57:22.979 align:start position:0%
have harder trout time filling vacancies
 
03:57:25.910 --> 03:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
than other facilities that it's hard to
 
03:57:29.510 --> 03:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
get to your facility they do have some
 
03:57:31.610 --> 03:57:31.620 align:start position:0%
significant vacancy concerns but one of
 
03:57:34.070 --> 03:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
the really nice things that is on their
 
03:57:36.889 --> 03:57:36.899 align:start position:0%
side when it comes to vacancy is that
 
03:57:39.590 --> 03:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
campus actually also has housing for
 
03:57:43.309 --> 03:57:43.319 align:start position:0%
agency staff there's additional houses
 
03:57:45.650 --> 03:57:45.660 align:start position:0%
you can see from the bird's eye view of
 
03:57:47.389 --> 03:57:47.399 align:start position:0%
the campus there's a number of
 
03:57:49.849 --> 03:57:49.859 align:start position:0%
facilities or buildings located on that
 
03:57:52.070 --> 03:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
campus some of which actually their
 
03:57:54.769 --> 03:57:54.779 align:start position:0%
nursing agency staff reside in for the
 
03:57:57.349 --> 03:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
duration of their agency contract so
 
03:57:59.330 --> 03:57:59.340 align:start position:0%
that really has been helpful for them to
 
03:58:02.210 --> 03:58:02.220 align:start position:0%
be able to maintain a decent level of
 
03:58:05.269 --> 03:58:05.279 align:start position:0%
Staffing with agency utilization and
 
03:58:07.070 --> 03:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
those agency nurses not having to pay
 
03:58:09.170 --> 03:58:09.180 align:start position:0%
for housing for the duration of their
 
03:58:09.180 --> 03:58:10.189 align:start position:0%
for housing for the duration of their
contract

03:58:10.189 --> 03:58:10.199 align:start position:0%
contract
 
03:58:13.729 --> 03:58:13.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:15.590 --> 03:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
just quickly I'm looking ahead at the
 
03:58:18.050 --> 03:58:18.060 align:start position:0%
the future needs and challenges and the
 
03:58:19.189 --> 03:58:19.199 align:start position:0%
fact that
 
03:58:21.110 --> 03:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
um again on my previous statement about
 
03:58:23.450 --> 03:58:23.460 align:start position:0%
keeping patients connected to their
 
03:58:25.790 --> 03:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
Community Family and support network
 
03:58:28.670 --> 03:58:28.680 align:start position:0%
no cell service no Wi-Fi
 
03:58:31.969 --> 03:58:31.979 align:start position:0%
which is to me heartbreaking that these
 
03:58:34.189 --> 03:58:34.199 align:start position:0%
people have no connection to those that
 
03:58:35.570 --> 03:58:35.580 align:start position:0%
love them
 
03:58:38.330 --> 03:58:38.340 align:start position:0%
um but yet I imagine the staff has Wi-Fi
 
03:58:41.210 --> 03:58:41.220 align:start position:0%
so what are some of the are you saying
 
03:58:43.189 --> 03:58:43.199 align:start position:0%
no no the staff doesn't have Wi-Fi how
 
03:58:45.769 --> 03:58:45.779 align:start position:0%
does the how do you function without
 
03:58:47.990 --> 03:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
so there's not a guest network but there
 
03:58:50.990 --> 03:58:51.000 align:start position:0%
is Wi-Fi that is able to support the
 
03:58:54.110 --> 03:58:54.120 align:start position:0%
state computer-based systems okay yeah
 
03:58:56.809 --> 03:58:56.819 align:start position:0%
yes do you have sorry do you have an
 
03:59:00.050 --> 03:59:00.060 align:start position:0%
idea of what step up could be would be
 
03:59:01.790 --> 03:59:01.800 align:start position:0%
needed to
 
03:59:01.800 --> 03:59:04.370 align:start position:0%
needed to
expand

03:59:04.370 --> 03:59:04.380 align:start position:0%
expand
 
03:59:06.410 --> 03:59:06.420 align:start position:0%
um well I know Dave Wieters is here from
 
03:59:07.849 --> 03:59:07.859 align:start position:0%
the IT department
 
03:59:11.570 --> 03:59:11.580 align:start position:0%
um so I'm not I'm not sure in my role if
 
03:59:13.370 --> 03:59:13.380 align:start position:0%
there's been any work or assessment done
 
03:59:17.090 --> 03:59:17.100 align:start position:0%
to be able to enhance that network but
 
03:59:18.849 --> 03:59:18.859 align:start position:0%
that's fine thank you
 
03:59:22.309 --> 03:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
yours is a valid concern and we had a
 
03:59:24.710 --> 03:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
similar issue two years ago when we
 
03:59:26.630 --> 03:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
started looking at the veterans home
 
03:59:29.450 --> 03:59:29.460 align:start position:0%
that they they didn't really have Wi-Fi
 
03:59:31.610 --> 03:59:31.620 align:start position:0%
support for the patients they had it for
 
03:59:35.269 --> 03:59:35.279 align:start position:0%
the staff and for the operations but
 
03:59:37.370 --> 03:59:37.380 align:start position:0%
they since we're able to take some
 
03:59:40.790 --> 03:59:40.800 align:start position:0%
federal money and upgrade and I think
 
03:59:43.010 --> 03:59:43.020 align:start position:0%
they put in a separate wi-fi system for
 
03:59:46.790 --> 03:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
the patients so I I Mr wieders is here
 
03:59:48.530 --> 03:59:48.540 align:start position:0%
you can correct everything I just said
 
03:59:50.990 --> 03:59:51.000 align:start position:0%
so representative Waller do you have
 
03:59:53.689 --> 03:59:53.699 align:start position:0%
just a really quick one
 
03:59:55.250 --> 03:59:55.260 align:start position:0%
um I know that
 
03:59:58.010 --> 03:59:58.020 align:start position:0%
these are elderly patients many of them
 
04:00:00.229 --> 04:00:00.239 align:start position:0%
but I remember a couple of years ago
 
04:00:00.239 --> 04:00:02.090 align:start position:0%
but I remember a couple of years ago
when

04:00:02.090 --> 04:00:02.100 align:start position:0%
when
 
04:00:04.610 --> 04:00:04.620 align:start position:0%
we're talking about glencliffe that they
 
04:00:06.710 --> 04:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
were starting to have a program where
 
04:00:09.710 --> 04:00:09.720 align:start position:0%
they were doing some discharge and is
 
04:00:11.750 --> 04:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
that still is that still happening yes
 
04:00:11.760 --> 04:00:13.070 align:start position:0%
that still is that still happening yes
absolutely

04:00:13.070 --> 04:00:13.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
04:00:15.349 --> 04:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
um it's not very it's not extremely
 
04:00:18.050 --> 04:00:18.060 align:start position:0%
frequent that residents discharge from
 
04:00:20.389 --> 04:00:20.399 align:start position:0%
that facility but absolutely if the
 
04:00:22.670 --> 04:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity presents itself or there's
 
04:00:24.290 --> 04:00:24.300 align:start position:0%
something closer to home for that
 
04:00:27.710 --> 04:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
individual or their level of care is
 
04:00:29.030 --> 04:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
able to be met due to family
 
04:00:31.610 --> 04:00:31.620 align:start position:0%
circumstances and in their actual home
 
04:00:33.769 --> 04:00:33.779 align:start position:0%
environment then they would absolutely
 
04:00:37.510 --> 04:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
work on discharging those individuals
 
04:00:41.030 --> 04:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
I don't know I my instinct on that is
 
04:00:45.590 --> 04:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
that 85 90 probably expire while
 
04:00:50.030 --> 04:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
residents uh and don't get discharged
 
04:00:52.130 --> 04:00:52.140 align:start position:0%
I would say that's probably pretty close
 
04:00:56.150 --> 04:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:59.450 --> 04:00:59.460 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you so much
 
04:01:02.030 --> 04:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
and now I think we're ready for I the it
 
04:01:02.040 --> 04:01:29.030 align:start position:0%
and now I think we're ready for I the it
minute

04:01:29.030 --> 04:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:32.990 --> 04:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
go ahead introduce yourself and let's go
 
04:01:34.969 --> 04:01:34.979 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is David Wieters
 
04:01:36.590 --> 04:01:36.600 align:start position:0%
I'm the information Services director
 
04:01:39.590 --> 04:01:39.600 align:start position:0%
for DHHS and in partnership with the
 
04:01:41.210 --> 04:01:41.220 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire we
 
04:01:44.330 --> 04:01:44.340 align:start position:0%
we do almost of all of our I.T work with
 
04:01:46.010 --> 04:01:46.020 align:start position:0%
commissioner Goulet in the department of
 
04:01:47.630 --> 04:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
Information Technology so I'll let him
 
04:01:49.610 --> 04:01:49.620 align:start position:0%
introduce himself
 
04:01:52.250 --> 04:01:52.260 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh Mr chair and members
 
04:01:56.689 --> 04:01:56.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:56.699 --> 04:01:57.950 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:01:57.950 --> 04:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:01:57.960 --> 04:01:58.729 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:01:58.729 --> 04:01:58.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:00.469 --> 04:02:00.479 align:start position:0%
the fun thing about Information Services
 
04:02:03.050 --> 04:02:03.060 align:start position:0%
in it is we touch just about everything
 
04:02:06.650 --> 04:02:06.660 align:start position:0%
so it can be very complex I will try not
 
04:02:09.650 --> 04:02:09.660 align:start position:0%
to use any three-letter acronyms stop me
 
04:02:11.090 --> 04:02:11.100 align:start position:0%
if there's anything that I'm getting too
 
04:02:14.570 --> 04:02:14.580 align:start position:0%
technical on as we go forward but one of
 
04:02:16.370 --> 04:02:16.380 align:start position:0%
the things I'd like to make sure that we
 
04:02:19.389 --> 04:02:19.399 align:start position:0%
impress upon this this committee is that
 
04:02:21.950 --> 04:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
all the services and programs that we
 
04:02:24.590 --> 04:02:24.600 align:start position:0%
offer throughout DHHS are dependent upon
 
04:02:24.600 --> 04:02:25.729 align:start position:0%
offer throughout DHHS are dependent upon
technology

04:02:25.729 --> 04:02:25.739 align:start position:0%
technology
 
04:02:29.210 --> 04:02:29.220 align:start position:0%
so without those the technology we do
 
04:02:31.610 --> 04:02:31.620 align:start position:0%
have difficulties actually providing for
 
04:02:34.189 --> 04:02:34.199 align:start position:0%
that efficiency and point-of-care
 
04:02:34.199 --> 04:02:35.269 align:start position:0%
that efficiency and point-of-care
solutions

04:02:35.269 --> 04:02:35.279 align:start position:0%
solutions
 
04:02:37.309 --> 04:02:37.319 align:start position:0%
and so when you go through the budget
 
04:02:40.550 --> 04:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
you'll see a large line item for class
 
04:02:43.550 --> 04:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
27 transfer over to the Department of
 
04:02:45.410 --> 04:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
Information Technology and it's just one
 
04:02:47.630 --> 04:02:47.640 align:start position:0%
line item in our budget but several line
 
04:02:49.910 --> 04:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
items and doit's budget
 
04:02:52.309 --> 04:02:52.319 align:start position:0%
and and then also throughout the budget
 
04:02:54.650 --> 04:02:54.660 align:start position:0%
you'll see components in the programs
 
04:02:58.189 --> 04:02:58.199 align:start position:0%
that are talking about their I.T systems
 
04:02:59.630 --> 04:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
like the Medicaid management information
 
04:03:02.450 --> 04:03:02.460 align:start position:0%
system and whatnot that is also funded
 
04:03:05.630 --> 04:03:05.640 align:start position:0%
in our budget so it can be more complex
 
04:03:07.370 --> 04:03:07.380 align:start position:0%
and it's hard for us to point it out we
 
04:03:09.229 --> 04:03:09.239 align:start position:0%
usually do point it out as we go through
 
04:03:10.910 --> 04:03:10.920 align:start position:0%
our presentations during the budget
 
04:03:13.250 --> 04:03:13.260 align:start position:0%
season sessions
 
04:03:16.910 --> 04:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
so with that the on the second slide is
 
04:03:20.450 --> 04:03:20.460 align:start position:0%
really our agenda today I'm gonna look
 
04:03:22.189 --> 04:03:22.199 align:start position:0%
to you for cues in terms of time because
 
04:03:23.809 --> 04:03:23.819 align:start position:0%
I know we're a little bit past our
 
04:03:25.550 --> 04:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
original scheduled time so you tell me
 
04:03:27.590 --> 04:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
to speed up or slow down as you need me
 
04:03:31.550 --> 04:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
so so I I I am going to ask you to go a
 
04:03:33.650 --> 04:03:33.660 align:start position:0%
little out of order if you don't mind I
 
04:03:35.750 --> 04:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
can certainly do that if we if we could
 
04:03:39.309 --> 04:03:39.319 align:start position:0%
maybe start on page 13. because because
 
04:03:42.410 --> 04:03:42.420 align:start position:0%
at the end of this presentation
 
04:03:45.050 --> 04:03:45.060 align:start position:0%
what what I'm what I'm what I'm trying
 
04:03:48.950 --> 04:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
to understand is the extent to which uh
 
04:03:51.050 --> 04:03:51.060 align:start position:0%
you're you're integrated with the
 
04:03:53.210 --> 04:03:53.220 align:start position:0%
management the Senior Management of the
 
04:03:54.710 --> 04:03:54.720 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
04:03:57.290 --> 04:03:57.300 align:start position:0%
you have to look at because I'm speaking
 
04:04:00.290 --> 04:04:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:03.650 --> 04:04:03.660 align:start position:0%
okay so there we have the Strategic
 
04:04:05.809 --> 04:04:05.819 align:start position:0%
vision and priorities of the
 
04:04:08.510 --> 04:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the DHHS and the
 
04:04:11.150 --> 04:04:11.160 align:start position:0%
leadership team establishing these are
 
04:04:13.250 --> 04:04:13.260 align:start position:0%
the things we must do
 
04:04:16.250 --> 04:04:16.260 align:start position:0%
and the I.T people coming in because I I
 
04:04:18.889 --> 04:04:18.899 align:start position:0%
think this is the way you think is for
 
04:04:21.650 --> 04:04:21.660 align:start position:0%
every strategic initiative the I.T
 
04:04:23.929 --> 04:04:23.939 align:start position:0%
implications and support plan has to be
 
04:04:26.870 --> 04:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
in place and for the commissioner's
 
04:04:28.910 --> 04:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
priorities there needs to be an I.T
 
04:04:32.389 --> 04:04:32.399 align:start position:0%
priority and we chunk down that list of
 
04:04:35.570 --> 04:04:35.580 align:start position:0%
support until we get to the point where
 
04:04:38.870 --> 04:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
there's all that other stuff that has to
 
04:04:41.450 --> 04:04:41.460 align:start position:0%
be done just on a day-to-day basis to
 
04:04:44.210 --> 04:04:44.220 align:start position:0%
keep everything running you know that
 
04:04:45.950 --> 04:04:45.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily map into her
 
04:04:48.050 --> 04:04:48.060 align:start position:0%
priorities but Maps into just keeping
 
04:04:50.389 --> 04:04:50.399 align:start position:0%
the office open so I want to understand
 
04:04:54.530 --> 04:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
the extent to which uh you are you are
 
04:04:58.309 --> 04:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
hearing the the Commissioners strategy
 
04:05:00.050 --> 04:05:00.060 align:start position:0%
and how you're supporting the
 
04:05:02.150 --> 04:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner's strategy and then if
 
04:05:04.070 --> 04:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
you're having problems with resourcing
 
04:05:06.110 --> 04:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
or Personnel because everyone's short
 
04:05:07.790 --> 04:05:07.800 align:start position:0%
something right so do you have enough
 
04:05:09.530 --> 04:05:09.540 align:start position:0%
project managers how you're doing that
 
04:05:12.410 --> 04:05:12.420 align:start position:0%
I'm look that's the that's the Strategic
 
04:05:15.469 --> 04:05:15.479 align:start position:0%
lay down I'm trying to to get today and
 
04:05:18.530 --> 04:05:18.540 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe starting at 13 may be a good
 
04:05:21.110 --> 04:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
spot yes
 
04:05:23.269 --> 04:05:23.279 align:start position:0%
so commissioner Goulet is going to kick
 
04:05:24.710 --> 04:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
it off I'll kick that off and I'll let
 
04:05:27.830 --> 04:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
David uh do the color commentary
 
04:05:29.450 --> 04:05:29.460 align:start position:0%
um you know our strategic planning
 
04:05:30.889 --> 04:05:30.899 align:start position:0%
starts with
 
04:05:33.050 --> 04:05:33.060 align:start position:0%
um you know we do uh we have a published
 
04:05:35.269 --> 04:05:35.279 align:start position:0%
strategic plan out on our doit website
 
04:05:38.750 --> 04:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
that's publicly available and we we um
 
04:05:40.849 --> 04:05:40.859 align:start position:0%
rev that every two or three years and
 
04:05:43.490 --> 04:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
it's a very high level plan and
 
04:05:46.969 --> 04:05:46.979 align:start position:0%
and it what it does is it considers the
 
04:05:49.969 --> 04:05:49.979 align:start position:0%
Strategic plans or the Strategic plans
 
04:05:52.130 --> 04:05:52.140 align:start position:0%
for each agency by Statute I can't
 
04:05:53.870 --> 04:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
remember the statute now but each agency
 
04:05:56.750 --> 04:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
is required to do a what they call it
 
04:05:59.330 --> 04:05:59.340 align:start position:0%
Agency information technology plan or
 
04:06:02.090 --> 04:06:02.100 align:start position:0%
aitp is what we call it so
 
04:06:04.849 --> 04:06:04.859 align:start position:0%
um what what DHHS and other agencies do
 
04:06:08.090 --> 04:06:08.100 align:start position:0%
is we we work with them to create this
 
04:06:11.450 --> 04:06:11.460 align:start position:0%
aitp which is a reflection of business
 
04:06:11.460 --> 04:06:13.550 align:start position:0%
aitp which is a reflection of business
priorities

04:06:13.550 --> 04:06:13.560 align:start position:0%
priorities
 
04:06:17.630 --> 04:06:17.640 align:start position:0%
uh put into it lingo so we start with
 
04:06:20.090 --> 04:06:20.100 align:start position:0%
the business we move to it as you you
 
04:06:22.910 --> 04:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
had pointed out the the overall
 
04:06:25.250 --> 04:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
Statewide strategic plan looks at the
 
04:06:27.189 --> 04:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
common themes across all agencies
 
04:06:30.650 --> 04:06:30.660 align:start position:0%
particularly the large ones and
 
04:06:32.269 --> 04:06:32.279 align:start position:0%
and then there's some obvious ones like
 
04:06:33.889 --> 04:06:33.899 align:start position:0%
cyber security is a pillar in our
 
04:06:35.510 --> 04:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
overall strategic plan because we have
 
04:06:37.250 --> 04:06:37.260 align:start position:0%
to do that we couldn't survive without
 
04:06:39.950 --> 04:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
it so that it's it's a pretty well
 
04:06:41.990 --> 04:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
um it's a pretty well
 
04:06:44.090 --> 04:06:44.100 align:start position:0%
um done process I think and we keep
 
04:06:45.889 --> 04:06:45.899 align:start position:0%
trying to evolve it each biennium we do
 
04:06:48.889 --> 04:06:48.899 align:start position:0%
this fully on a biennial basis so what
 
04:06:52.250 --> 04:06:52.260 align:start position:0%
you should expect is that when an agency
 
04:06:55.370 --> 04:06:55.380 align:start position:0%
comes in with a budget request that um
 
04:06:58.189 --> 04:06:58.199 align:start position:0%
that is say additional or whatever it
 
04:06:59.630 --> 04:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
should align with the agency Information
 
04:07:01.910 --> 04:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
Technology plan and be supported by the
 
04:07:05.750 --> 04:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
overall Statewide strategic plan as well
 
04:07:08.210 --> 04:07:08.220 align:start position:0%
and thank you for that that that's good
 
04:07:11.510 --> 04:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
context and the thing that's driving my
 
04:07:13.729 --> 04:07:13.739 align:start position:0%
wanting to to bring this up in front of
 
04:07:17.510 --> 04:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
division three is uh the the accumulated
 
04:07:21.170 --> 04:07:21.180 align:start position:0%
experience on the fiscal committee where
 
04:07:24.410 --> 04:07:24.420 align:start position:0%
an individual item will come in and
 
04:07:27.170 --> 04:07:27.180 align:start position:0%
there'll be an I.T component to it and
 
04:07:30.110 --> 04:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
the IT component will on paper look like
 
04:07:32.090 --> 04:07:32.100 align:start position:0%
oh yeah we're going to put some money
 
04:07:34.130 --> 04:07:34.140 align:start position:0%
and we've got some manpower to do it and
 
04:07:36.050 --> 04:07:36.060 align:start position:0%
we're just going to go do this thing to
 
04:07:38.990 --> 04:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
support this this this initial this one
 
04:07:39.000 --> 04:07:40.490 align:start position:0%
support this this this initial this one
initiative

04:07:40.490 --> 04:07:40.500 align:start position:0%
initiative
 
04:07:43.849 --> 04:07:43.859 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't have context at that
 
04:07:47.030 --> 04:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
point of the transaction of where that
 
04:07:48.889 --> 04:07:48.899 align:start position:0%
initiative fits into the big picture
 
04:07:52.490 --> 04:07:52.500 align:start position:0%
we're we're getting like buckshot
 
04:07:55.910 --> 04:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
IT projects all over the place and just
 
04:07:57.950 --> 04:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
this overall sense
 
04:08:01.729 --> 04:08:01.739 align:start position:0%
I have I'm left with is how how is all
 
04:08:06.370 --> 04:08:06.380 align:start position:0%
of this ran seeming Randomness being
 
04:08:11.389 --> 04:08:11.399 align:start position:0%
managed in a strategic construct and or
 
04:08:14.030 --> 04:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
is it and I'm sure it is because you're
 
04:08:16.250 --> 04:08:16.260 align:start position:0%
both really good but
 
04:08:18.590 --> 04:08:18.600 align:start position:0%
so that's what's been driving me for
 
04:08:20.530 --> 04:08:20.540 align:start position:0%
this today's briefing is to understand
 
04:08:25.010 --> 04:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
you know like like so so when dcyf shows
 
04:08:27.410 --> 04:08:27.420 align:start position:0%
up and they they and and in their budget
 
04:08:29.750 --> 04:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
they're talking about dcyf money and
 
04:08:31.910 --> 04:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
they say but we have this I.T thing we
 
04:08:33.590 --> 04:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
want to do
 
04:08:36.110 --> 04:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
um I I want to know that there's a way
 
04:08:38.809 --> 04:08:38.819 align:start position:0%
to to go from that it project in that
 
04:08:42.110 --> 04:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
department in that department and tie it
 
04:08:44.510 --> 04:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
into the big picture what you're doing
 
04:08:48.229 --> 04:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
from an I.T management perspective
 
04:08:50.389 --> 04:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
and I'm not I'm not meaning to throw you
 
04:08:52.550 --> 04:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
off I'm just trying to let you know if
 
04:08:54.650 --> 04:08:54.660 align:start position:0%
we don't get there today that's okay
 
04:08:57.650 --> 04:08:57.660 align:start position:0%
that's it's just that's where I where I
 
04:09:01.070 --> 04:09:01.080 align:start position:0%
want us to be able to have conversations
 
04:09:03.469 --> 04:09:03.479 align:start position:0%
sounds good Mr chairman I think if you
 
04:09:05.630 --> 04:09:05.640 align:start position:0%
let me start from a little bit closer to
 
04:09:07.429 --> 04:09:07.439 align:start position:0%
the beginning you'll understand some of
 
04:09:09.290 --> 04:09:09.300 align:start position:0%
the structure that we do have in place
 
04:09:11.510 --> 04:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
like the project management office our
 
04:09:14.150 --> 04:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
security privacy components and how that
 
04:09:17.269 --> 04:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
all filters into when dcyf has a request
 
04:09:19.189 --> 04:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
for comprehensive travel for information
 
04:09:22.790 --> 04:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
system how does that get onto our list
 
04:09:26.030 --> 04:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
to support them and move it forward to
 
04:09:28.670 --> 04:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
completion to provide those services but
 
04:09:30.229 --> 04:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
I will go quickly through those first
 
04:09:32.030 --> 04:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
like 10 slides and then we can jump in
 
04:09:34.670 --> 04:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
right into the division I.T does that
 
04:09:34.680 --> 04:09:37.250 align:start position:0%
right into the division I.T does that
work

04:09:37.250 --> 04:09:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:37.260 --> 04:09:38.889 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:09:38.889 --> 04:09:38.899 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:09:42.349 --> 04:09:42.359 align:start position:0%
starting on the third slide fourth slide
 
04:09:44.510 --> 04:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
there Information Services
 
04:09:46.790 --> 04:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
so the information Services team which
 
04:09:48.950 --> 04:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
is part of the ocom division
 
04:09:52.490 --> 04:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
um within DHHS is really has 20 people
 
04:09:55.010 --> 04:09:55.020 align:start position:0%
and we those 20 people are really
 
04:09:57.469 --> 04:09:57.479 align:start position:0%
leaders in the organization to help
 
04:10:00.229 --> 04:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
facilitate Information Services going
 
04:10:03.170 --> 04:10:03.180 align:start position:0%
forward and we we use what's called
 
04:10:05.630 --> 04:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
Matrix management and that's a common
 
04:10:07.610 --> 04:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
term in I.T but really there's
 
04:10:10.309 --> 04:10:10.319 align:start position:0%
Information Services leads and managers
 
04:10:12.769 --> 04:10:12.779 align:start position:0%
throughout every division moving I.T
 
04:10:14.990 --> 04:10:15.000 align:start position:0%
Solutions forward with their doit
 
04:10:15.000 --> 04:10:16.429 align:start position:0%
Solutions forward with their doit
partners

04:10:16.429 --> 04:10:16.439 align:start position:0%
partners
 
04:10:19.250 --> 04:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
so these five areas that you have that
 
04:10:21.110 --> 04:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
you see in front of you strategic
 
04:10:23.630 --> 04:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
planning design and interoperability is
 
04:10:25.849 --> 04:10:25.859 align:start position:0%
really focused at a high level the 50
 
04:10:28.010 --> 04:10:28.020 align:start position:0%
000 foot level to try to understand what
 
04:10:29.929 --> 04:10:29.939 align:start position:0%
are those business decisions that we're
 
04:10:32.090 --> 04:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
doing like a forensic science a forensic
 
04:10:35.030 --> 04:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
Hospital coming forward what is that
 
04:10:36.710 --> 04:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
going to impact us from an I.T
 
04:10:39.229 --> 04:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
perspective well when we were looking at
 
04:10:40.790 --> 04:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
the acquisition of Hampstead Hospital
 
04:10:42.889 --> 04:10:42.899 align:start position:0%
how are we going to look at that and
 
04:10:44.809 --> 04:10:44.819 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're effective day one
 
04:10:47.330 --> 04:10:47.340 align:start position:0%
when we come on when they come on board
 
04:10:50.269 --> 04:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
so that that group really engages pretty
 
04:10:52.849 --> 04:10:52.859 align:start position:0%
quickly with the uit and the in the
 
04:10:54.710 --> 04:10:54.720 align:start position:0%
bureaus and the divisions to move it
 
04:10:54.720 --> 04:10:55.670 align:start position:0%
bureaus and the divisions to move it
forward

04:10:55.670 --> 04:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
forward
 
04:10:57.769 --> 04:10:57.779 align:start position:0%
the project management office which you
 
04:10:59.389 --> 04:10:59.399 align:start position:0%
were sort of alluding to in terms of
 
04:11:01.550 --> 04:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
process of getting how do we prioritize
 
04:11:04.610 --> 04:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
is really made up of nine people with
 
04:11:08.150 --> 04:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
with a pmo director employing the best
 
04:11:10.189 --> 04:11:10.199 align:start position:0%
practices and the next steps of where
 
04:11:12.950 --> 04:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
we're going with um project management
 
04:11:15.590 --> 04:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
and that's working with all the
 
04:11:18.110 --> 04:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
different what we call resource managers
 
04:11:20.389 --> 04:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
as well as the division directors to say
 
04:11:22.309 --> 04:11:22.319 align:start position:0%
what's a priority for you and how does
 
04:11:24.130 --> 04:11:24.140 align:start position:0%
that play in with all the other work
 
04:11:25.849 --> 04:11:25.859 align:start position:0%
workload that we have in the
 
04:11:28.130 --> 04:11:28.140 align:start position:0%
organization we've been working on that
 
04:11:30.830 --> 04:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
for the past year year and a half really
 
04:11:33.189 --> 04:11:33.199 align:start position:0%
diligently in the past five years
 
04:11:35.630 --> 04:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
through lean processing as well as
 
04:11:37.250 --> 04:11:37.260 align:start position:0%
project management and I think we're
 
04:11:39.950 --> 04:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
really at the the precipice or the
 
04:11:41.510 --> 04:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
Tipping Point to be able to start
 
04:11:43.910 --> 04:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
delivering on those best practices in
 
04:11:45.410 --> 04:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
this next coming year next coming
 
04:11:45.420 --> 04:11:47.030 align:start position:0%
this next coming year next coming
biennium

04:11:47.030 --> 04:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
04:11:48.590 --> 04:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
the last three that you see there
 
04:11:50.450 --> 04:11:50.460 align:start position:0%
information security and awareness that
 
04:11:53.570 --> 04:11:53.580 align:start position:0%
team right now is it has three employees
 
04:11:55.849 --> 04:11:55.859 align:start position:0%
one there's only one position currently
 
04:11:58.729 --> 04:11:58.739 align:start position:0%
filled to vacant and it partners with
 
04:12:01.429 --> 04:12:01.439 align:start position:0%
the privacy officer that I know you
 
04:12:03.290 --> 04:12:03.300 align:start position:0%
heard from uh commission interim
 
04:12:06.349 --> 04:12:06.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner Weaver the other day Kathy
 
04:12:09.530 --> 04:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
Bernhardt is our privacy officer to
 
04:12:11.870 --> 04:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
really understand the Privacy first and
 
04:12:13.210 --> 04:12:13.220 align:start position:0%
the security
 
04:12:16.910 --> 04:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
components of all of our I.T systems as
 
04:12:19.670 --> 04:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
well as our practices so security isn't
 
04:12:22.429 --> 04:12:22.439 align:start position:0%
just technology it's where do we put
 
04:12:23.990 --> 04:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
this piece of paper at the end of the
 
04:12:25.969 --> 04:12:25.979 align:start position:0%
day if it has somebody's health record
 
04:12:27.710 --> 04:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
on it we need to make sure that it's
 
04:12:31.250 --> 04:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
locked up and maintained so that uh just
 
04:12:33.229 --> 04:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
no just only the people that need access
 
04:12:35.630 --> 04:12:35.640 align:start position:0%
can have access to it
 
04:12:37.309 --> 04:12:37.319 align:start position:0%
and then the last two Enterprise
 
04:12:39.290 --> 04:12:39.300 align:start position:0%
business intelligence really that's
 
04:12:41.689 --> 04:12:41.699 align:start position:0%
where you get your real reports your
 
04:12:43.790 --> 04:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
data analytics your understanding of the
 
04:12:46.010 --> 04:12:46.020 align:start position:0%
information and the services we're
 
04:12:48.229 --> 04:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
performing it's working with multiple
 
04:12:50.150 --> 04:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
other teams to put those reports
 
04:12:52.429 --> 04:12:52.439 align:start position:0%
together and the infrastructure to
 
04:12:53.750 --> 04:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
support it
 
04:12:56.030 --> 04:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
and then rounding out the group we have
 
04:12:57.530 --> 04:12:57.540 align:start position:0%
the application Hardware lifecycle
 
04:13:00.710 --> 04:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
management just a case in point like
 
04:13:02.809 --> 04:13:02.819 align:start position:0%
you'll hear this probably throughout the
 
04:13:06.110 --> 04:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
budget season we are at 30 vacancy in
 
04:13:08.689 --> 04:13:08.699 align:start position:0%
that group and so it is difficult to
 
04:13:11.269 --> 04:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
manage and facilitate new Solutions when
 
04:13:14.689 --> 04:13:14.699 align:start position:0%
you're you're also short staffed
 
04:13:18.050 --> 04:13:18.060 align:start position:0%
I want to jump ahead on an item and and
 
04:13:20.269 --> 04:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
we can come back to your flow I want to
 
04:13:21.950 --> 04:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
I want to do just a little drill down
 
04:13:24.050 --> 04:13:24.060 align:start position:0%
into Enterprise business intelligence
 
04:13:26.929 --> 04:13:26.939 align:start position:0%
and and you got you got three employees
 
04:13:28.910 --> 04:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
there and what's your vacancy rate in
 
04:13:31.429 --> 04:13:31.439 align:start position:0%
there right now that one's full and we
 
04:13:34.250 --> 04:13:34.260 align:start position:0%
have all all of them filled up and they
 
04:13:36.530 --> 04:13:36.540 align:start position:0%
are actively working with multiple other
 
04:13:38.389 --> 04:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
teams throughout the department so so
 
04:13:41.330 --> 04:13:41.340 align:start position:0%
skipping ahead then I I think slide 11
 
04:13:45.349 --> 04:13:45.359 align:start position:0%
is is your uh your effort to explode
 
04:13:47.570 --> 04:13:47.580 align:start position:0%
what what's happening with that
 
04:13:50.510 --> 04:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
Enterprise business intelligence so so
 
04:13:52.910 --> 04:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
this is this is this is kind of what
 
04:13:56.750 --> 04:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
these three people do but I'm I'd like
 
04:13:58.790 --> 04:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
to ask you a little bit about uh kind of
 
04:14:01.130 --> 04:14:01.140 align:start position:0%
how they do it how they integrate like
 
04:14:03.769 --> 04:14:03.779 align:start position:0%
like let's say for example
 
04:14:06.530 --> 04:14:06.540 align:start position:0%
um I'm somebody in the department of
 
04:14:08.389 --> 04:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
health and or excuse me the department
 
04:14:11.990 --> 04:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
of insurance or I'm in DHHS somewhere
 
04:14:14.630 --> 04:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
and I have a strategic information
 
04:14:17.929 --> 04:14:17.939 align:start position:0%
question and like for example I want to
 
04:14:21.410 --> 04:14:21.420 align:start position:0%
know the top 10 drugs that we spend
 
04:14:24.110 --> 04:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
money on in the state and I want to know
 
04:14:26.750 --> 04:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
how much we spend for how many units of
 
04:14:30.950 --> 04:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
it you know that that's not an ordinary
 
04:14:34.610 --> 04:14:34.620 align:start position:0%
query on any one system that sounds to
 
04:14:36.530 --> 04:14:36.540 align:start position:0%
me like housing capability and the
 
04:14:39.590 --> 04:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
ability to to to to go ahead and create
 
04:14:42.530 --> 04:14:42.540 align:start position:0%
that report and to visually to create
 
04:14:45.110 --> 04:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
the visualization are you able to
 
04:14:49.729 --> 04:14:49.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:52.490 --> 04:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
so the answer Mr chairman is it depends
 
04:14:55.490 --> 04:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
so different group so we have data
 
04:14:57.710 --> 04:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
analytics teams embedded in each
 
04:14:59.630 --> 04:14:59.640 align:start position:0%
division some teams are larger than
 
04:15:01.670 --> 04:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
others and then we Outsource with
 
04:15:04.010 --> 04:15:04.020 align:start position:0%
Professional Services organizations to
 
04:15:06.590 --> 04:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
do some of those Point Solutions so I'll
 
04:15:08.990 --> 04:15:09.000 align:start position:0%
give you an example opioid crisis and we
 
04:15:11.809 --> 04:15:11.819 align:start position:0%
had a grant that we got it was called
 
04:15:14.389 --> 04:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
opioid data to action where we receive
 
04:15:16.790 --> 04:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
funding from the Center for Disease
 
04:15:20.090 --> 04:15:20.100 align:start position:0%
Control and prevention to address the
 
04:15:22.870 --> 04:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
multiple data sources that support
 
04:15:25.849 --> 04:15:25.859 align:start position:0%
knowledge about the opioid crisis in in
 
04:15:28.309 --> 04:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire we worked
 
04:15:31.250 --> 04:15:31.260 align:start position:0%
through a multi-year organization both
 
04:15:33.590 --> 04:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
with Behavioral Health Division of
 
04:15:36.650 --> 04:15:36.660 align:start position:0%
Medicaid services and public health as
 
04:15:39.410 --> 04:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
well as our partners and Secretary of
 
04:15:42.050 --> 04:15:42.060 align:start position:0%
State for the vital records system to
 
04:15:43.729 --> 04:15:43.739 align:start position:0%
work through all the privacy concerns
 
04:15:46.250 --> 04:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
and the components of the data sharing
 
04:15:48.889 --> 04:15:48.899 align:start position:0%
so that we can ingest that and build our
 
04:15:52.610 --> 04:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
opioid crisis dashboard but it's not
 
04:15:55.309 --> 04:15:55.319 align:start position:0%
just one team this team helps lead the
 
04:15:58.550 --> 04:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
infrastructure the content like the the
 
04:16:01.189 --> 04:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
content of the contract and helps lead
 
04:16:03.590 --> 04:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
that direction but we are fully
 
04:16:06.410 --> 04:16:06.420 align:start position:0%
dependent upon the the program areas as
 
04:16:08.330 --> 04:16:08.340 align:start position:0%
well as the data analytics and that team
 
04:16:11.710 --> 04:16:11.720 align:start position:0%
in their teams as well as there's a doit
 
04:16:14.030 --> 04:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
Enterprise business intelligence team
 
04:16:16.490 --> 04:16:16.500 align:start position:0%
that is focused on this effort from a
 
04:16:18.469 --> 04:16:18.479 align:start position:0%
infrastructure perspective
 
04:16:21.889 --> 04:16:21.899 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you why
 
04:16:23.630 --> 04:16:23.640 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm pulling on this particular
 
04:16:26.750 --> 04:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
string I I I I think
 
04:16:29.330 --> 04:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
um I think the corporate world uh and a
 
04:16:31.490 --> 04:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
lot of Health Care has realized that the
 
04:16:33.410 --> 04:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
next big wave of innovation and
 
04:16:35.269 --> 04:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
productivity gains are going to come
 
04:16:38.570 --> 04:16:38.580 align:start position:0%
through the power of information and and
 
04:16:40.849 --> 04:16:40.859 align:start position:0%
so what the corporations are have been
 
04:16:42.710 --> 04:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
doing is that for at least a decade
 
04:16:45.050 --> 04:16:45.060 align:start position:0%
they've been really working on data
 
04:16:47.630 --> 04:16:47.640 align:start position:0%
warehousing capabilities and the ability
 
04:16:50.750 --> 04:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
to do Data Mining and and and I and I
 
04:16:52.250 --> 04:16:52.260 align:start position:0%
think the ones that are on The Cutting
 
04:16:55.550 --> 04:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
Edge are are going forward with some Ai
 
04:16:59.570 --> 04:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
implementations and so so I just I just
 
04:17:01.610 --> 04:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
want you know we've worked together on
 
04:17:03.469 --> 04:17:03.479 align:start position:0%
privacy we've worked together on cyber
 
04:17:06.889 --> 04:17:06.899 align:start position:0%
security I'm just saying that I I if if
 
04:17:10.189 --> 04:17:10.199 align:start position:0%
we need to I'd be willing to talk to you
 
04:17:12.889 --> 04:17:12.899 align:start position:0%
and and work with you on what it needs
 
04:17:14.809 --> 04:17:14.819 align:start position:0%
to what we need to do to have a really
 
04:17:17.750 --> 04:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
great Enterprise business intelligence
 
04:17:17.760 --> 04:17:19.610 align:start position:0%
great Enterprise business intelligence
unit

04:17:19.610 --> 04:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
unit
 
04:17:21.290 --> 04:17:21.300 align:start position:0%
um because with three people I you know
 
04:17:24.469 --> 04:17:24.479 align:start position:0%
it brings up questions of yeah are they
 
04:17:26.689 --> 04:17:26.699 align:start position:0%
are they the right three people are they
 
04:17:29.389 --> 04:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
are they are there jobs described the
 
04:17:31.790 --> 04:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
way you want them you know and we don't
 
04:17:34.790 --> 04:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
need to do that in public I I'm just
 
04:17:36.469 --> 04:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
letting you know this is I think this is
 
04:17:40.550 --> 04:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
a strategic priority uh for the state if
 
04:17:43.010 --> 04:17:43.020 align:start position:0%
and maybe the commissioner
 
04:17:45.530 --> 04:17:45.540 align:start position:0%
uh when when she's got her priorities
 
04:17:45.540 --> 04:17:48.410 align:start position:0%
uh when when she's got her priorities
listed

04:17:48.410 --> 04:17:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:50.870 --> 04:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
no I certainly understand and I would I
 
04:17:53.030 --> 04:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
would say it's three people in in my
 
04:17:55.969 --> 04:17:55.979 align:start position:0%
Bureau but it's it's a large amount of
 
04:17:58.250 --> 04:17:58.260 align:start position:0%
people so we have entire data analytics
 
04:18:00.889 --> 04:18:00.899 align:start position:0%
team for Medicaid but it's under the
 
04:18:02.689 --> 04:18:02.699 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Division and so the challenge
 
04:18:04.729 --> 04:18:04.739 align:start position:0%
with our the way our budget's structured
 
04:18:07.189 --> 04:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
and the way we present is each of us
 
04:18:10.130 --> 04:18:10.140 align:start position:0%
present from our our sort of our our
 
04:18:12.469 --> 04:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
span of control and so I'm I'm giving
 
04:18:14.389 --> 04:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
you visibility to my team that helps
 
04:18:16.610 --> 04:18:16.620 align:start position:0%
lead and facilitate but certainly
 
04:18:16.620 --> 04:18:17.929 align:start position:0%
lead and facilitate but certainly
there's

04:18:17.929 --> 04:18:17.939 align:start position:0%
there's
 
04:18:17.939 --> 04:18:18.469 align:start position:0%
there's
um

04:18:18.469 --> 04:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:20.330 --> 04:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
probably I don't know the exact number
 
04:18:21.830 --> 04:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
but I can get that number of how many
 
04:18:23.750 --> 04:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
people are working on data analytics and
 
04:18:25.910 --> 04:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
business intelligence in the department
 
04:18:29.330 --> 04:18:29.340 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with doat but I do
 
04:18:31.790 --> 04:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
believe we have the right people and we
 
04:18:33.349 --> 04:18:33.359 align:start position:0%
have an initiative with the Medicaid
 
04:18:36.710 --> 04:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
enterprise system strategy to go out to
 
04:18:39.349 --> 04:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
RFP in the future for a data analytics
 
04:18:41.150 --> 04:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
Professional Services organization to
 
04:18:45.530 --> 04:18:45.540 align:start position:0%
augment that work as well in in terms of
 
04:18:46.910 --> 04:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
your component that you were talking
 
04:18:49.429 --> 04:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
about are visual intelligence we have
 
04:18:51.950 --> 04:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
looked at that I think we need to go
 
04:18:54.349 --> 04:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
through the base infrastructure so most
 
04:18:56.090 --> 04:18:56.100 align:start position:0%
of the other private sector they started
 
04:18:58.790 --> 04:18:58.800 align:start position:0%
building the the data analytics and the
 
04:19:00.290 --> 04:19:00.300 align:start position:0%
business intelligence work and the turn
 
04:19:02.929 --> 04:19:02.939 align:start position:0%
of the century and they didn't have some
 
04:19:04.910 --> 04:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
of the privacy concerns so they just
 
04:19:06.710 --> 04:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
went and grabbed it and put pulled it
 
04:19:08.929 --> 04:19:08.939 align:start position:0%
together we have to be much more
 
04:19:11.090 --> 04:19:11.100 align:start position:0%
methodical with what information we can
 
04:19:13.370 --> 04:19:13.380 align:start position:0%
pull in and how we can combine it
 
04:19:16.550 --> 04:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
because once it is combined we now we
 
04:19:17.990 --> 04:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
have to know who we can share that
 
04:19:20.990 --> 04:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
information with and what and what
 
04:19:22.610 --> 04:19:22.620 align:start position:0%
information can be garnered from that
 
04:19:25.189 --> 04:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
can be shared with the public so we have
 
04:19:28.670 --> 04:19:28.680 align:start position:0%
a I guess another level or layer that
 
04:19:30.710 --> 04:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
makes it take a little bit longer but I
 
04:19:32.570 --> 04:19:32.580 align:start position:0%
think it's important for for our
 
04:19:34.189 --> 04:19:34.199 align:start position:0%
constituents so that we take that those
 
04:19:34.199 --> 04:19:35.410 align:start position:0%
constituents so that we take that those
steps

04:19:35.410 --> 04:19:35.420 align:start position:0%
steps
 
04:19:38.510 --> 04:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
that's great I guess what I'm imagining
 
04:19:41.030 --> 04:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
also just like you have your strategic
 
04:19:43.370 --> 04:19:43.380 align:start position:0%
I.T plan that goes out for many many
 
04:19:48.769 --> 04:19:48.779 align:start position:0%
years uh I I I assume that you have a
 
04:19:50.750 --> 04:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
vision of where you want to take the
 
04:19:52.910 --> 04:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
Enterprise business intelligence
 
04:19:55.490 --> 04:19:55.500 align:start position:0%
component over the next five to ten
 
04:19:58.370 --> 04:19:58.380 align:start position:0%
years to sort of keep track with
 
04:20:01.250 --> 04:20:01.260 align:start position:0%
external benchmarks on on how to manage
 
04:20:04.250 --> 04:20:04.260 align:start position:0%
corporate data certainly if that's
 
04:20:05.870 --> 04:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
something that would please the
 
04:20:07.370 --> 04:20:07.380 align:start position:0%
committee I can go into some of the
 
04:20:09.349 --> 04:20:09.359 align:start position:0%
details but we certainly from a
 
04:20:12.410 --> 04:20:12.420 align:start position:0%
technology perspective we we built a
 
04:20:14.929 --> 04:20:14.939 align:start position:0%
large infrastructure on an oracle back
 
04:20:18.710 --> 04:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
end with Informatica for extract to
 
04:20:20.630 --> 04:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
transform and load of the functions and
 
04:20:22.309 --> 04:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
actually doing the data modeling and the
 
04:20:24.290 --> 04:20:24.300 align:start position:0%
warehousing and then Tableau for
 
04:20:26.269 --> 04:20:26.279 align:start position:0%
visualizations but we're also looking at
 
04:20:28.729 --> 04:20:28.739 align:start position:0%
other tools to expand to create like ad
 
04:20:30.950 --> 04:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
hoc type reporting like you were saying
 
04:20:32.929 --> 04:20:32.939 align:start position:0%
where I want to know
 
04:20:35.030 --> 04:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
based off of all our data sources how
 
04:20:39.110 --> 04:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
much do we spend on on this drug every
 
04:20:42.710 --> 04:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
year that level of knowledge requires us
 
04:20:44.990 --> 04:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
to have all of our data sources in one
 
04:20:48.290 --> 04:20:48.300 align:start position:0%
data warehouse effectively so so for the
 
04:20:50.450 --> 04:20:50.460 align:start position:0%
committee's purpose where what we're
 
04:20:53.450 --> 04:20:53.460 align:start position:0%
teeing up is enough background and
 
04:20:55.969 --> 04:20:55.979 align:start position:0%
knowledge of your department to let us
 
04:20:58.610 --> 04:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
get through the two-year budget It's
 
04:21:01.610 --> 04:21:01.620 align:start position:0%
Complicated by the fact that you know it
 
04:21:05.090 --> 04:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
is spread all over the department and I
 
04:21:07.729 --> 04:21:07.739 align:start position:0%
just wanted us to end the day knowing
 
04:21:10.610 --> 04:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
you know how it all kind of we could map
 
04:21:12.769 --> 04:21:12.779 align:start position:0%
every piece of I.T in the budget
 
04:21:17.150 --> 04:21:17.160 align:start position:0%
somewhere into a a framework but on the
 
04:21:19.990 --> 04:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
longer term aspect of the 10-year
 
04:21:22.969 --> 04:21:22.979 align:start position:0%
strategy for business intelligence I'd
 
04:21:25.550 --> 04:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
be happy to talk to you offline on that
 
04:21:28.670 --> 04:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
sounds good Mr chairman all right uh so
 
04:21:30.830 --> 04:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
so when I last interrupted you you were
 
04:21:34.429 --> 04:21:34.439 align:start position:0%
on slide four well and we essentially I
 
04:21:37.010 --> 04:21:37.020 align:start position:0%
went at a high level for all the slides
 
04:21:40.309 --> 04:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
all the way up until slide 12 11 so
 
04:21:44.689 --> 04:21:44.699 align:start position:0%
going into slide 11 what you can see is
 
04:21:46.910 --> 04:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
if if the if the committee has time to
 
04:21:48.710 --> 04:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
review some of the details some of the
 
04:21:50.750 --> 04:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
high level Focus that we're looking at
 
04:21:54.590 --> 04:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
is different platforms and so if we if
 
04:21:58.490 --> 04:21:58.500 align:start position:0%
we if we jump to just for a pre brief
 
04:22:01.729 --> 04:22:01.739 align:start position:0%
moment it's on slide slide six
 
04:22:03.769 --> 04:22:03.779 align:start position:0%
which is department-wide strategic
 
04:22:05.210 --> 04:22:05.220 align:start position:0%
initiatives and this is important
 
04:22:06.830 --> 04:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
because it really does align with our
 
04:22:08.750 --> 04:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
division's directions and this is what
 
04:22:12.410 --> 04:22:12.420 align:start position:0%
aligns with our agency I.T plan as well
 
04:22:16.010 --> 04:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
as the the Statewide strategic I.T plan
 
04:22:18.950 --> 04:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
so you'll see common themes as we go
 
04:22:20.929 --> 04:22:20.939 align:start position:0%
through and discuss through the budget
 
04:22:23.809 --> 04:22:23.819 align:start position:0%
relationship management which is a
 
04:22:25.790 --> 04:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
utilization of a platform called
 
04:22:29.090 --> 04:22:29.100 align:start position:0%
Salesforce to enable us to quickly
 
04:22:32.090 --> 04:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
provide applications not develop them
 
04:22:33.530 --> 04:22:33.540 align:start position:0%
from scratch but leverage those
 
04:22:36.590 --> 04:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
Technologies to move forward and that's
 
04:22:38.630 --> 04:22:38.640 align:start position:0%
you'll hear it important as part of the
 
04:22:40.070 --> 04:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
comprehensive trial welfare information
 
04:22:44.269 --> 04:22:44.279 align:start position:0%
system for dcyf Medicaid quality use the
 
04:22:46.429 --> 04:22:46.439 align:start position:0%
sales force New Hampshire connections
 
04:22:49.010 --> 04:22:49.020 align:start position:0%
for child care registry and Licensing
 
04:22:51.229 --> 04:22:51.239 align:start position:0%
uses Salesforce public health uses
 
04:22:53.689 --> 04:22:53.699 align:start position:0%
Salesforce for their contact tracing
 
04:22:55.429 --> 04:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
patient monitoring and case
 
04:22:58.969 --> 04:22:58.979 align:start position:0%
investigation so you'll see this as a
 
04:23:00.729 --> 04:23:00.739 align:start position:0%
common platform as we roll it out
 
04:23:03.290 --> 04:23:03.300 align:start position:0%
continue to roll it out we have about 14
 
04:23:06.050 --> 04:23:06.060 align:start position:0%
workloads on it and we anticipate at
 
04:23:09.710 --> 04:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:11.570 --> 04:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
and then we already talked about project
 
04:23:13.729 --> 04:23:13.739 align:start position:0%
and resource management and data
 
04:23:15.530 --> 04:23:15.540 align:start position:0%
management was really that Enterprise
 
04:23:17.630 --> 04:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
business intelligence you'll hear it
 
04:23:20.389 --> 04:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
called ebi I will try to always call it
 
04:23:22.910 --> 04:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
Enterprise business intelligence
 
04:23:25.389 --> 04:23:25.399 align:start position:0%
um care coordination is an effort that
 
04:23:27.769 --> 04:23:27.779 align:start position:0%
you may have heard during the last
 
04:23:29.389 --> 04:23:29.399 align:start position:0%
legislative session there were some
 
04:23:32.929 --> 04:23:32.939 align:start position:0%
bills around closed loop referral and we
 
04:23:36.889 --> 04:23:36.899 align:start position:0%
also had through integrated delivery
 
04:23:39.530 --> 04:23:39.540 align:start position:0%
networks in the 1115 waiver from years
 
04:23:42.530 --> 04:23:42.540 align:start position:0%
past inherited a solution for event
 
04:23:44.630 --> 04:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
notifications and Emissions discharge
 
04:23:46.370 --> 04:23:46.380 align:start position:0%
and transfer so you were talking about
 
04:23:49.910 --> 04:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
that through that that through work from
 
04:23:53.330 --> 04:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
Ed to New Hampshire hospital to a
 
04:23:54.729 --> 04:23:54.739 align:start position:0%
designated receiving facility
 
04:23:57.050 --> 04:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
potentially out into transitional
 
04:23:59.870 --> 04:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
housing and then back into their home
 
04:24:03.410 --> 04:24:03.420 align:start position:0%
those those tools are really
 
04:24:03.420 --> 04:24:04.550 align:start position:0%
those those tools are really
um

04:24:04.550 --> 04:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:07.429 --> 04:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
integral for that solution to make sure
 
04:24:09.349 --> 04:24:09.359 align:start position:0%
that the referrals that are being made
 
04:24:11.570 --> 04:24:11.580 align:start position:0%
by the different providers are being
 
04:24:13.610 --> 04:24:13.620 align:start position:0%
received being followed up on and are
 
04:24:13.620 --> 04:24:14.630 align:start position:0%
received being followed up on and are
secure

04:24:14.630 --> 04:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
secure
 
04:24:16.790 --> 04:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
as well as the emissions discharge and
 
04:24:19.010 --> 04:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
transfers are timely so that people know
 
04:24:21.650 --> 04:24:21.660 align:start position:0%
hey this person's coming in make sure
 
04:24:23.570 --> 04:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
that you're ready for them and you have
 
04:24:25.550 --> 04:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
all the information that you need so you
 
04:24:27.950 --> 04:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
can actually process that admission and
 
04:24:31.309 --> 04:24:31.319 align:start position:0%
or transfer so that that project the
 
04:24:33.349 --> 04:24:33.359 align:start position:0%
event notification is in system is in
 
04:24:36.229 --> 04:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
place and is currently growing its
 
04:24:38.510 --> 04:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
network of of providers we have a little
 
04:24:41.870 --> 04:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
over 144 providers on that Network
 
04:24:43.250 --> 04:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
um throughout the state for health care
 
04:24:45.650 --> 04:24:45.660 align:start position:0%
providers and then the closed loop
 
04:24:48.229 --> 04:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
referral is in the in the RFP state
 
04:24:50.510 --> 04:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
right now with the the goal of
 
04:24:52.550 --> 04:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
continuing to implement it over the next
 
04:24:55.010 --> 04:24:55.020 align:start position:0%
couple years so two thoughts in here
 
04:24:58.370 --> 04:24:58.380 align:start position:0%
where are we at with
 
04:25:00.290 --> 04:25:00.300 align:start position:0%
um the the
 
04:25:04.250 --> 04:25:04.260 align:start position:0%
Master client patient index is or is
 
04:25:06.050 --> 04:25:06.060 align:start position:0%
that still something we're moving
 
04:25:08.330 --> 04:25:08.340 align:start position:0%
towards we've achieved we've given up on
 
04:25:10.849 --> 04:25:10.859 align:start position:0%
what what's its status
 
04:25:13.189 --> 04:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
it's something that we continue to
 
04:25:15.769 --> 04:25:15.779 align:start position:0%
Aspire to so I would say that where
 
04:25:17.330 --> 04:25:17.340 align:start position:0%
we're going to move forward on it is
 
04:25:19.849 --> 04:25:19.859 align:start position:0%
when we get there's two contracts that
 
04:25:21.050 --> 04:25:21.060 align:start position:0%
we're looking to move forward for
 
04:25:22.969 --> 04:25:22.979 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Enterprise systems one is the
 
04:25:25.130 --> 04:25:25.140 align:start position:0%
system integrator which is really the
 
04:25:27.349 --> 04:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
the brain of communicating between
 
04:25:29.990 --> 04:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
systems securely and managing data
 
04:25:33.590 --> 04:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
governance properly as well as the
 
04:25:35.929 --> 04:25:35.939 align:start position:0%
featured data analytics RFP that I was
 
04:25:38.269 --> 04:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
referring to that will take us from what
 
04:25:40.250 --> 04:25:40.260 align:start position:0%
we have as a master client index for the
 
04:25:41.929 --> 04:25:41.939 align:start position:0%
different data sources that we ingested
 
04:25:44.990 --> 04:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
our goal is to evolve that to a Master
 
04:25:48.050 --> 04:25:48.060 align:start position:0%
we call it entity index so it's not just
 
04:25:50.750 --> 04:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
clients but it would be for employees so
 
04:25:52.550 --> 04:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
we would know we would have a golden
 
04:25:54.530 --> 04:25:54.540 align:start position:0%
record for our employees and our staff
 
04:25:56.170 --> 04:25:56.180 align:start position:0%
our contractors
 
04:25:58.670 --> 04:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
interns as well as volunteers as well
 
04:26:00.229 --> 04:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
you know I think that would just be a
 
04:26:03.290 --> 04:26:03.300 align:start position:0%
good idea to like periodically volunteer
 
04:26:05.990 --> 04:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
with Mr Williams to come in to talk to
 
04:26:08.870 --> 04:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
oversight because that's a that's an
 
04:26:11.990 --> 04:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
intersection of powerful capability to
 
04:26:14.269 --> 04:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
be able to link records across systems
 
04:26:18.889 --> 04:26:18.899 align:start position:0%
based on a common record ID and privacy
 
04:26:21.110 --> 04:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
and I just I just think it might be
 
04:26:23.269 --> 04:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
better to get that stuff into the
 
04:26:26.389 --> 04:26:26.399 align:start position:0%
oversight committees the second thing I
 
04:26:30.469 --> 04:26:30.479 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention uh or ask you about is
 
04:26:32.990 --> 04:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
we're we're going to have some salary
 
04:26:36.290 --> 04:26:36.300 align:start position:0%
and Manpower issues and so
 
04:26:38.870 --> 04:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
um so this I the systems work that we're
 
04:26:40.969 --> 04:26:40.979 align:start position:0%
doing that are really going to drive
 
04:26:43.630 --> 04:26:43.640 align:start position:0%
efficiency and productivity
 
04:26:46.189 --> 04:26:46.199 align:start position:0%
or can can they be highlighted
 
04:26:48.649 --> 04:26:48.659 align:start position:0%
subsequently in a subsequent meeting so
 
04:26:50.689 --> 04:26:50.699 align:start position:0%
that we can we can see the correlation
 
04:26:53.809 --> 04:26:53.819 align:start position:0%
between this I.T system May save us some
 
04:26:56.570 --> 04:26:56.580 align:start position:0%
ftes here
 
04:26:59.389 --> 04:26:59.399 align:start position:0%
we certainly can do that and then I
 
04:27:00.349 --> 04:27:00.359 align:start position:0%
would say
 
04:27:03.710 --> 04:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
the challenge with right now is being
 
04:27:06.170 --> 04:27:06.180 align:start position:0%
our overarching department has such a
 
04:27:08.030 --> 04:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
large vacancy so it's not necessarily
 
04:27:11.269 --> 04:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
saving baking saving ftes it's allowing
 
04:27:13.729 --> 04:27:13.739 align:start position:0%
them to reappropriate those those
 
04:27:15.590 --> 04:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
positions to do something that is now
 
04:27:19.550 --> 04:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
we'll deal with that complexity okay
 
04:27:21.889 --> 04:27:21.899 align:start position:0%
but we just we need to understand what
 
04:27:25.490 --> 04:27:25.500 align:start position:0%
we're getting and and right now one of
 
04:27:28.130 --> 04:27:28.140 align:start position:0%
the most valuable things we can get is
 
04:27:31.370 --> 04:27:31.380 align:start position:0%
less pressure on our Manpower yeah and
 
04:27:33.469 --> 04:27:33.479 align:start position:0%
each one of these systems has that goal
 
04:27:36.469 --> 04:27:36.479 align:start position:0%
so and we if we skip into like you
 
04:27:39.110 --> 04:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
requested earlier the division strategic
 
04:27:41.990 --> 04:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
I.T initiatives which we can speak to
 
04:27:44.210 --> 04:27:44.220 align:start position:0%
though some of those Manpower impacts
 
04:27:44.220 --> 04:27:45.229 align:start position:0%
though some of those Manpower impacts
and

04:27:45.229 --> 04:27:45.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:27:47.929 --> 04:27:47.939 align:start position:0%
I would say that there won't be a single
 
04:27:49.969 --> 04:27:49.979 align:start position:0%
time you'll hear me say that we're
 
04:27:53.149 --> 04:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
eliminating positions but we will allow
 
04:27:55.610 --> 04:27:55.620 align:start position:0%
for positions to pick up work that is
 
04:27:57.170 --> 04:27:57.180 align:start position:0%
currently not being able to perform I
 
04:27:58.969 --> 04:27:58.979 align:start position:0%
know it's sensitive we'll we'll figure
 
04:28:01.790 --> 04:28:01.800 align:start position:0%
out how to talk nicely to each other uh
 
04:28:03.590 --> 04:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking for we could call it
 
04:28:06.050 --> 04:28:06.060 align:start position:0%
productivity gains sounds good that's
 
04:28:06.060 --> 04:28:07.849 align:start position:0%
productivity gains sounds good that's
Happy

04:28:07.849 --> 04:28:07.859 align:start position:0%
Happy
 
04:28:11.110 --> 04:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
so you have a question no okay
 
04:28:13.969 --> 04:28:13.979 align:start position:0%
so on the behavioral health strategic
 
04:28:18.170 --> 04:28:18.180 align:start position:0%
initiatives the the big they have a
 
04:28:20.530 --> 04:28:20.540 align:start position:0%
um in the drug and alcohol Services
 
04:28:23.750 --> 04:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
Bureau they utilize a a tool that has
 
04:28:25.969 --> 04:28:25.979 align:start position:0%
been around for many years it's called
 
04:28:28.189 --> 04:28:28.199 align:start position:0%
wits or web information technology
 
04:28:28.199 --> 04:28:29.510 align:start position:0%
wits or web information technology
system

04:28:29.510 --> 04:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
system
 
04:28:32.630 --> 04:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
and it there is a need for that system
 
04:28:35.630 --> 04:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
to be upgraded and it really is a
 
04:28:37.490 --> 04:28:37.500 align:start position:0%
relationship management
 
04:28:39.590 --> 04:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
um solution
 
04:28:42.950 --> 04:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I just asked that and uh
 
04:28:44.570 --> 04:28:44.580 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney says we're on
 
04:28:47.149 --> 04:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
slide 14. is that correct slide 14.
 
04:28:49.849 --> 04:28:49.859 align:start position:0%
slide 14. I apologize representative and
 
04:28:52.370 --> 04:28:52.380 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
04:28:54.649 --> 04:28:54.659 align:start position:0%
so on that second bullet I'm referring
 
04:28:57.050 --> 04:28:57.060 align:start position:0%
to a relationship management system but
 
04:29:00.110 --> 04:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
when we as I.T we try to combine
 
04:29:02.689 --> 04:29:02.699 align:start position:0%
projects more possible to reduce the
 
04:29:04.189 --> 04:29:04.199 align:start position:0%
impact on staff
 
04:29:07.969 --> 04:29:07.979 align:start position:0%
and so we are looking to we're planning
 
04:29:10.490 --> 04:29:10.500 align:start position:0%
to implement our relationship management
 
04:29:12.530 --> 04:29:12.540 align:start position:0%
system and an electronic health record
 
04:29:16.250 --> 04:29:16.260 align:start position:0%
system and that is one big project maybe
 
04:29:18.349 --> 04:29:18.359 align:start position:0%
two separate systems or two separate
 
04:29:21.769 --> 04:29:21.779 align:start position:0%
modules and certainly what um not
 
04:29:24.889 --> 04:29:24.899 align:start position:0%
overlapping access but that one solution
 
04:29:26.950 --> 04:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
and one project is meant to support
 
04:29:29.149 --> 04:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital New Hampshire
 
04:29:29.159 --> 04:29:30.349 align:start position:0%
Hampstead Hospital New Hampshire
hospital

04:29:30.349 --> 04:29:30.359 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
04:29:32.450 --> 04:29:32.460 align:start position:0%
the behavioral health Drug and Alcohol
 
04:29:36.309 --> 04:29:36.319 align:start position:0%
Services as well as potentially
 
04:29:38.929 --> 04:29:38.939 align:start position:0%
supporting the forensic hospital as it
 
04:29:41.870 --> 04:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
gets as it gets rolled out
 
04:29:44.030 --> 04:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
and the goal the reason why we want to
 
04:29:46.910 --> 04:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
do that is if we if we do it the old the
 
04:29:48.769 --> 04:29:48.779 align:start position:0%
old way we would have four different
 
04:29:50.689 --> 04:29:50.699 align:start position:0%
systems four different project teams
 
04:29:53.269 --> 04:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
we'd be asking for resources for all
 
04:29:55.490 --> 04:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
four initiatives so instead of asking
 
04:29:55.500 --> 04:29:56.570 align:start position:0%
four initiatives so instead of asking
for

04:29:56.570 --> 04:29:56.580 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:30:00.050 --> 04:30:00.060 align:start position:0%
40 people will be looking for 10. and so
 
04:30:02.929 --> 04:30:02.939 align:start position:0%
it just allows us to be more efficient
 
04:30:07.309 --> 04:30:07.319 align:start position:0%
with our it Workforce and and always be
 
04:30:08.990 --> 04:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
able to employ the solution that they're
 
04:30:11.030 --> 04:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
looking for this little tab at the
 
04:30:12.830 --> 04:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
bottom it's obviously you're doing a
 
04:30:14.929 --> 04:30:14.939 align:start position:0%
color code word combination thing to
 
04:30:16.790 --> 04:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
mean something what's the key on that
 
04:30:18.950 --> 04:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
what are we looking at so the key on
 
04:30:20.570 --> 04:30:20.580 align:start position:0%
that at the bottom is really how we
 
04:30:23.750 --> 04:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
align our projects at DHHS to the
 
04:30:25.610 --> 04:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
Statewide strategic Information
 
04:30:28.070 --> 04:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
Technology plan that commissioner Goulet
 
04:30:30.050 --> 04:30:30.060 align:start position:0%
has published and so you'll see
 
04:30:32.090 --> 04:30:32.100 align:start position:0%
different themes there's strategic
 
04:30:34.130 --> 04:30:34.140 align:start position:0%
partnership modern digital government
 
04:30:37.490 --> 04:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
performance cyber security and
 
04:30:40.790 --> 04:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
effective resource management and a lot
 
04:30:42.889 --> 04:30:42.899 align:start position:0%
of those actually overlap overlap with
 
04:30:44.929 --> 04:30:44.939 align:start position:0%
for our commissioner our interim
 
04:30:46.729 --> 04:30:46.739 align:start position:0%
commissioner Weaver's goals so the color
 
04:30:49.849 --> 04:30:49.859 align:start position:0%
inside the boxes don't add meaning they
 
04:30:53.269 --> 04:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
just are categorizations to consistent
 
04:30:55.969 --> 04:30:55.979 align:start position:0%
categorizations right they're really
 
04:30:58.729 --> 04:30:58.739 align:start position:0%
meant to separate themselves and so like
 
04:31:01.189 --> 04:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
on the behavioral health you don't
 
04:31:03.110 --> 04:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
mention effective Resource Management
 
04:31:05.269 --> 04:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
because it apparently doesn't tie into
 
04:31:05.279 --> 04:31:06.530 align:start position:0%
because it apparently doesn't tie into
that

04:31:06.530 --> 04:31:06.540 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:31:08.389 --> 04:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:31:10.969 --> 04:31:10.979 align:start position:0%
or you might have made found a potential
 
04:31:13.250 --> 04:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
error in my in my key there where I
 
04:31:15.889 --> 04:31:15.899 align:start position:0%
could I could add that so in many cases
 
04:31:18.290 --> 04:31:18.300 align:start position:0%
you can add all five of them what we did
 
04:31:20.330 --> 04:31:20.340 align:start position:0%
is we looked at it and said here's the
 
04:31:22.969 --> 04:31:22.979 align:start position:0%
three main ones that we that drove this
 
04:31:24.830 --> 04:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
project forward it doesn't mean that
 
04:31:26.510 --> 04:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
cyber security won't be included because
 
04:31:28.250 --> 04:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
cyber security is included in every
 
04:31:29.689 --> 04:31:29.699 align:start position:0%
effort that we did right I was just
 
04:31:31.070 --> 04:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
looking to see if there was some color
 
04:31:33.950 --> 04:31:33.960 align:start position:0%
coding here so I I know this is the
 
04:31:35.389 --> 04:31:35.399 align:start position:0%
number one thing they're really trying
 
04:31:37.309 --> 04:31:37.319 align:start position:0%
to achieve out of this but maybe that's
 
04:31:40.010 --> 04:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
too much detail for us it was like if
 
04:31:41.870 --> 04:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
you look at this key our goal is really
 
04:31:44.750 --> 04:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
to modernize our systems improve the
 
04:31:46.429 --> 04:31:46.439 align:start position:0%
performance of the solution that we
 
04:31:48.290 --> 04:31:48.300 align:start position:0%
currently have with our our providers
 
04:31:50.389 --> 04:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
that are working with Behavioral Health
 
04:31:52.969 --> 04:31:52.979 align:start position:0%
and then have that strategic partnership
 
04:31:54.590 --> 04:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
because it because Behavioral Health
 
04:31:56.929 --> 04:31:56.939 align:start position:0%
contracts with multiple providers within
 
04:31:59.750 --> 04:31:59.760 align:start position:0%
the or within the state and by
 
04:32:02.330 --> 04:32:02.340 align:start position:0%
modernizing the system it and improving
 
04:32:04.309 --> 04:32:04.319 align:start position:0%
that performance it actually Builds on
 
04:32:06.530 --> 04:32:06.540 align:start position:0%
that strategic partnership so I mean
 
04:32:08.389 --> 04:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
that that's really where we were focused
 
04:32:10.250 --> 04:32:10.260 align:start position:0%
it doesn't mean that we won't
 
04:32:13.070 --> 04:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
effectively resource manage our
 
04:32:15.050 --> 04:32:15.060 align:start position:0%
resources and provide cyber security
 
04:32:19.610 --> 04:32:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:19.620 --> 04:32:20.750 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:32:20.750 --> 04:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:23.990 --> 04:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
so then the other really the two areas
 
04:32:25.309 --> 04:32:25.319 align:start position:0%
in Behavioral Health that we were
 
04:32:28.070 --> 04:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
focused on is data analytics so that's a
 
04:32:29.630 --> 04:32:29.640 align:start position:0%
common theme and that you'll hear
 
04:32:32.469 --> 04:32:32.479 align:start position:0%
throughout conversations and and
 
04:32:34.969 --> 04:32:34.979 align:start position:0%
chairman Edwards you just mentioned it
 
04:32:37.309 --> 04:32:37.319 align:start position:0%
earlier lots of private sector
 
04:32:39.710 --> 04:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
Industries is using data to basically
 
04:32:41.689 --> 04:32:41.699 align:start position:0%
inform and provide a more knowledgeable
 
04:32:43.849 --> 04:32:43.859 align:start position:0%
Direction on how
 
04:32:46.490 --> 04:32:46.500 align:start position:0%
goods and services can be provided and
 
04:32:48.530 --> 04:32:48.540 align:start position:0%
in private sectors for returning on
 
04:32:51.110 --> 04:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
investment for us it's on providing
 
04:32:54.170 --> 04:32:54.180 align:start position:0%
better better client and patient support
 
04:32:57.950 --> 04:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
and services in an effective and timely
 
04:33:00.469 --> 04:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
as well as cost-effective way
 
04:33:02.570 --> 04:33:02.580 align:start position:0%
so we don't get that return on
 
04:33:04.250 --> 04:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
investment because we don't recognize
 
04:33:07.189 --> 04:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
Revenue that way but it is it is our
 
04:33:09.650 --> 04:33:09.660 align:start position:0%
goal to do it the best way
 
04:33:12.051 --> 04:33:12.061 align:start position:0%
and then we refer to the closed loop
 
04:33:13.670 --> 04:33:13.680 align:start position:0%
referral or the care coordination
 
04:33:16.131 --> 04:33:16.141 align:start position:0%
project earlier it also applies to
 
04:33:17.990 --> 04:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
behavioral health here in their
 
04:33:19.551 --> 04:33:19.561 align:start position:0%
strategic initiatives
 
04:33:21.830 --> 04:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
the goal there is that they need a
 
04:33:25.250 --> 04:33:25.260 align:start position:0%
solution so that if you arrive at a
 
04:33:26.929 --> 04:33:26.939 align:start position:0%
Community Mental Health Center and they
 
04:33:29.330 --> 04:33:29.340 align:start position:0%
need to provide you referrals to
 
04:33:32.570 --> 04:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
clinicians to support you or they or
 
04:33:33.890 --> 04:33:33.900 align:start position:0%
they or that you're going to emergency
 
04:33:36.289 --> 04:33:36.299 align:start position:0%
department and you need a referral to a
 
04:33:37.730 --> 04:33:37.740 align:start position:0%
community mental health center
 
04:33:40.369 --> 04:33:40.379 align:start position:0%
right now it's done by phone facts and
 
04:33:43.369 --> 04:33:43.379 align:start position:0%
email the goal is to make it a digital
 
04:33:46.551 --> 04:33:46.561 align:start position:0%
system that we can do consent we can
 
04:33:48.170 --> 04:33:48.180 align:start position:0%
maintain consent and we can understand
 
04:33:50.330 --> 04:33:50.340 align:start position:0%
that that person's consented to the
 
04:33:52.310 --> 04:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
services and that they're actually going
 
04:33:54.289 --> 04:33:54.299 align:start position:0%
to receive services so we don't lose
 
04:33:56.269 --> 04:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
track of what they're looking for in
 
04:33:59.150 --> 04:33:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:01.250 --> 04:34:01.260 align:start position:0%
um so then from a timeline perspective
 
04:34:04.310 --> 04:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
this is all these are major initiatives
 
04:34:07.490 --> 04:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
they do take multiple years and you'll
 
04:34:09.230 --> 04:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
hear at the end of if we get to the end
 
04:34:11.150 --> 04:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
of the conversation that there's
 
04:34:13.070 --> 04:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
procurement timelines as well as
 
04:34:14.990 --> 04:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
Discovery timelines that really dictate
 
04:34:23.269 --> 04:34:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:23.279 --> 04:34:24.470 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:34:24.470 --> 04:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:34:27.769 --> 04:34:27.779 align:start position:0%
so then moving on to slide 15 children
 
04:34:30.051 --> 04:34:30.061 align:start position:0%
youth and Families
 
04:34:32.390 --> 04:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
for the last couple years that I've been
 
04:34:35.510 --> 04:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
here we've been focusing on one major
 
04:34:37.730 --> 04:34:37.740 align:start position:0%
I.T system and it's the comprehensive
 
04:34:40.369 --> 04:34:40.379 align:start position:0%
child welfare information system we
 
04:34:43.429 --> 04:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
implemented an intake Solution on
 
04:34:45.590 --> 04:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
Salesforce over the last two years and
 
04:34:47.390 --> 04:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
we're working with Administration for
 
04:34:49.189 --> 04:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
children and families to implement the
 
04:34:52.070 --> 04:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
assessment and the case management
 
04:34:55.429 --> 04:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
component of that solution this current
 
04:34:57.170 --> 04:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
biennium and going into the next
 
04:34:57.180 --> 04:34:59.029 align:start position:0%
biennium and going into the next
biennium

04:34:59.029 --> 04:34:59.039 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
04:35:00.529 --> 04:35:00.539 align:start position:0%
this system
 
04:35:04.670 --> 04:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
will be really focused on making what
 
04:35:06.709 --> 04:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
their current solution is which is not a
 
04:35:09.470 --> 04:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
mobile solution it's a client server
 
04:35:11.269 --> 04:35:11.279 align:start position:0%
solution that they have to be on the
 
04:35:13.070 --> 04:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
network in order to access the
 
04:35:16.310 --> 04:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
information but when they're out in the
 
04:35:18.529 --> 04:35:18.539 align:start position:0%
field supporting the The Children and
 
04:35:20.330 --> 04:35:20.340 align:start position:0%
Families they don't always have an
 
04:35:21.650 --> 04:35:21.660 align:start position:0%
internet connection because New
 
04:35:21.660 --> 04:35:22.490 align:start position:0%
internet connection because New
Hampshire

04:35:22.490 --> 04:35:22.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:35:24.709 --> 04:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
is New Hampshire and there are rural
 
04:35:26.631 --> 04:35:26.641 align:start position:0%
areas and it's difficult to get cell
 
04:35:28.429 --> 04:35:28.439 align:start position:0%
connectivity sometimes and certainly
 
04:35:30.650 --> 04:35:30.660 align:start position:0%
Internet isn't even more difficult
 
04:35:33.170 --> 04:35:33.180 align:start position:0%
this will allow them to go offline
 
04:35:35.330 --> 04:35:35.340 align:start position:0%
still record their information and then
 
04:35:36.830 --> 04:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
when they get back into an internet
 
04:35:38.631 --> 04:35:38.641 align:start position:0%
connection securely transfer that
 
04:35:40.970 --> 04:35:40.980 align:start position:0%
information up to the system whereas
 
04:35:43.010 --> 04:35:43.020 align:start position:0%
right now those caseworkers have to do
 
04:35:45.349 --> 04:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
dual entry they type it up on their
 
04:35:47.029 --> 04:35:47.039 align:start position:0%
system wherever they're at either on
 
04:35:48.709 --> 04:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
their pattern paper or in their computer
 
04:35:50.750 --> 04:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
then when they get back they actually
 
04:35:53.269 --> 04:35:53.279 align:start position:0%
have to log into the system and redo all
 
04:35:56.810 --> 04:35:56.820 align:start position:0%
that work that's a huge time impact and
 
04:35:59.209 --> 04:35:59.219 align:start position:0%
if you think about every case
 
04:36:01.670 --> 04:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
if it adds them 20 30 minutes of
 
04:36:03.289 --> 04:36:03.299 align:start position:0%
administrative effort every time they
 
04:36:05.029 --> 04:36:05.039 align:start position:0%
have to do that it's taking that much
 
04:36:06.590 --> 04:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
time away from the children families
 
04:36:09.349 --> 04:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
they serve so that's a Major Performance
 
04:36:11.449 --> 04:36:11.459 align:start position:0%
gain for those individuals
 
04:36:13.609 --> 04:36:13.619 align:start position:0%
and the thought process behind
 
04:36:16.070 --> 04:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
modernizing that system is that then
 
04:36:18.529 --> 04:36:18.539 align:start position:0%
their caseload that they have right now
 
04:36:21.289 --> 04:36:21.299 align:start position:0%
will may be more attainable as opposed
 
04:36:26.631 --> 04:36:26.641 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:29.330 --> 04:36:29.340 align:start position:0%
so that I'm going to skip through like
 
04:36:31.070 --> 04:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
any of the details of reading this but
 
04:36:35.090 --> 04:36:35.100 align:start position:0%
that's the major component of the dcyf
 
04:36:37.449 --> 04:36:37.459 align:start position:0%
on site 16
 
04:36:41.510 --> 04:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
economic stability strategic initiatives
 
04:36:44.631 --> 04:36:44.641 align:start position:0%
so in in this division it's fairly large
 
04:36:47.510 --> 04:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
but it has one of the I would say the
 
04:36:49.429 --> 04:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
second largest I.T system that we have
 
04:36:52.250 --> 04:36:52.260 align:start position:0%
in DHHS it's our it's called New Heights
 
04:36:54.709 --> 04:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
it's our integrated eligibility system
 
04:36:58.429 --> 04:36:58.439 align:start position:0%
for SNAP TANF Medicaid as well as other
 
04:37:01.131 --> 04:37:01.141 align:start position:0%
Solutions utilize it for eligibility for
 
04:37:04.730 --> 04:37:04.740 align:start position:0%
for services as they go forward
 
04:37:08.150 --> 04:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
in as as you well know I'm sure the
 
04:37:09.949 --> 04:37:09.959 align:start position:0%
federal Public Health Emergency unwind
 
04:37:13.010 --> 04:37:13.020 align:start position:0%
is causing some challenges here in the
 
04:37:14.810 --> 04:37:14.820 align:start position:0%
near future for us to upgrade the system
 
04:37:17.510 --> 04:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
and make sure that we can make it easier
 
04:37:19.310 --> 04:37:19.320 align:start position:0%
for those
 
04:37:22.789 --> 04:37:22.799 align:start position:0%
um caseworkers and people and the family
 
04:37:25.970 --> 04:37:25.980 align:start position:0%
assistants to answer their the calls and
 
04:37:29.449 --> 04:37:29.459 align:start position:0%
process the redeterminations quicker
 
04:37:32.689 --> 04:37:32.699 align:start position:0%
so you'll see major enhancements to that
 
04:37:34.609 --> 04:37:34.619 align:start position:0%
system this year and then in the future
 
04:37:37.970 --> 04:37:37.980 align:start position:0%
by Union we continue to enhance that one
 
04:37:39.949 --> 04:37:39.959 align:start position:0%
of the things that is required on this
 
04:37:44.990 --> 04:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
system is a bi-annual by it and you'll
 
04:37:48.369 --> 04:37:48.379 align:start position:0%
um audit that is
 
04:37:50.869 --> 04:37:50.879 align:start position:0%
extremely time consuming and
 
04:37:52.670 --> 04:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
historically we would put into a capital
 
04:37:52.680 --> 04:37:53.990 align:start position:0%
historically we would put into a capital
budget

04:37:53.990 --> 04:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:37:56.510 --> 04:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
but since it is a every two year process
 
04:37:58.609 --> 04:37:58.619 align:start position:0%
it is an operating function so you'll
 
04:38:02.929 --> 04:38:02.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:06.230 --> 04:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
the other big system in economic
 
04:38:08.990 --> 04:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
stability is child support services and
 
04:38:11.990 --> 04:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
their their solution is really
 
04:38:14.269 --> 04:38:14.279 align:start position:0%
processing money processing payments
 
04:38:16.849 --> 04:38:16.859 align:start position:0%
making sure that the families are
 
04:38:18.650 --> 04:38:18.660 align:start position:0%
receiving those payments
 
04:38:21.470 --> 04:38:21.480 align:start position:0%
and they have nine plan projects I don't
 
04:38:23.330 --> 04:38:23.340 align:start position:0%
have them listed here but there are nine
 
04:38:25.490 --> 04:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
plan projects of enhancing that system
 
04:38:27.289 --> 04:38:27.299 align:start position:0%
over the next biennium
 
04:38:30.170 --> 04:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
and it is in their budget submittal that
 
04:38:33.289 --> 04:38:33.299 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:36.289 --> 04:38:36.299 align:start position:0%
um one of the key components and you'll
 
04:38:38.631 --> 04:38:38.641 align:start position:0%
see that in here again is data analytics
 
04:38:40.310 --> 04:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
and and the other one is document
 
04:38:43.310 --> 04:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
management so data analytics is really
 
04:38:45.709 --> 04:38:45.719 align:start position:0%
the standardized reporting as well as
 
04:38:48.051 --> 04:38:48.061 align:start position:0%
that analytics to inform and produce
 
04:38:49.849 --> 04:38:49.859 align:start position:0%
knowledge but then the document
 
04:38:52.010 --> 04:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
management is really making sure that we
 
04:38:52.020 --> 04:38:53.090 align:start position:0%
management is really making sure that we
have

04:38:53.090 --> 04:38:53.100 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:38:56.029 --> 04:38:56.039 align:start position:0%
a way in which to store all of our data
 
04:38:59.390 --> 04:38:59.400 align:start position:0%
securely as well as maintain retention
 
04:39:02.090 --> 04:39:02.100 align:start position:0%
properly so every record in in
 
04:39:04.910 --> 04:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
government has a retention period our
 
04:39:06.051 --> 04:39:06.061 align:start position:0%
goal is to make sure that we can
 
04:39:08.269 --> 04:39:08.279 align:start position:0%
maintain that correctly for each system
 
04:39:11.090 --> 04:39:11.100 align:start position:0%
that document management initiative is
 
04:39:14.090 --> 04:39:14.100 align:start position:0%
also a department-wide one but Child
 
04:39:17.209 --> 04:39:17.219 align:start position:0%
Support Services leading the way on it
 
04:39:23.449 --> 04:39:23.459 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:26.449 --> 04:39:26.459 align:start position:0%
so on slide 17 long-term supports and
 
04:39:26.459 --> 04:39:27.590 align:start position:0%
so on slide 17 long-term supports and
services

04:39:27.590 --> 04:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
services
 
04:39:29.269 --> 04:39:29.279 align:start position:0%
here we have a number of different
 
04:39:33.590 --> 04:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
systems but what you'll see and I hope
 
04:39:35.150 --> 04:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
you'll see as we go through is that
 
04:39:36.590 --> 04:39:36.600 align:start position:0%
we're starting to align towards
 
04:39:38.750 --> 04:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
platforms and platforms are really
 
04:39:41.288 --> 04:39:41.298 align:start position:0%
important for us to scale our I.T
 
04:39:43.850 --> 04:39:43.860 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and services without
 
04:39:48.230 --> 04:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
having to add more bodies and so my my
 
04:39:51.650 --> 04:39:51.660 align:start position:0%
goal to support the performance of the
 
04:39:53.868 --> 04:39:53.878 align:start position:0%
organization is to be able to provide
 
04:39:56.150 --> 04:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
those services to enhance both the the
 
04:39:58.070 --> 04:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
caseworkers and the people that are
 
04:39:59.690 --> 04:39:59.700 align:start position:0%
providing services on the in the field
 
04:40:02.448 --> 04:40:02.458 align:start position:0%
but also ensure that we're not overly
 
04:40:04.190 --> 04:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
impacting our information technology
 
04:40:07.490 --> 04:40:07.500 align:start position:0%
resources and in our our smaller
 
04:40:09.230 --> 04:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
resource teams as well
 
04:40:10.970 --> 04:40:10.980 align:start position:0%
so in this case when you're talking
 
04:40:12.530 --> 04:40:12.540 align:start position:0%
about platforms are you talking about
 
04:40:15.110 --> 04:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
the new heights platform correct so
 
04:40:17.270 --> 04:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
historically New Heights has just been
 
04:40:19.910 --> 04:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
focused on eligibility but you'll see
 
04:40:21.590 --> 04:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
that we've expanded it this this
 
04:40:23.630 --> 04:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
biennium to supporting developmental
 
04:40:25.250 --> 04:40:25.260 align:start position:0%
disabilities program
 
04:40:27.288 --> 04:40:27.298 align:start position:0%
and we're going to continue to expand it
 
04:40:29.510 --> 04:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
to support other components of long-term
 
04:40:31.610 --> 04:40:31.620 align:start position:0%
Support Services well that's good I I
 
04:40:34.070 --> 04:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
just hadn't viewed it as a as a platform
 
04:40:35.930 --> 04:40:35.940 align:start position:0%
uh for some reason
 
04:40:40.010 --> 04:40:40.020 align:start position:0%
um that that that is a vendor supported
 
04:40:42.650 --> 04:40:42.660 align:start position:0%
system that they've made some modules
 
04:40:46.010 --> 04:40:46.020 align:start position:0%
that are tailored for us or or is that a
 
04:40:49.730 --> 04:40:49.740 align:start position:0%
what what's the sourcing on New Heights
 
04:40:52.310 --> 04:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
so new heights is a Java based
 
04:40:55.490 --> 04:40:55.500 align:start position:0%
application running on in our in our
 
04:40:57.110 --> 04:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
data center here at the State of New
 
04:41:00.110 --> 04:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and it's um it is a vendor
 
04:41:02.750 --> 04:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
managed solution for 100 vendor managed
 
04:41:05.690 --> 04:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
solution the way they built the
 
04:41:07.970 --> 04:41:07.980 align:start position:0%
eligibility workflows and the business
 
04:41:11.690 --> 04:41:11.700 align:start position:0%
rules enabled it to provide the same and
 
04:41:13.730 --> 04:41:13.740 align:start position:0%
very similar services to long-term
 
04:41:16.090 --> 04:41:16.100 align:start position:0%
supports and services
 
04:41:19.128 --> 04:41:19.138 align:start position:0%
does the vendor offer essentially the
 
04:41:23.750 --> 04:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
same software solution across multiple
 
04:41:26.930 --> 04:41:26.940 align:start position:0%
States or is it a unique roll your own
 
04:41:30.050 --> 04:41:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:32.770 --> 04:41:32.780 align:start position:0%
um I would say that when we when we
 
04:41:35.150 --> 04:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
built this solution the way the contract
 
04:41:37.368 --> 04:41:37.378 align:start position:0%
reads is it's it's our software it's our
 
04:41:39.770 --> 04:41:39.780 align:start position:0%
solution they cannot resell it
 
04:41:41.930 --> 04:41:41.940 align:start position:0%
um for their own profit however they do
 
04:41:44.030 --> 04:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
develop very similar Solutions in other
 
04:41:46.788 --> 04:41:46.798 align:start position:0%
states and so they do manage I think
 
04:41:48.830 --> 04:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
more than half of the states
 
04:41:52.190 --> 04:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
of the country's eligibility systems
 
04:41:54.350 --> 04:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
um and it's and they're in various
 
04:41:57.050 --> 04:41:57.060 align:start position:0%
versions of ours because we were the
 
04:41:58.368 --> 04:41:58.378 align:start position:0%
first one to have an integrated
 
04:42:00.650 --> 04:42:00.660 align:start position:0%
eligibility solution but they do have a
 
04:42:03.590 --> 04:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
newer technology that they are deploying
 
04:42:06.650 --> 04:42:06.660 align:start position:0%
as well however we have a fairly large
 
04:42:08.990 --> 04:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
investment in this current solution and
 
04:42:10.910 --> 04:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
we've been continuing to maintain and
 
04:42:12.770 --> 04:42:12.780 align:start position:0%
operate it so that its useful life
 
04:42:17.030 --> 04:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
actually is extended and so when I talk
 
04:42:19.670 --> 04:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
about useful life when we we had an
 
04:42:21.530 --> 04:42:21.540 align:start position:0%
opportunity to look at it and say do we
 
04:42:23.448 --> 04:42:23.458 align:start position:0%
want to replace the system
 
04:42:25.368 --> 04:42:25.378 align:start position:0%
and we went and looked at other states
 
04:42:26.990 --> 04:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
what they were spending to replace the
 
04:42:28.970 --> 04:42:28.980 align:start position:0%
system and it was upwards of 200 million
 
04:42:31.070 --> 04:42:31.080 align:start position:0%
dollars and then we looked at what we
 
04:42:33.230 --> 04:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
would need to do to maintain and upgrade
 
04:42:34.970 --> 04:42:34.980 align:start position:0%
the system so it could meet our needs
 
04:42:37.190 --> 04:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
and it was less than 10 million dollars
 
04:42:39.288 --> 04:42:39.298 align:start position:0%
to do that we looked at that and said
 
04:42:40.788 --> 04:42:40.798 align:start position:0%
that that's what we should do and that's
 
04:42:42.410 --> 04:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
why we moved forward with the
 
04:42:44.090 --> 04:42:44.100 align:start position:0%
enhancements of the existing New Height
 
04:42:44.100 --> 04:42:45.708 align:start position:0%
enhancements of the existing New Height
system

04:42:45.708 --> 04:42:45.718 align:start position:0%
system
 
04:42:48.230 --> 04:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
and it really became a monetary thing at
 
04:42:50.150 --> 04:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
that time can we meet the needs of the
 
04:42:52.730 --> 04:42:52.740 align:start position:0%
department is it robust enough that it
 
04:42:54.530 --> 04:42:54.540 align:start position:0%
can continue to
 
04:42:58.850 --> 04:42:58.860 align:start position:0%
um support and evolve and
 
04:43:02.270 --> 04:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
is it is it financially capable and it
 
04:43:04.128 --> 04:43:04.138 align:start position:0%
met all three of those and so they
 
04:43:06.050 --> 04:43:06.060 align:start position:0%
haven't missed a beat on any of our
 
04:43:07.610 --> 04:43:07.620 align:start position:0%
enhancements and so we don't have a
 
04:43:14.090 --> 04:43:14.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:16.070 --> 04:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
so with with that there are a couple
 
04:43:18.170 --> 04:43:18.180 align:start position:0%
other things that long-term supports and
 
04:43:20.410 --> 04:43:20.420 align:start position:0%
Services is looking to
 
04:43:22.970 --> 04:43:22.980 align:start position:0%
reprocure which is including the service
 
04:43:24.530 --> 04:43:24.540 align:start position:0%
link system which is like an information
 
04:43:26.750 --> 04:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
and referral system for the elderly
 
04:43:28.810 --> 04:43:28.820 align:start position:0%
Adult Services
 
04:43:28.820 --> 04:43:30.708 align:start position:0%
Adult Services
and

04:43:30.708 --> 04:43:30.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:43:33.110 --> 04:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
and then as you go forward there's a
 
04:43:35.090 --> 04:43:35.100 align:start position:0%
number of benefits of doing that so that
 
04:43:37.670 --> 04:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
the goal is to really streamline that
 
04:43:39.470 --> 04:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the service link system
 
04:43:42.050 --> 04:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
as maybe it could could be a component
 
04:43:44.390 --> 04:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
of the care coordination solution we're
 
04:43:47.090 --> 04:43:47.100 align:start position:0%
not sure if it will fully hit um be
 
04:43:49.128 --> 04:43:49.138 align:start position:0%
replaced by a care coordination or we'll
 
04:43:53.448 --> 04:43:53.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:55.670 --> 04:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
any questions on the long-term supports
 
04:43:57.590 --> 04:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
of service no I've jumped ahead to
 
04:44:01.128 --> 04:44:01.138 align:start position:0%
Medicaid is this is this the Investments
 
04:44:03.230 --> 04:44:03.240 align:start position:0%
that we needed to make because we were
 
04:44:07.128 --> 04:44:07.138 align:start position:0%
dealing with the really aged operating
 
04:44:09.288 --> 04:44:09.298 align:start position:0%
systems and security vulnerabilities
 
04:44:11.270 --> 04:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
were popping up and it was threatening
 
04:44:14.030 --> 04:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
our ability to continue being certified
 
04:44:15.530 --> 04:44:15.540 align:start position:0%
by the feds
 
04:44:18.890 --> 04:44:18.900 align:start position:0%
so continuing on slide 18 Medicaid
 
04:44:20.570 --> 04:44:20.580 align:start position:0%
there's two components so you're not
 
04:44:22.430 --> 04:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
wrong when we did make the initiative
 
04:44:25.448 --> 04:44:25.458 align:start position:0%
the investment in replacing the hardware
 
04:44:28.550 --> 04:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
and software and upgrading it to current
 
04:44:30.830 --> 04:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
Technologies utilizing our existing
 
04:44:30.840 --> 04:44:31.910 align:start position:0%
Technologies utilizing our existing
vendor

04:44:31.910 --> 04:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
vendor
 
04:44:34.610 --> 04:44:34.620 align:start position:0%
that's actually going in place knock on
 
04:44:36.410 --> 04:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
wood successfully February 11th through
 
04:44:39.708 --> 04:44:39.718 align:start position:0%
the 13th to address those security and
 
04:44:42.890 --> 04:44:42.900 align:start position:0%
it really wasn't security it was really
 
04:44:42.900 --> 04:44:46.368 align:start position:0%
it really wasn't security it was really
um

04:44:46.368 --> 04:44:46.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:48.708 --> 04:44:48.718 align:start position:0%
portability sustainability so the system
 
04:44:51.788 --> 04:44:51.798 align:start position:0%
was on Old Oracle versions old old
 
04:44:55.610 --> 04:44:55.620 align:start position:0%
cognos licenses old IBM Hardware all of
 
04:44:57.110 --> 04:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
the vendors were saying we're not going
 
04:44:58.788 --> 04:44:58.798 align:start position:0%
to support you anymore if you call us
 
04:45:01.250 --> 04:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
we're going to tell you to upgrade and
 
04:45:03.288 --> 04:45:03.298 align:start position:0%
so under center for Medicare and
 
04:45:05.330 --> 04:45:05.340 align:start position:0%
Medicaid services requirements if we're
 
04:45:07.310 --> 04:45:07.320 align:start position:0%
utilizing their funds to support our
 
04:45:09.350 --> 04:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
Medicaid system we're obligated to
 
04:45:11.330 --> 04:45:11.340 align:start position:0%
maintain and operate a system that is
 
04:45:13.368 --> 04:45:13.378 align:start position:0%
supported by the vendors that we're
 
04:45:17.690 --> 04:45:17.700 align:start position:0%
working with so they CMS supported our
 
04:45:17.700 --> 04:45:18.948 align:start position:0%
working with so they CMS supported our
our

04:45:18.948 --> 04:45:18.958 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:45:21.470 --> 04:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
funding for implementing the solution in
 
04:45:23.448 --> 04:45:23.458 align:start position:0%
their we report to them every month on
 
04:45:25.730 --> 04:45:25.740 align:start position:0%
our product productivity on implementing
 
04:45:27.770 --> 04:45:27.780 align:start position:0%
so we're pretty happy about that however
 
04:45:30.770 --> 04:45:30.780 align:start position:0%
the other component is that Medicaid
 
04:45:33.530 --> 04:45:33.540 align:start position:0%
will CMS won't continue to fund us if we
 
04:45:35.448 --> 04:45:35.458 align:start position:0%
just keep a legacy system that we
 
04:45:39.110 --> 04:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
implemented in 2007. without having a
 
04:45:41.750 --> 04:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
strategic review of the solution and how
 
04:45:43.670 --> 04:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
does it align with their strategy for
 
04:45:45.110 --> 04:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
future funding
 
04:45:48.530 --> 04:45:48.540 align:start position:0%
as a result of that Discovery in working
 
04:45:51.590 --> 04:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
with CMS we embarked on a re-procurement
 
04:45:55.010 --> 04:45:55.020 align:start position:0%
roadmap of the mmis or Medicaid
 
04:45:57.288 --> 04:45:57.298 align:start position:0%
management information system to replace
 
04:45:59.090 --> 04:45:59.100 align:start position:0%
it with the Medicaid enterprise system
 
04:45:59.100 --> 04:46:00.350 align:start position:0%
it with the Medicaid enterprise system
strategy

04:46:00.350 --> 04:46:00.360 align:start position:0%
strategy
 
04:46:02.090 --> 04:46:02.100 align:start position:0%
and what that really is is that we're
 
04:46:03.770 --> 04:46:03.780 align:start position:0%
going to replace it with 12 modular
 
04:46:07.190 --> 04:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
modular based Solutions and I've spoken
 
04:46:08.750 --> 04:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
to a couple of those modules system
 
04:46:12.170 --> 04:46:12.180 align:start position:0%
integrators one and then the data
 
04:46:14.510 --> 04:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
warehouse is another or data analytics
 
04:46:16.010 --> 04:46:16.020 align:start position:0%
is another
 
04:46:18.490 --> 04:46:18.500 align:start position:0%
but then you'll see provider management
 
04:46:22.810 --> 04:46:22.820 align:start position:0%
third party liability will be a module
 
04:46:25.850 --> 04:46:25.860 align:start position:0%
financial management fiscal operations
 
04:46:28.670 --> 04:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
is another one and then claims is the
 
04:46:31.190 --> 04:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
largest one and so over the next five
 
04:46:34.310 --> 04:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
years we have a road map of when we're
 
04:46:36.230 --> 04:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
going to go out to RFP when we're going
 
04:46:38.628 --> 04:46:38.638 align:start position:0%
to design develop and Implement and then
 
04:46:40.850 --> 04:46:40.860 align:start position:0%
as we go live how is that going to
 
04:46:42.530 --> 04:46:42.540 align:start position:0%
interface with the other systems that we
 
04:46:42.540 --> 04:46:44.570 align:start position:0%
interface with the other systems that we
have

04:46:44.570 --> 04:46:44.580 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:46:47.208 --> 04:46:47.218 align:start position:0%
a couple of those claims the claims
 
04:46:50.030 --> 04:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
management the data warehouse and data
 
04:46:51.410 --> 04:46:51.420 align:start position:0%
analytics as well as the system
 
04:46:54.288 --> 04:46:54.298 align:start position:0%
integrator instead of just implementing
 
04:46:56.270 --> 04:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
it for Medicaid or implementing it for
 
04:46:58.550 --> 04:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
the department so that we can do claims
 
04:47:00.670 --> 04:47:00.680 align:start position:0%
processing for
 
04:47:03.590 --> 04:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
dcyf through that engine as opposed to
 
04:47:05.570 --> 04:47:05.580 align:start position:0%
having two separate claims processing
 
04:47:08.270 --> 04:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
engines again that economies of scale
 
04:47:10.850 --> 04:47:10.860 align:start position:0%
it'll cost a lot of money one time but
 
04:47:12.470 --> 04:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
not a lot of money two times to do
 
04:47:15.050 --> 04:47:15.060 align:start position:0%
claims processing twice it also will
 
04:47:17.390 --> 04:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
reduce the amount of staff time spent on
 
04:47:19.550 --> 04:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
those systems because we'll have a
 
04:47:23.810 --> 04:47:23.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:27.948 --> 04:47:27.958 align:start position:0%
so so that claims module is is going to
 
04:47:30.230 --> 04:47:30.240 align:start position:0%
be attached to some other larger it
 
04:47:34.150 --> 04:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
system or some other larger platform
 
04:47:37.670 --> 04:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
or it's not it's not just a standalone
 
04:47:40.070 --> 04:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
Enterprise service it's got to connect
 
04:47:43.310 --> 04:47:43.320 align:start position:0%
to something somewhere doesn't it and
 
04:47:45.650 --> 04:47:45.660 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough the industry for
 
04:47:48.050 --> 04:47:48.060 align:start position:0%
claims though because of the modular
 
04:47:51.230 --> 04:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
direction that CMS took and presented to
 
04:47:53.830 --> 04:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
the vendor Community there are
 
04:47:56.390 --> 04:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
providers out there that provide just a
 
04:47:59.090 --> 04:47:59.100 align:start position:0%
claims engine that's and they can you
 
04:48:01.010 --> 04:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
can buy a claims engine from them on
 
04:48:02.390 --> 04:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
their environment
 
04:48:04.730 --> 04:48:04.740 align:start position:0%
that will then interface with provider
 
04:48:07.910 --> 04:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
management and with with our integrated
 
04:48:10.490 --> 04:48:10.500 align:start position:0%
eligibility successfully and that that
 
04:48:12.590 --> 04:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
is the intent of the
 
04:48:14.750 --> 04:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
modular implementation is to create
 
04:48:17.208 --> 04:48:17.218 align:start position:0%
those multiple service services
 
04:48:19.788 --> 04:48:19.798 align:start position:0%
Enterprise level services and allow us
 
04:48:22.128 --> 04:48:22.138 align:start position:0%
to get like you can call it best of
 
04:48:24.470 --> 04:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
breed or best practices solutions for
 
04:48:25.730 --> 04:48:25.740 align:start position:0%
people who don't know what we're just
 
04:48:27.288 --> 04:48:27.298 align:start position:0%
talking about that's really cool and
 
04:48:27.298 --> 04:48:28.368 align:start position:0%
talking about that's really cool and
exciting

04:48:28.368 --> 04:48:28.378 align:start position:0%
exciting
 
04:48:30.288 --> 04:48:30.298 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you could tell from our
 
04:48:31.490 --> 04:48:31.500 align:start position:0%
voice but
 
04:48:33.110 --> 04:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
04:48:35.810 --> 04:48:35.820 align:start position:0%
so I'm not going to really go into
 
04:48:37.670 --> 04:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
details like because I already sort of
 
04:48:39.230 --> 04:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
went on a high level of what the
 
04:48:41.090 --> 04:48:41.100 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Enterprise strategy was to do
 
04:48:43.128 --> 04:48:43.138 align:start position:0%
but there are some components that we're
 
04:48:45.890 --> 04:48:45.900 align:start position:0%
we're trying to leverage to
 
04:48:48.110 --> 04:48:48.120 align:start position:0%
um reduce our costs reduce our time to
 
04:48:50.330 --> 04:48:50.340 align:start position:0%
delivery leveraging National Association
 
04:48:52.730 --> 04:48:52.740 align:start position:0%
of State procurement officer Solutions
 
04:48:54.770 --> 04:48:54.780 align:start position:0%
where they already have certified
 
04:48:58.490 --> 04:48:58.500 align:start position:0%
vendors that they did RFP for eliminate
 
04:49:00.430 --> 04:49:00.440 align:start position:0%
some procurement timelines
 
04:49:04.330 --> 04:49:04.340 align:start position:0%
and then really you'll see in this next
 
04:49:06.350 --> 04:49:06.360 align:start position:0%
24-25 where you're going to see us
 
04:49:09.830 --> 04:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
implementing this system integrator
 
04:49:12.050 --> 04:49:12.060 align:start position:0%
um going out to RFP and implementing the
 
04:49:13.810 --> 04:49:13.820 align:start position:0%
beginning of a provider management
 
04:49:16.850 --> 04:49:16.860 align:start position:0%
module and the reason why we picked
 
04:49:18.948 --> 04:49:18.958 align:start position:0%
those two is the system integrators
 
04:49:21.230 --> 04:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
based off of our research and working
 
04:49:23.390 --> 04:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
with other states a lot of other states
 
04:49:25.190 --> 04:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
started with provider which is where
 
04:49:27.110 --> 04:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
usually there's some challenges and
 
04:49:29.150 --> 04:49:29.160 align:start position:0%
opportunities to improve
 
04:49:31.970 --> 04:49:31.980 align:start position:0%
and then they found out that they
 
04:49:33.050 --> 04:49:33.060 align:start position:0%
couldn't get the provider management
 
04:49:34.910 --> 04:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
solution to communicate to their
 
04:49:36.770 --> 04:49:36.780 align:start position:0%
eligibility system and to all their
 
04:49:38.390 --> 04:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
other systems and then they had to
 
04:49:40.628 --> 04:49:40.638 align:start position:0%
essentially shut it down start over
 
04:49:43.610 --> 04:49:43.620 align:start position:0%
Implement a system integrator and then
 
04:49:45.650 --> 04:49:45.660 align:start position:0%
Implement a provider management so by
 
04:49:47.208 --> 04:49:47.218 align:start position:0%
going a little bit later we got to learn
 
04:49:49.788 --> 04:49:49.798 align:start position:0%
from the people that led the way and
 
04:49:51.530 --> 04:49:51.540 align:start position:0%
made some of those errors and told us
 
04:49:53.750 --> 04:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
don't do what we did do it this way and
 
04:49:53.760 --> 04:49:54.530 align:start position:0%
don't do what we did do it this way and
so

04:49:54.530 --> 04:49:54.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:49:56.330 --> 04:49:56.340 align:start position:0%
that's why we're going system integrator
 
04:49:58.910 --> 04:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
first for that sort of I call it the
 
04:50:00.650 --> 04:50:00.660 align:start position:0%
brain it's going to tell all the arms
 
04:50:02.690 --> 04:50:02.700 align:start position:0%
and legs how to work and really without
 
04:50:05.050 --> 04:50:05.060 align:start position:0%
the brain you can't do a whole lot
 
04:50:08.090 --> 04:50:08.100 align:start position:0%
and so we'll get that in place and then
 
04:50:10.250 --> 04:50:10.260 align:start position:0%
we'll start moving on the other more
 
04:50:14.030 --> 04:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:16.010 --> 04:50:16.020 align:start position:0%
sorry you missed the punchline there
 
04:50:18.890 --> 04:50:18.900 align:start position:0%
without a brain you can't do much you
 
04:50:21.050 --> 04:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
can run for office
 
04:50:24.590 --> 04:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
but okay so this is this is really great
 
04:50:29.270 --> 04:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
I see your challenge on page 19. we're
 
04:50:31.788 --> 04:50:31.798 align:start position:0%
running into trained I.T professionals
 
04:50:34.550 --> 04:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
being maybe a bottleneck to a lot of
 
04:50:37.070 --> 04:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
what we're doing and so you must have
 
04:50:40.610 --> 04:50:40.620 align:start position:0%
some prioritization process on these 16
 
04:50:42.590 --> 04:50:42.600 align:start position:0%
or so projects which one you're going to
 
04:50:44.750 --> 04:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
knock out in what order
 
04:50:47.690 --> 04:50:47.700 align:start position:0%
we we do and we also have
 
04:50:49.970 --> 04:50:49.980 align:start position:0%
um budgetary constraints so that there
 
04:50:51.770 --> 04:50:51.780 align:start position:0%
are opportunities so that the state of
 
04:50:53.470 --> 04:50:53.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in general
 
04:50:56.330 --> 04:50:56.340 align:start position:0%
hires out most of its work outsources
 
04:51:00.050 --> 04:51:00.060 align:start position:0%
the effort Outsourcing can be really
 
04:51:02.330 --> 04:51:02.340 align:start position:0%
beneficial in the sense that you have
 
04:51:04.070 --> 04:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
that one-time investment in the people
 
04:51:06.830 --> 04:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
to help implement but it does come at a
 
04:51:09.410 --> 04:51:09.420 align:start position:0%
cost and so you'll see in our budget as
 
04:51:11.030 --> 04:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
it goes forward I don't know what you'll
 
04:51:13.010 --> 04:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
see once it gets approved once it moves
 
04:51:15.650 --> 04:51:15.660 align:start position:0%
from the governor's face to your to your
 
04:51:17.570 --> 04:51:17.580 align:start position:0%
face but as that goes through we're
 
04:51:19.430 --> 04:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
going to be crosswalking our submittal
 
04:51:22.788 --> 04:51:22.798 align:start position:0%
to see what is in there and how does it
 
04:51:24.890 --> 04:51:24.900 align:start position:0%
support us being able to achieve this
 
04:51:26.930 --> 04:51:26.940 align:start position:0%
this goal and these missions
 
04:51:29.810 --> 04:51:29.820 align:start position:0%
and based off of what's in the house
 
04:51:32.208 --> 04:51:32.218 align:start position:0%
budget we'll be able to determine which
 
04:51:34.570 --> 04:51:34.580 align:start position:0%
ones we will need to prioritize lower
 
04:51:36.770 --> 04:51:36.780 align:start position:0%
and maybe put in what we call the
 
04:51:38.930 --> 04:51:38.940 align:start position:0%
parking lot okay if I heard you right
 
04:51:42.050 --> 04:51:42.060 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's it's like
 
04:51:44.570 --> 04:51:44.580 align:start position:0%
like I was hoping you would go first
 
04:51:47.270 --> 04:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
like like you would you you would go
 
04:51:49.430 --> 04:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
here's the Strategic plan of the
 
04:51:52.330 --> 04:51:52.340 align:start position:0%
commissioner here's the it support plan
 
04:51:55.010 --> 04:51:55.020 align:start position:0%
here are all the priorities as a result
 
04:51:56.990 --> 04:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
and this is how we're resource we're
 
04:51:58.850 --> 04:51:58.860 align:start position:0%
going to Resource these top priorities
 
04:52:01.190 --> 04:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a cut line where we
 
04:52:02.930 --> 04:52:02.940 align:start position:0%
weren't out of resources and we start
 
04:52:05.448 --> 04:52:05.458 align:start position:0%
talking about you know incremental
 
04:52:08.448 --> 04:52:08.458 align:start position:0%
improvements that I was I was hoping you
 
04:52:10.910 --> 04:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
guys would go in this top-down approach
 
04:52:13.850 --> 04:52:13.860 align:start position:0%
but I think I just heard you say
 
04:52:16.128 --> 04:52:16.138 align:start position:0%
depending on what we budget
 
04:52:18.530 --> 04:52:18.540 align:start position:0%
you're going to prioritize us and do
 
04:52:20.930 --> 04:52:20.940 align:start position:0%
those first and so we're sort of coming
 
04:52:22.430 --> 04:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
at this
 
04:52:25.128 --> 04:52:25.138 align:start position:0%
backwards from each other
 
04:52:28.490 --> 04:52:28.500 align:start position:0%
so let me clarify so we did go through
 
04:52:31.070 --> 04:52:31.080 align:start position:0%
during our agency phase all our
 
04:52:32.570 --> 04:52:32.580 align:start position:0%
prioritization what we consider
 
04:52:35.690 --> 04:52:35.700 align:start position:0%
priorities and if I put every priority
 
04:52:37.550 --> 04:52:37.560 align:start position:0%
that we needed on the list we would need
 
04:52:40.670 --> 04:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
a well more than our budget that we
 
04:52:43.010 --> 04:52:43.020 align:start position:0%
would ever submit just like anything you
 
04:52:44.208 --> 04:52:44.218 align:start position:0%
have to be reasonable with your
 
04:52:45.890 --> 04:52:45.900 align:start position:0%
submittal so we went through and we
 
04:52:48.530 --> 04:52:48.540 align:start position:0%
called it through and we'd say what are
 
04:52:51.590 --> 04:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
these are critical and high importance
 
04:52:53.868 --> 04:52:53.878 align:start position:0%
to the organization to achieve and
 
04:52:55.310 --> 04:52:55.320 align:start position:0%
that's that's what we submitted forward
 
04:52:59.270 --> 04:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
both to from an agency I.T plan and from
 
04:53:01.788 --> 04:53:01.798 align:start position:0%
a capital budget and a operating budget
 
04:53:04.490 --> 04:53:04.500 align:start position:0%
we submitted criticals and highs but
 
04:53:05.990 --> 04:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
there's not a single thing on the it
 
04:53:08.868 --> 04:53:08.878 align:start position:0%
list or the program list that I know of
 
04:53:11.330 --> 04:53:11.340 align:start position:0%
that is like a medium or low so anything
 
04:53:13.490 --> 04:53:13.500 align:start position:0%
that gets cut will have impact to
 
04:53:16.330 --> 04:53:16.340 align:start position:0%
services and programs in our department
 
04:53:18.708 --> 04:53:18.718 align:start position:0%
and so that that's the challenge it's
 
04:53:21.530 --> 04:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
like you have to continue to evolve in
 
04:53:23.390 --> 04:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
the last couple years through the
 
04:53:26.270 --> 04:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
pandemic we implemented Solutions and we
 
04:53:28.610 --> 04:53:28.620 align:start position:0%
have to maintain those Solutions and the
 
04:53:31.670 --> 04:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
challenges when you utilize funds like
 
04:53:34.128 --> 04:53:34.138 align:start position:0%
cares act and arpa funds you have to
 
04:53:35.810 --> 04:53:35.820 align:start position:0%
look at now we have these great
 
04:53:37.610 --> 04:53:37.620 align:start position:0%
solutions to help us Implement better
 
04:53:40.070 --> 04:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
Services now we need to continue the
 
04:53:42.650 --> 04:53:42.660 align:start position:0%
operating funds to support those so
 
04:53:44.330 --> 04:53:44.340 align:start position:0%
you'll see those as well in the budget
 
04:53:44.340 --> 04:53:45.350 align:start position:0%
you'll see those as well in the budget
but

04:53:45.350 --> 04:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:53:47.270 --> 04:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
what I was what I was referring to
 
04:53:50.208 --> 04:53:50.218 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards Mr chairman was
 
04:53:52.550 --> 04:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
that as you go through different phases
 
04:53:56.090 --> 04:53:56.100 align:start position:0%
of a budget when there are Cuts then our
 
04:53:58.010 --> 04:53:58.020 align:start position:0%
goal is to be able to understand that
 
04:54:00.110 --> 04:54:00.120 align:start position:0%
those are Cuts here's the impacts and
 
04:54:01.788 --> 04:54:01.798 align:start position:0%
then those are now de-prioritized
 
04:54:03.948 --> 04:54:03.958 align:start position:0%
projects because that's just the part of
 
04:54:06.410 --> 04:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
budgeting right and so if if there is a
 
04:54:09.170 --> 04:54:09.180 align:start position:0%
cut then I'll work with the division
 
04:54:11.628 --> 04:54:11.638 align:start position:0%
directors and the CFO to understand the
 
04:54:14.330 --> 04:54:14.340 align:start position:0%
impact steel organization
 
04:54:17.690 --> 04:54:17.700 align:start position:0%
sure I I was just wanting us in theory
 
04:54:19.490 --> 04:54:19.500 align:start position:0%
to be able to help by seeing what the
 
04:54:21.230 --> 04:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
priorities were and trying not to cut
 
04:54:23.690 --> 04:54:23.700 align:start position:0%
the priorities so if we accidentally
 
04:54:26.030 --> 04:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
inserted a budget cut somewhere that we
 
04:54:28.128 --> 04:54:28.138 align:start position:0%
were doing we were looking before we
 
04:54:29.270 --> 04:54:29.280 align:start position:0%
were leaping
 
04:54:31.310 --> 04:54:31.320 align:start position:0%
yeah so it's
 
04:54:33.170 --> 04:54:33.180 align:start position:0%
I guess we're going to come at it from
 
04:54:35.090 --> 04:54:35.100 align:start position:0%
both angles we will do our best to
 
04:54:40.190 --> 04:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:43.550 --> 04:54:43.560 align:start position:0%
you want to skip to 22 I know that's
 
04:54:45.230 --> 04:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
that's a big jump we're on
 
04:54:48.050 --> 04:54:48.060 align:start position:0%
department-wide challenges sure
 
04:54:50.750 --> 04:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
so we we sort of spoke to them but at
 
04:54:52.430 --> 04:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
the high level department-wide
 
04:54:55.368 --> 04:54:55.378 align:start position:0%
challenges are Staffing time and funding
 
04:54:57.410 --> 04:54:57.420 align:start position:0%
and that pretty much is
 
04:54:59.330 --> 04:54:59.340 align:start position:0%
correlates to almost everything you ever
 
04:55:02.330 --> 04:55:02.340 align:start position:0%
look at but our staffing due to low
 
04:55:05.150 --> 04:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
wages resulting in smaller teams really
 
04:55:07.850 --> 04:55:07.860 align:start position:0%
impacts our time to deliver and what
 
04:55:10.490 --> 04:55:10.500 align:start position:0%
that results in is projects that take
 
04:55:12.948 --> 04:55:12.958 align:start position:0%
years instead of like three years
 
04:55:16.128 --> 04:55:16.138 align:start position:0%
instead of one year or months instead of
 
04:55:18.288 --> 04:55:18.298 align:start position:0%
weeks and so in many cases there are
 
04:55:20.510 --> 04:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
solutions that we could Implement rather
 
04:55:23.030 --> 04:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
quickly but without the resources we
 
04:55:25.430 --> 04:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
can't and so that's
 
04:55:27.110 --> 04:55:27.120 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest challenges I would
 
04:55:28.730 --> 04:55:28.740 align:start position:0%
say the division directors would say
 
04:55:30.470 --> 04:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
that they have with me as well as they
 
04:55:32.330 --> 04:55:32.340 align:start position:0%
have with information Technologies we
 
04:55:34.310 --> 04:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
don't have the staff to support their
 
04:55:37.010 --> 04:55:37.020 align:start position:0%
continuous needs to to meet legislative
 
04:55:40.010 --> 04:55:40.020 align:start position:0%
mandates to meet um current their
 
04:55:41.628 --> 04:55:41.638 align:start position:0%
clients and their providers and their
 
04:55:43.550 --> 04:55:43.560 align:start position:0%
patients needs and the individuals of
 
04:55:45.708 --> 04:55:45.718 align:start position:0%
our state's needs and so then they
 
04:55:47.628 --> 04:55:47.638 align:start position:0%
create workarounds
 
04:55:49.190 --> 04:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
um and then
 
04:55:51.948 --> 04:55:51.958 align:start position:0%
so then the the timelines and I sort of
 
04:55:53.750 --> 04:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
sort of I spelled this out a little bit
 
04:55:56.708 --> 04:55:56.718 align:start position:0%
is in order to do some of these major
 
04:55:59.930 --> 04:55:59.940 align:start position:0%
efforts and it takes Discovery so we
 
04:56:01.550 --> 04:56:01.560 align:start position:0%
need to work with what we call subject
 
04:56:03.050 --> 04:56:03.060 align:start position:0%
matter experts
 
04:56:06.110 --> 04:56:06.120 align:start position:0%
and we need it business analysts and
 
04:56:07.850 --> 04:56:07.860 align:start position:0%
project managers to work with them to
 
04:56:10.310 --> 04:56:10.320 align:start position:0%
really understand what do they need and
 
04:56:12.230 --> 04:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
then translate that into a requirements
 
04:56:14.230 --> 04:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
so that we can then build a good project
 
04:56:17.150 --> 04:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
a good project plan good scope and a
 
04:56:19.610 --> 04:56:19.620 align:start position:0%
good contract to then either Outsource
 
04:56:22.430 --> 04:56:22.440 align:start position:0%
or that would be the contract way or in
 
04:56:25.010 --> 04:56:25.020 align:start position:0%
source with our current resources right
 
04:56:28.788 --> 04:56:28.798 align:start position:0%
so so I'm I'm the the first words under
 
04:56:32.330 --> 04:56:32.340 align:start position:0%
Staffing on page 22 Patrician due to low
 
04:56:34.570 --> 04:56:34.580 align:start position:0%
wages okay so
 
04:56:40.010 --> 04:56:40.020 align:start position:0%
if you were to quantify that uh what how
 
04:56:44.390 --> 04:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
low is too low are we you know 20 below
 
04:56:47.350 --> 04:56:47.360 align:start position:0%
Market five percent below Market how
 
04:56:51.288 --> 04:56:51.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:53.930 --> 04:56:53.940 align:start position:0%
um I'll take that one because I see it
 
04:56:56.930 --> 04:56:56.940 align:start position:0%
across the I.T across the state um it
 
04:56:59.628 --> 04:56:59.638 align:start position:0%
really depends on the roles what we did
 
04:57:01.670 --> 04:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
see is is Major
 
04:57:05.208 --> 04:57:05.218 align:start position:0%
um major wage inflation in the areas
 
04:57:08.990 --> 04:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
that are most in demand which includes
 
04:57:12.230 --> 04:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
all of the things that DHHS is doing so
 
04:57:14.030 --> 04:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
the you know the platforms like
 
04:57:15.830 --> 04:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
Salesforce the electronic business
 
04:57:18.110 --> 04:57:18.120 align:start position:0%
intelligence those are the those uh
 
04:57:20.230 --> 04:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
cyber security those are the hottest
 
04:57:23.330 --> 04:57:23.340 align:start position:0%
talents in there and during covet
 
04:57:26.208 --> 04:57:26.218 align:start position:0%
particularly wage inflation was very
 
04:57:29.570 --> 04:57:29.580 align:start position:0%
significant in those areas so it varies
 
04:57:32.510 --> 04:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
by area but but we're we're particularly
 
04:57:35.208 --> 04:57:35.218 align:start position:0%
for uh in the areas that um David's
 
04:57:36.350 --> 04:57:36.360 align:start position:0%
talking about where you're looking for
 
04:57:39.230 --> 04:57:39.240 align:start position:0%
business analysts project managers
 
04:57:42.230 --> 04:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
um and um and sometimes developers or
 
04:57:44.330 --> 04:57:44.340 align:start position:0%
senior Architects
 
04:57:47.690 --> 04:57:47.700 align:start position:0%
um we're very significantly below Market
 
04:57:50.990 --> 04:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
um like way more than 20 percent
 
04:57:54.830 --> 04:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
could be 100 or more way more you just
 
04:57:56.930 --> 04:57:56.940 align:start position:0%
said it could be as much as a hundred
 
04:57:59.030 --> 04:57:59.040 align:start position:0%
percent so we're paying I guess I know
 
04:58:01.490 --> 04:58:01.500 align:start position:0%
some roles in my team where we are a
 
04:58:03.650 --> 04:58:03.660 align:start position:0%
third of market right now so as I
 
04:58:05.990 --> 04:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
understand the governor is preparing a
 
04:58:06.000 --> 04:58:07.510 align:start position:0%
understand the governor is preparing a
Statewide

04:58:07.510 --> 04:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
Statewide
 
04:58:11.990 --> 04:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
salary fix uh for this budget that he's
 
04:58:14.030 --> 04:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
going to talk to us about and it's going
 
04:58:15.368 --> 04:58:15.378 align:start position:0%
to be in the budget
 
04:58:20.208 --> 04:58:20.218 align:start position:0%
uh I I can't I I can't imagine him
 
04:58:23.628 --> 04:58:23.638 align:start position:0%
saying is it do you
 
04:58:26.208 --> 04:58:26.218 align:start position:0%
I'll just be quiet on that I I I I I
 
04:58:28.670 --> 04:58:28.680 align:start position:0%
don't know how to repair something that
 
04:58:31.128 --> 04:58:31.138 align:start position:0%
that's got such a huge differential well
 
04:58:33.288 --> 04:58:33.298 align:start position:0%
I think anything is going to be helpful
 
04:58:36.410 --> 04:58:36.420 align:start position:0%
and and a lot of us don't come and do
 
04:58:38.208 --> 04:58:38.218 align:start position:0%
our jobs
 
04:58:39.830 --> 04:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
with the money
 
04:58:43.310 --> 04:58:43.320 align:start position:0%
um and so there there really is the to
 
04:58:46.970 --> 04:58:46.980 align:start position:0%
me for example I you know uh I could
 
04:58:48.708 --> 04:58:48.718 align:start position:0%
earn a lot more out in the private
 
04:58:51.050 --> 04:58:51.060 align:start position:0%
sector but I really like I love my job
 
04:58:52.810 --> 04:58:52.820 align:start position:0%
and I love doing what I'm doing so
 
04:58:55.970 --> 04:58:55.980 align:start position:0%
there's there's that aspect to it I know
 
04:58:58.368 --> 04:58:58.378 align:start position:0%
um you know so in my private sector
 
04:59:00.830 --> 04:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
roles we were motivated by stock options
 
04:59:03.350 --> 04:59:03.360 align:start position:0%
and bonuses and things like that but
 
04:59:05.810 --> 04:59:05.820 align:start position:0%
what I use as a motivation is citizen
 
04:59:07.788 --> 04:59:07.798 align:start position:0%
service you know that fulfillment you
 
04:59:09.770 --> 04:59:09.780 align:start position:0%
get so when you're implementing a system
 
04:59:12.650 --> 04:59:12.660 align:start position:0%
I try not to talk about it in terms of
 
04:59:15.590 --> 04:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
hey you just put this technology in you
 
04:59:18.288 --> 04:59:18.298 align:start position:0%
just made the line shorter at DMV you
 
04:59:20.448 --> 04:59:20.458 align:start position:0%
just you know you just did this really
 
04:59:22.368 --> 04:59:22.378 align:start position:0%
huge thing for the benefits of the
 
04:59:24.590 --> 04:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire you know so a
 
04:59:26.690 --> 04:59:26.700 align:start position:0%
lot of the things that that I try to do
 
04:59:29.448 --> 04:59:29.458 align:start position:0%
is explain it in that context so I
 
04:59:31.788 --> 04:59:31.798 align:start position:0%
believe we'll always be below work and
 
04:59:34.010 --> 04:59:34.020 align:start position:0%
we have to be you know there's a certain
 
04:59:35.570 --> 04:59:35.580 align:start position:0%
Tipping Point where you know if you're
 
04:59:37.010 --> 04:59:37.020 align:start position:0%
too far below you might have a real
 
04:59:38.628 --> 04:59:38.638 align:start position:0%
problem and I think we've hit that but
 
04:59:38.638 --> 04:59:39.770 align:start position:0%
problem and I think we've hit that but
but

04:59:39.770 --> 04:59:39.780 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:59:42.530 --> 04:59:42.540 align:start position:0%
um I I do believe that what um what's
 
04:59:44.810 --> 04:59:44.820 align:start position:0%
being proposed will help particularly on
 
04:59:47.628 --> 04:59:47.638 align:start position:0%
retention but there's just a
 
04:59:47.638 --> 04:59:48.170 align:start position:0%
retention but there's just a
um

04:59:48.170 --> 04:59:48.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:52.190 --> 04:59:52.200 align:start position:0%
and I do believe that you know we'll
 
04:59:53.770 --> 04:59:53.780 align:start position:0%
continue to have that balance between
 
04:59:55.970 --> 04:59:55.980 align:start position:0%
using you know outside contract
 
04:59:57.890 --> 04:59:57.900 align:start position:0%
resources to deliver on big system
 
05:00:00.470 --> 05:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
implementations as well as uh State
 
05:00:03.170 --> 05:00:03.180 align:start position:0%
staff to to run you you'll always need
 
05:00:05.448 --> 05:00:05.458 align:start position:0%
State staff to do the top level
 
05:00:07.310 --> 05:00:07.320 align:start position:0%
management the contracts management
 
05:00:11.090 --> 05:00:11.100 align:start position:0%
things like that so so uh in an era of
 
05:00:16.070 --> 05:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
rapidly Rising wage uh requests I I
 
05:00:18.110 --> 05:00:18.120 align:start position:0%
would I would think that the contract
 
05:00:20.990 --> 05:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
route would be more successful to
 
05:00:24.350 --> 05:00:24.360 align:start position:0%
inflationary pressure than what we could
 
05:00:27.070 --> 05:00:27.080 align:start position:0%
do with salaries
 
05:00:29.628 --> 05:00:29.638 align:start position:0%
does that make sense does that is that
 
05:00:31.730 --> 05:00:31.740 align:start position:0%
your experience the contracts are going
 
05:00:34.730 --> 05:00:34.740 align:start position:0%
up faster than if we if we were to build
 
05:00:36.948 --> 05:00:36.958 align:start position:0%
staff in-house
 
05:00:40.128 --> 05:00:40.138 align:start position:0%
um well contractors you know there's two
 
05:00:43.610 --> 05:00:43.620 align:start position:0%
things it it is it's if you're going to
 
05:00:45.410 --> 05:00:45.420 align:start position:0%
if you're a system integrator you're
 
05:00:47.090 --> 05:00:47.100 align:start position:0%
going to have to hire at Market you have
 
05:00:49.128 --> 05:00:49.138 align:start position:0%
no choice or you won't have people
 
05:00:51.470 --> 05:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
particularly in the hot areas so if
 
05:00:53.390 --> 05:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
there is wage inflation there then when
 
05:00:56.330 --> 05:00:56.340 align:start position:0%
they bid on contracts they will account
 
05:00:59.570 --> 05:00:59.580 align:start position:0%
for that ins inside their bids there's a
 
05:01:00.948 --> 05:01:00.958 align:start position:0%
little bit of a perverse effect too
 
05:01:02.750 --> 05:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
that's happening where we see some if we
 
05:01:04.550 --> 05:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
have a good contract in place or I say
 
05:01:06.590 --> 05:01:06.600 align:start position:0%
good is now you know we had some
 
05:01:08.810 --> 05:01:08.820 align:start position:0%
competitive pre-covered wages that still
 
05:01:11.330 --> 05:01:11.340 align:start position:0%
exist those are challenging because the
 
05:01:13.670 --> 05:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
motivation to actually do the job is in
 
05:01:15.470 --> 05:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
some cases is diminished by the system
 
05:01:18.230 --> 05:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
integrator because their profit margins
 
05:01:20.448 --> 05:01:20.458 align:start position:0%
may have shrunk to you know quite a lot
 
05:01:22.970 --> 05:01:22.980 align:start position:0%
in um based on the fact that that we
 
05:01:24.530 --> 05:01:24.540 align:start position:0%
locked them in you know and I say a
 
05:01:26.208 --> 05:01:26.218 align:start position:0%
three or five year deal and now they're
 
05:01:28.610 --> 05:01:28.620 align:start position:0%
you know you've pre-covered weight rates
 
05:01:31.368 --> 05:01:31.378 align:start position:0%
in there so so that is a interesting
 
05:01:32.868 --> 05:01:32.878 align:start position:0%
effect that we're seeing as well where
 
05:01:35.868 --> 05:01:35.878 align:start position:0%
there's less motivation to service an
 
05:01:37.670 --> 05:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
existing contract
 
05:01:40.670 --> 05:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
or Mooney
 
05:01:42.230 --> 05:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and thank you for
 
05:01:43.850 --> 05:01:43.860 align:start position:0%
your presentation today obviously very
 
05:01:46.010 --> 05:01:46.020 align:start position:0%
detailed because the work you do is so
 
05:01:50.750 --> 05:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
thorough uh getting to slide 17 in a
 
05:01:53.868 --> 05:01:53.878 align:start position:0%
nutshell I know that vendors will always
 
05:01:56.830 --> 05:01:56.840 align:start position:0%
propose the latest and the greatest
 
05:02:01.190 --> 05:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
updates and software and programs and so
 
05:02:04.430 --> 05:02:04.440 align:start position:0%
on and so forth in a nutshell what is
 
05:02:07.250 --> 05:02:07.260 align:start position:0%
the state's procedure process to be sure
 
05:02:11.330 --> 05:02:11.340 align:start position:0%
we're getting exactly what we need and
 
05:02:14.170 --> 05:02:14.180 align:start position:0%
we're paying for exactly
 
05:02:17.868 --> 05:02:17.878 align:start position:0%
the item that a vendor could give us to
 
05:02:20.448 --> 05:02:20.458 align:start position:0%
make sure we're delivering the best
 
05:02:23.930 --> 05:02:23.940 align:start position:0%
Services I can imagine it's difficult to
 
05:02:27.350 --> 05:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
weed through a lot of marketing and
 
05:02:27.360 --> 05:02:28.910 align:start position:0%
weed through a lot of marketing and
Promises

05:02:28.910 --> 05:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
Promises
 
05:02:31.250 --> 05:02:31.260 align:start position:0%
yes you you really get into the
 
05:02:34.070 --> 05:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
procurement process there
 
05:02:36.410 --> 05:02:36.420 align:start position:0%
um so it's one of the reasons why it
 
05:02:37.788 --> 05:02:37.798 align:start position:0%
takes us a while is because we're we
 
05:02:40.190 --> 05:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
really are careful and DHHS is
 
05:02:42.170 --> 05:02:42.180 align:start position:0%
particularly careful
 
05:02:44.690 --> 05:02:44.700 align:start position:0%
um as we go through the the process of
 
05:02:48.530 --> 05:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
procurement to look at to validate that
 
05:02:51.050 --> 05:02:51.060 align:start position:0%
what we've asked for so it starts in the
 
05:02:52.670 --> 05:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
beginning right you have to ask for what
 
05:02:53.990 --> 05:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
you need
 
05:02:56.448 --> 05:02:56.458 align:start position:0%
and and that takes a lot of work you
 
05:02:57.530 --> 05:02:57.540 align:start position:0%
know you would think it'd be easy right
 
05:02:59.448 --> 05:02:59.458 align:start position:0%
what do you need but that Discovery
 
05:03:02.868 --> 05:03:02.878 align:start position:0%
process is can be pretty lengthy if you
 
05:03:04.850 --> 05:03:04.860 align:start position:0%
do that well then at least you have a
 
05:03:07.010 --> 05:03:07.020 align:start position:0%
procurement that if fulfilled will get
 
05:03:09.050 --> 05:03:09.060 align:start position:0%
the business folks what they need in the
 
05:03:11.510 --> 05:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
end then there's the process of
 
05:03:13.610 --> 05:03:13.620 align:start position:0%
evaluating the responses and parsing out
 
05:03:15.708 --> 05:03:15.718 align:start position:0%
those responses to make sure that you
 
05:03:17.270 --> 05:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
are actually going to get what you need
 
05:03:20.868 --> 05:03:20.878 align:start position:0%
and then you've you have to hold this uh
 
05:03:23.930 --> 05:03:23.940 align:start position:0%
the supplier accountable once you're you
 
05:03:25.430 --> 05:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
know so you award the contract you go
 
05:03:26.750 --> 05:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
through the governor and Council process
 
05:03:29.750 --> 05:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
you you kick off the project it's really
 
05:03:32.750 --> 05:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
important to have that relationship with
 
05:03:34.730 --> 05:03:34.740 align:start position:0%
your partner who's who's delivering to
 
05:03:36.410 --> 05:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
make sure that they are holding up their
 
05:03:39.050 --> 05:03:39.060 align:start position:0%
end meeting the terms of the agreement
 
05:03:42.110 --> 05:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a pretty and we we all
 
05:03:44.930 --> 05:03:44.940 align:start position:0%
together spend a lot of time on that yep
 
05:03:46.670 --> 05:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
and then that's both for delivery
 
05:03:47.990 --> 05:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
perspective from a cyber security
 
05:03:50.330 --> 05:03:50.340 align:start position:0%
perspective from a from a privacy
 
05:03:56.330 --> 05:03:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:01.910 --> 05:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:06.110 --> 05:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
so anyone in the attendance feel like
 
05:04:08.390 --> 05:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
you want to say anything after all of
 
05:04:08.400 --> 05:04:09.170 align:start position:0%
you want to say anything after all of
this

05:04:09.170 --> 05:04:09.180 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:04:09.180 --> 05:04:11.208 align:start position:0%
this
no

05:04:11.208 --> 05:04:11.218 align:start position:0%
no
 
05:04:13.490 --> 05:04:13.500 align:start position:0%
um Mr Ripple
 
05:04:15.590 --> 05:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
So based on today
 
05:04:18.410 --> 05:04:18.420 align:start position:0%
I I think I think we need to find at
 
05:04:20.868 --> 05:04:20.878 align:start position:0%
least a three-hour block to continue a
 
05:04:24.288 --> 05:04:24.298 align:start position:0%
work session on HP 49.
 
05:04:26.868 --> 05:04:26.878 align:start position:0%
you you're probably way ahead what what
 
05:04:29.570 --> 05:04:29.580 align:start position:0%
do you got well I haven't uh talked to
 
05:04:31.368 --> 05:04:31.378 align:start position:0%
Janet about it or scheduled anything yet
 
05:04:34.128 --> 05:04:34.138 align:start position:0%
I don't I was waiting to see what days
 
05:04:36.230 --> 05:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
you thought uh might be best you already
 
05:04:36.240 --> 05:04:37.368 align:start position:0%
you thought uh might be best you already
have

05:04:37.368 --> 05:04:37.378 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:04:40.310 --> 05:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
pretty much a full day of work scheduled
 
05:04:45.050 --> 05:04:45.060 align:start position:0%
for Thursday the 9th so I'm not sure
 
05:04:47.628 --> 05:04:47.638 align:start position:0%
before the ninth okay
 
05:04:47.638 --> 05:04:52.368 align:start position:0%
before the ninth okay
um

05:04:52.368 --> 05:04:52.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:54.288 --> 05:04:54.298 align:start position:0%
well anything that we try to schedule
 
05:04:56.570 --> 05:04:56.580 align:start position:0%
now will not appear in the calendar in
 
05:04:58.190 --> 05:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
that case
 
05:05:02.090 --> 05:05:02.100 align:start position:0%
I you know as as much as I love the
 
05:05:04.190 --> 05:05:04.200 align:start position:0%
calendar at this point I I want to make
 
05:05:05.628 --> 05:05:05.638 align:start position:0%
sure that we have an opportunity to
 
05:05:08.030 --> 05:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
complete the conversation okay and I and
 
05:05:09.830 --> 05:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
so whatever the rules are I want to
 
05:05:13.788 --> 05:05:13.798 align:start position:0%
comply with the rules but you know
 
05:05:15.350 --> 05:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
so do you think Wednesday would be a
 
05:05:18.170 --> 05:05:18.180 align:start position:0%
good day to meet in that case well uh I
 
05:05:21.110 --> 05:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
had thought we I had reserved the eighth
 
05:05:23.030 --> 05:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
because I thought initially that was
 
05:05:25.850 --> 05:05:25.860 align:start position:0%
when Finance was going to meet so so
 
05:05:28.190 --> 05:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
it's probably Wednesday the 8th is
 
05:05:33.110 --> 05:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
probably open for me uh is it open for
 
05:05:34.610 --> 05:05:34.620 align:start position:0%
you I see you not in your head
 
05:05:38.990 --> 05:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
representative erf and tlerski walner go
 
05:05:39.000 --> 05:05:39.890 align:start position:0%
representative erf and tlerski walner go
ahead

05:05:39.890 --> 05:05:39.900 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
05:05:42.590 --> 05:05:42.600 align:start position:0%
on the 8th it on my calendar it says we
 
05:05:45.708 --> 05:05:45.718 align:start position:0%
have a 10 45 in finance and then I have
 
05:05:47.628 --> 05:05:47.638 align:start position:0%
a bill to introduce as a prime sponsor
 
05:05:57.350 --> 05:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:57.360 --> 05:06:03.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:06:03.230 --> 05:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:06.170 --> 05:06:06.180 align:start position:0%
I I can check on 104. we can find a room
 
05:06:08.030 --> 05:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
to work in right because we're a smaller
 
05:06:10.010 --> 05:06:10.020 align:start position:0%
group we don't need all this space
 
05:06:14.628 --> 05:06:14.638 align:start position:0%
oh okay let's let's shoot for that now
 
05:06:19.128 --> 05:06:19.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:22.670 --> 05:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
clerk but how do we how do we have a
 
05:06:23.750 --> 05:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
work session
 
05:06:25.610 --> 05:06:25.620 align:start position:0%
a division work session without having
 
05:06:28.330 --> 05:06:28.340 align:start position:0%
it posted someplace and I can't remember
 
05:06:31.670 --> 05:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
the details of how we do that or what we
 
05:06:39.948 --> 05:06:39.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:43.190 --> 05:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
I I I'm looking for Mr Ripple's advice
 
05:06:44.868 --> 05:06:44.878 align:start position:0%
well I'll have to check on what the
 
05:06:46.670 --> 05:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
current rules are Wednesday would meet
 
05:06:49.250 --> 05:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
the 48-hour notice requirement I don't
 
05:06:51.650 --> 05:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
know if that's still in effect
 
05:06:55.550 --> 05:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:57.230 --> 05:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
whether there's a current requirement
 
05:06:58.850 --> 05:06:58.860 align:start position:0%
that everything be calendared I'm not
 
05:07:00.770 --> 05:07:00.780 align:start position:0%
sure about that I don't believe there is
 
05:07:03.288 --> 05:07:03.298 align:start position:0%
I think there was an expectation that
 
05:07:06.708 --> 05:07:06.718 align:start position:0%
there was going to be less certainty in
 
05:07:07.850 --> 05:07:07.860 align:start position:0%
this session
 
05:07:13.510 --> 05:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:16.850 --> 05:07:16.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:18.350 --> 05:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't think you you're already
 
05:07:20.448 --> 05:07:20.458 align:start position:0%
out of the work session on House Bill 49
 
05:07:22.190 --> 05:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
so I don't think you can recess this
 
05:07:27.708 --> 05:07:27.718 align:start position:0%
until okay all right well one I'll uh I
 
05:07:28.970 --> 05:07:28.980 align:start position:0%
think we can leave you alone you know
 
05:07:31.070 --> 05:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
what the intent is we want to we want to
 
05:07:32.810 --> 05:07:32.820 align:start position:0%
do it Wednesday we want to do it within
 
05:07:35.750 --> 05:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
the rules maybe in the other order we
 
05:07:37.970 --> 05:07:37.980 align:start position:0%
want to do it within the rules if we can
 
05:07:40.788 --> 05:07:40.798 align:start position:0%
do it Wednesday that would be great but
 
05:07:42.948 --> 05:07:42.958 align:start position:0%
I but I would like us to have reached a
 
05:07:45.890 --> 05:07:45.900 align:start position:0%
conclusion before we go to full Finance
 
05:07:47.990 --> 05:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
on the ninth
 
05:07:48.000 --> 05:07:49.430 align:start position:0%
on the ninth
so

05:07:49.430 --> 05:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:07:49.440 --> 05:07:52.190 align:start position:0%
so
thoughts

05:07:52.190 --> 05:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
thoughts
 
05:07:54.770 --> 05:07:54.780 align:start position:0%
I I just think we should
 
05:07:58.550 --> 05:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
figure out what the rule is and how we
 
05:08:00.890 --> 05:08:00.900 align:start position:0%
get that done and then
 
05:08:04.788 --> 05:08:04.798 align:start position:0%
schedule a time I I think we've agreed
 
05:08:07.070 --> 05:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
that we're going to first comply with
 
05:08:09.350 --> 05:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
the rules with the idea that we're going
 
05:08:11.570 --> 05:08:11.580 align:start position:0%
to schedule on Wednesday and then miss
 
05:08:13.788 --> 05:08:13.798 align:start position:0%
Ripple is going to let us know if that's
 
05:08:17.868 --> 05:08:17.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:23.090 --> 05:08:23.100 align:start position:0%
okay uh anything else uh I thought I had
 
05:08:25.250 --> 05:08:25.260 align:start position:0%
something I got an invite from somebody
 
05:08:28.390 --> 05:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
got an invite from Commerce
 
05:08:32.270 --> 05:08:32.280 align:start position:0%
on for Wednesday at 9 00 A.M
 
05:08:34.610 --> 05:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
they're bringing in somebody who's an
 
05:08:38.690 --> 05:08:38.700 align:start position:0%
expert on Pharmacy benefit managers and
 
05:08:42.830 --> 05:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
the reason why pbm's may be interesting
 
05:08:45.948 --> 05:08:45.958 align:start position:0%
to division three is because even though
 
05:08:49.730 --> 05:08:49.740 align:start position:0%
it's an insurance kind of issue the pbms
 
05:08:52.788 --> 05:08:52.798 align:start position:0%
end up to be really Central to the
 
05:08:58.070 --> 05:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
overall levers on drug costs and with as
 
05:09:01.150 --> 05:09:01.160 align:start position:0%
much emphasis as there are on drug costs
 
05:09:03.050 --> 05:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
understanding if you don't know anything
 
05:09:05.570 --> 05:09:05.580 align:start position:0%
about pvms this would be you know
 
05:09:08.690 --> 05:09:08.700 align:start position:0%
basically a tutorial set up for that
 
05:09:11.448 --> 05:09:11.458 align:start position:0%
very purpose so so we're invited on the
 
05:09:15.050 --> 05:09:15.060 align:start position:0%
ninth excuse me on Wednesday at 9 A.M to
 
05:09:15.060 --> 05:09:16.368 align:start position:0%
ninth excuse me on Wednesday at 9 A.M to
Commerce

05:09:16.368 --> 05:09:16.378 align:start position:0%
Commerce
 
05:09:20.270 --> 05:09:20.280 align:start position:0%
it's not required it's just an invite
 
05:09:22.310 --> 05:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
anything before
 
05:09:24.170 --> 05:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
from the members I I don't want to I
 
05:09:25.730 --> 05:09:25.740 align:start position:0%
don't want to close without Ripple in
 
05:09:27.530 --> 05:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
the room just in case uh he's coming
 
05:09:31.730 --> 05:09:31.740 align:start position:0%
back with like the last minute Intel
 
05:09:35.330 --> 05:09:35.340 align:start position:0%
hey thank you for coming and a good
 
05:09:37.190 --> 05:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
presentation a lot of depth a lot of
 
05:09:40.910 --> 05:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
detail I I'm sort of left you know
 
05:09:43.970 --> 05:09:43.980 align:start position:0%
believing though that when the
 
05:09:45.470 --> 05:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner comes out with her
 
05:09:47.930 --> 05:09:47.940 align:start position:0%
strategies I'm not going to be able to
 
05:09:50.628 --> 05:09:50.638 align:start position:0%
lay the I.T strategies next to it and
 
05:09:53.690 --> 05:09:53.700 align:start position:0%
see an alignment that there's still that
 
05:09:55.788 --> 05:09:55.798 align:start position:0%
they'll probably be a way to make an
 
05:09:58.250 --> 05:09:58.260 align:start position:0%
alignment but I was kind of hoping for
 
05:09:58.260 --> 05:09:59.270 align:start position:0%
alignment but I was kind of hoping for
something

05:09:59.270 --> 05:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
something
 
05:09:59.280 --> 05:10:02.030 align:start position:0%
something
simple

05:10:02.030 --> 05:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:06.590 --> 05:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:09.350 --> 05:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
yeah you will do our best to make to do
 
05:10:12.288 --> 05:10:12.298 align:start position:0%
that alignment for you and Nathan and I
 
05:10:13.788 --> 05:10:13.798 align:start position:0%
were just talking about some strategies
 
05:10:16.910 --> 05:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
about how to do that so that that'd be
 
05:10:19.128 --> 05:10:19.138 align:start position:0%
great I I don't it would be useful to me
 
05:10:20.750 --> 05:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
maybe useful to the committee maybe
 
05:10:23.750 --> 05:10:23.760 align:start position:0%
useful to the fiscal committee and I
 
05:10:25.490 --> 05:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
don't know internally I hopefully that
 
05:10:27.288 --> 05:10:27.298 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be wasted effort that it may
 
05:10:29.690 --> 05:10:29.700 align:start position:0%
get some use for your team
 
05:10:31.910 --> 05:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
I think it would be very good to have
 
05:10:34.128 --> 05:10:34.138 align:start position:0%
those those dotted line connections so
 
05:10:36.650 --> 05:10:36.660 align:start position:0%
that we can show here's the program area
 
05:10:38.150 --> 05:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
here's what we're doing for our
 
05:10:40.670 --> 05:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
initiatives and our our roadmap for our
 
05:10:44.150 --> 05:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
our next year and next biennium and how
 
05:10:45.590 --> 05:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
does that align to the technology
 
05:10:47.208 --> 05:10:47.218 align:start position:0%
initiatives that's really important
 
05:10:49.310 --> 05:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
component so thank you it certainly
 
05:10:51.948 --> 05:10:51.958 align:start position:0%
sounds good so Mr White before we leave
 
05:10:54.530 --> 05:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
you got anything for us
 
05:10:56.750 --> 05:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
I think I think when we were just
 
05:10:59.208 --> 05:10:59.218 align:start position:0%
chatting offline one of the things you
 
05:11:04.788 --> 05:11:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:04.798 --> 05:11:06.230 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:11:06.230 --> 05:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:11:09.230 --> 05:11:09.240 align:start position:0%
um so earlier we we were we were
 
05:11:11.690 --> 05:11:11.700 align:start position:0%
discussing what what the future schedule
 
05:11:13.128 --> 05:11:13.138 align:start position:0%
would look like once the governor's
 
05:11:14.810 --> 05:11:14.820 align:start position:0%
budget does come out
 
05:11:16.430 --> 05:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
um I'll be working with Kevin over the
 
05:11:18.770 --> 05:11:18.780 align:start position:0%
next couple of days just to figure out
 
05:11:21.470 --> 05:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
uh when Medicaid will come when dltss
 
05:11:23.030 --> 05:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
will come what are the days that we need
 
05:11:24.410 --> 05:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
to block out I think there's a holiday
 
05:11:25.970 --> 05:11:25.980 align:start position:0%
in there as well of the legislative
 
05:11:25.980 --> 05:11:27.170 align:start position:0%
in there as well of the legislative
Break

05:11:27.170 --> 05:11:27.180 align:start position:0%
Break
 
05:11:29.330 --> 05:11:29.340 align:start position:0%
um so we will we'll be working offline
 
05:11:30.948 --> 05:11:30.958 align:start position:0%
and we'll follow up soon just to make
 
05:11:32.448 --> 05:11:32.458 align:start position:0%
sure that those the times that we
 
05:11:34.430 --> 05:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
propose work with everybody's schedules
 
05:11:37.610 --> 05:11:37.620 align:start position:0%
in in one of the boundary conditions we
 
05:11:40.070 --> 05:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
were hoping to meet if possible not
 
05:11:43.310 --> 05:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
required but if possible that week where
 
05:11:45.948 --> 05:11:45.958 align:start position:0%
it's down for the house we're trying to
 
05:11:49.010 --> 05:11:49.020 align:start position:0%
leave Thursday and Friday open so that
 
05:11:50.690 --> 05:11:50.700 align:start position:0%
people can at least have a long weekend
 
05:11:52.190 --> 05:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
on that week
 
05:11:55.310 --> 05:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:58.250 --> 05:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
okay are you saying for our division
 
05:12:01.128 --> 05:12:01.138 align:start position:0%
only or for everyone if you read the
 
05:12:03.170 --> 05:12:03.180 align:start position:0%
house calendar there's a there's a
 
05:12:05.030 --> 05:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
little blurb in there that says that you
 
05:12:07.128 --> 05:12:07.138 align:start position:0%
know we're going to shut down for or no
 
05:12:10.670 --> 05:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
no house sessions on that week right so
 
05:12:12.230 --> 05:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
that's kind of code for if the
 
05:12:14.750 --> 05:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
Committees does don't have work you can
 
05:12:16.850 --> 05:12:16.860 align:start position:0%
take some time off I just assumed we
 
05:12:18.530 --> 05:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
would have worked no we're going to have
 
05:12:20.390 --> 05:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
a ton of work which is why I'm giving
 
05:12:22.788 --> 05:12:22.798 align:start position:0%
you an update we're trying to work it so
 
05:12:24.770 --> 05:12:24.780 align:start position:0%
that we can maybe keep Thursday and
 
05:12:27.470 --> 05:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
Friday of that week reserved so that at
 
05:12:29.448 --> 05:12:29.458 align:start position:0%
least you got a long weekend
 
05:12:32.270 --> 05:12:32.280 align:start position:0%
great that's that's that's the objective
 
05:12:34.610 --> 05:12:34.620 align:start position:0%
I don't know if we're going to succeed
 
05:12:37.310 --> 05:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
