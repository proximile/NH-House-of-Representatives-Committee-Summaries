there knowing that we are being streamed
 
00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:05.820 align:start position:0%
right now so uh in the future too we're
 
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
going to try to get for these smaller
 
00:10:09.949 --> 00:10:09.959 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meetings uh represent
 
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
Cornell did you get a copy of the agenda
 
00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:12.530 align:start position:0%
Cornell did you get a copy of the agenda

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
that's it yes uh we are going to try to
 
00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
have a small subcommer our committee our
 
00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:20.399 align:start position:0%

um sit around the tables in the center
 
00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
here so we'd be a little closer to the
 
00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:27.839 align:start position:0%
public and so that's it's more of like a
 
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
work group uh although we do make
 
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:32.220 align:start position:0%

everybody as far as what are the duties
 
00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:36.180 align:start position:0%
of the legislative oversight committee
 
00:12:38.569 --> 00:12:38.579 align:start position:0%
this is a committee that was reinstated
 
00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
in the last year it had been eliminated
 
00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
however this committee has some very
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
important tasks and reading through them
 
00:12:48.410 --> 00:12:48.420 align:start position:0%
I'll do it very quickly these are
 
00:12:50.329 --> 00:12:50.339 align:start position:0%
summarized these are not specifically
 
00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
how it's stated in statute the
 
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
legislative committee shall review the
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
development implementation of school
 
00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
performance and accountability program
 
00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
that's that's quite a task in itself
 
00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:02.700 align:start position:0%
submit an annual report that reports
 
00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
submitted to the the Senate to the house
 
00:13:07.009 --> 00:13:07.019 align:start position:0%
to the state librarian
 
00:13:07.019 --> 00:13:07.910 align:start position:0%
to the state librarian
um

00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
Etc uh C proposed legislation that is
 
00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:12.660 align:start position:0%
needed as a result of the review of the
 
00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
progress and results of the policies
 
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
implemented under this chapter
 
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
so we are responsible for submitting any
 
00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
new legislation that we see as necessary
 
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
or needed
 
00:13:26.449 --> 00:13:26.459 align:start position:0%
D confer with commissioner of the State
 
00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
Board the commissioner and the State
 
00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:30.180 align:start position:0%
Board of Education to identify and
 
00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:31.980 align:start position:0%
support improved school performance and
 
00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
accountability so we work closely with
 
00:13:37.069 --> 00:13:37.079 align:start position:0%
the department and with the State Board
 
00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:39.540 align:start position:0%
he analyzed existing department of
 
00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:42.120 align:start position:0%
education programs and initiatives which
 
00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
support improved school performance and
 
00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
accountability that's right down our
 
00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
bailiwick right now that we have to be
 
00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:49.740 align:start position:0%
addressing how we're looking at
 
00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:52.860 align:start position:0%
improving where we are in our academic
 
00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
programs and accountability for those
 
00:13:55.079 --> 00:13:57.190 align:start position:0%
programs and accountability for those
programs

00:13:57.190 --> 00:13:57.200 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
received reports from the commissioner
 
00:14:01.129 --> 00:14:01.139 align:start position:0%
regarding the status of public education
 
00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:03.540 align:start position:0%
updates on the Improvement made by local
 
00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:05.220 align:start position:0%
school districts towards achieving
 
00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:07.620 align:start position:0%
satisfactory progress and student
 
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
performance so we receive these reports
 
00:14:12.889 --> 00:14:12.899 align:start position:0%
back from the Department G review and
 
00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:14.820 align:start position:0%
approve Statewide performance targets
 
00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
developed by the Department of Education
 
00:14:18.170 --> 00:14:18.180 align:start position:0%
and recommend to the legislative
 
00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:21.060 align:start position:0%
oversight committee by the State Board
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
of Education so any kind of changes in
 
00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:26.220 align:start position:0%
targets have to be recommended to this
 
00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:28.500 align:start position:0%
committee and receive this committee's
 
00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:29.569 align:start position:0%
committee and receive this committee's
approval

00:14:29.569 --> 00:14:29.579 align:start position:0%
approval
 
00:14:31.970 --> 00:14:31.980 align:start position:0%
H we see reports from the State Board of
 
00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
Education including rules recommended by
 
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
the department relative to Statewide
 
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
performance targets required under RSA
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
193 H2 and proposed legislation to be
 
00:14:44.449 --> 00:14:44.459 align:start position:0%
submitted to establish such a Statewide
 
00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:46.860 align:start position:0%
performance targets and state statute
 
00:14:50.569 --> 00:14:50.579 align:start position:0%
during the legislative season session
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
review the unique pupil identification
 
00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:55.380 align:start position:0%
system and propose areas within so
 
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:56.820 align:start position:0%
that's another area of dealing with
 
00:14:59.449 --> 00:14:59.459 align:start position:0%
confidentiality of student records and a
 
00:15:01.009 --> 00:15:01.019 align:start position:0%
Personnel working here
 
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
uh review the implementation and results
 
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
of the program relative to
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
accountability for the opportunity for
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
an adequate education established in 193
 
00:15:10.569 --> 00:15:10.579 align:start position:0%
e so now we're involving ourselves in
 
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
1983e which is the adequacy section of
 
00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
education and consult and receive
 
00:15:19.009 --> 00:15:19.019 align:start position:0%
reports on such program evaluate and
 
00:15:20.509 --> 00:15:20.519 align:start position:0%
review existing and emergent
 
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:22.800 align:start position:0%
performance-based measurement tools and
 
00:15:24.829 --> 00:15:24.839 align:start position:0%
propose legislation for improvements to
 
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:28.440 align:start position:0%
the accountability program as necessary
 
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
K received security breach reports from
 
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:33.720 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education pursuant to
 
00:15:38.329 --> 00:15:38.339 align:start position:0%
RSA 199 colon 66. consult with the
 
00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:39.660 align:start position:0%
commissioner and proposed legislation
 
00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:42.060 align:start position:0%
needed as a result of the review so
 
00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:43.380 align:start position:0%
that's one area we've really not have
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
been involved with I hope we aren't I
 
00:15:47.569 --> 00:15:47.579 align:start position:0%
hope we have no security breaches but in
 
00:15:49.189 --> 00:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
that case this committee becomes
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
involved review and make recommendations
 
00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
relating to academic standards and under
 
00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:55.620 align:start position:0%
consideration by the State Board of
 
00:15:59.150 --> 00:15:59.160 align:start position:0%
Education pursuant to 193e to a
 
00:16:02.449 --> 00:16:02.459 align:start position:0%
column for parentheses C so there's a
 
00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:04.620 align:start position:0%
huge task in itself that we review and
 
00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
approve these academic standards so
 
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
today what I've asked under number two
 
00:16:11.629 --> 00:16:11.639 align:start position:0%
here I've met just recently several
 
00:16:15.949 --> 00:16:15.959 align:start position:0%
times with Dr Nate green Nate is working
 
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
over at the Department of Education he
 
00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
works downstairs in dealing with all
 
00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
this data and information and is a data
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
analysis and we hopefully we can give
 
00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
them support this year with supporting
 
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
Aid and support through some of our
 
00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
legislation but I asked him to come
 
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
today and explain to where we are and
 
00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:41.220 align:start position:0%
try to Define and speak to academic
 
00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:43.620 align:start position:0%
standards and the minimum standards for
 
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:45.720 align:start position:0%
public school approval there has been
 
00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:48.180 align:start position:0%
some cons not some you know in the
 
00:16:50.749 --> 00:16:50.759 align:start position:0%
papers you you hear of it concerns
 
00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:53.100 align:start position:0%
regarding the the process which is going
 
00:16:54.829 --> 00:16:54.839 align:start position:0%
on right now for the minimum standards
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
for public school approval at this time
 
00:16:59.689 --> 00:16:59.699 align:start position:0%
Nate's going to just give us an update
 
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:01.740 align:start position:0%
where we are and try to help us Define
 
00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:03.720 align:start position:0%
the difference between these academic
 
00:17:05.809 --> 00:17:05.819 align:start position:0%
standards and the minimum Public School
 
00:17:07.789 --> 00:17:07.799 align:start position:0%
standards public standards for public
 
00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
school approval Mr chair yes could I um
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
could I make a couple of comments before
 
00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
we start in with um Dr Greene
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh if it's no no just relevant to what
 
00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
you were just talking about absolutely
 
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:22.260 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely so so thanks very much
 
00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:24.900 align:start position:0%
Rick and and uh thanks everybody for for
 
00:17:27.530 --> 00:17:27.540 align:start position:0%
joining us here this morning for our our
 
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
introductory meeting I'm glad uh the
 
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
chair read through the the duties which
 
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
are enumerated in the the statute that
 
00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:38.340 align:start position:0%
establishes this committee but uh but I
 
00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
think it's also worth
 
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
um just reminding the members of the
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
committee and members of the public
 
00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:46.740 align:start position:0%
um uh some of the some of the language
 
00:17:48.950 --> 00:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
from the Preamble which was the
 
00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:51.539 align:start position:0%
rationale behind behind establishing
 
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
this committee and specifically and I'm
 
00:17:58.250 --> 00:17:58.260 align:start position:0%
just reading from Parts B and C in the
 
00:18:01.029 --> 00:18:01.039 align:start position:0%
uh in the Preamble of the of the statute
 
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
193 c8a and uh and it's it's very
 
00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:07.140 align:start position:0%
interesting and I think it speaks a lot
 
00:18:10.669 --> 00:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
to um to public schools in uh in New
 
00:18:12.890 --> 00:18:12.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and and how we we go about
 
00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:15.660 align:start position:0%
doing things but but it reads like this
 
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
respecting New Hampshire's long
 
00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
tradition of community involvement
 
00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate means are established to
 
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
provide an adequate educate an adequate
 
00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:25.740 align:start position:0%
education through an integrated system
 
00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
of shared responsibility between state
 
00:18:30.289 --> 00:18:30.299 align:start position:0%
and local government in this system the
 
00:18:32.270 --> 00:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
state establishes minimum standards for
 
00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:34.380 align:start position:0%
public school approval and academic
 
00:18:36.169 --> 00:18:36.179 align:start position:0%
standards for delivery of educational
 
00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:38.580 align:start position:0%
services at the local level school
 
00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
districts then have the responsibility
 
00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
and flexibility in implementing diverse
 
00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:44.700 align:start position:0%
educational approaches to instruction
 
00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
and curriculum tailored to meet student
 
00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
needs the next part concludes
 
00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
and very importantly it says New
 
00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:56.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's long history of authorizing
 
00:18:58.669 --> 00:18:58.679 align:start position:0%
local governments in the form of local
 
00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:01.200 align:start position:0%
districts to develop and administer
 
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
public schools pursuant to a set of
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
minimum standards established by the
 
00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:08.220 align:start position:0%
state has successfully achieved on
 
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
average across the state and that's an
 
00:19:12.049 --> 00:19:12.059 align:start position:0%
important thing on average across the
 
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
state high quality educational outcomes
 
00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much now if you
 
00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:21.660 align:start position:0%
open up your yellow statuary books which
 
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
we have the first statute there is
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
dealing with the shared responsibility
 
00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:29.700 align:start position:0%
for education and list all those that
 
00:19:32.029 --> 00:19:32.039 align:start position:0%
are sharing that responsibility so going
 
00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799 align:start position:0%
in here I welcome Nate could you please
 
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
help us out with the academic standards
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
and and with the minimum standards for
 
00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
public school school approval absolutely
 
00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
yeah so for the record my name is Dr
 
00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:44.340 align:start position:0%
Nate green I'm with the New Hampshire
 
00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Education I currently am
 
00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
the bureau administrator for the Bureau
 
00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
of educational opportunities which
 
00:19:51.789 --> 00:19:51.799 align:start position:0%
includes a variety of different offices
 
00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:53.940 align:start position:0%
one of those offices the Office of
 
00:19:56.029 --> 00:19:56.039 align:start position:0%
Public Schools another one is assessment
 
00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
and accountability and much of the work
 
00:19:59.590 --> 00:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
that I'll talk about today
 
00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:02.100 align:start position:0%
is involving both of those offices sort
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
of simultaneously there's a lot of
 
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
overlap and I think because of that
 
00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
overlap there's Sometimes some
 
00:20:09.409 --> 00:20:09.419 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies and there's some
 
00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:11.940 align:start position:0%
conflation of what academic standards
 
00:20:13.789 --> 00:20:13.799 align:start position:0%
are and what the minimum standards are
 
00:20:15.409 --> 00:20:15.419 align:start position:0%
and part of the problem is they both use
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
the word standards and oftentimes in
 
00:20:19.789 --> 00:20:19.799 align:start position:0%
education we just talk about standards
 
00:20:21.890 --> 00:20:21.900 align:start position:0%
and so part of what I want to do right
 
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
off the bat is just make sure that
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
there's a clear distinction between what
 
00:20:27.049 --> 00:20:27.059 align:start position:0%
we're talking about when we say academic
 
00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
standards and what we're talking about
 
00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:29.820 align:start position:0%
when we say the minimum standards for
 
00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:31.260 align:start position:0%
public school approval
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
so the minimum standards for public
 
00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
school approval are state regulations
 
00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:38.220 align:start position:0%
they're found in ed306 and that full set
 
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
of Standards Define the minimum
 
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
requirements for a public school to be
 
00:20:43.549 --> 00:20:43.559 align:start position:0%
approved in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:45.660 align:start position:0%
and it includes a variety of different
 
00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
things things like nursing Services food
 
00:20:51.289 --> 00:20:51.299 align:start position:0%
services janitorial services the
 
00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of principals teachers
 
00:20:55.490 --> 00:20:55.500 align:start position:0%
as well as the responsibilities on
 
00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
districts when offering academic
 
00:20:59.630 --> 00:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
programs and that's a key distinction
 
00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
that I want to point out is the minimum
 
00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:03.780 align:start position:0%
standards are relative to programs at
 
00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:05.340 align:start position:0%
the various School levels elementary
 
00:21:07.669 --> 00:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
middle and high school so they Define
 
00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
what a mathematics program is required
 
00:21:12.529 --> 00:21:12.539 align:start position:0%
to do at a middle school level for
 
00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:14.700 align:start position:0%
example at a high school level
 
00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:16.620 align:start position:0%
separate from the minimum standards we
 
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
have our academic standards in New
 
00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:19.980 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we call those the College and
 
00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
Career ready Frameworks they can be
 
00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:23.580 align:start position:0%
found on the department of education's
 
00:21:25.789 --> 00:21:25.799 align:start position:0%
website and they are much much more
 
00:21:28.130 --> 00:21:28.140 align:start position:0%
extensive documents they are what we
 
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
would you know refer to as true academic
 
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
standards so for example in science New
 
00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:34.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire adopted the Next Generation
 
00:21:36.649 --> 00:21:36.659 align:start position:0%
science standards those are the academic
 
00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
standards that Define what a student
 
00:21:41.149 --> 00:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
should know and be able to do at every
 
00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
grade level K through 12 in science so
 
00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:46.500 align:start position:0%
if you're looking at a third grader in
 
00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
science the Next Generation science
 
00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:49.980 align:start position:0%
centers are going to lay out a whole set
 
00:21:52.010 --> 00:21:52.020 align:start position:0%
of standards for what that third grader
 
00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
should be able to do by the end of that
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
grade similarly in high school if we're
 
00:21:57.169 --> 00:21:57.179 align:start position:0%
looking at something like chemistry
 
00:21:58.610 --> 00:21:58.620 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a whole set of
 
00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:01.140 align:start position:0%
standards in the ngss that lays out what
 
00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:02.700 align:start position:0%
a chemistry student should be able to do
 
00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:05.340 align:start position:0%
at the end of a chemistry course and so
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
that's those are the the differences
 
00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:08.460 align:start position:0%
between what the minimum standards are
 
00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:10.620 align:start position:0%
which are relative to programs so for
 
00:22:12.649 --> 00:22:12.659 align:start position:0%
example in science it might say that in
 
00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:13.860 align:start position:0%
the science classroom you need to have a
 
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
certain amount of Laboratory space for
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
student safety the districts need to
 
00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:19.940 align:start position:0%
offer certain number of science courses
 
00:22:22.250 --> 00:22:22.260 align:start position:0%
but actually identifying what a student
 
00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:23.820 align:start position:0%
should know and be able to do at a
 
00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:26.039 align:start position:0%
really granular level is outside of the
 
00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:27.240 align:start position:0%
minimum standards and those are the
 
00:22:28.669 --> 00:22:28.679 align:start position:0%
academic standards that the state board
 
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
has adopted
 
00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
and where those come into play separate
 
00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
from school approval is that's what we
 
00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
use to build our state assessment
 
00:22:37.789 --> 00:22:37.799 align:start position:0%
framework so right now we assess
 
00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:40.980 align:start position:0%
students in Three core areas reading an
 
00:22:43.970 --> 00:22:43.980 align:start position:0%
Ela Math and Science and our state
 
00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:46.260 align:start position:0%
assessments and those Frameworks for the
 
00:22:47.930 --> 00:22:47.940 align:start position:0%
state assessments are built on the
 
00:22:49.549 --> 00:22:49.559 align:start position:0%
academic standards that we've adopted
 
00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:53.220 align:start position:0%
not the minimum standards and I think
 
00:22:54.409 --> 00:22:54.419 align:start position:0%
there's Sometimes some conflation
 
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
between those two things but those
 
00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
larger academic standards documents are
 
00:23:02.330 --> 00:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
the the definitions of what students
 
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
should know that's what we build our
 
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
definition of proficiency on and that's
 
00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:06.900 align:start position:0%
what we test our students on through the
 
00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:08.940 align:start position:0%
state assessment system so I'm going to
 
00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:10.140 align:start position:0%
stop there for a minute to see if there
 
00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:11.460 align:start position:0%
are any questions
 
00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
are there questions from the committee
 
00:23:18.649 --> 00:23:18.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
so I will ask one then
 
00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.289 align:start position:0%
so I will ask one then
um

00:23:21.289 --> 00:23:21.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
if I ever open up 306 and look at the
 
00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:27.780 align:start position:0%
area of art which is that you know it's
 
00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:29.940 align:start position:0%
a curricular area substantive criteria
 
00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:31.740 align:start position:0%
of an adequate education mentions art
 
00:23:33.529 --> 00:23:33.539 align:start position:0%
and then it talks about the elementary
 
00:23:36.669 --> 00:23:36.679 align:start position:0%
middle and high school
 
00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
programs in terms of how art is uh
 
00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:43.740 align:start position:0%
defined or are used it does mention
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
academic standards there in on now so
 
00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:49.250 align:start position:0%
academic standards there in on now so
the

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:52.260 align:start position:0%
the the minimum standards for public
 
00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
you've mentioned a whole lot of elements
 
00:23:59.930 --> 00:23:59.940 align:start position:0%
or components which are above and beyond
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
the ACT you know like like the the
 
00:24:04.909 --> 00:24:04.919 align:start position:0%
facility itself like the the libraries
 
00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
and all that but we we are talking about
 
00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:13.260 align:start position:0%
subject areas and when we start dealing
 
00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
with the this minimum uh standards for
 
00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:19.620 align:start position:0%
public uh School approval we are also
 
00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:22.860 align:start position:0%
then aren't we also discussing academic
 
00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:23.930 align:start position:0%
then aren't we also discussing academic
standards

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:23.940 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:24:25.730 --> 00:24:25.740 align:start position:0%
so there are parts of the minimum
 
00:24:27.049 --> 00:24:27.059 align:start position:0%
standards when you read them that they
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
read like an academic standard and some
 
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
of them read a little bit like
 
00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
competencies which you know teachers are
 
00:24:36.049 --> 00:24:36.059 align:start position:0%
building competencies into their
 
00:24:37.549 --> 00:24:37.559 align:start position:0%
instruction when they build a curriculum
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
for a particular course or grade level
 
00:24:42.409 --> 00:24:42.419 align:start position:0%
the difference is the granularity I
 
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
think so if you take part as an example
 
00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:46.740 align:start position:0%
the minimum standards uh it requires
 
00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
districts to offer art programs K-12 and
 
00:24:51.409 --> 00:24:51.419 align:start position:0%
it talks about some of the things that
 
00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:52.740 align:start position:0%
they have to offer if they have to offer
 
00:24:54.529 --> 00:24:54.539 align:start position:0%
opportunities for students to become
 
00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
involved in artistic expression in dance
 
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
in theater in music
 
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
what the minimum standards don't do is
 
00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
they don't say at a third grade level
 
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
students should be able to know and do X
 
00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:11.220 align:start position:0%
Y and Z and art so it's that level of
 
00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:13.020 align:start position:0%
granularity that exists in the academic
 
00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
standards so we have National Art
 
00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:16.380 align:start position:0%
standards that many of our districts in
 
00:25:18.289 --> 00:25:18.299 align:start position:0%
the state use we have art standards that
 
00:25:19.909 --> 00:25:19.919 align:start position:0%
we post on the Department of Education
 
00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:21.900 align:start position:0%
website and those go really really
 
00:25:24.409 --> 00:25:24.419 align:start position:0%
specifically into what should second
 
00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
grade art look like what should third
 
00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
grade art what should fourth grade what
 
00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:29.940 align:start position:0%
are the types of skills that students
 
00:25:32.269 --> 00:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
need to be able to know and do that
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
level of detail is not in the minimum
 
00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
standards the minimum standard is going
 
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
to say you need to offer opportunities
 
00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:37.860 align:start position:0%
and dance you need to offer
 
00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
opportunities in theater you need to
 
00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
offer opportunities in drawing or
 
00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:44.700 align:start position:0%
painting things like that but what how
 
00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:46.140 align:start position:0%
you actually build a curriculum you need
 
00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:47.940 align:start position:0%
a lot more specificity and granularity
 
00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:49.500 align:start position:0%
to build a curriculum to build out
 
00:25:51.289 --> 00:25:51.299 align:start position:0%
lessons to have a progression throughout
 
00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:52.980 align:start position:0%
the school year and much of that comes
 
00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:54.120 align:start position:0%
from the framework that's in the
 
00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:56.100 align:start position:0%
academic standards and not the minimum
 
00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:57.590 align:start position:0%
academic standards and not the minimum
standards

00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
thank you yes representative Luna thank
 
00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:02.460 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chair um and it's sort
 
00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
of a follow-up to um to your question
 
00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
Rick and and thank you Dr Greene for um
 
00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:10.380 align:start position:0%
you know discussing the the differences
 
00:26:12.169 --> 00:26:12.179 align:start position:0%
between minimum standards and academic
 
00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
standards I appreciate
 
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
um the now having a better understanding
 
00:26:20.029 --> 00:26:20.039 align:start position:0%
of uh of where those differences are but
 
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
um could you talk I mean when you talked
 
00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
about minimum standards you talk about
 
00:26:26.269 --> 00:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
you talked about programs you talked
 
00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:28.200 align:start position:0%
about services like custodial services
 
00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:31.980 align:start position:0%
and and um and what the opportunities
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
the programmatic opportunities uh a
 
00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
school uh would needs to offer it's uh
 
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
its students but I was wondering if you
 
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
could sort of reflect on where the
 
00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:46.140 align:start position:0%
minimum standards um talk about the um
 
00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
um you know what what I guess is
 
00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
expected or what are the outcomes that
 
00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:54.900 align:start position:0%
are expected from from a student's
 
00:26:58.730 --> 00:26:58.740 align:start position:0%
um uh perspective and um and now that
 
00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:01.740 align:start position:0%
particularly as as students you know go
 
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
into you know from elementary to a
 
00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
middle school to a um to a um uh you
 
00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
know Secondary School to to uh
 
00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.310 align:start position:0%
know Secondary School to to uh
graduation

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
graduation
 
00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
um how do the minimum standards reflect
 
00:27:18.289 --> 00:27:18.299 align:start position:0%
on on on things from a from a student's
 
00:27:18.299 --> 00:27:21.230 align:start position:0%
on on on things from a from a student's
perspective

00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.370 align:start position:0%
perspective
so

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:22.380 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:24.169 --> 00:27:24.179 align:start position:0%
it's interesting because there are
 
00:27:26.149 --> 00:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
places where you can pull out I would
 
00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
say you could read into the standards to
 
00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:28.740 align:start position:0%
say you know these are going to be the
 
00:27:30.409 --> 00:27:30.419 align:start position:0%
expectations we have on students and
 
00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:31.740 align:start position:0%
what the student outcomes should be and
 
00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
what we want and I think ultimately in
 
00:27:35.390 --> 00:27:35.400 align:start position:0%
education that's our goal right we have
 
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:37.140 align:start position:0%
student outcomes as our final goal we
 
00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
want all students to be proficient
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
across the subjects that they're taking
 
00:27:42.049 --> 00:27:42.059 align:start position:0%
we want them to be ready for colleges
 
00:27:43.789 --> 00:27:43.799 align:start position:0%
and careers when they leave our K-12
 
00:27:45.769 --> 00:27:45.779 align:start position:0%
system but the minimum standards
 
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
themselves are a set of regulations that
 
00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:51.480 align:start position:0%
were written primarily with a audience
 
00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
of school boards and superintendents and
 
00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
so when you read much of them it says
 
00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
things like the school board shell the
 
00:27:59.029 --> 00:27:59.039 align:start position:0%
school board shall provide or the school
 
00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:01.740 align:start position:0%
board shall ensure and so they're more
 
00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
programmatic in nature even though the
 
00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:05.400 align:start position:0%
programs we're putting into place
 
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
through the minimum standards we have
 
00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:08.580 align:start position:0%
certain expectations of what those
 
00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:11.100 align:start position:0%
student outcomes are going to be they're
 
00:28:12.649 --> 00:28:12.659 align:start position:0%
really written from the perspective of
 
00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
this is what we're expecting the local
 
00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:16.260 align:start position:0%
school board to provide to their
 
00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
Community or to their students or this
 
00:28:19.789 --> 00:28:19.799 align:start position:0%
is what we expect a teacher to provide
 
00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:22.020 align:start position:0%
through the course of implementing a
 
00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:23.340 align:start position:0%
math problem program through the course
 
00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:25.620 align:start position:0%
of implementing a science program so I
 
00:28:27.049 --> 00:28:27.059 align:start position:0%
would say student outcomes are probably
 
00:28:28.909 --> 00:28:28.919 align:start position:0%
more reflected in statute when you look
 
00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:31.740 align:start position:0%
at things like rsa183h which is the
 
00:28:33.529 --> 00:28:33.539 align:start position:0%
accountability system and that's where
 
00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:34.799 align:start position:0%
we talk about things like performance
 
00:28:36.649 --> 00:28:36.659 align:start position:0%
targets that's where we set uh
 
00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
short-term and long-term goals for
 
00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
student achievement on things like math
 
00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
and reading and Ela sort of separate
 
00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
from the minimum standards but the
 
00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
minimum standards really set out what is
 
00:28:48.049 --> 00:28:48.059 align:start position:0%
what's the minimum academic and
 
00:28:49.549 --> 00:28:49.559 align:start position:0%
educational program that we want to
 
00:28:51.529 --> 00:28:51.539 align:start position:0%
offer our students that really reflects
 
00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:53.039 align:start position:0%
a high quality education in New
 
00:28:53.039 --> 00:28:54.110 align:start position:0%
a high quality education in New
Hampshire

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
thank you so I'll follow up to that
 
00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
um if I'm looking at 193h
 
00:29:03.529 --> 00:29:03.539 align:start position:0%
and I see the
 
00:29:06.169 --> 00:29:06.179 align:start position:0%
uh title of some various thing called
 
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
performance standards for level one
 
00:29:12.169 --> 00:29:12.179 align:start position:0%
level two level three level four
 
00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
um so that performance standard let's
 
00:29:18.830 --> 00:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
say a one or any of them is reflective
 
00:29:21.529 --> 00:29:21.539 align:start position:0%
of where on the Spectrum
 
00:29:24.529 --> 00:29:24.539 align:start position:0%
for the academic standards in that
 
00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
subject area or that substance area of
 
00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
criteria area
 
00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
yeah you see the the to me I'm I see
 
00:29:36.769 --> 00:29:36.779 align:start position:0%
them overlapping somewhat here and I I
 
00:29:38.269 --> 00:29:38.279 align:start position:0%
don't know if I'm seeing it correctly or
 
00:29:40.490 --> 00:29:40.500 align:start position:0%
not there's so there's a little bit of
 
00:29:43.789 --> 00:29:43.799 align:start position:0%
an overlap and I and almost in the way
 
00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:46.860 align:start position:0%
of a hierarchical system so the minimum
 
00:29:48.889 --> 00:29:48.899 align:start position:0%
standards as a document of study
 
00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:50.700 align:start position:0%
regulations tele District you have to
 
00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:52.740 align:start position:0%
offer math and you have to offer math
 
00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:55.559 align:start position:0%
K-12 every year you know the high school
 
00:29:57.169 --> 00:29:57.179 align:start position:0%
level students need to take four years
 
00:29:59.029 --> 00:29:59.039 align:start position:0%
of math here's a number of courses in
 
00:30:00.409 --> 00:30:00.419 align:start position:0%
math that they're required to have by
 
00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:02.100 align:start position:0%
the time they graduate they need to
 
00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:04.140 align:start position:0%
reflect things like algebra and geometry
 
00:30:06.649 --> 00:30:06.659 align:start position:0%
and then when teachers sit down or
 
00:30:08.269 --> 00:30:08.279 align:start position:0%
principal sit down a curriculum director
 
00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
sit down and they start to build those
 
00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
programs they're generally not going to
 
00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
the minimum standards because the
 
00:30:14.269 --> 00:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
minimum standards say this is what you
 
00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
have to do but now as you build that out
 
00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
we have the academic standards over here
 
00:30:21.049 --> 00:30:21.059 align:start position:0%
that say you know in Geometry here are
 
00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
the you know 25 or 30 Concepts that
 
00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
students really should be able to
 
00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:26.460 align:start position:0%
understand whether you know we're
 
00:30:30.529 --> 00:30:30.539 align:start position:0%
looking at shapes or proofs or angles
 
00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:32.220 align:start position:0%
you know if you if you want to know
 
00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:34.260 align:start position:0%
about sine cosine and tangent within
 
00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
geometry those words are not going to
 
00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
ever appear in the minimum standards
 
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
yeah but we know that that is a crucial
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
part of learning geometry and
 
00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:43.620 align:start position:0%
understanding angles and shapes and for
 
00:30:45.289 --> 00:30:45.299 align:start position:0%
the record I'm not a geometry teacher so
 
00:30:47.389 --> 00:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
if I try not to delve too far deeply
 
00:30:48.769 --> 00:30:48.779 align:start position:0%
into that particular thing I was a
 
00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:50.100 align:start position:0%
chemistry teacher so maybe I should use
 
00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:52.380 align:start position:0%
those as examples
 
00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:53.330 align:start position:0%
those as examples
um

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:53.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
those academic standards are also what
 
00:30:56.930 --> 00:30:56.940 align:start position:0%
we build the state assessment on so we
 
00:30:59.409 --> 00:30:59.419 align:start position:0%
talk about proficiency when we first
 
00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:01.919 align:start position:0%
built the current state assessment that
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
we're using now back in like 1617 we
 
00:31:06.409 --> 00:31:06.419 align:start position:0%
brought in groups of teachers at the
 
00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
different grade levels and we had the
 
00:31:10.669 --> 00:31:10.679 align:start position:0%
teachers go through the standards so not
 
00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
the minimum standards but the academic
 
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
standards that College and Career ready
 
00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
Frameworks and they actually took the
 
00:31:18.049 --> 00:31:18.059 align:start position:0%
assessment they went through each of the
 
00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
questions and then they sat down with
 
00:31:23.149 --> 00:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
psychometricians they sat down with
 
00:31:24.889 --> 00:31:24.899 align:start position:0%
researchers that were part of the
 
00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
assessment company that the state uses
 
00:31:30.049 --> 00:31:30.059 align:start position:0%
and we determined what level performance
 
00:31:32.029 --> 00:31:32.039 align:start position:0%
did students need to have on each of the
 
00:31:33.889 --> 00:31:33.899 align:start position:0%
various questions and how many questions
 
00:31:36.169 --> 00:31:36.179 align:start position:0%
and how what kinds of answers do they
 
00:31:37.909 --> 00:31:37.919 align:start position:0%
have to provide in order for the
 
00:31:39.950 --> 00:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
students performance to be reflective of
 
00:31:42.649 --> 00:31:42.659 align:start position:0%
those academic standards and that's how
 
00:31:45.289 --> 00:31:45.299 align:start position:0%
we set the level one two three and four
 
00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
it was a pretty lengthy process that
 
00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:49.380 align:start position:0%
involved teachers at all those different
 
00:31:51.409 --> 00:31:51.419 align:start position:0%
grade levels throughout the state so
 
00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:52.860 align:start position:0%
it's not something that's set for us by
 
00:31:54.169 --> 00:31:54.179 align:start position:0%
the assessment company it's actually
 
00:31:56.049 --> 00:31:56.059 align:start position:0%
something that we build through
 
00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
collaboration with teachers in the field
 
00:31:59.210 --> 00:31:59.220 align:start position:0%
that are teaching at each of those
 
00:32:01.549 --> 00:32:01.559 align:start position:0%
different grade levels but the minimum
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
standards were not part of that piece of
 
00:32:06.529 --> 00:32:06.539 align:start position:0%
it so proficiency and performance on the
 
00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:08.340 align:start position:0%
assessments comes from those academic
 
00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:10.380 align:start position:0%
standards and mapping back to those
 
00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
standards not necessarily to the minimum
 
00:32:13.789 --> 00:32:13.799 align:start position:0%
standards though the minimum standards
 
00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
do require that we have to teach math in
 
00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
our schools
 
00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:20.820 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli
 
00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:23.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Dr Green
 
00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:24.590 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Dr Green
um

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
in addition
 
00:32:28.909 --> 00:32:28.919 align:start position:0%
um to the level one through four
 
00:32:33.049 --> 00:32:33.059 align:start position:0%
proficiency there are also State targets
 
00:32:35.810 --> 00:32:35.820 align:start position:0%
for proficiency and am I correct and
 
00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
those are defined as part of the Esser
 
00:32:42.409 --> 00:32:42.419 align:start position:0%
state plan that is developed by the
 
00:32:45.529 --> 00:32:45.539 align:start position:0%
department and stakeholders
 
00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:47.640 align:start position:0%
yes yeah so one of the things that we're
 
00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:49.500 align:start position:0%
required to do as part of the SSA state
 
00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:52.740 align:start position:0%
plan we have to set annual Benchmark and
 
00:32:56.330 --> 00:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
targets Statewide and we did that
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
through a
 
00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
I'd say it's probably a little bit of a
 
00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:01.740 align:start position:0%
logistical regression process where we
 
00:33:03.649 --> 00:33:03.659 align:start position:0%
looked at when we wrote the state plan
 
00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
back in you know 16 17 18 looking at the
 
00:33:07.789 --> 00:33:07.799 align:start position:0%
past three or four years of student
 
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
performance and trying to project out
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
what were the types of gains that we
 
00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:13.620 align:start position:0%
felt like were realistic to continue to
 
00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:16.500 align:start position:0%
push student performance up uh now I
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
will say that was pre-pandemic so the
 
00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:21.240 align:start position:0%
state targets that we had for several of
 
00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:23.700 align:start position:0%
those years we ended up securing a
 
00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
waiver through the U.S Department of
 
00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:27.720 align:start position:0%
Education for so for the school year is
 
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
19 and 20 we had State targets that we
 
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
were you know going to meet we've
 
00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:34.980 align:start position:0%
actually pushed all those targets out
 
00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
now for two years and we looked at the
 
00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:40.860 align:start position:0%
19 school year and the 20 school year as
 
00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
just sort of being steady in terms of
 
00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:44.100 align:start position:0%
student performance particularly because
 
00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:46.260 align:start position:0%
we didn't run the state assessment in
 
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
the 1920 school year
 
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
representative Luna
 
00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:53.100 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair thanks very
 
00:33:54.649 --> 00:33:54.659 align:start position:0%
much Dr Green
 
00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:57.000 align:start position:0%
um going back to the um to the academic
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
standards I was wondering if you could
 
00:34:01.549 --> 00:34:01.559 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about how um how the
 
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
um uh the standards has as written are I
 
00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:07.380 align:start position:0%
guess informed by um by other state
 
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
statutes like um like our recently
 
00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
passed Holocaust studies and um and um
 
00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:17.220 align:start position:0%
uh concepts of legislation
 
00:34:19.129 --> 00:34:19.139 align:start position:0%
sure so we have a variety of different
 
00:34:21.169 --> 00:34:21.179 align:start position:0%
academic standards that are all posted
 
00:34:23.149 --> 00:34:23.159 align:start position:0%
on the website under the the title of
 
00:34:24.589 --> 00:34:24.599 align:start position:0%
College and Career ready Frameworks so
 
00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
there are standards there are business
 
00:34:28.129 --> 00:34:28.139 align:start position:0%
education standards I believe they're
 
00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:30.540 align:start position:0%
family consumer science standards uh but
 
00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
the three that have gone through sort of
 
00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:33.780 align:start position:0%
the really rigorous
 
00:34:35.089 --> 00:34:35.099 align:start position:0%
um you know public Outreach and common
 
00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:36.540 align:start position:0%
period and been adopted by the state
 
00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
board are the math uh Elaine reading and
 
00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:41.220 align:start position:0%
science standards because those are the
 
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%
ones that were required to have as
 
00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:47.820 align:start position:0%
Statewide uh academic standards for the
 
00:34:50.329 --> 00:34:50.339 align:start position:0%
purposes of the state assessments so
 
00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
things like the Holocaust and genocide
 
00:34:53.810 --> 00:34:53.820 align:start position:0%
uh standards live within the minimum
 
00:34:55.490 --> 00:34:55.500 align:start position:0%
standards we don't necessarily have
 
00:34:57.890 --> 00:34:57.900 align:start position:0%
statewide academic standards that relate
 
00:34:59.089 --> 00:34:59.099 align:start position:0%
to that one I think because it's
 
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
relatively new uh and two because we
 
00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:04.740 align:start position:0%
don't have a state assessment and one of
 
00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
the things we have in New Hampshire as
 
00:35:08.030 --> 00:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
well is the state is required to adopt
 
00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
these academic standards for the
 
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
purposes of having a test that assesses
 
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
all students equally across the board
 
00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:16.200 align:start position:0%
however there's no requirement that
 
00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:18.300 align:start position:0%
school districts actually really use the
 
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
standards that are adopted by the State
 
00:35:23.089 --> 00:35:23.099 align:start position:0%
Board of Education so you know we
 
00:35:25.370 --> 00:35:25.380 align:start position:0%
encourage them to because all of their
 
00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
students are going to be assessed on an
 
00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:28.740 align:start position:0%
assessment that is tied to those
 
00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:30.839 align:start position:0%
standards but school districts are not
 
00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:32.220 align:start position:0%
required to adopt those standards
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
locally they could choose to adopt a
 
00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:35.640 align:start position:0%
different set of of state or national
 
00:35:37.430 --> 00:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
standards if the local school board
 
00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
chose to
 
00:35:42.109 --> 00:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
and a follow-up yes thanks
 
00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:45.180 align:start position:0%
um and so so going back to the example
 
00:35:48.609 --> 00:35:48.619 align:start position:0%
of the Holocaust and genocide studies
 
00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:51.599 align:start position:0%
you you said that that
 
00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:54.660 align:start position:0%
that feeds into the minimum standards as
 
00:35:57.770 --> 00:35:57.780 align:start position:0%
opposed to the academic standards
 
00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:02.460 align:start position:0%
um and and so uh would would the
 
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
academic standards be then updated
 
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
sometime to
 
00:36:10.970 --> 00:36:10.980 align:start position:0%
um uh maybe in the next round of updates
 
00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:13.640 align:start position:0%
for a certain curriculum area
 
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
to include that subject matter
 
00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
absolutely yeah and one of the key
 
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
differences here is that anything that
 
00:36:22.609 --> 00:36:22.619 align:start position:0%
is enumerated within the minimum
 
00:36:24.410 --> 00:36:24.420 align:start position:0%
standards is a requirement of public
 
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
schools you have to do it it is a state
 
00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:29.700 align:start position:0%
regulation but if it's in the academic
 
00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
standards again districts have the
 
00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:32.820 align:start position:0%
choice whether or not to use those
 
00:36:34.190 --> 00:36:34.200 align:start position:0%
academic standards to build their
 
00:36:36.349 --> 00:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
curriculum or not so that's another key
 
00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:37.740 align:start position:0%
difference between minimum standards and
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
academic standards one is a choice and
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
one is a state regulation so the
 
00:36:43.970 --> 00:36:43.980 align:start position:0%
regulations around the Holocaust and
 
00:36:46.550 --> 00:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
genocide studies require districts to
 
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
teach them and to include those
 
00:36:50.329 --> 00:36:50.339 align:start position:0%
components that are within it we also
 
00:36:52.370 --> 00:36:52.380 align:start position:0%
have statewide social studies academic
 
00:36:54.109 --> 00:36:54.119 align:start position:0%
standards and there are aspects of
 
00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:56.460 align:start position:0%
Holocaust and genocide content that is
 
00:36:58.310 --> 00:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
within the social studies standards the
 
00:36:59.569 --> 00:36:59.579 align:start position:0%
districts would have a choice whether to
 
00:37:01.609 --> 00:37:01.619 align:start position:0%
use those standards or to adopt a
 
00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
different set of standards that they
 
00:37:02.820 --> 00:37:04.450 align:start position:0%
different set of standards that they
chose

00:37:04.450 --> 00:37:04.460 align:start position:0%
chose
 
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
so Nate a proficiency score on the
 
00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.589 align:start position:0%
so Nate a proficiency score on the
national

00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:09.599 align:start position:0%
national
 
00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:12.180 align:start position:0%
test assessment
 
00:37:15.589 --> 00:37:15.599 align:start position:0%
indicates comp Proficiency in that
 
00:37:19.010 --> 00:37:19.020 align:start position:0%
competency does that correlate to our
 
00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:22.380 align:start position:0%
our standards here in the state
 
00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:24.900 align:start position:0%
uh so separate from our state assessment
 
00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:26.630 align:start position:0%
uh so separate from our state assessment
yes

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
um they should so there there are
 
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
different studies it depends on the
 
00:37:31.490 --> 00:37:31.500 align:start position:0%
exams that we're talking about
 
00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:34.260 align:start position:0%
um so for example we use at the 11th
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
grade level the SAT for our Juniors for
 
00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:37.740 align:start position:0%
11th graders
 
00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
um and so they're being assessed on math
 
00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
reading an Ela through the SAT we know
 
00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:43.500 align:start position:0%
that for example with the SAT there's
 
00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:45.540 align:start position:0%
also comparability with the act so
 
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
students that are scoring a certain you
 
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
know level or score on the SAT for our
 
00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
state tests will most likely score a
 
00:37:53.109 --> 00:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
similar or comparable score on the ACT
 
00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:55.980 align:start position:0%
so it really probably depends on the
 
00:37:58.670 --> 00:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
type of assessment and the test that's
 
00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:00.300 align:start position:0%
being given we've done some
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
comparability studies across subject
 
00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
areas so for example a student that
 
00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
scores a certain score on the math test
 
00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:07.980 align:start position:0%
we know we'll likely score within a
 
00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:09.660 align:start position:0%
certain range on a science test because
 
00:38:11.390 --> 00:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
there's some comparability between Math
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
and Science there's a little bit less
 
00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:15.420 align:start position:0%
comparability say between English and
 
00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
Science and English and math
 
00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:19.880 align:start position:0%
so so
 
00:38:23.450 --> 00:38:23.460 align:start position:0%
if I'm a high school administrator and
 
00:38:25.069 --> 00:38:25.079 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to set up the curriculum that
 
00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:26.640 align:start position:0%
particular building with my staff and
 
00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
with my community
 
00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
and we decide that at the Freshman level
 
00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:35.460 align:start position:0%
that we're not going to be teaching this
 
00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
area of maybe U.S history or whatever it
 
00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:39.780 align:start position:0%
might be we're going to do that at the
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
10th grade
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
and yet we assess using a national
 
00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:47.700 align:start position:0%
instrument that may assume that you've
 
00:38:51.410 --> 00:38:51.420 align:start position:0%
had that U.S history at the ninth grade
 
00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:54.540 align:start position:0%
and so our proficiency may not look good
 
00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
well simply because we haven't taught it
 
00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:00.780 align:start position:0%
uh yet it's in the next year coming do
 
00:39:03.370 --> 00:39:03.380 align:start position:0%
we run in that alignment problem between
 
00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:06.780 align:start position:0%
our testing instruments and how the
 
00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
locals have decided to set up their
 
00:39:10.069 --> 00:39:10.079 align:start position:0%
curriculum because that is a local
 
00:39:10.079 --> 00:39:12.170 align:start position:0%
curriculum because that is a local
responsibility

00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:12.180 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
00:39:14.690 --> 00:39:14.700 align:start position:0%
so there's in one area where we have run
 
00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
into some alignment issues I think with
 
00:39:20.210 --> 00:39:20.220 align:start position:0%
math and Ela we're good
 
00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
um you know we part of the reason why we
 
00:39:24.170 --> 00:39:24.180 align:start position:0%
assess in the spring of the junior year
 
00:39:26.870 --> 00:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
is because much of what is on the test
 
00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:29.700 align:start position:0%
is being taught across the state in uh
 
00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:31.740 align:start position:0%
ninth 10th and the first half of 11th
 
00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:34.260 align:start position:0%
grade so in in that respect I think that
 
00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:36.060 align:start position:0%
assessment is a good assessment of where
 
00:39:37.609 --> 00:39:37.619 align:start position:0%
students are at
 
00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
um however with the science test for
 
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
juniors one of the things that we've
 
00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
noticed is our current Science
 
00:39:45.290 --> 00:39:45.300 align:start position:0%
assessment assesses students across
 
00:39:47.329 --> 00:39:47.339 align:start position:0%
three different content areas physical
 
00:39:50.089 --> 00:39:50.099 align:start position:0%
science life science and Earth and space
 
00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
science but in New Hampshire the only
 
00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:53.820 align:start position:0%
two sciences that are required for
 
00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
graduation are life science and physical
 
00:39:58.190 --> 00:39:58.200 align:start position:0%
science so Earth and space science is
 
00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:00.420 align:start position:0%
not required for graduation and there
 
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
are some students that have not taken
 
00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:04.380 align:start position:0%
Earth and space science
 
00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
and there are questions about Earth and
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
space science on the science tests that
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
were given to them as Juniors so I think
 
00:40:13.069 --> 00:40:13.079 align:start position:0%
that we if we really kind of dug deeper
 
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
into that data into those details we
 
00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
would probably see differences in the
 
00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
science scores if we were able to look
 
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
at students who have taken Earth and
 
00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:21.359 align:start position:0%
space science in high school and those
 
00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:22.980 align:start position:0%
students who have not and my guess is
 
00:40:24.589 --> 00:40:24.599 align:start position:0%
there would be a disparity between those
 
00:40:27.290 --> 00:40:27.300 align:start position:0%
scores we are currently working with our
 
00:40:29.810 --> 00:40:29.820 align:start position:0%
assessment vendor to do some changes to
 
00:40:31.849 --> 00:40:31.859 align:start position:0%
the alignment of our science test to
 
00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:33.300 align:start position:0%
make it more reflect the actual
 
00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:35.700 align:start position:0%
requirements on school districts but
 
00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:36.780 align:start position:0%
that's more a result of state
 
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
requirements and not necessarily it you
 
00:40:41.210 --> 00:40:41.220 align:start position:0%
know any actor that's you know a local
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
school district you know is changing
 
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
their curriculum that really is just
 
00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:45.900 align:start position:0%
purely because what we require as a
 
00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:48.349 align:start position:0%
purely because what we require as a
state

00:40:48.349 --> 00:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:50.700 align:start position:0%
yes represent Luna thank you very much
 
00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chair so I wanted to uh pick on what
 
00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
we were just talking about here a little
 
00:40:57.650 --> 00:40:57.660 align:start position:0%
bit so Earth and space science again for
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
it for a for example so
 
00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
um Can can you talk with us a little bit
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
about school districts that do
 
00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:07.609 align:start position:0%
about school districts that do
um

00:41:07.609 --> 00:41:07.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh include uh Earth and space science in
 
00:41:14.510 --> 00:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
their um in their science curriculum uh
 
00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
and uh and maybe you know are are is
 
00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:19.740 align:start position:0%
that most districts or some districts or
 
00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:22.740 align:start position:0%
few districts and in the end how does
 
00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
that play out on um on on our students
 
00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
outcomes and what their you know
 
00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
opportunities are for success
 
00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
so this is one of those times where you
 
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
you do have an overlap between the
 
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
academic standards and the minimum
 
00:41:36.770 --> 00:41:36.780 align:start position:0%
standards and you know with the science
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
test how they both come into play so all
 
00:41:41.030 --> 00:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
school districts offer Earth and space
 
00:41:43.310 --> 00:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
science the minimum standards require
 
00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:45.839 align:start position:0%
districts to offer it what they don't do
 
00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:48.300 align:start position:0%
is require students to take it so as a
 
00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:50.940 align:start position:0%
student you have a choice and so some
 
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
students you know may take physical
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
science or freshman year they may take
 
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
biology their sophomore year and then
 
00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:57.300 align:start position:0%
junior year they decide you know I
 
00:41:59.630 --> 00:41:59.640 align:start position:0%
really want to go into the medical field
 
00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:01.140 align:start position:0%
I'm going to take human anatomy and
 
00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:03.900 align:start position:0%
physiology and maybe their you know
 
00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:06.300 align:start position:0%
friend takes Earth space science when
 
00:42:07.970 --> 00:42:07.980 align:start position:0%
they go to take the Science assessment
 
00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
their junior year one of those students
 
00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
is going to have taken Earth and space
 
00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
science and one has not and so there's
 
00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
probably going to be a difference in the
 
00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:16.500 align:start position:0%
science scores for those two students
 
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
purely because of student choice and you
 
00:42:20.569 --> 00:42:20.579 align:start position:0%
know no parts all districts are required
 
00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:22.260 align:start position:0%
to offer it by the middle of Standards
 
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
but not every student is required to
 
00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:32.220 align:start position:0%
um there was a recent article put out
 
00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:32.870 align:start position:0%
um there was a recent article put out
um

00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:35.640 align:start position:0%
and I'm reading from this which was
 
00:42:38.450 --> 00:42:38.460 align:start position:0%
written this fall New Hampshire students
 
00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:40.380 align:start position:0%
test scores fell during the covet
 
00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:42.069 align:start position:0%
test scores fell during the covet
pandemic

00:42:42.069 --> 00:42:42.079 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
according to 2022 assessments taken by
 
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
sample students 30 percent of the
 
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
state's 8th graders and 40 percent of
 
00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
the fourth graders are proficient or
 
00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:54.540 align:start position:0%
above in mathematics
 
00:42:57.290 --> 00:42:57.300 align:start position:0%
I've spoken with you a number of times
 
00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:01.020 align:start position:0%
regarding trying to track the cohort of
 
00:43:04.010 --> 00:43:04.020 align:start position:0%
students in all our schools
 
00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:06.540 align:start position:0%
to find out how that particular class
 
00:43:08.809 --> 00:43:08.819 align:start position:0%
that's in the third grade then later on
 
00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
another year fourth grade and tracking
 
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
that and to determine and a little bit
 
00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:15.660 align:start position:0%
this goes a little bit to what represent
 
00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:17.940 align:start position:0%
Luna was trying to say about
 
00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
the are stating that there may be some
 
00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
schools which are hitting it and others
 
00:43:27.290 --> 00:43:27.300 align:start position:0%
not is this one way we can determine
 
00:43:29.390 --> 00:43:29.400 align:start position:0%
that if we can get that cohort
 
00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
information back I know we we're trying
 
00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:34.980 align:start position:0%
to get somebody to analyze that stuff
 
00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
for you and I know that you're shallow
 
00:43:39.530 --> 00:43:39.540 align:start position:0%
in staff there but um
 
00:43:42.109 --> 00:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
uh you know I'm concerned that we're
 
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
we're doing something that we've got to
 
00:43:47.089 --> 00:43:47.099 align:start position:0%
look at and find out where our strengths
 
00:43:48.829 --> 00:43:48.839 align:start position:0%
are why are they strong in certain
 
00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:51.180 align:start position:0%
locations and maybe not in others is a
 
00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
result of instructional staff is a
 
00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:56.460 align:start position:0%
result of aspiration of the community is
 
00:43:58.970 --> 00:43:58.980 align:start position:0%
that a result of supervision in school
 
00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:01.980 align:start position:0%
leadership parent you know
 
00:44:05.390 --> 00:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
aspiration I I don't know and yet we we
 
00:44:08.329 --> 00:44:08.339 align:start position:0%
need to get our math scores higher and I
 
00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:10.020 align:start position:0%
don't think it's necessarily just a
 
00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:11.030 align:start position:0%
don't think it's necessarily just a
result

00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
result
 
00:44:12.890 --> 00:44:12.900 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic
 
00:44:15.770 --> 00:44:15.780 align:start position:0%
that we were sliding in mathematics
 
00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:17.220 align:start position:0%
prior to this
 
00:44:20.569 --> 00:44:20.579 align:start position:0%
so I guess the question is you know will
 
00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:22.140 align:start position:0%
that cohort information help us
 
00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:24.540 align:start position:0%
understand where we need to really
 
00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:25.609 align:start position:0%
understand where we need to really
address

00:44:25.609 --> 00:44:25.619 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
some of our our support from the
 
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
legislature to help get that you know
 
00:44:34.130 --> 00:44:34.140 align:start position:0%
level increased higher in stars to
 
00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:35.990 align:start position:0%
level increased higher in stars to
achievement

00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
achievement
 
00:44:38.329 --> 00:44:38.339 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's you know we're a big
 
00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:40.079 align:start position:0%
proponent of providing as much data as
 
00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:42.300 align:start position:0%
we can to school districts uh you know
 
00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
to your point I think there could be a
 
00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:46.260 align:start position:0%
lot of reasons that live behind what the
 
00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:48.780 align:start position:0%
data says you know whether that is
 
00:44:50.329 --> 00:44:50.339 align:start position:0%
changes that need to be made and
 
00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
instruction and curriculum whether it's
 
00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:53.940 align:start position:0%
a result of particular cohorts of
 
00:44:55.609 --> 00:44:55.619 align:start position:0%
students and the experiences and the
 
00:44:57.170 --> 00:44:57.180 align:start position:0%
environment that those students are in
 
00:44:59.630 --> 00:44:59.640 align:start position:0%
whether it's you know cultural shifts
 
00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
within school districts changes in
 
00:45:03.349 --> 00:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
administration we know all of that can
 
00:45:05.630 --> 00:45:05.640 align:start position:0%
impact overall school programs and data
 
00:45:07.849 --> 00:45:07.859 align:start position:0%
so we're in the process or we're in the
 
00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:09.720 align:start position:0%
final stages of publishing a dashboard
 
00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:11.940 align:start position:0%
that will live within our website that's
 
00:45:13.970 --> 00:45:13.980 align:start position:0%
going to show that kind of cohort data
 
00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
we sort of call them heat Maps but
 
00:45:18.290 --> 00:45:18.300 align:start position:0%
essentially you'll be able to see a
 
00:45:20.750 --> 00:45:20.760 align:start position:0%
table for each school that shows each of
 
00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
the grades and their proficiency
 
00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
percentages as they move through so
 
00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:27.180 align:start position:0%
you'll see this class you know in third
 
00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
grade had this proficiency here's where
 
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
that class was fourth grade the next
 
00:45:31.849 --> 00:45:31.859 align:start position:0%
year here's where they were fifth grade
 
00:45:33.530 --> 00:45:33.540 align:start position:0%
the next year or sixth grade and you'll
 
00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
be able to see you know kind of a
 
00:45:37.069 --> 00:45:37.079 align:start position:0%
straight line the Prof efficiencies for
 
00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:38.940 align:start position:0%
cohorts of students as they've moved
 
00:45:40.609 --> 00:45:40.619 align:start position:0%
through grades and we think that that's
 
00:45:42.349 --> 00:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
going to be data that's you know useful
 
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
for schools and districts that are
 
00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
looking at trying to identify what what
 
00:45:48.109 --> 00:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
are the issues you know maybe there's
 
00:45:49.609 --> 00:45:49.619 align:start position:0%
particular cohorts of students they want
 
00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:51.300 align:start position:0%
to focus on or maybe there's particular
 
00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
grades you know we know and not just in
 
00:45:55.730 --> 00:45:55.740 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but fifth grade and eighth
 
00:45:58.250 --> 00:45:58.260 align:start position:0%
grade we tend to see larger changes in
 
00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:00.780 align:start position:0%
assessment scores possibly as a result
 
00:46:02.690 --> 00:46:02.700 align:start position:0%
of students moving from one building to
 
00:46:04.609 --> 00:46:04.619 align:start position:0%
another building or coming to the end of
 
00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:06.540 align:start position:0%
middle school so there are different
 
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
places where we know that if we have the
 
00:46:10.069 --> 00:46:10.079 align:start position:0%
data and we're seeing changes in
 
00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
assessment scores whether they're going
 
00:46:13.309 --> 00:46:13.319 align:start position:0%
up or down we'll know where to target
 
00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:15.900 align:start position:0%
specific resources for those students
 
00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:18.119 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping by March those dashboards are
 
00:46:20.589 --> 00:46:20.599 align:start position:0%
going to be published hopefully sooner
 
00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
but I'm I'm saying March and then if I
 
00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
can over deliver I will the beginning of
 
00:46:27.710 --> 00:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
March or the end of March let's shoot
 
00:46:29.329 --> 00:46:29.339 align:start position:0%
for the beginning well that's true for
 
00:46:31.490 --> 00:46:31.500 align:start position:0%
the beginning that'd be great further
 
00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
questions uh Dr Greene representative
 
00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:38.450 align:start position:0%
questions uh Dr Greene representative
miler

00:46:38.450 --> 00:46:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Dr Green for being here
 
00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh I'm aware that the 306 standards are
 
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
our rules are currently being reviewed
 
00:46:49.550 --> 00:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
what's the status of that review sure so
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
there's a group that's been looking at
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
the 306 standards and have proposed some
 
00:46:57.170 --> 00:46:57.180 align:start position:0%
revisions to that we have met with a
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
group of teachers we've met with a
 
00:47:00.829 --> 00:47:00.839 align:start position:0%
couple of other stakeholder groups we
 
00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:01.980 align:start position:0%
have several meetings coming up with
 
00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:03.540 align:start position:0%
some of the professional associations as
 
00:47:05.329 --> 00:47:05.339 align:start position:0%
well but right now they're just
 
00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:07.140 align:start position:0%
recommendations and revisions to the
 
00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
standards my understanding is sometime
 
00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
in either February or March there will
 
00:47:13.370 --> 00:47:13.380 align:start position:0%
most likely be an initial proposal for
 
00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:15.300 align:start position:0%
the State Board and at that point it
 
00:47:16.849 --> 00:47:16.859 align:start position:0%
will become a state board of education
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
process right now I'm working with
 
00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
several of those groups to try to gather
 
00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:24.060 align:start position:0%
input and feedback as to the types of
 
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
revisions that they want to see in those
 
00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
standards follow it please yes and so
 
00:47:31.849 --> 00:47:31.859 align:start position:0%
what's the procedure for the input from
 
00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:34.380 align:start position:0%
the practitioners regarding those
 
00:47:36.829 --> 00:47:36.839 align:start position:0%
particular standards
 
00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
so I know that the the group that has
 
00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
been working on it is hoping to start
 
00:47:43.370 --> 00:47:43.380 align:start position:0%
scheduling some public meetings over the
 
00:47:44.809 --> 00:47:44.819 align:start position:0%
course of the next few weeks where they
 
00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:46.980 align:start position:0%
can generate public feedback as well as
 
00:47:49.130 --> 00:47:49.140 align:start position:0%
some specific meetings with some of the
 
00:47:50.930 --> 00:47:50.940 align:start position:0%
different professional associations like
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
the superintendents associations the
 
00:47:55.370 --> 00:47:55.380 align:start position:0%
principal Association we've met with
 
00:47:57.770 --> 00:47:57.780 align:start position:0%
some of the curricular groups so I've
 
00:47:59.630 --> 00:47:59.640 align:start position:0%
had conversations with Extended Learning
 
00:48:02.089 --> 00:48:02.099 align:start position:0%
opportunity Network as well as the
 
00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
library media Specialists group they've
 
00:48:06.349 --> 00:48:06.359 align:start position:0%
had some suggestions school counselors
 
00:48:08.630 --> 00:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
group has provided some suggestions so
 
00:48:10.309 --> 00:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
we're continuing to see public feedback
 
00:48:12.109 --> 00:48:12.119 align:start position:0%
but I know that they want to hold
 
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
several meetings that are just going to
 
00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:15.900 align:start position:0%
be open to General Public feedback as
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
opposed to targeting specific groups so
 
00:48:20.930 --> 00:48:20.940 align:start position:0%
will there be General feedback prior to
 
00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
the final finalization of those
 
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
standards going before the board yes
 
00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:27.060 align:start position:0%
yeah and then once the State Board takes
 
00:48:28.849 --> 00:48:28.859 align:start position:0%
up an initial proposal there's always
 
00:48:30.530 --> 00:48:30.540 align:start position:0%
going to be you know public hearings
 
00:48:32.089 --> 00:48:32.099 align:start position:0%
involved with that as well so there will
 
00:48:34.130 --> 00:48:34.140 align:start position:0%
be additional public feedback and
 
00:48:35.870 --> 00:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
opportunities my guess is that with
 
00:48:38.089 --> 00:48:38.099 align:start position:0%
something as large charge as the minimum
 
00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:39.780 align:start position:0%
standards most likely there will be
 
00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:41.400 align:start position:0%
multiple opportunities for public
 
00:48:43.609 --> 00:48:43.619 align:start position:0%
feedback is there currently a draft
 
00:48:45.650 --> 00:48:45.660 align:start position:0%
that's available for review on the part
 
00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
of the public I believe there's a draft
 
00:48:49.609 --> 00:48:49.619 align:start position:0%
that's going to be made available very
 
00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
shortly yes thank you
 
00:48:55.069 --> 00:48:55.079 align:start position:0%
so if I schedule a meeting for next
 
00:48:57.170 --> 00:48:57.180 align:start position:0%
month would that draft be available by
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
then my guess is that draft will be
 
00:49:00.829 --> 00:49:00.839 align:start position:0%
available by the end of the week yeah
 
00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:03.180 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:05.940 align:start position:0%
further questions did you meet this this
 
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
week yeah this week that's what I
 
00:49:09.650 --> 00:49:09.660 align:start position:0%
understand this week
 
00:49:12.290 --> 00:49:12.300 align:start position:0%
yeah so we're we're climbing up on it
 
00:49:14.569 --> 00:49:14.579 align:start position:0%
that's that's uh that's good Rick a
 
00:49:16.309 --> 00:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
quick question for you yes could um
 
00:49:18.589 --> 00:49:18.599 align:start position:0%
could you uh get that
 
00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:21.780 align:start position:0%
um as soon as it becomes available we're
 
00:49:23.750 --> 00:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
going to request that a copy be you know
 
00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
sent to us we can make multiple copies
 
00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:26.329 align:start position:0%
sent to us we can make multiple copies
here

00:49:26.329 --> 00:49:26.339 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:49:29.329 --> 00:49:29.339 align:start position:0%
uh but could you get a draft to this
 
00:49:31.370 --> 00:49:31.380 align:start position:0%
committee as soon as it's released
 
00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:33.780 align:start position:0%
absolutely yeah PDF and we can get it
 
00:49:36.290 --> 00:49:36.300 align:start position:0%
out as well as the whole education
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
committee oh yes definitely yeah thank
 
00:49:40.430 --> 00:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
you Rick definitely I got another
 
00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:42.420 align:start position:0%
question it's jumping off this topic a
 
00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:49:44.569 --> 00:49:44.579 align:start position:0%
um there are a number of school
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
districts out there that are giving
 
00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
their own assessments above and beyond
 
00:49:50.329 --> 00:49:50.339 align:start position:0%
the Statewide assessment that which we
 
00:49:50.339 --> 00:49:51.230 align:start position:0%
the Statewide assessment that which we
do

00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:49:55.550 --> 00:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
and that that might be the key math test
 
00:49:57.470 --> 00:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
or some other test can you tell us the
 
00:49:58.910 --> 00:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
difference between a formative and a
 
00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
summative test sure yeah yeah I know
 
00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes they use interchangeably
 
00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
they're very very different so folks
 
00:50:07.490 --> 00:50:07.500 align:start position:0%
like me within assessment circles you
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
know really try to set those two things
 
00:50:11.089 --> 00:50:11.099 align:start position:0%
apart from each other because sometimes
 
00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:12.900 align:start position:0%
people try to equate the scores on one
 
00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
with the other
 
00:50:15.650 --> 00:50:15.660 align:start position:0%
um and they're used for very different
 
00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:17.210 align:start position:0%
um and they're used for very different
purposes

00:50:17.210 --> 00:50:17.220 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
00:50:18.829 --> 00:50:18.839 align:start position:0%
um so the best analogy I can make when I
 
00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:20.460 align:start position:0%
was you know still in the classroom as a
 
00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
teacher I would give regular quizzes to
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
my students it would have weekly quizzes
 
00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:27.180 align:start position:0%
and that was more for me as a teacher to
 
00:50:28.550 --> 00:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
make sure that the instruction that I
 
00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:31.020 align:start position:0%
was providing to my students was being
 
00:50:33.109 --> 00:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
received and that I was actually hitting
 
00:50:35.150 --> 00:50:35.160 align:start position:0%
the points that I needed to hit so if I
 
00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:36.780 align:start position:0%
got a set of quizzes back from students
 
00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:39.180 align:start position:0%
and they didn't understand half of the
 
00:50:40.609 --> 00:50:40.619 align:start position:0%
stuff was on the quizzes I knew the next
 
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
three lessons I was going to give we're
 
00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:43.980 align:start position:0%
going to be targeting that content that
 
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
the students hadn't got so formative
 
00:50:48.829 --> 00:50:48.839 align:start position:0%
assessment are like those weekly quizzes
 
00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
it's designed to help a teacher in the
 
00:50:52.970 --> 00:50:52.980 align:start position:0%
the moment change their instruction
 
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
change their practices in the classroom
 
00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they're filling gaps
 
00:50:59.450 --> 00:50:59.460 align:start position:0%
in student learning a summative
 
00:51:01.730 --> 00:51:01.740 align:start position:0%
assessment on the other hand is after
 
00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
the fact it's designed to you know show
 
00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:06.839 align:start position:0%
what a student was able to do after
 
00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
taking a particular course or a
 
00:51:11.450 --> 00:51:11.460 align:start position:0%
particular program and a good example in
 
00:51:12.890 --> 00:51:12.900 align:start position:0%
the classroom of something like a
 
00:51:14.930 --> 00:51:14.940 align:start position:0%
summative would be a final exam if you
 
00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:16.380 align:start position:0%
get to the end of a school year and it's
 
00:51:17.630 --> 00:51:17.640 align:start position:0%
the last day of the year and a student
 
00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:20.220 align:start position:0%
takes a final that's not going to inform
 
00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
the teacher's instruction you're going
 
00:51:23.809 --> 00:51:23.819 align:start position:0%
into summer that's really a measurement
 
00:51:26.030 --> 00:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
of how did the student do at the end of
 
00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:28.260 align:start position:0%
the instruction so the state summative
 
00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:31.140 align:start position:0%
tests are summative assessments they're
 
00:51:33.049 --> 00:51:33.059 align:start position:0%
designed to measure what a student was
 
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
able to do by the end of a particular
 
00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:36.540 align:start position:0%
grade so at the end of third grade
 
00:51:38.329 --> 00:51:38.339 align:start position:0%
here's where students were at at the end
 
00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:39.900 align:start position:0%
of eighth grade here's where students
 
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
were at so many districts will use
 
00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:45.300 align:start position:0%
formative tools things like nwea Star
 
00:51:47.870 --> 00:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
tests I ready many of those tests they
 
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
can give multiple times throughout the
 
00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
school year and that really is designed
 
00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
to Drive instructional changes during
 
00:51:55.549 --> 00:51:55.559 align:start position:0%
the year to make changes so that you can
 
00:51:58.069 --> 00:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
still provide instructions to students
 
00:51:59.630 --> 00:51:59.640 align:start position:0%
before you get to the summative
 
00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:01.250 align:start position:0%
before you get to the summative
assessment

00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
we have some schools that are giving the
 
00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:07.740 align:start position:0%
niwa or nwea or the the star star mass
 
00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:11.700 align:start position:0%
star reading Etc and but the the results
 
00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:15.420 align:start position:0%
on that uh summative instrument
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
and some of those tests you can give
 
00:52:20.809 --> 00:52:20.819 align:start position:0%
mid-year too as well but and it's it's
 
00:52:22.849 --> 00:52:22.859 align:start position:0%
Divergent then then the results we're
 
00:52:26.329 --> 00:52:26.339 align:start position:0%
getting from the Statewide assessment uh
 
00:52:29.930 --> 00:52:29.940 align:start position:0%
and so a school district may be given a
 
00:52:31.790 --> 00:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
bad rap because here I have a slow
 
00:52:34.069 --> 00:52:34.079 align:start position:0%
achievement score here but on our
 
00:52:36.170 --> 00:52:36.180 align:start position:0%
individual Norm referenced assessment
 
00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:38.700 align:start position:0%
test we're seeing are doing well because
 
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
we better aligned it to our our sequence
 
00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
of curricular instruction
 
00:52:46.849 --> 00:52:46.859 align:start position:0%
um are is that An Occurrence it's common
 
00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:51.240 align:start position:0%
at all or existing in the State uh yes I
 
00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:53.280 align:start position:0%
regularly hear from districts that you
 
00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:54.780 align:start position:0%
know have local assessments that they're
 
00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:56.400 align:start position:0%
providing that are you know giving them
 
00:52:58.309 --> 00:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
one set of data and then their students
 
00:52:59.510 --> 00:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
are taking the state assessment they're
 
00:53:01.790 --> 00:53:01.800 align:start position:0%
getting a separate set of data and
 
00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:03.660 align:start position:0%
they're saying why are students showing
 
00:53:05.329 --> 00:53:05.339 align:start position:0%
this level of proficiency here but this
 
00:53:07.849 --> 00:53:07.859 align:start position:0%
level of proficiency here sometimes it's
 
00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:09.480 align:start position:0%
just a difference in in the assessment
 
00:53:10.970 --> 00:53:10.980 align:start position:0%
structure oftentimes it's a difference
 
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
in when the tests are given and again
 
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
it's a difference in the the purpose of
 
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
the assessment itself health
 
00:53:19.069 --> 00:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further
 
00:53:19.079 --> 00:53:20.030 align:start position:0%
thank you are there any further
questions

00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:21.780 align:start position:0%
we have a little bit more on the docket
 
00:53:24.170 --> 00:53:24.180 align:start position:0%
here so I I don't want to
 
00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:25.430 align:start position:0%
here so I I don't want to
um

00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:27.049 --> 00:53:27.059 align:start position:0%
not seeing you thank you very much Dr
 
00:53:28.970 --> 00:53:28.980 align:start position:0%
Green thank you appreciate it and we're
 
00:53:35.329 --> 00:53:35.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
I'd like to you know I handed out a pack
 
00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:39.720 align:start position:0%
of the materials here to all the folks
 
00:53:41.089 --> 00:53:41.099 align:start position:0%
here on the on the committee here and
 
00:53:42.710 --> 00:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
there may be a few people with packets
 
00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
out there the next one down I had deals
 
00:53:47.210 --> 00:53:47.220 align:start position:0%
with the areas of assessment
 
00:53:49.370 --> 00:53:49.380 align:start position:0%
specifically history geography civics
 
00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
and economics
 
00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:53.940 align:start position:0%
which there's a letter that
 
00:53:57.530 --> 00:53:57.540 align:start position:0%
um I I received from Mary Gile who used
 
00:53:59.510 --> 00:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
to be the chairman of this committee
 
00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:03.180 align:start position:0%
that I've included in that packet
 
00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:05.640 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to locate it here
 
00:54:08.329 --> 00:54:08.339 align:start position:0%
but it speaks to some of the requests
 
00:54:10.970 --> 00:54:10.980 align:start position:0%
here at us right here
 
00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:13.069 align:start position:0%
here at us right here
um

00:54:13.069 --> 00:54:13.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
and this came from from representative
 
00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:16.849 align:start position:0%
and this came from from representative
guile

00:54:16.849 --> 00:54:16.859 align:start position:0%
guile
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
it's well it's not a it's about halfway
 
00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
through and you can see it it was a
 
00:54:25.370 --> 00:54:25.380 align:start position:0%
little review Senator Stiles
 
00:54:30.650 --> 00:54:30.660 align:start position:0%
and at that point in time we had
 
00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:34.980 align:start position:0%
history and Civics and economics as part
 
00:54:37.609 --> 00:54:37.619 align:start position:0%
of the required assessment given by the
 
00:54:39.349 --> 00:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
Statewide assessment but it wasn't being
 
00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
given we were doing a science and
 
00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
English language arts reading and
 
00:54:46.130 --> 00:54:46.140 align:start position:0%
Mathematics so then it was the decision
 
00:54:48.490 --> 00:54:48.500 align:start position:0%
of the legislature where we put into
 
00:54:51.650 --> 00:54:51.660 align:start position:0%
statute that this now is responsibility
 
00:54:55.549 --> 00:54:55.559 align:start position:0%
of the locals to assess the nature of
 
00:54:57.470 --> 00:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
where they are with achievement in these
 
00:54:59.030 --> 00:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
subject areas
 
00:55:02.930 --> 00:55:02.940 align:start position:0%
my question is is that being done
 
00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm not looking to the immigration
 
00:55:08.089 --> 00:55:08.099 align:start position:0%
test either as being an assessment of
 
00:55:10.370 --> 00:55:10.380 align:start position:0%
those areas of curriculum be it
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
economics or be it civics or being in
 
00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:13.730 align:start position:0%
economics or be it civics or being in
history

00:55:13.730 --> 00:55:13.740 align:start position:0%
history
 
00:55:15.829 --> 00:55:15.839 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:55:18.290 --> 00:55:18.300 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
um I I I I throw that out there seeing
 
00:55:23.630 --> 00:55:23.640 align:start position:0%
that this was a concern that was
 
00:55:27.170 --> 00:55:27.180 align:start position:0%
generated way back in 2014
 
00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:28.609 align:start position:0%
generated way back in 2014
and

00:55:28.609 --> 00:55:28.619 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:55:32.030 --> 00:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
I'd like to know whether if we have
 
00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
districts which have grabbed it and are
 
00:55:36.109 --> 00:55:36.119 align:start position:0%
doing it or whether they're just leaving
 
00:55:38.329 --> 00:55:38.339 align:start position:0%
it up to the local classroom to do an
 
00:55:40.970 --> 00:55:40.980 align:start position:0%
assessment as we go along just like the
 
00:55:43.790 --> 00:55:43.800 align:start position:0%
grade in your report card
 
00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
so somewhere along the way I I'm yet I'm
 
00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
just asking committee members now is
 
00:55:49.730 --> 00:55:49.740 align:start position:0%
this worth pursuing or is it something
 
00:55:51.049 --> 00:55:51.059 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:55:59.510 --> 00:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:02.030 --> 00:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
you need to keep that question right
 
00:56:04.910 --> 00:56:04.920 align:start position:0%
what do you want okay the the statute as
 
00:56:07.010 --> 00:56:07.020 align:start position:0%
it reads right now I don't have it right
 
00:56:09.829 --> 00:56:09.839 align:start position:0%
in front of me but the statute says the
 
00:56:09.839 --> 00:56:11.450 align:start position:0%
in front of me but the statute says the
Statewide

00:56:11.450 --> 00:56:11.460 align:start position:0%
Statewide
 
00:56:13.549 --> 00:56:13.559 align:start position:0%
Improvement assessment test which we
 
00:56:16.730 --> 00:56:16.740 align:start position:0%
give which is Statewide one is for those
 
00:56:19.010 --> 00:56:19.020 align:start position:0%
areas of mathematics then we have the
 
00:56:20.809 --> 00:56:20.819 align:start position:0%
science at certain grade levels and we
 
00:56:23.210 --> 00:56:23.220 align:start position:0%
have the English language arts reading
 
00:56:26.089 --> 00:56:26.099 align:start position:0%
that's it we used to have as a
 
00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
requirement that social studies was part
 
00:56:31.309 --> 00:56:31.319 align:start position:0%
of that however we didn't have an
 
00:56:33.049 --> 00:56:33.059 align:start position:0%
instrument which was measuring social
 
00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
studies achievement
 
00:56:37.849 --> 00:56:37.859 align:start position:0%
so we recognized that and said well
 
00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:39.720 align:start position:0%
maybe that's something the local ought
 
00:56:40.790 --> 00:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
to be doing
 
00:56:42.890 --> 00:56:42.900 align:start position:0%
so we did say but it's still a
 
00:56:44.589 --> 00:56:44.599 align:start position:0%
requirement if you look at that area of
 
00:56:48.829 --> 00:56:48.839 align:start position:0%
I don't maybe I it's in uh on Page Six
 
00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:58.069 --> 00:56:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:01.370 --> 00:57:01.380 align:start position:0%
yes there it is okay it reads
 
00:57:03.530 --> 00:57:03.540 align:start position:0%
the Statewide academic areas to be
 
00:57:05.030 --> 00:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
assessed shall include reading and
 
00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:07.500 align:start position:0%
language arts mathematics and science
 
00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
history geography civics and economics
 
00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:12.440 align:start position:0%
remain required critical areas of study
 
00:57:15.049 --> 00:57:15.059 align:start position:0%
therefore assessment of these subjects
 
00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
remains within the purview of the local
 
00:57:18.829 --> 00:57:18.839 align:start position:0%
school board
 
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
the Statewide Assessment program shall
 
00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:22.740 align:start position:0%
only measure student understanding of
 
00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
key content specific Concepts skills and
 
00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
knows applied within or across academic
 
00:57:32.210 --> 00:57:32.220 align:start position:0%
content domains and if you look back at
 
00:57:34.730 --> 00:57:34.740 align:start position:0%
193e those academic
 
00:57:38.750 --> 00:57:38.760 align:start position:0%
content areas include those subjects
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
that now we we hand it over to the local
 
00:57:44.450 --> 00:57:44.460 align:start position:0%
school board to do my question is is it
 
00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
being done
 
00:57:48.170 --> 00:57:48.180 align:start position:0%
now we heard in the inaugural address of
 
00:57:50.030 --> 00:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
the governor the other day that Civics
 
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
is a an area we want to pursue well we
 
00:57:55.250 --> 00:57:55.260 align:start position:0%
should be
 
00:57:56.990 --> 00:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
um so I
 
00:57:59.510 --> 00:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
I'm just asking okay here and that's
 
00:58:01.250 --> 00:58:01.260 align:start position:0%
where it's I put it out there should we
 
00:58:02.930 --> 00:58:02.940 align:start position:0%
be trying to find out from school
 
00:58:05.450 --> 00:58:05.460 align:start position:0%
districts what they're doing in regard
 
00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
to this
 
00:58:10.549 --> 00:58:10.559 align:start position:0%
so Rick I think that's a I think that is
 
00:58:13.309 --> 00:58:13.319 align:start position:0%
a good question and and
 
00:58:15.890 --> 00:58:15.900 align:start position:0%
I I believe
 
00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
we heard last year or the year before or
 
00:58:22.849 --> 00:58:22.859 align:start position:0%
the year before that um that the um uh
 
00:58:24.530 --> 00:58:24.540 align:start position:0%
in particular I think the social studies
 
00:58:25.849 --> 00:58:25.859 align:start position:0%
curriculum is something that the
 
00:58:27.530 --> 00:58:27.540 align:start position:0%
department the state
 
00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:28.130 align:start position:0%
department the state
um

00:58:28.130 --> 00:58:28.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:31.309 --> 00:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
um uh let me use the right term I guess
 
00:58:33.950 --> 00:58:33.960 align:start position:0%
academic standard for social studies is
 
00:58:35.390 --> 00:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
uh is a work
 
00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:38.460 align:start position:0%
um uh is a work in progress right right
 
00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
now and um and
 
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:43.730 align:start position:0%
now and um and
the

00:58:43.730 --> 00:58:43.740 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:58:46.250 --> 00:58:46.260 align:start position:0%
you know maybe this is something that
 
00:58:48.349 --> 00:58:48.359 align:start position:0%
that we could work with the school
 
00:58:51.410 --> 00:58:51.420 align:start position:0%
administrators Association on to get uh
 
00:58:53.150 --> 00:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
feedback from the districts on what
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
their what each district is currently
 
00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:55.849 align:start position:0%
their what each district is currently
using

00:58:55.849 --> 00:58:55.859 align:start position:0%
using
 
00:58:59.270 --> 00:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
for a social studies
 
00:59:01.730 --> 00:59:01.740 align:start position:0%
um you know using that as the as the
 
00:59:04.370 --> 00:59:04.380 align:start position:0%
envelope for um for this question what
 
00:59:05.569 --> 00:59:05.579 align:start position:0%
they're using for social studies
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
curriculum given that the uh that the
 
00:59:10.010 --> 00:59:10.020 align:start position:0%
State draft is um is still in progress
 
00:59:13.370 --> 00:59:13.380 align:start position:0%
would that be worth getting a poll on I
 
00:59:15.890 --> 00:59:15.900 align:start position:0%
I think it'd be it'd be helpful for if
 
00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:17.640 align:start position:0%
we could use for organizations such as
 
00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
that or even right through the
 
00:59:20.329 --> 00:59:20.339 align:start position:0%
department yeah does the department have
 
00:59:23.450 --> 00:59:23.460 align:start position:0%
any information on on what's going on we
 
00:59:26.450 --> 00:59:26.460 align:start position:0%
right in 2014 we put it down to the
 
00:59:29.930 --> 00:59:29.940 align:start position:0%
locals now okay what's what's going on
 
00:59:33.349 --> 00:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
uh it's it's something that I as a
 
00:59:35.690 --> 00:59:35.700 align:start position:0%
parent and I as a legislator up in my
 
00:59:37.069 --> 00:59:37.079 align:start position:0%
neck of the woods I have people asking
 
00:59:39.289 --> 00:59:39.299 align:start position:0%
me you know what's being taught in
 
00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:41.220 align:start position:0%
school and social studies now they want
 
00:59:42.589 --> 00:59:42.599 align:start position:0%
to know that their child knows that
 
00:59:45.109 --> 00:59:45.119 align:start position:0%
Brazil is in South America New Mexico is
 
00:59:47.329 --> 00:59:47.339 align:start position:0%
not another state a country
 
00:59:50.329 --> 00:59:50.339 align:start position:0%
and and in those are terms which used to
 
00:59:51.710 --> 00:59:51.720 align:start position:0%
be in the Old National Council for
 
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
Geographic education stuff that came out
 
00:59:55.309 --> 00:59:55.319 align:start position:0%
they had an assessment which was used
 
00:59:57.890 --> 00:59:57.900 align:start position:0%
for that I that that's a long time ago
 
01:00:00.109 --> 01:00:00.119 align:start position:0%
that's back in 1980s
 
01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:02.940 align:start position:0%
so what's being used today I don't know
 
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell other than the
 
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
testing I don't think we even know in
 
01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:10.020 align:start position:0%
what's being taught in each grade I I
 
01:00:11.870 --> 01:00:11.880 align:start position:0%
think even in the middle schools in
 
01:00:13.970 --> 01:00:13.980 align:start position:0%
Manchester if I can remember sixth
 
01:00:15.770 --> 01:00:15.780 align:start position:0%
seventh and eighth grade eighth grade
 
01:00:18.410 --> 01:00:18.420 align:start position:0%
was always U.S history but sixth and
 
01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
seventh taught different things at
 
01:00:22.430 --> 01:00:22.440 align:start position:0%
different times and different cultures
 
01:00:24.890 --> 01:00:24.900 align:start position:0%
and you know one might have South
 
01:00:27.829 --> 01:00:27.839 align:start position:0%
America and then they'd do Mexico in the
 
01:00:30.530 --> 01:00:30.540 align:start position:0%
the next grade so it's
 
01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:32.700 align:start position:0%
we don't even know that no it's it's
 
01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
changed we used to use the old textbook
 
01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
models where you start out with
 
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
Community my my family my neighborhood
 
01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:39.900 align:start position:0%
my community and then by fourth grade
 
01:00:41.690 --> 01:00:41.700 align:start position:0%
usually in the State history State
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
Geography and then you move on to U.S
 
01:00:46.370 --> 01:00:46.380 align:start position:0%
who I don't know what's going on
 
01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:49.740 align:start position:0%
nowadays and um I think it's worthy
 
01:00:52.670 --> 01:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
worthwhile to try and ask that question
 
01:00:55.970 --> 01:00:55.980 align:start position:0%
yes I I think I think it's worth
 
01:00:58.010 --> 01:00:58.020 align:start position:0%
pursuing the question is can you get the
 
01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:00.660 align:start position:0%
data well that's the question uh I mean
 
01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
that's always the question well I mean
 
01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:05.460 align:start position:0%
yeah as we have found I mean in the uh
 
01:01:08.030 --> 01:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
teacher shortage uh work study work
 
01:01:10.609 --> 01:01:10.619 align:start position:0%
group uh we it was even harder for
 
01:01:12.890 --> 01:01:12.900 align:start position:0%
superintendents to get data back on what
 
01:01:15.650 --> 01:01:15.660 align:start position:0%
the status of that was and so I think
 
01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
the the school districts are inundated
 
01:01:20.210 --> 01:01:20.220 align:start position:0%
with requests
 
01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:22.740 align:start position:0%
to get information and so it's hard to
 
01:01:25.309 --> 01:01:25.319 align:start position:0%
get that information back perhaps it
 
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
might even might be easier
 
01:01:30.109 --> 01:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
to use the social studies teachers on
 
01:01:33.470 --> 01:01:33.480 align:start position:0%
this particular topic ask that group if
 
01:01:34.970 --> 01:01:34.980 align:start position:0%
they could get the information from
 
01:01:37.309 --> 01:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
their peers rather than going through
 
01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:39.240 align:start position:0%
this through the school district so I
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
don't know I mean just the Gathering of
 
01:01:42.170 --> 01:01:42.180 align:start position:0%
the data is difficult I agree
 
01:01:43.849 --> 01:01:43.859 align:start position:0%
representative Myler there is a social
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
studies group within the state we could
 
01:01:47.930 --> 01:01:47.940 align:start position:0%
always work with them as well I'm open
 
01:01:49.730 --> 01:01:49.740 align:start position:0%
to trying to work with any group that
 
01:01:51.770 --> 01:01:51.780 align:start position:0%
can provide us more information there
 
01:01:53.569 --> 01:01:53.579 align:start position:0%
was a study at the department going on
 
01:01:55.609 --> 01:01:55.619 align:start position:0%
but that was disbanded
 
01:01:58.549 --> 01:01:58.559 align:start position:0%
so now we are sort of this area of flux
 
01:02:01.010 --> 01:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
on this subject area and what we're
 
01:02:01.970 --> 01:02:01.980 align:start position:0%
going to do we're going to end up
 
01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
waiting for the national to do something
 
01:02:07.309 --> 01:02:07.319 align:start position:0%
and then lo and behold here we are once
 
01:02:08.990 --> 01:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
again developing our curriculum around
 
01:02:10.609 --> 01:02:10.619 align:start position:0%
some kind of a national proficiency
 
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
level not what we see as necessary in
 
01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:15.180 align:start position:0%
our own state
 
01:02:17.750 --> 01:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to pursue that and try to
 
01:02:19.789 --> 01:02:19.799 align:start position:0%
get as much as we can right
 
01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
um Rick a quick question question to you
 
01:02:25.309 --> 01:02:25.319 align:start position:0%
do you do we know where the um where the
 
01:02:27.230 --> 01:02:27.240 align:start position:0%
um the department is in terms of
 
01:02:29.650 --> 01:02:29.660 align:start position:0%
development of the social studies
 
01:02:32.450 --> 01:02:32.460 align:start position:0%
curriculum I think it's been disbanded
 
01:02:35.390 --> 01:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
that's just that's what I thought yeah
 
01:02:37.970 --> 01:02:37.980 align:start position:0%
yeah so it is not there's nothing going
 
01:02:41.270 --> 01:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
on oh okay I didn't realize that thank
 
01:02:44.089 --> 01:02:44.099 align:start position:0%
you so we need to
 
01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
if you give me the green light I will
 
01:02:48.289 --> 01:02:48.299 align:start position:0%
start doing some questioning and asking
 
01:02:52.670 --> 01:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:58.789 --> 01:02:58.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:01.130 --> 01:03:01.140 align:start position:0%
oh okay there's one other thing I'd like
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
to do here I know that it's it's 11
 
01:03:05.030 --> 01:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
o'clock and this one is probably going
 
01:03:07.010 --> 01:03:07.020 align:start position:0%
to take a little bit more time
 
01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:10.380 align:start position:0%
uh item number four there was a new New
 
01:03:11.809 --> 01:03:11.819 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State task force on
 
01:03:13.730 --> 01:03:13.740 align:start position:0%
mathematics instruction
 
01:03:16.130 --> 01:03:16.140 align:start position:0%
they ask you to report back in January
 
01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:17.510 align:start position:0%
they ask you to report back in January
18th

01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
18th
 
01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:20.150 align:start position:0%
18th
2012.

01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
2012.
 
01:03:23.089 --> 01:03:23.099 align:start position:0%
that report was chaired by Paul leather
 
01:03:24.770 --> 01:03:24.780 align:start position:0%
who was the Deputy Commissioner of
 
01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
Education underneath Jenny Berry at that
 
01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:27.770 align:start position:0%
Education underneath Jenny Berry at that
time

01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:27.780 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:03:30.910 --> 01:03:30.920 align:start position:0%
and this report was a very thorough
 
01:03:33.589 --> 01:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
comprehensive report from which we have
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
taken some recommendations
 
01:03:40.010 --> 01:03:40.020 align:start position:0%
and we've gone and and placed them in
 
01:03:41.569 --> 01:03:41.579 align:start position:0%
the statute one of which was to get
 
01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
involved with the applying our skills
 
01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
through stem and CTE programs we've done
 
01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:48.900 align:start position:0%
that the fourth year of mathematics we
 
01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
didn't go with the fourth year of
 
01:03:52.730 --> 01:03:52.740 align:start position:0%
required Math course we went with the
 
01:03:55.130 --> 01:03:55.140 align:start position:0%
fourth year of having math skills
 
01:03:58.809 --> 01:03:58.819 align:start position:0%
embedded in a course in the high school
 
01:04:02.569 --> 01:04:02.579 align:start position:0%
of which had to be approved by the local
 
01:04:05.569 --> 01:04:05.579 align:start position:0%
school board and every student has to
 
01:04:07.730 --> 01:04:07.740 align:start position:0%
take at least four years of mathematics
 
01:04:10.910 --> 01:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
or three years of maths courses and the
 
01:04:13.490 --> 01:04:13.500 align:start position:0%
one year of embedded mathematics
 
01:04:17.030 --> 01:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
question I have is that being done it
 
01:04:18.650 --> 01:04:18.660 align:start position:0%
goes back to that accountability thing
 
01:04:21.410 --> 01:04:21.420 align:start position:0%
again and if we could all open up to
 
01:04:23.450 --> 01:04:23.460 align:start position:0%
that report right here I'd like to walk
 
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
through it
 
01:04:28.309 --> 01:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
and I've starred several areas which I
 
01:04:31.069 --> 01:04:31.079 align:start position:0%
think are are critical and very
 
01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
informative that was back done in 2012.
 
01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
we're looking at our state proficiency
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
and math is going the wrong direction
 
01:04:40.609 --> 01:04:40.619 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:04:43.970 --> 01:04:43.980 align:start position:0%
and for what reason I don't know and and
 
01:04:46.849 --> 01:04:46.859 align:start position:0%
uh but we do see it in the news we see
 
01:04:49.309 --> 01:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
it we hear it we saw it it's some are
 
01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
saying it's all pandemic related but
 
01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
according to this report it was going on
 
01:04:56.829 --> 01:04:56.839 align:start position:0%
prior to that back in
 
01:05:00.650 --> 01:05:00.660 align:start position:0%
2012. So on page five of that report
 
01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:04.200 align:start position:0%
I've underlined
 
01:05:08.390 --> 01:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
and this is coming out of 2014 it states
 
01:05:10.849 --> 01:05:10.859 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire must reverse the
 
01:05:13.069 --> 01:05:13.079 align:start position:0%
disturbing Trend poor mathematics
 
01:05:15.650 --> 01:05:15.660 align:start position:0%
performance in its high schools and
 
01:05:17.690 --> 01:05:17.700 align:start position:0%
minimize the need for remediation and
 
01:05:21.109 --> 01:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:23.690 --> 01:05:23.700 align:start position:0%
jumping on here to the next page I
 
01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:25.490 align:start position:0%
jumping on here to the next page I
underlined

01:05:25.490 --> 01:05:25.500 align:start position:0%
underlined
 
01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
on Page Six
 
01:05:30.530 --> 01:05:30.540 align:start position:0%
however that data in Figure 1 also
 
01:05:32.569 --> 01:05:32.579 align:start position:0%
suggests the decline in mathematical
 
01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
performance becomes evident during the
 
01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
Middle grades 6th through eighth grade
 
01:05:41.450 --> 01:05:41.460 align:start position:0%
that's where that this task force
 
01:05:43.970 --> 01:05:43.980 align:start position:0%
started seeing the fall off
 
01:05:46.609 --> 01:05:46.619 align:start position:0%
going on to page seven
 
01:05:48.770 --> 01:05:48.780 align:start position:0%
we're in 11th grade mathematics
 
01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
performances compared to other content
 
01:05:53.690 --> 01:05:53.700 align:start position:0%
areas there is further data to suggest
 
01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
that performances and Mathematics the
 
01:05:58.670 --> 01:05:58.680 align:start position:0%
middle and secondary levels need to
 
01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
become a priority for New Hampshire
 
01:06:04.670 --> 01:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
for all grades tested by kneecap at that
 
01:06:07.370 --> 01:06:07.380 align:start position:0%
time mathematics performance is lower
 
01:06:09.410 --> 01:06:09.420 align:start position:0%
when compared to achievement and reading
 
01:06:11.450 --> 01:06:11.460 align:start position:0%
that still exists
 
01:06:13.370 --> 01:06:13.380 align:start position:0%
while the percentages of students
 
01:06:15.230 --> 01:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
proficient in Reading seem to remain
 
01:06:16.849 --> 01:06:16.859 align:start position:0%
consistent during grades six through
 
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
eight this is not the case in
 
01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:21.950 align:start position:0%
eight this is not the case in
mathematics

01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
mathematics
 
01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
that was back in 2014 jumping further to
 
01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:27.720 align:start position:0%
some of the areas that underlined
 
01:06:30.410 --> 01:06:30.420 align:start position:0%
on page 11.
 
01:06:32.690 --> 01:06:32.700 align:start position:0%
the presentation further stated that
 
01:06:34.789 --> 01:06:34.799 align:start position:0%
approximately 65 percent of students
 
01:06:36.049 --> 01:06:36.059 align:start position:0%
entering New Hampshire's community
 
01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:39.839 align:start position:0%
colleges in the fall of 2009 tested not
 
01:06:41.390 --> 01:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
ready for the first college level
 
01:06:44.450 --> 01:06:44.460 align:start position:0%
mathematics course it seems this data
 
01:06:46.430 --> 01:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
could have been predicted based on the
 
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
2009 kneecap and nape results which
 
01:06:51.289 --> 01:06:51.299 align:start position:0%
demonstrated that approximately
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
one-third of grades grade 11 and 12
 
01:06:55.250 --> 01:06:55.260 align:start position:0%
students were professional were
 
01:06:58.069 --> 01:06:58.079 align:start position:0%
proficient in mathematics I talked with
 
01:06:59.510 --> 01:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
the community college system the other
 
01:07:02.690 --> 01:07:02.700 align:start position:0%
day we still have remediation going on
 
01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
at the community college level I don't
 
01:07:07.549 --> 01:07:07.559 align:start position:0%
know if it's that 60 percent level
 
01:07:09.770 --> 01:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
that they're not teaching as remedial
 
01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
math now they're working with the kids
 
01:07:13.130 --> 01:07:13.140 align:start position:0%
in the classroom
 
01:07:15.049 --> 01:07:15.059 align:start position:0%
and of course they cater to an adult
 
01:07:16.970 --> 01:07:16.980 align:start position:0%
population it's older than the student
 
01:07:20.329 --> 01:07:20.339 align:start position:0%
coming out of out of uh High School
 
01:07:23.210 --> 01:07:23.220 align:start position:0%
moving on let me read these things off
 
01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
then we can have a little bit of a
 
01:07:28.190 --> 01:07:28.200 align:start position:0%
discussion on it going to page
 
01:07:31.309 --> 01:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
uh 16.
 
01:07:33.710 --> 01:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
the final component of instructional of
 
01:07:35.809 --> 01:07:35.819 align:start position:0%
instructional change is the impact
 
01:07:38.690 --> 01:07:38.700 align:start position:0%
teacher content the impact teacher
 
01:07:41.029 --> 01:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
content and pedagogical knowledge and
 
01:07:43.069 --> 01:07:43.079 align:start position:0%
attitudes about mathematics have on
 
01:07:44.410 --> 01:07:44.420 align:start position:0%
student learning and achievement
 
01:07:46.910 --> 01:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
teachers need a deep understanding of
 
01:07:49.970 --> 01:07:49.980 align:start position:0%
mathematics they T they teach including
 
01:07:51.650 --> 01:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
Concepts practices principles
 
01:07:54.349 --> 01:07:54.359 align:start position:0%
representations and applications to
 
01:07:56.690 --> 01:07:56.700 align:start position:0%
support effective instruction that's an
 
01:08:00.049 --> 01:08:00.059 align:start position:0%
old study but it's surely true today too
 
01:08:03.410 --> 01:08:03.420 align:start position:0%
that even our teachers in elementary
 
01:08:05.569 --> 01:08:05.579 align:start position:0%
school have to take the Praxis in terms
 
01:08:08.329 --> 01:08:08.339 align:start position:0%
of mathematics and some Bach against
 
01:08:10.370 --> 01:08:10.380 align:start position:0%
doing that but I think it's absolutely
 
01:08:13.370 --> 01:08:13.380 align:start position:0%
you know a good case for having to take
 
01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:14.990 align:start position:0%
you know a good case for having to take
that

01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:08:18.349 --> 01:08:18.359 align:start position:0%
on page 17 based on Research relating to
 
01:08:20.150 --> 01:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
effective teaching and Mathematics the
 
01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:21.900 align:start position:0%
task force to improve mathematics
 
01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:22.749 align:start position:0%
task force to improve mathematics
instruction

01:08:22.749 --> 01:08:22.759 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
01:08:25.249 --> 01:08:25.259 align:start position:0%
recommends pre-service mathematics
 
01:08:27.530 --> 01:08:27.540 align:start position:0%
teacher programs and professional
 
01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
development for practicing mathematic
 
01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
Educators I think it should be for all
 
01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:32.570 align:start position:0%
Educators I think it should be for all
teachers

01:08:32.570 --> 01:08:32.580 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
01:08:35.209 --> 01:08:35.219 align:start position:0%
elementary through middle and on high
 
01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
school are we doing it I don't know
 
01:08:41.150 --> 01:08:41.160 align:start position:0%
um recommendation five
 
01:08:43.309 --> 01:08:43.319 align:start position:0%
include training on how to effectively
 
01:08:45.349 --> 01:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
utilize and incorporate 21st century
 
01:08:48.349 --> 01:08:48.359 align:start position:0%
skills such as stem and CT outcomes and
 
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
Mathematics instruction to provide
 
01:08:51.349 --> 01:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
students with opportunities to apply
 
01:08:53.209 --> 01:08:53.219 align:start position:0%
mathematical understanding and authentic
 
01:08:53.219 --> 01:08:54.410 align:start position:0%
mathematical understanding and authentic
context

01:08:54.410 --> 01:08:54.420 align:start position:0%
context
 
01:08:57.229 --> 01:08:57.239 align:start position:0%
with real world applications that was
 
01:08:59.329 --> 01:08:59.339 align:start position:0%
the onset of the math learning community
 
01:09:02.269 --> 01:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
program and using the accuplacer at the
 
01:09:04.490 --> 01:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
end of the 10th grade which we no longer
 
01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
fund and it's not being done
 
01:09:10.490 --> 01:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
uh and what we also recognize that
 
01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
there's different styles of learning and
 
01:09:15.289 --> 01:09:15.299 align:start position:0%
different styles of teaching and this is
 
01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:17.759 align:start position:0%
proposing that we we teach it in
 
01:09:19.910 --> 01:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the skills that career
 
01:09:22.130 --> 01:09:22.140 align:start position:0%
is going to be requesting them to do
 
01:09:25.249 --> 01:09:25.259 align:start position:0%
later on
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
um going further here
 
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
there's a on page 23 you can look at all
 
01:09:34.010 --> 01:09:34.020 align:start position:0%
the recommendations which came out some
 
01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
are just great recommendations
 
01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
on page 23 in addition High School
 
01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
Mathematics Curriculum instruction often
 
01:09:43.130 --> 01:09:43.140 align:start position:0%
focus on Mastery of conceptual and
 
01:09:45.530 --> 01:09:45.540 align:start position:0%
procedural knowledge rather than on the
 
01:09:47.329 --> 01:09:47.339 align:start position:0%
application of Concepts and procedures
 
01:09:50.510 --> 01:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
linked to real world context
 
01:09:53.450 --> 01:09:53.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:56.689 --> 01:09:56.699 align:start position:0%
and going a little farther and then we
 
01:09:58.610 --> 01:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
can have if there's any need for a
 
01:10:01.790 --> 01:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
discussion here on page 24
 
01:10:04.790 --> 01:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
underline the goal should be to provide
 
01:10:06.890 --> 01:10:06.900 align:start position:0%
support so that all students can reach
 
01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
the College and Career ready line by the
 
01:10:11.930 --> 01:10:11.940 align:start position:0%
end of the 11th grade ending their High
 
01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:14.219 align:start position:0%
School career with one of several high
 
01:10:16.729 --> 01:10:16.739 align:start position:0%
quality mathematical courses that allow
 
01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
students the opportunity to deepen their
 
01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
understanding the College and Career
 
01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
ready standards that's why we integrated
 
01:10:25.189 --> 01:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
the embedded mathematics in the fourth
 
01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
year recommendation 17 there on that
 
01:10:30.890 --> 01:10:30.900 align:start position:0%
same page include a study of mathematics
 
01:10:32.750 --> 01:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
for each year that a student is enrolled
 
01:10:35.090 --> 01:10:35.100 align:start position:0%
in high school for a minimum of four
 
01:10:37.130 --> 01:10:37.140 align:start position:0%
credits and Mathematics for graduation
 
01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
from high school that we didn't do
 
01:10:41.689 --> 01:10:41.699 align:start position:0%
that we didn't do
 
01:10:43.250 --> 01:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
it's three
 
01:10:45.290 --> 01:10:45.300 align:start position:0%
we went with the embedded which is a
 
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
maybe a credit in social studies and
 
01:10:50.270 --> 01:10:50.280 align:start position:0%
learning how to use the spreadsheet
 
01:10:54.290 --> 01:10:54.300 align:start position:0%
number 20 on page 25 provide increased
 
01:10:55.850 --> 01:10:55.860 align:start position:0%
opportunities for deeper learning
 
01:10:57.770 --> 01:10:57.780 align:start position:0%
including experiences to apply
 
01:11:00.189 --> 01:11:00.199 align:start position:0%
mathematics and real world contacts
 
01:11:02.630 --> 01:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
connections will be made to Extended
 
01:11:04.729 --> 01:11:04.739 align:start position:0%
Learning opportunities we had a
 
01:11:06.050 --> 01:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
youngster in the other day with
 
01:11:07.970 --> 01:11:07.980 align:start position:0%
extending learning opportunity that came
 
01:11:11.450 --> 01:11:11.460 align:start position:0%
from your town their reps in luno
 
01:11:12.890 --> 01:11:12.900 align:start position:0%
um opportunities utilize science
 
01:11:14.570 --> 01:11:14.580 align:start position:0%
technology engineering Career Technical
 
01:11:16.250 --> 01:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
education and relevant applications
 
01:11:19.310 --> 01:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
lastly recommendation 20 include the
 
01:11:21.290 --> 01:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
requirement of successful completion of
 
01:11:23.090 --> 01:11:23.100 align:start position:0%
algebra for high school graduation
 
01:11:25.729 --> 01:11:25.739 align:start position:0%
however future movement will be made to
 
01:11:27.410 --> 01:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
ensure that all New Hampshire school
 
01:11:29.570 --> 01:11:29.580 align:start position:0%
students are obtaining mathematical
 
01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
content equivalent equivalent through
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
Algebra 2 to be prepared for a variety
 
01:11:36.410 --> 01:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
of college and career opportunities we
 
01:11:38.930 --> 01:11:38.940 align:start position:0%
know that that is not the case that
 
01:11:40.610 --> 01:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
there's a number of students coming out
 
01:11:43.250 --> 01:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
of algebra one who are you know just
 
01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
unable to tackle algebra 2. and uh so
 
01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
that was one of the things we were
 
01:11:51.050 --> 01:11:51.060 align:start position:0%
trying to do with of course the bath
 
01:11:52.790 --> 01:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
Dorian from the community college system
 
01:11:55.570 --> 01:11:55.580 align:start position:0%
was trying to work with us on so
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
mathematics is sliding still
 
01:11:58.800 --> 01:11:59.810 align:start position:0%
mathematics is sliding still
um

01:11:59.810 --> 01:11:59.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:01.370 --> 01:12:01.380 align:start position:0%
what are we going to do
 
01:12:04.310 --> 01:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
or do we do anything or do that we let
 
01:12:05.810 --> 01:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
all that Federal money in the schools
 
01:12:08.209 --> 01:12:08.219 align:start position:0%
take care of it
 
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
representative cardelli thank you I I
 
01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
think it's not just a New Hampshire
 
01:12:15.229 --> 01:12:15.239 align:start position:0%
problem but according to nape it seemed
 
01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
to be a national problem for mathematics
 
01:12:21.890 --> 01:12:21.900 align:start position:0%
uh so I don't know
 
01:12:21.900 --> 01:12:22.810 align:start position:0%
uh so I don't know
um

01:12:22.810 --> 01:12:22.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:26.270 --> 01:12:26.280 align:start position:0%
if there's a not uh National solution
 
01:12:28.430 --> 01:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
um or a local solution
 
01:12:30.649 --> 01:12:30.659 align:start position:0%
um but it's interesting that a number of
 
01:12:33.229 --> 01:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
these recommendations also all uh
 
01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
reference um we real world application
 
01:12:40.010 --> 01:12:40.020 align:start position:0%
of mathematics is part of the rep uh
 
01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:42.470 align:start position:0%
of mathematics is part of the rep uh
recommendation

01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:44.930 align:start position:0%
recommendation
um

01:12:44.930 --> 01:12:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:47.090 --> 01:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
so I'm not I'm not sure and to answer
 
01:12:49.610 --> 01:12:49.620 align:start position:0%
your question where we go but I think
 
01:12:51.169 --> 01:12:51.179 align:start position:0%
there are several uh pieces of
 
01:12:53.209 --> 01:12:53.219 align:start position:0%
legislation dealing with mathematics
 
01:12:56.209 --> 01:12:56.219 align:start position:0%
this year that uh will provide uh for a
 
01:12:57.890 --> 01:12:57.900 align:start position:0%
good discussion of
 
01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh where we do go I think I mentioned
 
01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
the last minute I had a meeting with all
 
01:13:04.850 --> 01:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
the math teachers up at Rivendell that's
 
01:13:07.370 --> 01:13:07.380 align:start position:0%
a Interstate government uh District we
 
01:13:08.930 --> 01:13:08.940 align:start position:0%
have between Orford and fairly Vermont
 
01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
it's one of our districts and I had high
 
01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
school middle school there and then I'll
 
01:13:16.910 --> 01:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
mention there was not
 
01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
one tune song they were all sort of like
 
01:13:22.010 --> 01:13:22.020 align:start position:0%
going in different directions in terms
 
01:13:24.709 --> 01:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
of how I teach mathematics
 
01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
and based upon their background but
 
01:13:31.070 --> 01:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
they're all very anxious to see their
 
01:13:33.110 --> 01:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
their kids get to the point where we're
 
01:13:34.729 --> 01:13:34.739 align:start position:0%
seeing that level of achievement we want
 
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
and working cooperatively together
 
01:13:39.770 --> 01:13:39.780 align:start position:0%
is there a mathematics Association in
 
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:13:43.250 --> 01:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
that we could work with in terms of
 
01:13:45.050 --> 01:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
is anybody out here maybe no Becky do
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
so they're just not siloing it to middle
 
01:14:07.490 --> 01:14:07.500 align:start position:0%
school but are they also working with
 
01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
the elements a lot of kids get the fear
 
01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
of mathematics right in the grade school
 
01:14:15.709 --> 01:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
and from that point onwards it's it's
 
01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
very difficult for them to really grasp
 
01:14:20.270 --> 01:14:20.280 align:start position:0%
and especially if the if the teaching
 
01:14:22.010 --> 01:14:22.020 align:start position:0%
style doesn't match up with the learning
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
style of that child
 
01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:36.950 align:start position:0%
style of that child
okay

01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:40.370 --> 01:14:40.380 align:start position:0%
yes represent Luna yeah Rick thanks for
 
01:14:41.870 --> 01:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
including this because I hadn't seen
 
01:14:44.630 --> 01:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
this report the leather report that was
 
01:14:46.729 --> 01:14:46.739 align:start position:0%
very comprehensive and after that he
 
01:14:49.790 --> 01:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
left for Kentucky yeah yeah and and you
 
01:14:52.729 --> 01:14:52.739 align:start position:0%
know and obviously some of the uh you
 
01:14:56.510 --> 01:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
know the data is um is a decade old but
 
01:14:59.630 --> 01:14:59.640 align:start position:0%
I think the um the the issues that that
 
01:15:02.810 --> 01:15:02.820 align:start position:0%
it raises are um are are certainly uh
 
01:15:05.209 --> 01:15:05.219 align:start position:0%
you know contemporary
 
01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:08.640 align:start position:0%
um but but one of the the thing that one
 
01:15:10.010 --> 01:15:10.020 align:start position:0%
of the things you skipped over on here
 
01:15:11.330 --> 01:15:11.340 align:start position:0%
and I think your review on this was
 
01:15:14.209 --> 01:15:14.219 align:start position:0%
excellent on page nine figure four has
 
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
got me going here
 
01:15:19.010 --> 01:15:19.020 align:start position:0%
um because it's the cohort map yeah
 
01:15:22.910 --> 01:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
and and it's it's interesting because
 
01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:23.570 align:start position:0%
and and it's it's interesting because
um

01:15:23.570 --> 01:15:23.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:27.530 --> 01:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
it uh it it certainly tells the story
 
01:15:30.649 --> 01:15:30.659 align:start position:0%
about about you know something's
 
01:15:34.610 --> 01:15:34.620 align:start position:0%
happening in the um in the uh early high
 
01:15:37.250 --> 01:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
school years where um where where you
 
01:15:40.850 --> 01:15:40.860 align:start position:0%
you know the um the kneecap scores in in
 
01:15:43.729 --> 01:15:43.739 align:start position:0%
this case sort of fall off a cliff
 
01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
but in the Years building up taking a
 
01:15:49.490 --> 01:15:49.500 align:start position:0%
look at the cohort that moves through
 
01:15:51.410 --> 01:15:51.420 align:start position:0%
and you sort of have to look at it I
 
01:15:54.229 --> 01:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
think along a diagonal going across the
 
01:15:56.030 --> 01:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
the cohort map
 
01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:05.390 --> 01:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
they just they just fall as as as as the
 
01:16:08.450 --> 01:16:08.460 align:start position:0%
cohort goes into the more advanced
 
01:16:13.370 --> 01:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
grades but across the years they um they
 
01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
increase that's how I'm reading this is
 
01:16:17.689 --> 01:16:17.699 align:start position:0%
that that's that's how it is right
 
01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
across our country
 
01:16:22.189 --> 01:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
and and you know I had it when I was a
 
01:16:24.110 --> 01:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
school administrator and principal up in
 
01:16:27.229 --> 01:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
Alaska we we saw the fall
 
01:16:30.410 --> 01:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
start yeah at the end of the junior high
 
01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:31.310 align:start position:0%
start yeah at the end of the junior high
school

01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:16:35.090 --> 01:16:35.100 align:start position:0%
and and and then it went downhill
 
01:16:38.030 --> 01:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
um so what can we do to try to reverse
 
01:16:41.450 --> 01:16:41.460 align:start position:0%
that Trend and so yeah yeah well I I
 
01:16:43.070 --> 01:16:43.080 align:start position:0%
think it's an there's an interesting
 
01:16:45.530 --> 01:16:45.540 align:start position:0%
Dynamic if I'm reading this this this
 
01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:47.390 align:start position:0%
Dynamic if I'm reading this this this
graph

01:16:47.390 --> 01:16:47.400 align:start position:0%
graph
 
01:16:52.490 --> 01:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
um correctly because looking at the 2010
 
01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:53.169 align:start position:0%
um correctly because looking at the 2010
um

01:16:53.169 --> 01:16:53.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:57.669 --> 01:16:57.679 align:start position:0%
uh uh 11th grade did better than the
 
01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:01.260 align:start position:0%
2009 11th grade and they did better than
 
01:17:04.669 --> 01:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
the 2008 11th grade and they did better
 
01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:07.800 align:start position:0%
than the Tucson 2007 11th grade so there
 
01:17:09.370 --> 01:17:09.380 align:start position:0%
was Improvement
 
01:17:12.970 --> 01:17:12.980 align:start position:0%
horizontally but there was decline
 
01:17:15.649 --> 01:17:15.659 align:start position:0%
looking at the cohort as they move
 
01:17:18.830 --> 01:17:18.840 align:start position:0%
through the grades so there was this
 
01:17:21.890 --> 01:17:21.900 align:start position:0%
sort of like General Improvement going
 
01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:24.900 align:start position:0%
on but it but we were losing something
 
01:17:29.030 --> 01:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
in that in that sort of 9 10 leading to
 
01:17:32.689 --> 01:17:32.699 align:start position:0%
11 for for every cohort and see and we
 
01:17:34.610 --> 01:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
have so many other issues approaching us
 
01:17:37.430 --> 01:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
now that weren't existing back at in
 
01:17:39.410 --> 01:17:39.420 align:start position:0%
this era it'd be great to get some new
 
01:17:41.570 --> 01:17:41.580 align:start position:0%
data you know the social issues the
 
01:17:44.450 --> 01:17:44.460 align:start position:0%
pandemic related yeah all that uh
 
01:17:46.610 --> 01:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
families you know you know they probably
 
01:17:48.050 --> 01:17:48.060 align:start position:0%
don't have dinner together they have it
 
01:17:49.729 --> 01:17:49.739 align:start position:0%
around the TV set or while they're doing
 
01:17:52.490 --> 01:17:52.500 align:start position:0%
XBox and and
 
01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:55.380 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm I'm concerned here and I look
 
01:17:57.110 --> 01:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
forward to the data we might get back
 
01:17:59.570 --> 01:17:59.580 align:start position:0%
from Dr Green here on following these
 
01:18:02.090 --> 01:18:02.100 align:start position:0%
cohorts in these subject areas and even
 
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
getting down into the weeds not just
 
01:18:05.689 --> 01:18:05.699 align:start position:0%
mathematics but getting down into the
 
01:18:07.729 --> 01:18:07.739 align:start position:0%
skill sets and the knowledge in
 
01:18:10.930 --> 01:18:10.940 align:start position:0%
mathematics so we can see that you know
 
01:18:14.209 --> 01:18:14.219 align:start position:0%
it's it's expensive to replace your
 
01:18:15.649 --> 01:18:15.659 align:start position:0%
whole curriculum in a school district
 
01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
when in fact you may just have one set
 
01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
of elements or themes which are needing
 
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
repair repair that not throw the whole
 
01:18:26.649 --> 01:18:26.659 align:start position:0%
thing out with the with the wash uh
 
01:18:30.169 --> 01:18:30.179 align:start position:0%
represent Cornell and then Senator sorry
 
01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
how do these scores compare with how the
 
01:18:35.030 --> 01:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
students are doing in their classes or
 
01:18:38.830 --> 01:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
or you know on their you know
 
01:18:41.990 --> 01:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I you know is there a are they
 
01:18:44.090 --> 01:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
doing this poorly in their their high
 
01:18:47.090 --> 01:18:47.100 align:start position:0%
school math classes or
 
01:18:49.250 --> 01:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
are they just doing this poorly on the
 
01:18:49.260 --> 01:18:50.450 align:start position:0%
are they just doing this poorly on the
tests

01:18:50.450 --> 01:18:50.460 align:start position:0%
tests
 
01:18:52.930 --> 01:18:52.940 align:start position:0%
the kneecap test
 
01:18:55.310 --> 01:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
it could be that's a good question as
 
01:18:57.649 --> 01:18:57.659 align:start position:0%
you get older in school attitude towards
 
01:19:00.950 --> 01:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
standardized testing falls off I think
 
01:19:04.250 --> 01:19:04.260 align:start position:0%
from when you're younger and a classroom
 
01:19:06.649 --> 01:19:06.659 align:start position:0%
teacher has the group of kids and says
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
okay everybody's going to be on time and
 
01:19:11.209 --> 01:19:11.219 align:start position:0%
you're going to do well and you know and
 
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
but in high school they're doing it as a
 
01:19:15.770 --> 01:19:15.780 align:start position:0%
big group and I don't know if it's given
 
01:19:17.450 --> 01:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
the same way exactly do you think
 
01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
there's any the other day I was talking
 
01:19:20.689 --> 01:19:20.699 align:start position:0%
with my wife and I was saying about a
 
01:19:22.430 --> 01:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
couple of our grandkids which are off at
 
01:19:25.070 --> 01:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
college and graduated and some going
 
01:19:27.649 --> 01:19:27.659 align:start position:0%
and I said boy you know
 
01:19:31.130 --> 01:19:31.140 align:start position:0%
when I was in college getting an 88 in
 
01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
in something was a real feat now the
 
01:19:38.689 --> 01:19:38.699 align:start position:0%
kids come back and you know I've got A's
 
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
you know and so my 88 was that an a back
 
01:19:44.450 --> 01:19:44.460 align:start position:0%
then compared to today do grades are
 
01:19:47.630 --> 01:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
grades easier today than the yeah great
 
01:19:49.010 --> 01:19:49.020 align:start position:0%
inflation I don't know what you want to
 
01:19:52.310 --> 01:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
call it but uh when I went in as a
 
01:19:54.530 --> 01:19:54.540 align:start position:0%
school administrator or principal up in
 
01:19:56.330 --> 01:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
Alaska I looked at the report cards
 
01:19:59.750 --> 01:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
after two after the first semester and I
 
01:20:01.189 --> 01:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
collected them all and this is a school
 
01:20:03.169 --> 01:20:03.179 align:start position:0%
of in elementary so it was it is
 
01:20:06.110 --> 01:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
basically grades four through six and I
 
01:20:09.169 --> 01:20:09.179 align:start position:0%
had about 450 kids in that school talk
 
01:20:11.870 --> 01:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
to the report cards and the average
 
01:20:14.990 --> 01:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
grade in the school was a minus
 
01:20:19.130 --> 01:20:19.140 align:start position:0%
I said this can't be and so when I had a
 
01:20:21.050 --> 01:20:21.060 align:start position:0%
teacher meeting I said that to the staff
 
01:20:23.030 --> 01:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
and I said what's going on here I said
 
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
well the parents are kind of expecting
 
01:20:27.110 --> 01:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
this and are you going to be there to
 
01:20:29.870 --> 01:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
support us when we give what I said yes
 
01:20:32.209 --> 01:20:32.219 align:start position:0%
you just send them to me we changed it
 
01:20:34.370 --> 01:20:34.380 align:start position:0%
so a CU as a c
 
01:20:37.790 --> 01:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
and by the end of the next year at the
 
01:20:39.590 --> 01:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
same time things have been corrected and
 
01:20:41.990 --> 01:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
and actually everybody's more pleased
 
01:20:45.530 --> 01:20:45.540 align:start position:0%
parent-wise knowing their child was here
 
01:20:48.950 --> 01:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't a false report so that I'm
 
01:20:50.270 --> 01:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
not saying that's characteristic of
 
01:20:52.189 --> 01:20:52.199 align:start position:0%
Education today everywhere but that
 
01:20:54.290 --> 01:20:54.300 align:start position:0%
occurred where I was
 
01:20:58.310 --> 01:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
so great inflation
 
01:21:00.410 --> 01:21:00.420 align:start position:0%
representative senator
 
01:21:03.890 --> 01:21:03.900 align:start position:0%
what I've heard many times is that to
 
01:21:06.590 --> 01:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
like math is
 
01:21:09.649 --> 01:21:09.659 align:start position:0%
it's a very esoteric kind of thing and
 
01:21:12.649 --> 01:21:12.659 align:start position:0%
only the very smartest can go with math
 
01:21:14.750 --> 01:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
and I think this particularly something
 
01:21:16.850 --> 01:21:16.860 align:start position:0%
that has been told to women oh you're
 
01:21:19.790 --> 01:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
not you know woman is not that that math
 
01:21:22.490 --> 01:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
is not for you it's for certain other
 
01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
kinds of people and I think
 
01:21:28.430 --> 01:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
teaching math has had that with it
 
01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
if you have an expectation that the kids
 
01:21:33.770 --> 01:21:33.780 align:start position:0%
are not going to understand it
 
01:21:35.810 --> 01:21:35.820 align:start position:0%
and they get that feeling they're not
 
01:21:37.669 --> 01:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
going to be totally excited about it I
 
01:21:40.130 --> 01:21:40.140 align:start position:0%
think Math is fun it's it could be done
 
01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
in so many different ways of seeing how
 
01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
math is in every single thing that you
 
01:21:48.709 --> 01:21:48.719 align:start position:0%
do you see math problems you don't think
 
01:21:51.110 --> 01:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
of it as a math problem but it is so you
 
01:21:52.729 --> 01:21:52.739 align:start position:0%
have to know a certain level of math in
 
01:21:54.410 --> 01:21:54.420 align:start position:0%
order to understand in order to function
 
01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
so I think math has had a bad rap and
 
01:22:00.110 --> 01:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see it promoted
 
01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:04.189 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see it promoted
foreign

01:22:04.189 --> 01:22:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:06.229 --> 01:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks I couldn't agree with
 
01:22:08.810 --> 01:22:08.820 align:start position:0%
Senator Ward more on on this
 
01:22:14.209 --> 01:22:14.219 align:start position:0%
um and I I had heard this at some ncsl
 
01:22:14.219 --> 01:22:15.050 align:start position:0%
um and I I had heard this at some ncsl
um

01:22:15.050 --> 01:22:15.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:18.169 --> 01:22:18.179 align:start position:0%
um uh work groups I I think I heard it
 
01:22:20.630 --> 01:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
when I was on the school board too
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
um that uh that that certain groups in
 
01:22:26.090 --> 01:22:26.100 align:start position:0%
our society were discouraged from from
 
01:22:29.570 --> 01:22:29.580 align:start position:0%
pursuing math it's not for you and and I
 
01:22:31.370 --> 01:22:31.380 align:start position:0%
think we see that in a lot of areas and
 
01:22:33.649 --> 01:22:33.659 align:start position:0%
it's and it's why it's so important to
 
01:22:36.649 --> 01:22:36.659 align:start position:0%
begin and address that and I I know this
 
01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
is a hot word but it's an equity issue
 
01:22:41.930 --> 01:22:41.940 align:start position:0%
and in with what with what Senator Ward
 
01:22:44.270 --> 01:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
was saying it was an equity issue for
 
01:22:46.610 --> 01:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
I'll use the word girls because we're
 
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
talking about you know
 
01:22:51.050 --> 01:22:51.060 align:start position:0%
um you know Elementary and and secondary
 
01:22:51.060 --> 01:22:52.430 align:start position:0%
um you know Elementary and and secondary
school

01:22:52.430 --> 01:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:22:56.750 --> 01:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
um and uh where where you know everybody
 
01:22:59.149 --> 01:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
is taking math and again I'm sort of
 
01:23:01.729 --> 01:23:01.739 align:start position:0%
looking at this figure four they're all
 
01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
taking everybody's taking math in third
 
01:23:05.270 --> 01:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
grade fourth grade fifth grade sixth
 
01:23:08.630 --> 01:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
grade and then you know something
 
01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:09.530 align:start position:0%
grade and then you know something
happens

01:23:09.530 --> 01:23:09.540 align:start position:0%
happens
 
01:23:14.510 --> 01:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
and um and and uh uh you know certain
 
01:23:17.510 --> 01:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
certain groups are discouraged from uh
 
01:23:19.450 --> 01:23:19.460 align:start position:0%
or encouraged to pursue something else
 
01:23:23.870 --> 01:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
and not math and um and then you wind up
 
01:23:25.370 --> 01:23:25.380 align:start position:0%
with the uh with the number at the
 
01:23:27.470 --> 01:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
bottom in grade 11
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
um which which I think reflects that
 
01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:30.649 align:start position:0%
um which which I think reflects that
that

01:23:30.649 --> 01:23:30.659 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:23:30.659 --> 01:23:32.149 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:23:32.149 --> 01:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know that shift and uh and I I think
 
01:23:40.310 --> 01:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
as a as a as a state and as a country uh
 
01:23:42.530 --> 01:23:42.540 align:start position:0%
you know we can do a lot better when it
 
01:23:45.169 --> 01:23:45.179 align:start position:0%
comes to making sure that uh that that
 
01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
that that all of our all of our students
 
01:23:50.450 --> 01:23:50.460 align:start position:0%
have um have you know strong
 
01:23:54.169 --> 01:23:54.179 align:start position:0%
opportunities to pursue and succeed in
 
01:23:56.689 --> 01:23:56.699 align:start position:0%
not just math but other you know areas
 
01:24:00.350 --> 01:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
too and um and uh anyway I'll I'll leave
 
01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
it at that but I think I thank Senator
 
01:24:05.530 --> 01:24:05.540 align:start position:0%
Ward for uh for raising this
 
01:24:08.570 --> 01:24:08.580 align:start position:0%
yeah I think Mr chair you've got your
 
01:24:08.580 --> 01:24:09.649 align:start position:0%
yeah I think Mr chair you've got your
answer

01:24:09.649 --> 01:24:09.659 align:start position:0%
answer
 
01:24:12.530 --> 01:24:12.540 align:start position:0%
we need to pursue this okay I I think we
 
01:24:14.930 --> 01:24:14.940 align:start position:0%
we will we will pursue it
 
01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:15.649 align:start position:0%
we will we will pursue it
um

01:24:15.649 --> 01:24:15.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:17.870 --> 01:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
talking to one of my grandkids who's a
 
01:24:20.090 --> 01:24:20.100 align:start position:0%
freshman in high school this year and he
 
01:24:21.709 --> 01:24:21.719 align:start position:0%
was saying I just don't want to be in
 
01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
that art class sign me up for a science
 
01:24:25.850 --> 01:24:25.860 align:start position:0%
or a math class he his brain it's
 
01:24:27.709 --> 01:24:27.719 align:start position:0%
there's brain research out there now
 
01:24:31.850 --> 01:24:31.860 align:start position:0%
that uh we need to be looking at uh he
 
01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
he was saying I can do well on that but
 
01:24:37.070 --> 01:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
I I don't get this other side and I have
 
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
another one that's up at St Lawrence
 
01:24:41.030 --> 01:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
University in the same domain it's his
 
01:24:44.270 --> 01:24:44.280 align:start position:0%
Forte is statistics and and all the
 
01:24:47.090 --> 01:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets and and business
 
01:24:49.250 --> 01:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
when it came to have to know something
 
01:24:51.290 --> 01:24:51.300 align:start position:0%
about the Sistine Chapel he didn't want
 
01:24:52.930 --> 01:24:52.940 align:start position:0%
to know a thing about it
 
01:24:55.910 --> 01:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately that's not kind of a
 
01:24:58.430 --> 01:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
narrow focus and I think some people are
 
01:25:01.790 --> 01:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
we we've got to recognize everybody has
 
01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
that ability it's just we got to connect
 
01:25:05.570 --> 01:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
with the right button there and we can't
 
01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
have the expectation that we had when my
 
01:25:09.830 --> 01:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
wife was going to college she was told
 
01:25:11.810 --> 01:25:11.820 align:start position:0%
by a father her father you can either
 
01:25:14.030 --> 01:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
become a nurse or you can go off and be
 
01:25:17.810 --> 01:25:17.820 align:start position:0%
a PE teacher her brother electrical
 
01:25:17.820 --> 01:25:19.189 align:start position:0%
a PE teacher her brother electrical
engineer

01:25:19.189 --> 01:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
engineer
 
01:25:21.169 --> 01:25:21.179 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:25:24.590 --> 01:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
Margaret wasn't given that option and I
 
01:25:26.390 --> 01:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
would say she's the gifted one in the
 
01:25:28.850 --> 01:25:28.860 align:start position:0%
family too and and certainly the best
 
01:25:31.850 --> 01:25:31.860 align:start position:0%
looking one but uh I
 
01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
I think that we got us you know
 
01:25:37.729 --> 01:25:37.739 align:start position:0%
I as a kid was fearful of certain things
 
01:25:41.630 --> 01:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
in school as element spelling I hated it
 
01:25:44.030 --> 01:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
and you know to the point where I got
 
01:25:46.250 --> 01:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
myself sick several times over having to
 
01:25:48.290 --> 01:25:48.300 align:start position:0%
be called on by the teacher
 
01:25:50.570 --> 01:25:50.580 align:start position:0%
and there are a lot of kids like that
 
01:25:54.850 --> 01:25:54.860 align:start position:0%
fear and and uh of making a mistake
 
01:25:57.649 --> 01:25:57.659 align:start position:0%
so so I think it's a lot to do with
 
01:25:59.810 --> 01:25:59.820 align:start position:0%
instruction too not just the curriculum
 
01:26:01.910 --> 01:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
side but the instruction side and the
 
01:26:05.090 --> 01:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
the nature of the individual and a lot
 
01:26:08.810 --> 01:26:08.820 align:start position:0%
of issues I I agree with both you on
 
01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:09.729 align:start position:0%
of issues I I agree with both you on
this

01:26:09.729 --> 01:26:09.739 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:26:11.930 --> 01:26:11.940 align:start position:0%
I actually think that has something to
 
01:26:13.930 --> 01:26:13.940 align:start position:0%
do with what you underlined on page 25
 
01:26:16.490 --> 01:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
connecting it to Extended Learning
 
01:26:19.370 --> 01:26:19.380 align:start position:0%
opportunities and your your great your
 
01:26:21.709 --> 01:26:21.719 align:start position:0%
grandson who wants art if you could
 
01:26:23.870 --> 01:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
realize how the art could be connected
 
01:26:26.810 --> 01:26:26.820 align:start position:0%
how Math Connects to Art it might make
 
01:26:28.850 --> 01:26:28.860 align:start position:0%
him want to learn it more because it
 
01:26:32.030 --> 01:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
does you know spatial relations and and
 
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
all that so that has something to do
 
01:26:36.709 --> 01:26:36.719 align:start position:0%
maybe that has something to do with how
 
01:26:38.990 --> 01:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
he'll learn it if if it can if he can
 
01:26:41.330 --> 01:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
realize that math does affect his art
 
01:26:43.910 --> 01:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
classes yeah I think is what we need to
 
01:26:45.649 --> 01:26:45.659 align:start position:0%
do we need to pursue this subject of
 
01:26:47.810 --> 01:26:47.820 align:start position:0%
mathematics and work with some Math
 
01:26:50.149 --> 01:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
teachers and and various organizations
 
01:26:52.490 --> 01:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
trying to get some reporting back to us
 
01:26:54.530 --> 01:26:54.540 align:start position:0%
to find out how can we as a legislature
 
01:26:56.570 --> 01:26:56.580 align:start position:0%
help out on this
 
01:26:56.580 --> 01:26:57.350 align:start position:0%
help out on this
um

01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:59.149 --> 01:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
and not pointing any fingers or anything
 
01:27:01.310 --> 01:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
like that but since we all recognize we
 
01:27:03.050 --> 01:27:03.060 align:start position:0%
are at a point where we've got to do
 
01:27:04.490 --> 01:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
something in the state
 
01:27:06.890 --> 01:27:06.900 align:start position:0%
and so I'd like to maybe use this group
 
01:27:09.470 --> 01:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
as a group where we can start chewing at
 
01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:10.370 align:start position:0%
as a group where we can start chewing at
it

01:27:10.370 --> 01:27:10.380 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:27:12.410 --> 01:27:12.420 align:start position:0%
any further Becky I see you have a
 
01:27:16.850 --> 01:27:16.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:20.810 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:27:20.810 --> 01:27:20.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:22.850 --> 01:27:22.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:27:26.510 --> 01:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
okay that I think takes us down to
 
01:27:28.250 --> 01:27:28.260 align:start position:0%
we've done pretty much everything on
 
01:27:30.890 --> 01:27:30.900 align:start position:0%
that docket today yeah I I just want to
 
01:27:33.050 --> 01:27:33.060 align:start position:0%
comment on particularly on the item five
 
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
dealing with the Ed 306. okay I was uh
 
01:27:40.729 --> 01:27:40.739 align:start position:0%
encouraged uh from Dr Green's uh
 
01:27:42.890 --> 01:27:42.900 align:start position:0%
comments on this has been a very
 
01:27:46.490 --> 01:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
controversial issue and there's been
 
01:27:49.370 --> 01:27:49.380 align:start position:0%
um all kinds of charges of
 
01:27:52.669 --> 01:27:52.679 align:start position:0%
um No Lack of transparency
 
01:27:55.790 --> 01:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
Etc but based upon Dr Green's comments
 
01:27:58.790 --> 01:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
this morning it appears that there is an
 
01:28:01.870 --> 01:28:01.880 align:start position:0%
attempt to expand the input for that
 
01:28:04.610 --> 01:28:04.620 align:start position:0%
which is all the
 
01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
um various stakeholder groups are asking
 
01:28:10.010 --> 01:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
for so it appears to me that prior to
 
01:28:12.709 --> 01:28:12.719 align:start position:0%
any kind of a final report going to the
 
01:28:15.530 --> 01:28:15.540 align:start position:0%
uh the State Board of Education that
 
01:28:18.350 --> 01:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
those not only the advocate groups being
 
01:28:21.169 --> 01:28:21.179 align:start position:0%
involved but also engaging Community
 
01:28:24.350 --> 01:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
groups in seeking input on that too so I
 
01:28:26.330 --> 01:28:26.340 align:start position:0%
was I was really pleased to hear that
 
01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
well I think that's not what I've been
 
01:28:29.570 --> 01:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
hearing I agree with you I think that
 
01:28:31.310 --> 01:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
there's got to be transparency there's
 
01:28:32.990 --> 01:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
got to be communication between all
 
01:28:34.910 --> 01:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
groups and when I see the word like
 
01:28:37.129 --> 01:28:37.139 align:start position:0%
competency and when I saw that initial
 
01:28:38.930 --> 01:28:38.940 align:start position:0%
report came out and that word was being
 
01:28:38.940 --> 01:28:40.750 align:start position:0%
report came out and that word was being
challenged

01:28:40.750 --> 01:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
challenged
 
01:28:43.490 --> 01:28:43.500 align:start position:0%
acknowledgment of something uh something
 
01:28:44.930 --> 01:28:44.940 align:start position:0%
such as that
 
01:28:44.940 --> 01:28:45.550 align:start position:0%
such as that
um

01:28:45.550 --> 01:28:45.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:49.129 --> 01:28:49.139 align:start position:0%
it that that's a lot of statutory
 
01:28:52.189 --> 01:28:52.199 align:start position:0%
changes that are going on here and and
 
01:28:54.410 --> 01:28:54.420 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of changes which are going to
 
01:28:56.570 --> 01:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
impact everything we do in education in
 
01:28:58.550 --> 01:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
the state if if we can make changes
 
01:28:59.870 --> 01:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
which are positive and going to result
 
01:29:01.910 --> 01:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
in the positive and I'm all for it but
 
01:29:04.910 --> 01:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
let's do it in uh that you know like 21
 
01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
incest where we have to do an open
 
01:29:10.790 --> 01:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
shared way working with all parties
 
01:29:13.370 --> 01:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
including students parents school board
 
01:29:15.590 --> 01:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
members teachers principals community
 
01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
community leaders all have to be
 
01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
involved with this
 
01:29:22.129 --> 01:29:22.139 align:start position:0%
um yes representative luno yeah thanks
 
01:29:24.410 --> 01:29:24.420 align:start position:0%
Rick I I completely agree with that and
 
01:29:28.310 --> 01:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
and what what what Mel just um just said
 
01:29:32.450 --> 01:29:32.460 align:start position:0%
um said as well uh that I think um Dr
 
01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
Green was uh was was very helpful in in
 
01:29:40.970 --> 01:29:40.980 align:start position:0%
saying that uh that the uh that draft uh
 
01:29:43.250 --> 01:29:43.260 align:start position:0%
set of rules would be available by the
 
01:29:44.810 --> 01:29:44.820 align:start position:0%
end of the week we can get that out and
 
01:29:47.209 --> 01:29:47.219 align:start position:0%
begin the the comment period but I think
 
01:29:50.149 --> 01:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
where I do have a concern and I I hope
 
01:29:52.370 --> 01:29:52.380 align:start position:0%
you know this would be shared with with
 
01:29:53.870 --> 01:29:53.880 align:start position:0%
the members in the committee as well
 
01:29:55.729 --> 01:29:55.739 align:start position:0%
that that
 
01:29:55.739 --> 01:29:56.750 align:start position:0%
that that
um

01:29:56.750 --> 01:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:59.390 --> 01:29:59.400 align:start position:0%
you know it's not going to be 45 days
 
01:30:02.270 --> 01:30:02.280 align:start position:0%
from Friday that um that the department
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
plans to take those Draft rules to the
 
01:30:07.669 --> 01:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education and I don't
 
01:30:10.310 --> 01:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
know how in 45 days they're going to be
 
01:30:12.830 --> 01:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
able to convene the um the public
 
01:30:15.050 --> 01:30:15.060 align:start position:0%
feedback groups
 
01:30:19.070 --> 01:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
um as well as as get feedback from from
 
01:30:22.490 --> 01:30:22.500 align:start position:0%
this committee uh relative to the um the
 
01:30:24.169 --> 01:30:24.179 align:start position:0%
Draft rules and then be able to
 
01:30:26.570 --> 01:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
incorporate that feedback and do all
 
01:30:29.390 --> 01:30:29.400 align:start position:0%
that and do all that in time to uh to
 
01:30:31.669 --> 01:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
present an early March to the uh to the
 
01:30:34.729 --> 01:30:34.739 align:start position:0%
state board so so you know I would I
 
01:30:36.950 --> 01:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
would you know respectfully suggest that
 
01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
maybe the department reconsider it's uh
 
01:30:42.830 --> 01:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
its time frame in in bringing these
 
01:30:47.330 --> 01:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
rules to um uh to the board to provide
 
01:30:50.390 --> 01:30:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh public stakeholders as well as this
 
01:30:53.870 --> 01:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
committee uh I think a reasonable amount
 
01:30:56.689 --> 01:30:56.699 align:start position:0%
of time uh obviously in consideration
 
01:30:59.149 --> 01:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
nation of you know we're we're not just
 
01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
all sitting on our hands waiting for
 
01:31:03.290 --> 01:31:03.300 align:start position:0%
this report to drop got a few other
 
01:31:05.810 --> 01:31:05.820 align:start position:0%
things to do right Rick yes we did and
 
01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:07.610 align:start position:0%
things to do right Rick yes we did and
uh

01:31:07.610 --> 01:31:07.620 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:31:09.050 --> 01:31:09.060 align:start position:0%
um you know before bringing it to the
 
01:31:11.629 --> 01:31:11.639 align:start position:0%
state board I I think that might be a
 
01:31:13.790 --> 01:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
reasonable request from from this
 
01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:15.169 align:start position:0%
reasonable request from from this
committee

01:31:15.169 --> 01:31:15.179 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:31:18.590 --> 01:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
I was very impressed with uh Nate green
 
01:31:21.649 --> 01:31:21.659 align:start position:0%
Dr Green I've met with him
 
01:31:24.290 --> 01:31:24.300 align:start position:0%
three times or so within the last month
 
01:31:27.950 --> 01:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
over there at doe he's very open wanting
 
01:31:31.010 --> 01:31:31.020 align:start position:0%
to work with us and he's underneath the
 
01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
auspices of Caitlyn Davis who expressed
 
01:31:38.390 --> 01:31:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:41.209 --> 01:31:41.219 align:start position:0%
I I I'm I'm just going to wait and see
 
01:31:42.770 --> 01:31:42.780 align:start position:0%
what kind of process they present I
 
01:31:44.570 --> 01:31:44.580 align:start position:0%
think they've gotten the message
 
01:31:47.090 --> 01:31:47.100 align:start position:0%
that we're going to have to all be part
 
01:31:49.970 --> 01:31:49.980 align:start position:0%
of this and uh nobody's going to take
 
01:31:52.189 --> 01:31:52.199 align:start position:0%
anything you know thrown at us it's got
 
01:31:56.450 --> 01:31:56.460 align:start position:0%
to be able to stick and and um so just
 
01:31:59.810 --> 01:31:59.820 align:start position:0%
because I I remain hopeful yeah just a
 
01:32:02.450 --> 01:32:02.460 align:start position:0%
couple of comments on the you mentioned
 
01:32:04.550 --> 01:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
earlier uh in your comments around
 
01:32:06.890 --> 01:32:06.900 align:start position:0%
students I do hope that they're seeking
 
01:32:09.410 --> 01:32:09.420 align:start position:0%
student input and the reason why I say
 
01:32:13.790 --> 01:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
that I think students bring to the table
 
01:32:16.250 --> 01:32:16.260 align:start position:0%
a much different perspective to their
 
01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
learning styles and needs than what we
 
01:32:21.229 --> 01:32:21.239 align:start position:0%
give them credit for
 
01:32:24.050 --> 01:32:24.060 align:start position:0%
um I if you look at the availability of
 
01:32:24.060 --> 01:32:25.430 align:start position:0%
um I if you look at the availability of
information

01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:32:29.209 --> 01:32:29.219 align:start position:0%
that that's there now
 
01:32:32.709 --> 01:32:32.719 align:start position:0%
they have that information they they
 
01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
have that information right here right
 
01:32:39.169 --> 01:32:39.179 align:start position:0%
and so the question is is how do you
 
01:32:41.629 --> 01:32:41.639 align:start position:0%
translate the information they can get
 
01:32:41.639 --> 01:32:42.830 align:start position:0%
translate the information they can get
here

01:32:42.830 --> 01:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:32:45.290 --> 01:32:45.300 align:start position:0%
versus a learning style
 
01:32:48.050 --> 01:32:48.060 align:start position:0%
within schools yeah and I think it's a
 
01:32:49.669 --> 01:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
heck of a challenge to try to do it so I
 
01:32:52.129 --> 01:32:52.139 align:start position:0%
hope that they will seek student input
 
01:32:53.450 --> 01:32:53.460 align:start position:0%
the other thing I think it's important
 
01:32:54.530 --> 01:32:54.540 align:start position:0%
to note too
 
01:32:56.149 --> 01:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
that any changes that come out of the
 
01:32:57.649 --> 01:32:57.659 align:start position:0%
State Board of Education has to come
 
01:33:00.169 --> 01:33:00.179 align:start position:0%
back to this committee
 
01:33:02.209 --> 01:33:02.219 align:start position:0%
the legislative oversight committee
 
01:33:04.189 --> 01:33:04.199 align:start position:0%
looks at all that stuff that's going to
 
01:33:06.050 --> 01:33:06.060 align:start position:0%
be dealt with at the State Board of
 
01:33:08.510 --> 01:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
Education so I think the issue of the
 
01:33:10.189 --> 01:33:10.199 align:start position:0%
inclusive approach
 
01:33:12.830 --> 01:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
to getting the data to getting the
 
01:33:14.629 --> 01:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
information there before it becomes
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
finalized before it goes before the
 
01:33:18.770 --> 01:33:18.780 align:start position:0%
rules committee and I think that's very
 
01:33:18.780 --> 01:33:19.850 align:start position:0%
rules committee and I think that's very
important

01:33:19.850 --> 01:33:19.860 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:33:22.010 --> 01:33:22.020 align:start position:0%
that that input is there before the
 
01:33:23.450 --> 01:33:23.460 align:start position:0%
rules committee because once it gets the
 
01:33:25.250 --> 01:33:25.260 align:start position:0%
rules committee it's awfully hard to
 
01:33:27.649 --> 01:33:27.659 align:start position:0%
change it's just not input from us it's
 
01:33:30.229 --> 01:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
our recommendation right exactly and so
 
01:33:32.930 --> 01:33:32.940 align:start position:0%
that that that's a real concern and I
 
01:33:34.610 --> 01:33:34.620 align:start position:0%
agree with you on that Junior High kids
 
01:33:36.490 --> 01:33:36.500 align:start position:0%
I I just have to get my junior high
 
01:33:38.990 --> 01:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
grandson down to help me pair this thing
 
01:33:40.970 --> 01:33:40.980 align:start position:0%
to my car
 
01:33:43.250 --> 01:33:43.260 align:start position:0%
um it's a new one and it's pairing to
 
01:33:45.169 --> 01:33:45.179 align:start position:0%
the old one and I sit there just
 
01:33:46.669 --> 01:33:46.679 align:start position:0%
frustrated coming down the highway
 
01:33:49.370 --> 01:33:49.380 align:start position:0%
wanting to talk somebody and
 
01:33:51.110 --> 01:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
can't do it
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
so that younger generation is a good
 
01:33:55.310 --> 01:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
generation but I'd also talk to the kids
 
01:33:56.570 --> 01:33:56.580 align:start position:0%
that are in the community college system
 
01:33:58.729 --> 01:33:58.739 align:start position:0%
and and and those have just recently
 
01:34:00.470 --> 01:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
graduated find out what was their
 
01:34:02.090 --> 01:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
experience like while they were in the
 
01:34:04.610 --> 01:34:04.620 align:start position:0%
grade school through the 12th grade in
 
01:34:06.890 --> 01:34:06.900 align:start position:0%
terms of mathematics and that feedback's
 
01:34:09.530 --> 01:34:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:11.209 --> 01:34:11.219 align:start position:0%
anything further today I know that
 
01:34:12.890 --> 01:34:12.900 align:start position:0%
Senator ward has to get out of here she
 
01:34:15.229 --> 01:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
has another meeting coming up
 
01:34:15.239 --> 01:34:17.830 align:start position:0%
has another meeting coming up
um

01:34:17.830 --> 01:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:20.570 --> 01:34:20.580 align:start position:0%
is there any comments from the public
 
01:34:22.729 --> 01:34:22.739 align:start position:0%
yeah we're I'm open to that
 
01:34:24.110 --> 01:34:24.120 align:start position:0%
um we're going to adjourn here in a
 
01:34:26.629 --> 01:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
minute but if they're what we're seeing
 
01:34:28.550 --> 01:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
now is that we want to get a hold of the
 
01:34:30.709 --> 01:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
cohort information we want to get the at
 
01:34:32.689 --> 01:34:32.699 align:start position:0%
the the report that's coming back from
 
01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
the contracted service for looking at
 
01:34:37.129 --> 01:34:37.139 align:start position:0%
our assessment tests in terms of
 
01:34:39.169 --> 01:34:39.179 align:start position:0%
improvement and following individual
 
01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
classes all the way through we're
 
01:34:43.010 --> 01:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
interested in looking at this this very
 
01:34:45.229 --> 01:34:45.239 align:start position:0%
much in the area of social studies and
 
01:34:46.850 --> 01:34:46.860 align:start position:0%
finding out what's going on at the local
 
01:34:49.250 --> 01:34:49.260 align:start position:0%
level and we're also wanting to delve
 
01:34:52.189 --> 01:34:52.199 align:start position:0%
into the area of mathematics and and
 
01:34:55.370 --> 01:34:55.380 align:start position:0%
maybe using this math task force Report
 
01:34:56.990 --> 01:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
with some of those wonderful
 
01:34:58.970 --> 01:34:58.980 align:start position:0%
recommendations over 20 some odd
 
01:35:01.250 --> 01:35:01.260 align:start position:0%
recommendations in that I don't think we
 
01:35:02.930 --> 01:35:02.940 align:start position:0%
should leave it alone even though
 
01:35:05.149 --> 01:35:05.159 align:start position:0%
there's a lot new research out there
 
01:35:06.950 --> 01:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
there's good stuff there for us to look
 
01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:07.669 align:start position:0%
there's good stuff there for us to look
at

01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:35:10.010 --> 01:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
so those are the three takeaways I can
 
01:35:12.169 --> 01:35:12.179 align:start position:0%
take from this weaning right now and
 
01:35:14.570 --> 01:35:14.580 align:start position:0%
also waiting for that big report to come
 
01:35:16.910 --> 01:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
in that we're all waiting for in terms
 
01:35:19.310 --> 01:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
of the the normal standards for public
 
01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
school approval that's very important
 
01:35:27.649 --> 01:35:27.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:29.689 --> 01:35:29.699 align:start position:0%
not seeing any hands flying everybody
 
01:35:31.850 --> 01:35:31.860 align:start position:0%
wants lunch thank you very much all for
 
01:35:33.649 --> 01:35:33.659 align:start position:0%
attending today and the next meeting
 
01:35:36.110 --> 01:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
will be we'll call the chair
 
01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:38.030 align:start position:0%

okay

01:35:38.030 --> 01:35:38.040 align:start position:0%

well
 
01:35:41.689 --> 01:35:41.699 align:start position:0%
if we do it it's going to have to be on
 
01:35:43.850 --> 01:35:43.860 align:start position:0%
like um let's see today's a Tuesday
 
01:35:43.860 --> 01:35:46.850 align:start position:0%
like um let's see today's a Tuesday
right

01:35:46.850 --> 01:35:46.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:48.890 --> 01:35:48.900 align:start position:0%
right oh that's right so we'd have to be
 
01:35:50.450 --> 01:35:50.460 align:start position:0%
after okay we'd have to talk to those
 
01:35:51.590 --> 01:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
folks too
 
01:35:53.570 --> 01:35:53.580 align:start position:0%
um I I think it'd be great for us to
 
01:35:55.850 --> 01:35:55.860 align:start position:0%
have uh if we can get a regular schedule
 
01:35:55.860 --> 01:35:57.410 align:start position:0%
have uh if we can get a regular schedule
going

01:35:57.410 --> 01:35:57.420 align:start position:0%
going
 
01:35:59.629 --> 01:35:59.639 align:start position:0%
um I'll I'll talk with everybody here on
 
01:36:01.970 --> 01:36:01.980 align:start position:0%
the web and find out what days are good
 
01:36:06.530 --> 01:36:06.540 align:start position:0%
um we know that we saw at least 16 bills
 
01:36:09.229 --> 01:36:09.239 align:start position:0%
of which have been withdrawn lsrs for
 
01:36:11.450 --> 01:36:11.460 align:start position:0%
this committee so we may be down to
 
01:36:13.250 --> 01:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
around 100 now
 
01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
and and that's still overload uh and so
 
01:36:19.010 --> 01:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have to and I I gotta find
 
01:36:20.390 --> 01:36:20.400 align:start position:0%
out which ones have physical notes
 
01:36:21.410 --> 01:36:21.420 align:start position:0%
because they're going to be the first
 
01:36:23.149 --> 01:36:23.159 align:start position:0%
ones out and that's going to take some
 
01:36:26.330 --> 01:36:26.340 align:start position:0%
time hearing and executing sessions so
 
01:36:28.010 --> 01:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
I'm going to try and stay away from
 
01:36:29.629 --> 01:36:29.639 align:start position:0%
Mondays like I told the community so
 
01:36:31.370 --> 01:36:31.380 align:start position:0%
people have doctor's appointments Etc
 
01:36:33.290 --> 01:36:33.300 align:start position:0%
you can do that
 
01:36:35.270 --> 01:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
um what day does the education committee
 
01:36:37.490 --> 01:36:37.500 align:start position:0%
meet Senator Ward Tuesday Morning
 
01:36:39.709 --> 01:36:39.719 align:start position:0%
Tuesday morning so
 
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
there's there's another time too that as
 
01:36:44.149 --> 01:36:44.159 align:start position:0%
bills start leaving here and Bill's
 
01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:46.560 align:start position:0%

01:36:47.570 --> 01:36:47.580 align:start position:0%
same time
 
01:36:50.750 --> 01:36:50.760 align:start position:0%

01:36:56.030 --> 01:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
find a day so yes I I don't want this to
 
01:36:57.350 --> 01:36:57.360 align:start position:0%
SL you know they say we should be
 
01:36:58.910 --> 01:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
meeting at least quarterly I think we
 
01:37:00.770 --> 01:37:00.780 align:start position:0%
need to meet more than quarterly I think
 
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
we need to be meeting and getting on
 
01:37:05.030 --> 01:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
these topics here and not let them hang
 
01:37:08.090 --> 01:37:08.100 align:start position:0%
and then disappear when we disappear
 
01:37:09.950 --> 01:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
stay on it
 
01:37:11.750 --> 01:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
any further
 
01:37:15.169 --> 01:37:15.179 align:start position:0%
