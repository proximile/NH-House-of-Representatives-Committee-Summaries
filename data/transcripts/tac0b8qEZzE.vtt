Pledge of Allegiance if you would if you
 
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 align:start position:0%

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 align:start position:0%
and I pledge allegiance to the flag of
 
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 align:start position:0%
the United States of America and to the
 
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
Republic for which it stands one nation
 
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
of God indivisible with liberty and
 
00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 align:start position:0%
all okay welcome to state federal and
 
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
Veterans uh we have three bills
 
00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 align:start position:0%
scheduled for this morning um I will
 
00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:30.079 align:start position:0%
tell you that the third one uh the
 
00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
sponsors asked if we could recess it and
 
00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 align:start position:0%
uh reschedule until next week which we
 
00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 align:start position:0%
will do so that leaves us with two bills
 
00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
this morning starting at 9:15 9:16 with
 
00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 align:start position:0%
uh HP
 
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 align:start position:0%
1156 uh and we'll go to that in just a
 
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 align:start position:0%
moment um so I do want to say that
 
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 align:start position:0%
unlike some our previous couple uh
 
00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 align:start position:0%
hearings where we had ended up with a
 
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 align:start position:0%
lot of folks who wanted to testify and
 
00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
we did have to uh try to limit the time
 
00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 align:start position:0%
on testimony not a problem today um so
 
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh we have a good number of cards for
 
00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
this first measure uh so some of you
 
00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 align:start position:0%
have asked for one or two minutes up to
 
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
10 minutes uh uh so don't feel any
 
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
constraints you have plenty of time to
 
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 align:start position:0%
fully uh make your case or or say what
 
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
you like us to hear also want to
 
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
apologize we have a lot of folks missing
 
00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
today for different reasons usually uh
 
00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 align:start position:0%
we like to have most everybody here for
 
00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
these hearings um but we have some uh
 
00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
scheduling conflicts etc etc so uh we
 
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
will have an executive session this
 
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 align:start position:0%
afternoon with uh with subs and we'll
 
00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
have a full house then okay uh to start
 
00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
off today with uh HB 1156 relative to
 
00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:49.159 align:start position:0%
public health safety and state
 
00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:52.159 align:start position:0%
sovereignty uh Prime sponsor is here
 
00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 align:start position:0%
representative Granger welcome back uh
 
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me I've been
 
00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 align:start position:0%
considering getting a tent and just
 
00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 align:start position:0%
parking it in the back considering how
 
00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 align:start position:0%
often I'm in front of this committee
 
00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
hopefully I don't wear out my welcome
 
00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
committee so so this is a nullification
 
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
Bill and uh what that means is that it
 
00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
utilizes the 10th Amendment of the US
 
00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 align:start position:0%
Constitution uh to deny State resources
 
00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
to Federal Pro uh programs um you you
 
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
might have if you're in this committee
 
00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 align:start position:0%
I'm guessing you probably ran across it
 
00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 align:start position:0%
before but just in case you know this
 
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
isn't unprecedented this is uh held up
 
00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
to Supreme Court scrutiny multiple times
 
00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 align:start position:0%
uh the standard example of nullification
 
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
is when uh States refuse to Force the
 
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
Fugitive Slave Act uh this was tested in
 
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 align:start position:0%
PR versus Pennsylvania and since that
 
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
case the general principle that the
 
00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
federal government can't Commander State
 
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 align:start position:0%
resources this is now called the uh
 
00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
anti-commandeering Doctrine and this is
 
00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:44.599 align:start position:0%
how various states legalize marijuana
 
00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
and we've done it a couple times in this
 
00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
state in other committees and uh you but
 
00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
nothing of nothing in regards to
 
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
specifically the
 
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
CDC um so what this bill does is it
 
00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
prevents the state and municipalities
 
00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
from enforcing the edicts of the CDC or
 
00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 align:start position:0%
the world World Health
 
00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 align:start position:0%
Organization so the CDC is part of the
 
00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 align:start position:0%
US federal government the World Health
 
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
Organization is part of the United
 
00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 align:start position:0%
Nations and I don't believe that the
 
00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire should be uh
 
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
doing any of their work for them
 
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 align:start position:0%
especially considering uh the heinous
 
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
displays we've seen over the last
 
00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
several years
 
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 align:start position:0%
um so um with with that I would if I
 
00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 align:start position:0%
would take any questions about the
 
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
legality of the bill as other people
 
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
here including Dr cat who came from a
 
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 align:start position:0%
very long way um will be able to cover
 
00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
the specifics of why it's important to
 
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 align:start position:0%
do this for the CDC and the World Health
 
00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 align:start position:0%
Organization in particular I'm open to
 
00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative so
 
00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask right up front uh is
 
00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
this largely inspired by the covid
 
00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 align:start position:0%
epidemic or the co pandemic and
 
00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 align:start position:0%
everything or or there was went with
 
00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
that yes but there's other factors in
 
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 align:start position:0%
involved as well so uh they they're not
 
00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 align:start position:0%
just incompetent when it came to the
 
00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 align:start position:0%
Corona virus they also uh so for
 
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 align:start position:0%
instance if you go to the CDC website
 
00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
and you look up the zika virus they say
 
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
that any place that is purple on their
 
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 align:start position:0%
map uh married couples should engage in
 
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
uh in in marital processes with um with
 
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 align:start position:0%
prophylactics and um part of the area
 
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
that's purple is the entirety of the
 
00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199 align:start position:0%
continental United States uh just as an
 
00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:26.039 align:start position:0%
example uh they they do all sorts of
 
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 align:start position:0%
crazy stuff that other people are going
 
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 align:start position:0%
to be able to talk about but the prime
 
00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
motivator is in fact their response to
 
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 align:start position:0%
the Corona
 
00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 align:start position:0%
virus okay so a question uh along those
 
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 align:start position:0%
lines during the uh pandemic there were
 
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
mask mandates uh uh all over the place
 
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 align:start position:0%
um some schools had them businesses had
 
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
them the state had them for a while if
 
00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:50.759 align:start position:0%
you recollect in
 
00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
2020 uh it was uh you know under the
 
00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
emergency powers that the governor had
 
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
um at that time time there were these
 
00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
mask mandates that were in place so uh
 
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
let me ask you about the mask mandate
 
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
piece of it I know a lot of folks had
 
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
heartburn with that in 2020 2021
 
00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
um with the with
 
00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:20.319 align:start position:0%
this with this measure um would that
 
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
impact uh local mask mandates uh I know
 
00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
there's a difference between like a
 
00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:29.639 align:start position:0%
municipality wanting to have a mask
 
00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:31.160 align:start position:0%
dayses let me ask you specifically I
 
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 align:start position:0%
live in Lowden so if Lowden had a uh
 
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
selectman's meeting and Lowden wanted to
 
00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 align:start position:0%
have a mask mandate that required
 
00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:43.759 align:start position:0%
everyone to wear a mask or or school
 
00:06:46.309 --> 00:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
board meeting uh which happened we had
 
00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:48.039 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard meetings and everybody had
 
00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:49.720 align:start position:0%
to wear mask to go to the school board
 
00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard meeting so what do you
 
00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
envision this measure would would this
 
00:06:57.909 --> 00:06:57.919 align:start position:0%
have impact on local control in terms of
 
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities having mask
 
00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:02.919 align:start position:0%
mandates I believe I could I believe
 
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
that that sort of uh ma local mask
 
00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:08.759 align:start position:0%
mandate is covered by other parts of law
 
00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:10.919 align:start position:0%
um that being said I believe the heart
 
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
of your question is whether or not
 
00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:13.639 align:start position:0%
they'll just be straight banned from
 
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
doing it because the CDC says it's not a
 
00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
good idea is that is that
 
00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:21.039 align:start position:0%
correct sure the C CDC is a federal
 
00:07:24.869 --> 00:07:24.879 align:start position:0%
operation correct yes so if the
 
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
CDC I think they recommend I don't know
 
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
that the CDC can mandate if the CDC
 
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
recommends masks and a school board
 
00:07:37.869 --> 00:07:37.879 align:start position:0%
meeting or selectman meeting uh requires
 
00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
people to wear masks to attend a public
 
00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
Municipal meeting citing the
 
00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:44.869 align:start position:0%
Municipal meeting citing the
CDC

00:07:44.869 --> 00:07:44.879 align:start position:0%
CDC
 
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
guidance um would this measure which is
 
00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:53.800 align:start position:0%
U relative to public health and safety
 
00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.710 align:start position:0%
U relative to public health and safety
um

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:55.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
so in the analysis line says this the
 
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
this bill it's a bill provides that the
 
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh Center for Disease Control of the CDC
 
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
shall have no jurisdiction in New
 
00:08:12.189 --> 00:08:12.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so my my question is I don't
 
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
know that they necessarily had
 
00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction anyway I think they they
 
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:22.280 align:start position:0%
they were a not a statutory body they
 
00:08:26.029 --> 00:08:26.039 align:start position:0%
weren't Congress so if if the CDC made
 
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
ma recommended mask
 
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:29.800 align:start position:0%
mandates then
 
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
the local
 
00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:35.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities given this HB that we
 
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
we're looking at is we're looking at
 
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
here the local municipalities could cite
 
00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:40.120 align:start position:0%
this where this to move forward they
 
00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:44.440 align:start position:0%
could cite this and say uh CDC we don't
 
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
want to wear masks and we're not going
 
00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
to wear them is is that kind of what
 
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
this is about so so when you said that
 
00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:54.440 align:start position:0%
they cite the CDC as the source of the
 
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
mass mandate that would be where I
 
00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
believe it would would cross if this
 
00:09:01.069 --> 00:09:01.079 align:start position:0%
build would become law so if a local
 
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:03.720 align:start position:0%
municipality doesn't justify their Mass
 
00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:05.720 align:start position:0%
mandate with the CDC I would still
 
00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
oppose the mass mandate um but I do not
 
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:09.240 align:start position:0%
believe that this would prevent them
 
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
from enfor from making their own Mass
 
00:09:11.910 --> 00:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
mandates they just wouldn't be able to
 
00:09:15.069 --> 00:09:15.079 align:start position:0%
use the CDC as a justification for it so
 
00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:19.160 align:start position:0%
if a if a Municipality of some sort um
 
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
did not want say say the next pandemic
 
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
or whatever uh if a municipality did not
 
00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
want to have a mask mandate they could
 
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
cite this this measure this HB this law
 
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
If It moveed Forward they could cite
 
00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:36.200 align:start position:0%
this and say uh yeah the the CDC wanted
 
00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:38.600 align:start position:0%
us to wear mask but because of this
 
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
legislation uh we're not going to is
 
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:44.440 align:start position:0%
that fair to fair to look at it that way
 
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:46.360 align:start position:0%
uh right they wouldn't have uh the CDC
 
00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have uh with this bill in
 
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
effect they wouldn't have any excuse to
 
00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
think that the CDC has legal authority
 
00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
to command them to have a mass mandate
 
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
or anything of that sort okay uh
 
00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:00.959 align:start position:0%
followup um how about Manchester Airport
 
00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh with Airlines had uh mask mandates uh
 
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
nationally would this a bus terminal or
 
00:10:13.069 --> 00:10:13.079 align:start position:0%
an airport you know if a transportation
 
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:15.720 align:start position:0%
company or an airline had mask mandates
 
00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:20.120 align:start position:0%
uh would this have any impact on that I
 
00:10:23.069 --> 00:10:23.079 align:start position:0%
uh I don't want to mislead you and so
 
00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:25.720 align:start position:0%
I'll preface this with I'm not 100% sure
 
00:10:28.069 --> 00:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
I do not believe so because I believe
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
that the airports are private however I
 
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
don't know if they're totally private um
 
00:10:35.389 --> 00:10:35.399 align:start position:0%
if I I don't believe it does however I
 
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
could be mistaken about
 
00:10:39.069 --> 00:10:39.079 align:start position:0%
that okay thank you representative I
 
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
know I've been kind of peppering you a
 
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:43.240 align:start position:0%
little bit uh questions representative
 
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
gagy thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:48.959 align:start position:0%
taking my question let's say this bill
 
00:10:52.269 --> 00:10:52.279 align:start position:0%
would pass who would be in overall
 
00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:56.680 align:start position:0%
control of of deciding uh Statewide
 
00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
would be in in the state itself and not
 
00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
not be influenced by The Who or the CDC
 
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
who would make the determinations that
 
00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:11.480 align:start position:0%
somebody should wear a mask or you could
 
00:11:15.269 --> 00:11:15.279 align:start position:0%
you you should get u a vaccine if we I'm
 
00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:17.720 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm talking pandemic here I'm not
 
00:11:19.629 --> 00:11:19.639 align:start position:0%
talking normal
 
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
stuff it would be the legislature or
 
00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.949 align:start position:0%
stuff it would be the legislature or
elected

00:11:24.949 --> 00:11:24.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
officials so it would be Statewide but
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
what if a city that thank you for a
 
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
followup Mr chairman so what if a city
 
00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
or several townships decides we're not
 
00:11:36.829 --> 00:11:36.839 align:start position:0%
going to have a mask I live in
 
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
Manchester okay and they say well you're
 
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
going to have to wear a mask but if I go
 
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
to nashille I don't have to wear a mask
 
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
so it would be would it not be a
 
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
hodgepodge of wherever you're living is
 
00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
you decide so if you if you can't if you
 
00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
don't have to wear a mask in one town
 
00:11:54.269 --> 00:11:54.279 align:start position:0%
and you go to another town to shop or
 
00:11:56.030 --> 00:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
something would you have to wear a mask
 
00:11:59.069 --> 00:11:59.079 align:start position:0%
if that municipality decides that yes
 
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
they will enforce whatever well I'd
 
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
prefer they just didn't make such uh
 
00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:07.560 align:start position:0%
edicts in the first place uh but I would
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
consider that beyond the scope I I don't
 
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
think that local municipalities should
 
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
have ever enforced a mask mandate for
 
00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:15.800 align:start position:0%
instance um if if they do that and then
 
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
people decide that they don't like
 
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:19.240 align:start position:0%
visiting that town and I guess that's on
 
00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:22.120 align:start position:0%
them and their Selectmen or their uh
 
00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
local legislative body however they run
 
00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
it depending on if it's an fp2 or
 
00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
whatever one more comment sure chairman
 
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
this to me would would be like a
 
00:12:35.389 --> 00:12:35.399 align:start position:0%
hodgepodge it's it's like you go here
 
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
and you got to do this you go there you
 
00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:39.560 align:start position:0%
don't have to do
 
00:12:42.509 --> 00:12:42.519 align:start position:0%
that it would be a mowe
 
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
so if this were to pass I my personal
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
opinion would you believe would be that
 
00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
it should be like a Statewide decision
 
00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
to whether uh plan A would be instituted
 
00:12:58.829 --> 00:12:58.839 align:start position:0%
or plan b or whatever would you agree
 
00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
age with
 
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
that I don't have the text of the bill
 
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
or references to the bill I believe
 
00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:08.440 align:start position:0%
there was a separate bill specifically
 
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
addressing local mask mandates and I
 
00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
believe the intent of the bill and I
 
00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:15.800 align:start position:0%
could be misremembering was to prevent
 
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
them from instituting local mask
 
00:13:19.829 --> 00:13:19.839 align:start position:0%
mandates um I would have supported that
 
00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
bill um if if you know but uh I think
 
00:13:25.829 --> 00:13:25.839 align:start position:0%
that would Sol if if that were to pass
 
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
and that's not in this legislation if
 
00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
that were to pass that I believe that
 
00:13:31.509 --> 00:13:31.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
filat thank you Mr chair and uh thank
 
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
you prime sponsor uh some there may be
 
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
multiple questions related to this if
 
00:13:44.949 --> 00:13:44.959 align:start position:0%
you would indulge me uh sometimes a bill
 
00:13:47.069 --> 00:13:47.079 align:start position:0%
or a proposal can have unintended uh
 
00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:50.040 align:start position:0%
flow on effects uh and here the
 
00:13:51.949 --> 00:13:51.959 align:start position:0%
suggestion is that the state and its
 
00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:53.560 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions including but
 
00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:55.160 align:start position:0%
unlimited to counties cities towns
 
00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:57.720 align:start position:0%
precincts water districts Etc shall not
 
00:13:59.350 --> 00:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
engage in the enforcement of of any or
 
00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:01.480 align:start position:0%
any collaboration with the enforcement
 
00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:03.320 align:start position:0%
of any requirements mandates
 
00:14:05.389 --> 00:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
recommendations instructions or guidance
 
00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:07.600 align:start position:0%
provided by either organization
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
referencing uh the CDC or the who now it
 
00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:12.959 align:start position:0%
seems as though much of the discussion
 
00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:15.279 align:start position:0%
here has censored on uh mask mandates
 
00:14:17.629 --> 00:14:17.639 align:start position:0%
and covid which seems a natural flow on
 
00:14:19.389 --> 00:14:19.399 align:start position:0%
from what we've just all experienced
 
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:21.560 align:start position:0%
over the last four years which is
 
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
incredible that we've all now been doing
 
00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:25.880 align:start position:0%
this for four years but the World Health
 
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
Organization does more than Co and mask
 
00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:32.600 align:start position:0%
Ates for example would this uh proposal
 
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
now say that the state would no longer
 
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
be able to discuss or recommend or
 
00:14:39.829 --> 00:14:39.839 align:start position:0%
recommend the world Heth the World
 
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
Health organization's recommendation
 
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
that individuals with HIV or at risk of
 
00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:47.560 align:start position:0%
hvv engage in testing
 
00:14:49.629 --> 00:14:49.639 align:start position:0%
regularly they wouldn't be able to site
 
00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
The Who as a source um if they want to
 
00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:55.160 align:start position:0%
recommend that on their own without you
 
00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:57.839 align:start position:0%
citing the wh then I believe that would
 
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
be fine with the language that's in the
 
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
bill now to with respect though they
 
00:15:03.749 --> 00:15:03.759 align:start position:0%
would also not be able to rec to use the
 
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
CDC as the the source for that which
 
00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:08.240 align:start position:0%
would now be the two prime organizations
 
00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
in the world as the source for it uh so
 
00:15:14.269 --> 00:15:14.279 align:start position:0%
where would the recommendation for this
 
00:15:16.590 --> 00:15:16.600 align:start position:0%
coming from and this is just one example
 
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
basically every STI every major
 
00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
communicable disease every uh disability
 
00:15:26.829 --> 00:15:26.839 align:start position:0%
one can think of there are
 
00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:28.120 align:start position:0%
recommendations coming from these
 
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
organizations on and now these are
 
00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:40.949 align:start position:0%
organizations on and now these are
unable

00:15:40.949 --> 00:15:40.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:43.470 --> 00:15:43.480 align:start position:0%
correct representative Massa you're
 
00:15:46.309 --> 00:15:46.319 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question how
 
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
would this be enforced and who would be
 
00:15:55.389 --> 00:15:55.399 align:start position:0%
responsible it would uh basically be up
 
00:15:58.430 --> 00:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
up to the citizenry to enforce it and uh
 
00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
it would probably be handled um in the
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:37.069 align:start position:0%
 
courts

00:16:37.069 --> 00:16:37.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:39.069 --> 00:16:39.079 align:start position:0%
people seem to think they
 
00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
do and and and the reason that's
 
00:16:44.949 --> 00:16:44.959 align:start position:0%
important is uh because uh a lot of
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
towns and municipalities were citing The
 
00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:49.720 align:start position:0%
Who and the CDC as the source or the
 
00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:51.160 align:start position:0%
authority and said well we have to the
 
00:16:54.269 --> 00:16:54.279 align:start position:0%
CDC said so and um whether they actually
 
00:16:55.749 --> 00:16:55.759 align:start position:0%
do or not and whether that holds up to
 
00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
Legal scrutiny if this is in law they
 
00:17:25.949 --> 00:17:25.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
anymore I I understand your uh
 
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
the there are doctors and experts and
 
00:17:37.950 --> 00:17:37.960 align:start position:0%
all that in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
that can have influence on legislator
 
00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:41.870 align:start position:0%
that can have influence on legislator
and

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
legislators uh therefore I do not
 
00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:46.360 align:start position:0%
believe that it is taking it away from
 
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
doctors um I believe it is taking away
 
00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
from one or two specific groups of
 
00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
Highly incompetent doctors and then
 
00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:54.280 align:start position:0%
putting it in legislators because when
 
00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:56.600 align:start position:0%
it comes to the medical profession and
 
00:17:59.310 --> 00:17:59.320 align:start position:0%
any any hypers specialization
 
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:01.480 align:start position:0%
you need a you need a sanity check
 
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
occasionally with people who are not in
 
00:18:04.789 --> 00:18:04.799 align:start position:0%
there just to make sure that they're not
 
00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
just getting caught up in the weeds and
 
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
I believe that's a large part of what we
 
00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
saw during the coron virus response was
 
00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
people who were very well intentioned
 
00:18:14.549 --> 00:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
but they went down a rabbit hole and
 
00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
hyperfocused on their on their one area
 
00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
of study to the detriment of everything
 
00:18:21.149 --> 00:18:21.159 align:start position:0%
else and this happens somewhat
 
00:18:22.909 --> 00:18:22.919 align:start position:0%
frequently so for instance in the Opium
 
00:18:26.549 --> 00:18:26.559 align:start position:0%
epidemic uh we we saw all these doctors
 
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
openly declaring that pain is a Vital
 
00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
sign and uh then we had a crazy op they
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
were started prescribing Opus like crazy
 
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
but if we had like elected legislators
 
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
overseeing that then it's a good check
 
00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:44.360 align:start position:0%
and that's why the DHHS is responsible
 
00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
or is overseen by the legislature and uh
 
00:18:49.029 --> 00:18:49.039 align:start position:0%
you know there's a lot of Highly
 
00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
competent medical professionals in there
 
00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
um I believe that history has shown that
 
00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
the CDC and the who are not competent we
 
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
it's okay okay you're up thank you Mr
 
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for taking my question
 
00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't this make it very confusing for
 
00:19:15.549 --> 00:19:15.559 align:start position:0%
the public as to whom to listen
 
00:19:18.909 --> 00:19:18.919 align:start position:0%
to the bill does not require the public
 
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
to stop listening to the
 
00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
CDC um it just means that uh the state
 
00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
and political subdivisions don't listen
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:59.430 --> 00:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
confusing oh hey mine's
 
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
a very real question that I just
 
00:20:03.270 --> 00:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
actually thought of which I don't have
 
00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
an answer to to what extent does this uh
 
00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
proposal conflict with the First
 
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
Amendment and the right of legislators
 
00:20:11.789 --> 00:20:11.799 align:start position:0%
to be able to consider what information
 
00:20:13.990 --> 00:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
they please while they are considering
 
00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
legislation Mr Prime sponsor I do not
 
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
believe uh that it uh conflicts um but
 
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh you have the right to disagree with
 
00:20:24.149 --> 00:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
me um I I don't think it I don't think
 
00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:29.909 --> 00:20:29.919 align:start position:0%
issue other questions
 
00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:31.799 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Granger thank
 
00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:33.320 align:start position:0%
you very much okay moving right to
 
00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
representative Manion me member of this
 
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.070 align:start position:0%
representative Manion me member of this
committee

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
uh welcome representative Manion
 
00:20:44.149 --> 00:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
speaking for the
 
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chair members of the
 
00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Tom
 
00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
Manion representing Hillsboro one the
 
00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
town of pelum uh so uh despite my
 
00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
dislike of most federal agencies if you
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
were to ask me in 2019 Tom surely
 
00:20:59.830 --> 00:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
there's some Bureau that's wholly good
 
00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:01.640 align:start position:0%
not captured by political interests I
 
00:21:03.909 --> 00:21:03.919 align:start position:0%
would have said sure probably the CDC we
 
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
can keep that one uh fast forward to
 
00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
February 12th 2021 the CDC released
 
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
guidance for the return in-person
 
00:21:12.669 --> 00:21:12.679 align:start position:0%
instruction for schools that included
 
00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
massive carve outs allowing for
 
00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
administrators to use any number of
 
00:21:18.149 --> 00:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
excuses to continue the damaging remote
 
00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.559 align:start position:0%
learning status quo this was running
 
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
counter to widely accepted worldwide
 
00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:25.039 align:start position:0%
data that showed virtually zero risk to
 
00:21:28.149 --> 00:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
of the virus to Children it was after
 
00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
several school systems this was after
 
00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:32.200 align:start position:0%
several school systems dumps tens of
 
00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars upgrading HVAC
 
00:21:36.789 --> 00:21:36.799 align:start position:0%
systems in the FDA Fast Track teachers
 
00:21:38.669 --> 00:21:38.679 align:start position:0%
to the top of the vaccine release
 
00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
schedule so the question is why would
 
00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
the CDC an organization that is claiming
 
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
Authority on the science ignore the
 
00:21:47.269 --> 00:21:47.279 align:start position:0%
multitude of unrefuted studies that
 
00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:49.919 align:start position:0%
showed the near zero risk to Children
 
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
enter a freedom of information request
 
00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
uh that showed email change between CDC
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
director Dr relle wilinsky and the
 
00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
American Federation of teach teachers
 
00:22:01.269 --> 00:22:01.279 align:start position:0%
the largest teacher Union in the country
 
00:22:02.990 --> 00:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
what was exposed was a requested
 
00:22:05.510 --> 00:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
language from a non-scientific lobbying
 
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
organization that made it almost word
 
00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
for word into the official science-based
 
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
guidance issued by the CDC this act
 
00:22:14.870 --> 00:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
delayed inperson learning across the
 
00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:17.320 align:start position:0%
country for students in some areas for
 
00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:19.559 align:start position:0%
almost another year we're still seeing
 
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
the detrimental effects of this decision
 
00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
n Nationwide and an entire generation of
 
00:22:25.269 --> 00:22:25.279 align:start position:0%
children have been damaged by this
 
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
collusion of special interests and a
 
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
bureau that
 
00:22:30.909 --> 00:22:30.919 align:start position:0%
shouldn't should have been the most
 
00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
fact-based one of the entire mess in DC
 
00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
so if you were to ask me now Tom surely
 
00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:37.640 align:start position:0%
there's some Bureau you'd keep my
 
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
response would be a resounding no and
 
00:22:42.029 --> 00:22:42.039 align:start position:0%
since we don't have the ability to
 
00:22:43.549 --> 00:22:43.559 align:start position:0%
dismantle it here from conquered the
 
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
least we can do is damage it's going uh
 
00:22:47.149 --> 00:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
limit its damage going forward please
 
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
vote OTP on HB
 
00:22:52.909 --> 00:22:52.919 align:start position:0%
1156 thank percent would you take
 
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any yeah I'm open
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
to questions okay I I do have a quick
 
00:22:59.149 --> 00:22:59.159 align:start position:0%
one here uh because you mentioned
 
00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
education U numerous schools clo closed
 
00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:04.760 align:start position:0%
uh public schools in particular many
 
00:23:06.909 --> 00:23:06.919 align:start position:0%
private schools uh parochial schools
 
00:23:09.549 --> 00:23:09.559 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools stayed open more nashar
 
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
is an example among others was closed
 
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
for about a year and I believe that that
 
00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
these schools who closed cited uh the
 
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
CDC yes uh and Anthony fouchi is a
 
00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:25.720 align:start position:0%
rationale for closing down uh live live
 
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
learning so where this measure to become
 
00:23:31.269 --> 00:23:31.279 align:start position:0%
law uh if I read this correctly and this
 
00:23:34.149 --> 00:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
why I'm asking if if uh the next
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
pandemic hopefully it'll be far in the
 
00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
future if ever but if something is what
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
happened a couple years ago happens
 
00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
again if a school seeing you mention
 
00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:45.320 align:start position:0%
learning if a
 
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
school wanted to site the CDC as a
 
00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
reason to close and and they and they go
 
00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:55.039 align:start position:0%
to remote learning would this law give
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
uh citizens legal basis to to sue the
 
00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
school district to reopen is that I I
 
00:24:02.789 --> 00:24:02.799 align:start position:0%
wouldn't think so uh to me any any
 
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
guidance going forward here is is
 
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
suspect because we're already seeing we
 
00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
saw already that this Bureau has been
 
00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:10.559 align:start position:0%
captured as well by special interests so
 
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether they issue this
 
00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
this guidance or not I wouldn't listen
 
00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
to it period And I understand that some
 
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
people take Umbridge with that but I
 
00:24:18.990 --> 00:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
don't trust any of these organizations
 
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
anymore they're just
 
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
captured yeah again my question
 
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
sorry basically was if there this were
 
00:24:31.470 --> 00:24:31.480 align:start position:0%
to be come La could citizens in a city
 
00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:35.919 align:start position:0%
or a town use this measure as a basis to
 
00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
sue the school district and require them
 
00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
to reopen if if the only rationale they
 
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
have for closing is a CDC or who
 
00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:47.720 align:start position:0%
recommendation I mean the schools
 
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
themselves can find Outside sources and
 
00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
if they go outside sources they're going
 
00:24:51.909 --> 00:24:51.919 align:start position:0%
to find that they shouldn't have locked
 
00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:53.480 align:start position:0%
down in the first place so if the CDC
 
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
says to close and these individuals are
 
00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
are suing to open then yeah they should
 
00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:58.549 align:start position:0%
are suing to open then yeah they should
open

00:24:58.549 --> 00:24:58.559 align:start position:0%
open
 
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
is what I would say thank you uh other
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:10.909 --> 00:25:10.919 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
wary welcome you were here early
 
00:25:18.190 --> 00:25:18.200 align:start position:0%
today yes thank you Mr
 
00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.029 align:start position:0%
today yes thank you Mr

chair
 
00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:22.480 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is Robert
 
00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
warry I have the privilege of
 
00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
representing the town of Hudson which is
 
00:25:29.149 --> 00:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
in District 13 of Hillsboro
 
00:25:29.159 --> 00:25:30.789 align:start position:0%
in District 13 of Hillsboro
County

00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:30.799 align:start position:0%
County
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
um just a little bit about my uh career
 
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
and background I'm a chemical engineer
 
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
who also has a MERS in pharmaceutical
 
00:25:42.029 --> 00:25:42.039 align:start position:0%
quality from the University of Strath
 
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
Clyde in Glascow Scotland as well as a
 
00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
masters in Regulatory Affairs from
 
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
Northeastern University I'm uh familiar
 
00:25:54.149 --> 00:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
with vaccine development as well as uh
 
00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:56.440 align:start position:0%
dealing with pandemic vaccine
 
00:26:00.070 --> 00:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
development um having worked under Dr
 
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
Jonas sulk during the 90s when he was
 
00:26:06.909 --> 00:26:06.919 align:start position:0%
trying to formulate um a vaccine for
 
00:26:09.789 --> 00:26:09.799 align:start position:0%
HIV um unfortunately his approach was
 
00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
not successful he was trying to attempt
 
00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919 align:start position:0%
a similar approach to what he did for
 
00:26:18.510 --> 00:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
polio but um what I'm here to comment on
 
00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
is I'm not a co-sponsor but I do support
 
00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
the principle of the bill in that um
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
anytime you have a situation where
 
00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
you're implementing mandates that are
 
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
not based in science and sound science
 
00:26:33.149 --> 00:26:33.159 align:start position:0%
uh there are some extreme
 
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
problems and so what I'd like to address
 
00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:38.520 align:start position:0%
is just a couple of problems that are
 
00:26:41.389 --> 00:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
noted with the CDC response to the covid
 
00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
pandemic as well as addressing some of
 
00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
the so-called signs behind the
 
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
lockdowns uh and um bear with me just a
 
00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:53.320 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
um I I've basically gathered available
 
00:26:59.430 --> 00:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
article on evidence uh so there was an
 
00:27:02.389 --> 00:27:02.399 align:start position:0%
extensive study done by uh Health and
 
00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
Human Services uh uh Mr McCrae Jim
 
00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
McCrae uh delivered a report in
 
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
September 1st
 
00:27:13.789 --> 00:27:13.799 align:start position:0%
2022 uh citing a number of deficiencies
 
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
and opportunities for improvement within
 
00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:16.750 align:start position:0%
and opportunities for improvement within
the

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
CDC um the director of the
 
00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
CDC um Rochelle walinsky had a number of
 
00:27:26.269 --> 00:27:26.279 align:start position:0%
press conferences around deficiencies
 
00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:28.120 align:start position:0%
with the CDC and
 
00:27:30.110 --> 00:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
admitted the need to change so i' I'd
 
00:27:32.549 --> 00:27:32.559 align:start position:0%
like to just for the record and for this
 
00:27:35.549 --> 00:27:35.559 align:start position:0%
committee's awareness cover some of the
 
00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
problems that were cited by the CDC and
 
00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
the Health and Human Services uh
 
00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
representative so um uh these incl
 
00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
issues include uh it just takes too long
 
00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:50.120 align:start position:0%
for CDC to publish its guidance and
 
00:27:52.149 --> 00:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
signs for decisionmaking they had been
 
00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
used to more of an academic setting and
 
00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
really were not geared up to properly
 
00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:58.960 align:start position:0%
respond to a p pandemic
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
situation um and their guidance for the
 
00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:03.720 align:start position:0%
public purposes and public consumption
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
was often confusing quote confusing and
 
00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
overwhelming um they also had a high
 
00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
staff turnover during that time period
 
00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:16.120 align:start position:0%
um the testing that they first came out
 
00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:19.960 align:start position:0%
with were faulty with a 33% error
 
00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:22.070 align:start position:0%
with were faulty with a 33% error
rate

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
rate
 
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
um and as a result the communication
 
00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
from the CDC uh was summed up as do what
 
00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
you think is best due to a lack of data
 
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
concrete scientific studies to obtain um
 
00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
proper answers and um just an overall
 
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
lack of data so they actually and you
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
may recall this had a lot of
 
00:28:48.789 --> 00:28:48.799 align:start position:0%
flip-flopping on device on advice such
 
00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
as wearing masks testing for covid and
 
00:28:55.389 --> 00:28:55.399 align:start position:0%
explanations as to how the virus
 
00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
spread um
 
00:28:58.480 --> 00:28:59.430 align:start position:0%
spread um
there

00:28:59.430 --> 00:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
were uh in in um admitting what was
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
wrong with the CDC director wilinsky
 
00:29:09.630 --> 00:29:09.640 align:start position:0%
noted that they need to have
 
00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:11.480 align:start position:0%
improvements with communication to the
 
00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:14.360 align:start position:0%
public they needed to change the
 
00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
incentives from a published published
 
00:29:20.789 --> 00:29:20.799 align:start position:0%
research approach in scientific journals
 
00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
to research and data aimed at the public
 
00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
health policy and proper actions to
 
00:29:28.549 --> 00:29:28.559 align:start position:0%
address this
 
00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:30.440 align:start position:0%
um they also needed to have more staff
 
00:29:33.909 --> 00:29:33.919 align:start position:0%
training to respond to Public Health
 
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
emergencies um another problem was the
 
00:29:39.870 --> 00:29:39.880 align:start position:0%
lab that developed the testing um it was
 
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
headed by someone uh who was familiar
 
00:29:46.669 --> 00:29:46.679 align:start position:0%
with influenza viruses but not the
 
00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:49.039 align:start position:0%
corona viruses so essentially there are
 
00:29:51.389 --> 00:29:51.399 align:start position:0%
seven different types of respiratory
 
00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
viruses Corona viruses one category uh
 
00:29:58.950 --> 00:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
influenza adov virus uh Rona virus a few
 
00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:02.200 align:start position:0%
others as well Are all uh different
 
00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
viruses um respiratory viruses but they
 
00:30:06.909 --> 00:30:06.919 align:start position:0%
behave differently and modeled
 
00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
differently um regrettably they had the
 
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
the head of the lab for developing the
 
00:30:16.029 --> 00:30:16.039 align:start position:0%
covid-19 test was an expert in influenza
 
00:30:19.669 --> 00:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
but not in Corona viruses therefore the
 
00:30:21.789 --> 00:30:21.799 align:start position:0%
laboratory set up and the protocols that
 
00:30:25.509 --> 00:30:25.519 align:start position:0%
they followed were faulty to that they
 
00:30:28.549 --> 00:30:28.559 align:start position:0%
also failed to do um initial quality
 
00:30:31.070 --> 00:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
control testing using the correct
 
00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
emergency youth emergency use
 
00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:36.149 align:start position:0%
emergency youth emergency use
authorization

00:30:36.149 --> 00:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
authorization
 
00:30:39.789 --> 00:30:39.799 align:start position:0%
protocol um when they did finally at the
 
00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
end of a series of testing use the the
 
00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
correct QC procedure they discovered
 
00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
that 33% failure rate that I mentioned
 
00:30:52.029 --> 00:30:52.039 align:start position:0%
earlier despite that finding that
 
00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:54.480 align:start position:0%
because the test kits were already
 
00:30:57.909 --> 00:30:57.919 align:start position:0%
repair prepared and ready to go out they
 
00:31:00.310 --> 00:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
did not do anything about holding off on
 
00:31:03.110 --> 00:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
the distribution of the test kits having
 
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
been in that situation myself
 
00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
responsible for the release of
 
00:31:09.549 --> 00:31:09.559 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical batches and we had a
 
00:31:13.470 --> 00:31:13.480 align:start position:0%
contaminant or a problem that made the I
 
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
literally held back over 50 batches of a
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
product because of that situation so to
 
00:31:19.919 --> 00:31:20.710 align:start position:0%
product because of that situation so to
in

00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
my scientific opinion and in my e and
 
00:31:28.509 --> 00:31:28.519 align:start position:0%
one of the areas of my expertise is in
 
00:31:30.909 --> 00:31:30.919 align:start position:0%
compliance around Pharmaceuticals and
 
00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:38.600 align:start position:0%
is unbelievable that they would do
 
00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:43.480 align:start position:0%
something like this it is um unethical
 
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
it is improper and
 
00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh basic quality assurance people would
 
00:31:53.549 --> 00:31:53.559 align:start position:0%
never do this and if they do they ought
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
to be banned from the
 
00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
industry so CDC did not stop there they
 
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
also failed in different opportunities
 
00:32:05.629 --> 00:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
to properly study uh different
 
00:32:07.549 --> 00:32:07.559 align:start position:0%
populations that were exposed to the
 
00:32:07.559 --> 00:32:08.750 align:start position:0%
populations that were exposed to the
Corona

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
Corona
 
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
virus they had uh several groups of
 
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
people evacuees from the Wuhan
 
00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
laboratory in Wuhan area as well as uh
 
00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
300 Americans stranded on a Japanese
 
00:32:21.389 --> 00:32:21.399 align:start position:0%
cruise ship they could have held those
 
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
people in a sort of quarantine detention
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
they did already but rather than trying
 
00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.669 align:start position:0%
they did already but rather than trying
to

00:32:28.669 --> 00:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:32:34.629 --> 00:32:34.639 align:start position:0%
ascertain um what behaviors and uh viral
 
00:32:38.909 --> 00:32:38.919 align:start position:0%
behaviors were occurring with between
 
00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
those persons who expressed symptoms and
 
00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
those persons who were asymptomatic or
 
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:45.870 align:start position:0%
those persons who were asymptomatic or
without

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:45.880 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:50.200 align:start position:0%
symptoms they um basically uh did not
 
00:32:52.029 --> 00:32:52.039 align:start position:0%
want to bother the people with the
 
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
informed consent process the testing and
 
00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
the uh additional detention so
 
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
a huge opportunity to understand the if
 
00:33:03.669 --> 00:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
you will the viral incubation rate how
 
00:33:06.750 --> 00:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
long it takes to uh get into a person
 
00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
and understand exactly how long it the
 
00:33:12.669 --> 00:33:12.679 align:start position:0%
symptoms it takes to manifest and then
 
00:33:14.549 --> 00:33:14.559 align:start position:0%
what the impact would be on spreading to
 
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
other people was completely missed so
 
00:33:23.549 --> 00:33:23.559 align:start position:0%
um and uh if you go into the CDC uh last
 
00:33:26.509 --> 00:33:26.519 align:start position:0%
word on uh the CDC issues and then I'd
 
00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
like to transition to discussing about
 
00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:32.440 align:start position:0%
lockdowns briefly if I may um the CDC
 
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
moving forward summary report was
 
00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:37.039 align:start position:0%
published on September 1st
 
00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:40.960 align:start position:0%
2022 appendix a contains the uh
 
00:33:42.269 --> 00:33:42.279 align:start position:0%
recommendations from the Health and
 
00:33:43.629 --> 00:33:43.639 align:start position:0%
Human Services
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
findings um and uh that's several pages
 
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
so uh they're written at a high level
 
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
but they are not in
 
00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:54.870 align:start position:0%
but they are not in
consequential

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
consequential
 
00:33:59.230 --> 00:33:59.240 align:start position:0%
um if I may continue briefly on
 
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
lockdowns proceed sure all right thank
 
00:34:05.549 --> 00:34:05.559 align:start position:0%
you um so uh there was some mentioned
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
earlier about lockdowns I'd like to just
 
00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:11.720 align:start position:0%
talk about that a little bit is um the
 
00:34:13.669 --> 00:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
whole concept of quarantining while that
 
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
is quite old um the uh quarantining and
 
00:34:21.430 --> 00:34:21.440 align:start position:0%
social distancing that led to the to the
 
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
covid-19 lockdowns was based on a
 
00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:27.560 align:start position:0%
computer simulation um that originated
 
00:34:30.669 --> 00:34:30.679 align:start position:0%
with a high school student and
 
00:34:33.349 --> 00:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
scientists from the Sandia National
 
00:34:36.109 --> 00:34:36.119 align:start position:0%
Laboratories one of whom was the father
 
00:34:38.589 --> 00:34:38.599 align:start position:0%
of that high school
 
00:34:38.599 --> 00:34:40.149 align:start position:0%
of that high school
student

00:34:40.149 --> 00:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
student
 
00:34:43.589 --> 00:34:43.599 align:start position:0%
now the whole concept of
 
00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:47.240 align:start position:0%
lockdowns was at least for for these
 
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
individuals was a computer simulation
 
00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:53.919 align:start position:0%
where the driving principle was to
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
minimize the spread of potential virus
 
00:34:59.630 --> 00:34:59.640 align:start position:0%
by minimizing the contacts and
 
00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:03.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:08.349 --> 00:35:08.359 align:start position:0%
people and so that was a singular
 
00:35:14.990 --> 00:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
considerations um unfortunately and
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
tragically the computer simulation model
 
00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:23.800 align:start position:0%
modelers uh failed to consider other
 
00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
factors and the side effects of
 
00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.550 align:start position:0%
factors and the side effects of
lockdown

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
lockdown
 
00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
um back and this originated back in the
 
00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
mid 2000s so in the 20062
 
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
2007 um time
 
00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:44.680 align:start position:0%
period um consequently they uh people
 
00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
who saw this information in this
 
00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:49.470 align:start position:0%
who saw this information in this
computer

00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:49.480 align:start position:0%
computer
 
00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:53.960 align:start position:0%
simulation uh took this two-e Target and
 
00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
uh extended it into multiple months of
 
00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:57.349 align:start position:0%
uh extended it into multiple months of
lockdown

00:35:57.349 --> 00:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
lockdown
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
which bordered on house rests in some
 
00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
countries and even some states within
 
00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:03.510 align:start position:0%
countries and even some states within
the

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
US the side effects of the lockdowns
 
00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
included worker furlows at
 
00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
256 hospitals adversely affecting the
 
00:36:16.870 --> 00:36:16.880 align:start position:0%

00:36:19.309 --> 00:36:19.319 align:start position:0%

00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:22.040 align:start position:0%

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
per year Devastation of every economic
 
00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:28.280 align:start position:0%

businesses I'd like to just also read
 
00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:44.550 align:start position:0%
businesses I'd like to just also read
some

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:44.560 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.950 align:start position:0%
some
other

00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
um INE they describe them as
 
00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
inequalities um in this one particular
 
00:36:55.510 --> 00:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
article and I apologize I don't have
 
00:36:59.710 --> 00:36:59.720 align:start position:0%
copies but I can make those available
 
00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:01.230 align:start position:0%
copies but I can make those available
um

00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:01.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:05.000 align:start position:0%
so I this list
 
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.750 align:start position:0%
so I this list
is

00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:06.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
um extensive well over kind of 50 lines
 
00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:15.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
um uh I I don't want to read them all
 
00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
but but let me just kind of highlight a
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
few of them there are estimates at the
 
00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
side effects of attempting to fully
 
00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
mitigate the covid pandemic
 
00:37:29.829 --> 00:37:29.839 align:start position:0%
um you via lockdowns will negatively
 
00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
impact life expectancy over 10 years the
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
negative life expectancy from
 
00:37:37.349 --> 00:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic inequalities alone will be
 
00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:40.280 align:start position:0%
around the equivalent of six unmitigated
 
00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:42.030 align:start position:0%
around the equivalent of six unmitigated
covid-19

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
covid-19
 
00:37:44.829 --> 00:37:44.839 align:start position:0%
pandemics this is not my opinion but the
 
00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:47.640 align:start position:0%
opinion from this particular article
 
00:37:49.349 --> 00:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
this is not considering the negative
 
00:37:51.309 --> 00:37:51.319 align:start position:0%
effects on life expectancy due to
 
00:37:53.309 --> 00:37:53.319 align:start position:0%
increased mental health problems
 
00:37:56.589 --> 00:37:56.599 align:start position:0%
suicides and drug abuse the effect of
 
00:37:58.589 --> 00:37:58.599 align:start position:0%
covid-19 pandemics and lockdowns
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
differed across socioeconomic groups um
 
00:38:06.349 --> 00:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
but low those with a lower
 
00:38:06.359 --> 00:38:08.030 align:start position:0%
but low those with a lower
socioeconomic

00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic
 
00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:11.480 align:start position:0%
um scale had higher infection incidents
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
and mortality suggesting that
 
00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
um the less fortunate groups were
 
00:38:21.950 --> 00:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
affected Harder by the
 
00:38:25.069 --> 00:38:25.079 align:start position:0%
lockdowns racial minorities were more at
 
00:38:27.349 --> 00:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
risk of getting infected than had worst
 
00:38:29.829 --> 00:38:29.839 align:start position:0%
covid health conditions and outcomes
 
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic and the existing
 
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
inequalities were
 
00:38:39.069 --> 00:38:39.079 align:start position:0%
exacerbated um
 
00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:41.800 align:start position:0%
I I I represent I know you said there
 
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
were around
 
00:38:45.630 --> 00:38:45.640 align:start position:0%
50 anymore maybe you could pick out the
 
00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
best one the most Salient one and give
 
00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:59.190 --> 00:38:59.200 align:start position:0%
my I think the greatest impact is to our
 
00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
school children the loss of learning
 
00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
from children young children who need to
 
00:39:11.069 --> 00:39:11.079 align:start position:0%
see the mouth move so infants I think
 
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
the socialization among the middle
 
00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:15.309 align:start position:0%
the socialization among the middle
schoolers

00:39:15.309 --> 00:39:15.319 align:start position:0%
schoolers
 
00:39:19.870 --> 00:39:19.880 align:start position:0%
was horrifically affected the
 
00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
um I can only say this anecdotally but
 
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
my my wife is a teacher and I know
 
00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
counselors within the school system is I
 
00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
think that there are uh an accelerated
 
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh much higher rate
 
00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:37.240 align:start position:0%
of um mental health issues right now
 
00:39:39.790 --> 00:39:39.800 align:start position:0%
within the schools than ever were before
 
00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:41.470 align:start position:0%
within the schools than ever were before
so

00:39:41.470 --> 00:39:41.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:43.230 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:43.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
so these
 
00:39:48.870 --> 00:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
are I think the the most horrific there
 
00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of horrific things that
 
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
happened side effects wise I think the
 
00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
most horrific is the impact that we've
 
00:39:59.109 --> 00:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:01.069 --> 00:40:01.079 align:start position:0%
Generations thank you representative
 
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
would you take questions if there are
 
00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
any if I can answer them yes I will try
 
00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:07.880 align:start position:0%
representative gagy thank you Mr
 
00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:13.790 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
question

00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
um I actually understood most of what
 
00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:18.640 align:start position:0%
you said I'm a high school graduate I
 
00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
don't have all these degrees I taught
 
00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
martial arts back in the last century
 
00:40:25.069 --> 00:40:25.079 align:start position:0%
and I learned to break heads rather than
 
00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
to come to conclusions like you did uh I
 
00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
wrote down three words here her immunity
 
00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:35.200 align:start position:0%
delayed all these mandates with the
 
00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:37.960 align:start position:0%
masks and uh shutting down schools
 
00:40:41.829 --> 00:40:41.839 align:start position:0%
shutting down churches Etc yes that that
 
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
that that that death in in part um
 
00:40:52.309 --> 00:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
prevent U natural immunity know you
 
00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:54.440 align:start position:0%
catch it once and you you get over it
 
00:40:59.430 --> 00:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:04.990 --> 00:41:05.000 align:start position:0%
DeLay So delay getting better um so it
 
00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:07.000 align:start position:0%
again this would be just my opinion and
 
00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:09.640 align:start position:0%
I haven't done I don't want to become
 
00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:11.720 align:start position:0%
like the CDC and make wild conclusions
 
00:41:18.069 --> 00:41:18.079 align:start position:0%
without proper data um so I I think um
 
00:41:22.510 --> 00:41:22.520 align:start position:0%
my my opinion is
 
00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:34.829 --> 00:41:34.839 align:start position:0%
allow Hospital resources and Healthcare
 
00:41:38.309 --> 00:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
resources to help address it was
 
00:41:38.319 --> 00:41:39.950 align:start position:0%
resources to help address it was
well-intentioned

00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
well-intentioned
 
00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:44.440 align:start position:0%
but but fundamentally flawed as a case
 
00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
example you can look at the country of
 
00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
Sweden who did not do any mandates
 
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
whatsoever but instead
 
00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
practiced um a much more relaxed
 
00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:57.109 align:start position:0%
practiced um a much more relaxed
approach

00:41:57.109 --> 00:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
approach
 
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
in if you compare the outcomes from
 
00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
Sweden uh to other European nations or
 
00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
even the US their death rates are far
 
00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
from covid are far less and excess death
 
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
rates above normal incidents of death um
 
00:42:19.589 --> 00:42:19.599 align:start position:0%
were far less than other countries and
 
00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
um you know you could compare that to uh
 
00:42:25.549 --> 00:42:25.559 align:start position:0%
say Israel which which was almost fully
 
00:42:25.559 --> 00:42:26.870 align:start position:0%
say Israel which which was almost fully
vaccinated

00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
00:42:29.549 --> 00:42:29.559 align:start position:0%
and they had they had much higher uh
 
00:42:33.349 --> 00:42:33.359 align:start position:0%
rates um you I think that it's similar
 
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
to the US in that uh us has a largely
 
00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
decentralized health care system based
 
00:42:43.069 --> 00:42:43.079 align:start position:0%
upon individual states with some
 
00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
oversight and uh I would say overreach
 
00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:49.960 align:start position:0%
um from uh organizations like the CDC so
 
00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:55.160 align:start position:0%
I think in in in trying to answer your
 
00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:59.150 align:start position:0%
I think in in in trying to answer your
question

00:42:59.150 --> 00:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:01.960 align:start position:0%
um they did not achieve their ultimate
 
00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:08.589 --> 00:43:08.599 align:start position:0%
that's other questions represent
 
00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
filio uh thank you Mr chair and two
 
00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
questions if I may the the first would
 
00:43:18.109 --> 00:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
be a somewhat legal question uh that in
 
00:43:20.109 --> 00:43:20.119 align:start position:0%
law we talk about the difference between
 
00:43:23.309 --> 00:43:23.319 align:start position:0%
weight and admissibility meaning that we
 
00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:24.760 align:start position:0%
determine whether something can actually
 
00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:27.800 align:start position:0%
be said in court versus the weight that
 
00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:30.680 align:start position:0%
can be given to a statement meaning
 
00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
whether we believe it's believable or
 
00:43:34.270 --> 00:43:34.280 align:start position:0%
not and then how much we actually want
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
to believe that statement why do we want
 
00:43:40.710 --> 00:43:40.720 align:start position:0%
to make statements by the CDC and World
 
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
Health Organization completely
 
00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
inadmissible versus just saying we don't
 
00:43:47.069 --> 00:43:47.079 align:start position:0%
really believe them and allowing each
 
00:43:49.589 --> 00:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
individual legislator the right to
 
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
Simply give it the weight that they
 
00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:54.040 align:start position:0%
believe it may be deserving and in your
 
00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
case it may be in other individual's
 
00:43:58.670 --> 00:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
case may be they get zero weight but
 
00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't this effectively be making that
 
00:44:02.829 --> 00:44:02.839 align:start position:0%
decision for each legislator that it
 
00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
gets zero weight and it's completely
 
00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
inadmissible rather than allowing each
 
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
individual legislature to determine the
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:18.349 --> 00:44:18.359 align:start position:0%
merits I'm not a lawyer so I'll only
 
00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:21.880 align:start position:0%
answer that as a scientist I suppose um
 
00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:24.990 align:start position:0%
answer that as a scientist I suppose um
I

00:44:24.990 --> 00:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
think uh to to me the the weight is
 
00:44:31.829 --> 00:44:31.839 align:start position:0%
always dependent upon the available data
 
00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
and what you can reasonably draw you
 
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
know what conclusions one can reasonably
 
00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:43.240 align:start position:0%
draw from the evidence and and having uh
 
00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
of or full disclosure of not
 
00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:55.480 align:start position:0%
only uh successful studies but those
 
00:44:56.910 --> 00:44:56.920 align:start position:0%
studies that have
 
00:44:59.950 --> 00:44:59.960 align:start position:0%
failed um I
 
00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
think what we
 
00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:06.280 align:start position:0%
found and maybe unlike the
 
00:45:09.549 --> 00:45:09.559 align:start position:0%
sponsors there are a lot of I think good
 
00:45:10.829 --> 00:45:10.839 align:start position:0%
things that
 
00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
CDC um and FDA with the organization
 
00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
with whom I work most closely uh are do
 
00:45:22.589 --> 00:45:22.599 align:start position:0%
very well the the problem is when is
 
00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
when a particular area causes so much
 
00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
overreach and it's not Based on data so
 
00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
I I again I I would say there needs to
 
00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:39.160 align:start position:0%
be transparency of data and
 
00:45:43.030 --> 00:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
that the information that's available to
 
00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:45.640 align:start position:0%
legislators needs to be weighed
 
00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:48.270 align:start position:0%
legislators needs to be weighed
carefully

00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:48.280 align:start position:0%
carefully
 
00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:57.829 --> 00:45:57.839 align:start position:0%
without with access to all the data
 
00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
if I may Mr chair follow up this is
 
00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:03.240 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a followup one of the
 
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
greatest Innovations to both New
 
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and American government is
 
00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:07.720 align:start position:0%
what we call the speech and debate
 
00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
clause which says that legislators may
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
say and consider any evidence they wish
 
00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
on the floor of a legislative body
 
00:46:17.710 --> 00:46:17.720 align:start position:0%
without repercussion this is very
 
00:46:20.309 --> 00:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
important because it says that not only
 
00:46:22.069 --> 00:46:22.079 align:start position:0%
may I consider whatever evidence that I
 
00:46:23.589 --> 00:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
believe is important but also I cannot
 
00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:26.200 align:start position:0%
be forced to consider whatever evidence
 
00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
I believe is important we can imagine a
 
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
government in system which I'm either
 
00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
forced to consider evidence or told I
 
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
may not consider evidence which
 
00:46:35.309 --> 00:46:35.319 align:start position:0%
effectively means that I'm quartered
 
00:46:37.349 --> 00:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
into a universe of only one piece of
 
00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:39.839 align:start position:0%
evidence this is important to a
 
00:46:42.829 --> 00:46:42.839 align:start position:0%
democracy in what way does a bill that
 
00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
says I may not consider evidence as a
 
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
legislator or comport with the speech
 
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
and debate clause of both the New
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:57.829 align:start position:0%
 
constitutions

00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:59.670 --> 00:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh since you mentioned freedom of speech
 
00:47:02.030 --> 00:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
I think I think one of the principles
 
00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
that we often talk about is you can't
 
00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:07.400 align:start position:0%
yell fire in a crowded movie
 
00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
theater um because if there's no fire
 
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
because of the issues that would result
 
00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
from people having a mass panic
 
00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:25.400 align:start position:0%
or um and then taking actions to rush
 
00:47:27.390 --> 00:47:27.400 align:start position:0%
out of the theater that might that would
 
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
in fact be more harmful
 
00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
than uh
 
00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
not I think in in this case where the
 
00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:39.400 align:start position:0%
CDC has basically yelled
 
00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:45.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
not specified the parameters of that and
 
00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:51.069 align:start position:0%
not specified the parameters of that and
actually

00:47:51.069 --> 00:47:51.079 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
withheld data that would suggest their
 
00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
proposals and testing were highly
 
00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:01.790 align:start position:0%
proposals and testing were highly
flawed

00:48:01.790 --> 00:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:06.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
is uh akin to yelling fire in a crowded
 
00:48:15.069 --> 00:48:15.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:15.079 --> 00:48:16.589 align:start position:0%
 
it's

00:48:16.589 --> 00:48:16.599 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
it's however this bill ends up it's
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
important that we understand that the
 
00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:28.280 align:start position:0%
data needs to be available
 
00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:34.640 align:start position:0%
communicated what we have right now is a
 
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
pattern where CDC has repeatedly
 
00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
withheld that
 
00:48:41.790 --> 00:48:41.800 align:start position:0%
data and not made it available to the
 
00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
public for decisionmaking
 
00:48:47.190 --> 00:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
purposes thank thank you for that I I
 
00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
Know repr M Mill had a hand up
 
00:48:52.589 --> 00:48:52.599 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair thank
 
00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:55.640 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um you me
 
00:48:58.589 --> 00:48:58.599 align:start position:0%
mentioned in your testimony that the CDC
 
00:49:01.829 --> 00:49:01.839 align:start position:0%
testing has a 33% failure rate could you
 
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
explain that please yeah so uh basically
 
00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:13.880 align:start position:0%
there um one of the tests so if you're
 
00:49:17.069 --> 00:49:17.079 align:start position:0%
making a test you have a number of
 
00:49:18.870 --> 00:49:18.880 align:start position:0%
parameters that you need
 
00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:24.680 align:start position:0%
to uh ensure are are viable uh accuracy
 
00:49:27.710 --> 00:49:27.720 align:start position:0%
precision reproducibility there uh limit
 
00:49:29.589 --> 00:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
of detection limit of
 
00:49:32.349 --> 00:49:32.359 align:start position:0%
quantification there are I think a total
 
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
of nine or so things that are described
 
00:49:37.309 --> 00:49:37.319 align:start position:0%
in the United States pharmacopia as well
 
00:49:40.109 --> 00:49:40.119 align:start position:0%
as other uh
 
00:49:44.270 --> 00:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
standards what the 33% failure rate came
 
00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
from exactly I'm not sure but it
 
00:49:49.549 --> 00:49:49.559 align:start position:0%
probably had to do with um false
 
00:49:51.789 --> 00:49:51.799 align:start position:0%
positives and false negatives so in
 
00:49:55.549 --> 00:49:55.559 align:start position:0%
other words you had the virus um and it
 
00:49:58.349 --> 00:49:58.359 align:start position:0%
didn't register or you didn't have the
 
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
virus but it did register positive so um
 
00:50:04.829 --> 00:50:04.839 align:start position:0%
I would think that that is probably the
 
00:50:09.789 --> 00:50:09.799 align:start position:0%
33% failure rate is attributable to a
 
00:50:13.109 --> 00:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
false negative false positive
 
00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:15.720 align:start position:0%
situation another question uh
 
00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
followup um is that rate higher or lower
 
00:50:22.109 --> 00:50:22.119 align:start position:0%
than the average oh my uh yes I mean you
 
00:50:29.789 --> 00:50:29.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:34.280 align:start position:0%
FDA us United States pharmacopia and
 
00:50:36.870 --> 00:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
other areas are expecting minimal
 
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
failure rates in the single digits or
 
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
less uh you
 
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
don't you don't want um those sorts of
 
00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
tests to be um have a high failure rate
 
00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:54.200 align:start position:0%
incident I'm not I'm not sure what um it
 
00:50:57.829 --> 00:50:57.839 align:start position:0%
probably depends upon the the test to be
 
00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:01.640 align:start position:0%
uh as accurate as I can be um some tests
 
00:51:03.390 --> 00:51:03.400 align:start position:0%
have greater accuracy than others but
 
00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
you would not 33% is unduly
 
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
large thank you other questions
 
00:51:14.789 --> 00:51:14.799 align:start position:0%
representative Lloyd so um from my
 
00:51:18.349 --> 00:51:18.359 align:start position:0%
understanding covid-19 was an unknown um
 
00:51:21.549 --> 00:51:21.559 align:start position:0%
entity prior to it happening and and uh
 
00:51:24.430 --> 00:51:24.440 align:start position:0%
breaking out in pandemic um how many of
 
00:51:26.349 --> 00:51:26.359 align:start position:0%
those other testing
 
00:51:28.829 --> 00:51:28.839 align:start position:0%
uh kits are
 
00:51:33.150 --> 00:51:33.160 align:start position:0%
known like so if I have a test for a flu
 
00:51:35.309 --> 00:51:35.319 align:start position:0%
we know the flu virus we know how it
 
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
interacts we know somewhat of of how it
 
00:51:41.150 --> 00:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
behaves however covid-19 didn't so how
 
00:51:43.349 --> 00:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
many so if the success rate is being
 
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
compared to the success rate of the
 
00:51:48.589 --> 00:51:48.599 align:start position:0%
other kits how how many of those Kit
 
00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
rates are
 
00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
known I I'm I'm not sure I can actually
 
00:51:57.349 --> 00:51:57.359 align:start position:0%
answer answer your question I will I
 
00:51:59.950 --> 00:51:59.960 align:start position:0%
will say that at the same time that the
 
00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:02.680 align:start position:0%
CDC was developing their kit there was
 
00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:04.559 align:start position:0%
also a kit that had been developed in
 
00:52:08.870 --> 00:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
Germany that had good testing rates and
 
00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:12.280 align:start position:0%
um CDC elected not to to utilize that
 
00:52:14.549 --> 00:52:14.559 align:start position:0%
kit so they instead forged ahead with
 
00:52:18.670 --> 00:52:18.680 align:start position:0%
their own kit um I would say some of
 
00:52:20.789 --> 00:52:20.799 align:start position:0%
some of this especially in the biologics
 
00:52:24.069 --> 00:52:24.079 align:start position:0%
and kind of pandemics and things are not
 
00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:32.270 --> 00:52:32.280 align:start position:0%
well known often the flu vaccines are a
 
00:52:37.109 --> 00:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
forecast So based on what experts think
 
00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
might come about in the next flu season
 
00:52:42.829 --> 00:52:42.839 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
they're they're taking um educated
 
00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
guesses but
 
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
um but I would say you know there's a
 
00:52:57.150 --> 00:52:57.160 align:start position:0%
difference between educated guesses and
 
00:52:57.160 --> 00:52:58.910 align:start position:0%
difference between educated guesses and
guesses

00:52:58.910 --> 00:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
guesses
 
00:53:04.430 --> 00:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
that fail to disclose bad data so I I I
 
00:53:07.829 --> 00:53:07.839 align:start position:0%
just want to emphasize that is that when
 
00:53:11.309 --> 00:53:11.319 align:start position:0%
you uh have bad data and you do not
 
00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
disclose it you're you've crossed that
 
00:53:15.470 --> 00:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
barrier from educated guesses to
 
00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:17.710 align:start position:0%
barrier from educated guesses to
unethical

00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:17.720 align:start position:0%
unethical
 
00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
practices follow up so I guess my
 
00:53:23.589 --> 00:53:23.599 align:start position:0%
concern here is also the fact that with
 
00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
a 33%
 
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
um unsuccess rate or unsuccessful rate
 
00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
uh there's a 67% successful rate so um
 
00:53:37.390 --> 00:53:37.400 align:start position:0%
if if you were the head of an
 
00:53:41.230 --> 00:53:41.240 align:start position:0%
organization that was trying to just get
 
00:53:43.549 --> 00:53:43.559 align:start position:0%
anything out there as soon as possible
 
00:53:48.390 --> 00:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
to potentially save lives uh would you
 
00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:51.720 align:start position:0%
suggest like trying to move forward with
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
something uh the CDC itself said that
 
00:53:57.910 --> 00:53:57.920 align:start position:0%
this was bad that so I I will defer in
 
00:54:01.349 --> 00:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
this case ironically to the cdc's and
 
00:54:04.750 --> 00:54:04.760 align:start position:0%
the hhs's review of those practices they
 
00:54:08.990 --> 00:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
thought it was unacceptable and
 
00:54:11.589 --> 00:54:11.599 align:start position:0%
um in this particular case I see no
 
00:54:13.789 --> 00:54:13.799 align:start position:0%
reason to disagree with
 
00:54:16.190 --> 00:54:16.200 align:start position:0%
them other
 
00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:19.720 align:start position:0%
questions uh see and rep thank you uh
 
00:54:21.789 --> 00:54:21.799 align:start position:0%
just to at the beginning you mentioned
 
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
uh your background you're a scientist is
 
00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
that fair to
 
00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm I'm a chemical engineer I have
 
00:54:29.950 --> 00:54:29.960 align:start position:0%
a process patent for a
 
00:54:33.109 --> 00:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical um I have been working in
 
00:54:34.990 --> 00:54:35.000 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals biotechnology and
 
00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:37.240 align:start position:0%
medical devices for approximately 40
 
00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:39.400 align:start position:0%
years and that's my other job when I'm
 
00:54:40.510 --> 00:54:40.520 align:start position:0%
not up in
 
00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
conquered okay thank you and did did you
 
00:54:45.069 --> 00:54:45.079 align:start position:0%
mention Jonas su's name at the beginning
 
00:54:46.829 --> 00:54:46.839 align:start position:0%
yes yes I did I worked with him in the
 
00:54:51.510 --> 00:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
mid 90s um he was um the inventor of
 
00:54:54.230 --> 00:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
this concept I was in a joint venture
 
00:54:58.789 --> 00:54:58.799 align:start position:0%
with uh rlan Roar uh and the immune
 
00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:01.960 align:start position:0%
response Corporation and they had gotten
 
00:55:03.990 --> 00:55:04.000 align:start position:0%
together and so I worked in that I
 
00:55:05.589 --> 00:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
worked in a facility I was the head of
 
00:55:08.030 --> 00:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
quality in a small vaccine producing
 
00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:12.440 align:start position:0%
facility that uh made HIV uh in cell
 
00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:16.720 align:start position:0%
culture uh and then inactivated it using
 
00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
irradiation and chemical inactivation uh
 
00:55:23.710 --> 00:55:23.720 align:start position:0%
and then um proceed to put in vaccines
 
00:55:26.230 --> 00:55:26.240 align:start position:0%
for uh human clinical
 
00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
trials well thank you obviously you have
 
00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
some um some background in this area
 
00:55:33.549 --> 00:55:33.559 align:start position:0%
thank you again for your uh extended
 
00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
testimony okay um our practice here at
 
00:55:41.349 --> 00:55:41.359 align:start position:0%
the House of Representatives is when we
 
00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
have these pink cards we give a little
 
00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
bit of difference to co-sponsors and
 
00:55:47.829 --> 00:55:47.839 align:start position:0%
fellow legislators and I have five more
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
uh cards uh from State reps that we're
 
00:55:54.630 --> 00:55:54.640 align:start position:0%
going to get to uh but before we get to
 
00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
those and some have asked for two to 5
 
00:55:59.069 --> 00:55:59.079 align:start position:0%
to 10 minutes before we get to those all
 
00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:01.240 align:start position:0%
of whom have read have signed in as
 
00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
supporting the bill and we'll get right
 
00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:05.839 align:start position:0%
to them but I do want to go to uh
 
00:56:08.190 --> 00:56:08.200 align:start position:0%
someone who is representing an
 
00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill
 
00:56:13.630 --> 00:56:13.640 align:start position:0%

Association representing approximately
 
00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
1,200 nurses urges you to vote in
 
00:57:18.549 --> 00:57:18.559 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate on HB 1156 this
 
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:21.200 align:start position:0%
bill would require that all political
 
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
subdivisions in New Hampshire not engage
 
00:57:25.950 --> 00:57:25.960 align:start position:0%
in the enforcement of any requirements
 
00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
mandates recommendations instructions or
 
00:57:33.390 --> 00:57:33.400 align:start position:0%
guidance from either CDC or who um the
 
00:57:36.029 --> 00:57:36.039 align:start position:0%
CDC and the who detect and respond to
 
00:57:38.549 --> 00:57:38.559 align:start position:0%
new and emerging Health threats and both
 
00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
play an advisory role in New Hampshire
 
00:57:43.950 --> 00:57:43.960 align:start position:0%
adoption of 1156 would impede New
 
00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's access to current
 
00:57:47.870 --> 00:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations from leading P public
 
00:57:50.910 --> 00:57:50.920 align:start position:0%
health experts regarding the prevention
 
00:57:53.549 --> 00:57:53.559 align:start position:0%
and treatment of communicable disease
 
00:57:56.430 --> 00:57:56.440 align:start position:0%
adoption of 115 56 would also impede
 
00:57:59.829 --> 00:57:59.839 align:start position:0%
access to federal funds from the CDC and
 
00:58:01.789 --> 00:58:01.799 align:start position:0%
from other sources that require
 
00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
compliance with CDC guidelines nurses
 
00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
practice from evidence-based research
 
00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
and they depend upon expertise that the
 
00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:12.720 align:start position:0%
CDC and the who provide to address
 
00:58:16.349 --> 00:58:16.359 align:start position:0%
Public Health threats 1156 runs counter
 
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
to nurses commitment to protecting the
 
00:58:21.630 --> 00:58:21.640 align:start position:0%
Public's Health and Welfare I have been
 
00:58:24.789 --> 00:58:24.799 align:start position:0%
a nurse for over 31 years and you
 
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
utilize the expert guidance published by
 
00:58:31.870 --> 00:58:31.880 align:start position:0%
the CDC in caring for active TB patients
 
00:58:35.549 --> 00:58:35.559 align:start position:0%
HIV positive patients and many patients
 
00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:38.480 align:start position:0%
on contact Airborne or droplet
 
00:58:41.589 --> 00:58:41.599 align:start position:0%
precautions the CDC guidance has kept me
 
00:58:44.589 --> 00:58:44.599 align:start position:0%
and my patients safe as a member of the
 
00:58:48.029 --> 00:58:48.039 align:start position:0%
incident command during the co9 pandemic
 
00:58:50.589 --> 00:58:50.599 align:start position:0%
I relied on scientific guidance from the
 
00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
CDC to protect patients and staff this
 
00:58:56.190 --> 00:58:56.200 align:start position:0%
guidance was based on on scientific data
 
00:58:58.910 --> 00:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
and in my opinion as a subject matter
 
00:59:01.630 --> 00:59:01.640 align:start position:0%
expert saved many lives please vote
 
00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:07.720 align:start position:0%
Bill thank thank you very much we take
 
00:59:11.470 --> 00:59:11.480 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any other
 
00:59:14.430 --> 00:59:14.440 align:start position:0%
questions I have one quick question and
 
00:59:17.589 --> 00:59:17.599 align:start position:0%
that has to do you mentioned um the some
 
00:59:20.789 --> 00:59:20.799 align:start position:0%
of the information from said the CDC uh
 
00:59:24.349 --> 00:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
gets to nurses um could you just explain
 
00:59:26.349 --> 00:59:26.359 align:start position:0%
that process a little bit I know every
 
00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
hospital every Clinic is a little bit
 
00:59:31.109 --> 00:59:31.119 align:start position:0%
different but uh did do you get like a
 
00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
memo from from somebody that cites the
 
00:59:36.190 --> 00:59:36.200 align:start position:0%
CDC recommendations how does that filter
 
00:59:37.910 --> 00:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
down if you could speak to that a little
 
00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:40.400 align:start position:0%
bit absolutely so as incident command I
 
00:59:43.470 --> 00:59:43.480 align:start position:0%
was actually a nursing director and I
 
00:59:46.589 --> 00:59:46.599 align:start position:0%
was going to the CDC website and looking
 
00:59:48.430 --> 00:59:48.440 align:start position:0%
directly at what they were offering at
 
00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
the time for what's new what's the
 
00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
information what what Guidance Do we
 
00:59:55.390 --> 00:59:55.400 align:start position:0%
have for our patients
 
00:59:57.190 --> 00:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
and we were looking through that and
 
00:59:59.109 --> 00:59:59.119 align:start position:0%
making the best judgment that we could
 
01:00:02.029 --> 01:00:02.039 align:start position:0%
with that guidance and it was changing
 
01:00:05.349 --> 01:00:05.359 align:start position:0%
rapidly we were in a pandemic everyone
 
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
was frightened we didn't no one knew how
 
01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
to handle this situation we'd never been
 
01:00:12.430 --> 01:00:12.440 align:start position:0%
there before and we also were proceeding
 
01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
with caution um so we were using that
 
01:00:17.230 --> 01:00:17.240 align:start position:0%
guidance and making the best decision
 
01:00:20.190 --> 01:00:20.200 align:start position:0%
possible for our patients and our staff
 
01:00:22.029 --> 01:00:22.039 align:start position:0%
and we did proceed with caution
 
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes we used their guidance and we
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
actually went to even more cautious
 
01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:30.520 align:start position:0%
steps so we use that guidance and we set
 
01:00:33.710 --> 01:00:33.720 align:start position:0%
mask mandates you know hand
 
01:00:37.710 --> 01:00:37.720 align:start position:0%
sanitizing hand washing uh all the
 
01:00:41.470 --> 01:00:41.480 align:start position:0%
isolation um the social distancing all
 
01:00:43.150 --> 01:00:43.160 align:start position:0%
of that guidance and teaching and
 
01:00:45.029 --> 01:00:45.039 align:start position:0%
education and we put all of that in
 
01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:47.720 align:start position:0%
information out for patients for staff
 
01:00:49.589 --> 01:00:49.599 align:start position:0%
all of
 
01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
that uh ripson
 
01:00:54.549 --> 01:00:54.559 align:start position:0%
Rollins thank you Mr chairman um the
 
01:00:57.150 --> 01:00:57.160 align:start position:0%
first year when Co hit all right all the
 
01:00:59.109 --> 01:00:59.119 align:start position:0%
nurses were all heroes I mean they
 
01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
worked Around the Clock they did
 
01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
diligent job they spent lots of time and
 
01:01:07.029 --> 01:01:07.039 align:start position:0%
overtime because our hospitals were were
 
01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:09.720 align:start position:0%
so overwhelmed the second year it came
 
01:01:12.349 --> 01:01:12.359 align:start position:0%
out that the nurses had to get a vaccine
 
01:01:14.349 --> 01:01:14.359 align:start position:0%
or they were going to be released from
 
01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:16.160 align:start position:0%
their job do you feel that that was the
 
01:01:19.789 --> 01:01:19.799 align:start position:0%
right move I'm used to that I've always
 
01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
had to get a flu vaccine I've had to
 
01:01:23.589 --> 01:01:23.599 align:start position:0%
have vaccines my whole life being a
 
01:01:25.950 --> 01:01:25.960 align:start position:0%
nurse that's what our patients want us
 
01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
to do to protect them they don't want us
 
01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:31.400 align:start position:0%
to have diseases that then we spread to
 
01:01:33.309 --> 01:01:33.319 align:start position:0%
them so that's been my whole life that
 
01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
I've been vaccinated I'm not I'm not
 
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
that's not unfamiliar to me
 
01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:44.720 align:start position:0%
so it wasn't a surprise thank you
 
01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
yeah uh one more quick question um was
 
01:01:52.190 --> 01:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
there ever any push back uh and I know
 
01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
you just have a piece of the nurse ing
 
01:01:58.349 --> 01:01:58.359 align:start position:0%
Healthcare World um was there ever to
 
01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
your knowledge push back on the on the
 
01:02:03.150 --> 01:02:03.160 align:start position:0%
part of uh healthare professionals
 
01:02:06.510 --> 01:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
nurses or doctors to some of the CD
 
01:02:09.630 --> 01:02:09.640 align:start position:0%
guidelines uh that were passed down did
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
any nurses say uh I don't agree and I'm
 
01:02:14.349 --> 01:02:14.359 align:start position:0%
not going to do it um so there was a
 
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
small percentage of staff that were
 
01:02:19.349 --> 01:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
against vaccination there was a small
 
01:02:21.430 --> 01:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
percentage of staff that were against
 
01:02:25.069 --> 01:02:25.079 align:start position:0%
masking but I was small very small
 
01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
small than thank
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%

um I really wanted to address a couple
 
01:03:20.589 --> 01:03:20.599 align:start position:0%
of issues that were raised um a couple
 
01:03:24.990 --> 01:03:25.000 align:start position:0%
questions and um the constit ution and
 
01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
and jurisdiction so um there is a court
 
01:03:31.870 --> 01:03:31.880 align:start position:0%
case Worcester versus Plymouth it's a
 
01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court case for New Hampshire um
 
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
and in that court case the Supreme Court
 
01:03:41.710 --> 01:03:41.720 align:start position:0%
made it clear that the constitution is
 
01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
divided into two parts Part One are our
 
01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
rights and that they're reserved back to
 
01:03:49.029 --> 01:03:49.039 align:start position:0%
the people government can't touch them
 
01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:51.880 align:start position:0%
can't make any laws uh relating to them
 
01:03:53.789 --> 01:03:53.799 align:start position:0%
or bridging them and that those rights
 
01:03:56.029 --> 01:03:56.039 align:start position:0%
are kept
 
01:03:59.109 --> 01:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
unless uh they are determined to be
 
01:04:01.150 --> 01:04:01.160 align:start position:0%
suspended by a
 
01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
trial um by a jury of your
 
01:04:07.349 --> 01:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
peers that being said part two of The
 
01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution uh directs the government
 
01:04:11.269 --> 01:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
how to carry out its duties and
 
01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:13.160 align:start position:0%
functions to preserve the rights of the
 
01:04:18.670 --> 01:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
people and there is no Grant in part two
 
01:04:20.430 --> 01:04:20.440 align:start position:0%
for the jurisdiction that the people
 
01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:22.799 align:start position:0%
granted to their agents in
 
01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
government to then uh pass
 
01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
along their authority to a
 
01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:32.029 align:start position:0%
along their authority to a
non-governmental

01:04:32.029 --> 01:04:32.039 align:start position:0%
non-governmental
 
01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:34.760 align:start position:0%
entity so if there's some issues with
 
01:04:37.549 --> 01:04:37.559 align:start position:0%
the last line of the bill um about
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
citing the
 
01:04:39.119 --> 01:04:40.670 align:start position:0%
citing the
CDC

01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
CDC
 
01:04:43.950 --> 01:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps that can be adjusted a little
 
01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
bit um but I think
 
01:04:50.670 --> 01:04:50.680 align:start position:0%
that it's clear the founders said that
 
01:04:52.349 --> 01:04:52.359 align:start position:0%
we had to have an informed populace and
 
01:04:54.029 --> 01:04:54.039 align:start position:0%
informed legislators but you hear all
 
01:04:56.190 --> 01:04:56.200 align:start position:0%
the the time people just talk about
 
01:04:59.069 --> 01:04:59.079 align:start position:0%
statutes and kind of ignore the
 
01:05:03.029 --> 01:05:03.039 align:start position:0%
Constitution and while the CDC and who
 
01:05:05.029 --> 01:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
already don't have jurisdiction over the
 
01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
people of New
 
01:05:08.230 --> 01:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire per the Constitution because
 
01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
it's clear who does have that
 
01:05:12.029 --> 01:05:12.039 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction in part
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
two and there's a maxim of law that says
 
01:05:16.269 --> 01:05:16.279 align:start position:0%
what's been delegated cannot be
 
01:05:16.279 --> 01:05:18.150 align:start position:0%
what's been delegated cannot be
delegated

01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
delegated
 
01:05:21.069 --> 01:05:21.079 align:start position:0%
again um I think there is some Merit to
 
01:05:25.470 --> 01:05:25.480 align:start position:0%
the question of debate so if if you know
 
01:05:29.269 --> 01:05:29.279 align:start position:0%
during a hearing the CDC or who
 
01:05:31.549 --> 01:05:31.559 align:start position:0%
recommendations are weighed it's fair
 
01:05:32.950 --> 01:05:32.960 align:start position:0%
that that's brought up in debate and
 
01:05:35.069 --> 01:05:35.079 align:start position:0%
kept in the record um so that the
 
01:05:37.589 --> 01:05:37.599 align:start position:0%
legislative intent of something is
 
01:05:40.789 --> 01:05:40.799 align:start position:0%
known um but you can't have in law
 
01:05:44.349 --> 01:05:44.359 align:start position:0%
pursuant to the who
 
01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
recommendations um a lot of times you'll
 
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
see in administrative rules and that's
 
01:05:51.029 --> 01:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
different because that's directing how
 
01:05:54.269 --> 01:05:54.279 align:start position:0%
government operates um you'll see
 
01:05:57.390 --> 01:05:57.400 align:start position:0%
they'll say uh the person must be
 
01:05:59.829 --> 01:05:59.839 align:start position:0%
licensed according to these um
 
01:06:03.630 --> 01:06:03.640 align:start position:0%
requirements from the CDC or um actually
 
01:06:05.029 --> 01:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
some statutes
 
01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
say uh you know CDC
 
01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations you know pursuant to
 
01:06:13.950 --> 01:06:13.960 align:start position:0%
them this bill would would make it clear
 
01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
that that's that's not okay um and I
 
01:06:18.269 --> 01:06:18.279 align:start position:0%
think that's important for the
 
01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
Constitutional intention of the founders
 
01:06:22.510 --> 01:06:22.520 align:start position:0%
that the agents who are elected by the
 
01:06:25.390 --> 01:06:25.400 align:start position:0%
people or appointed by the governor or
 
01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh and the uh executive counsel that
 
01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:30.079 align:start position:0%
those be the people who make decisions
 
01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
for them um as their agents and in their
 
01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
interest um the CDC and the who are
 
01:06:40.990 --> 01:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
not uh they they're not beholden to the
 
01:06:43.990 --> 01:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
people uh they they do have expert
 
01:06:48.029 --> 01:06:48.039 align:start position:0%
information um that is is often errant
 
01:06:51.109 --> 01:06:51.119 align:start position:0%
and I think it been called into
 
01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
question much more in the last four
 
01:06:55.150 --> 01:06:55.160 align:start position:0%
years but even before that there were
 
01:06:57.789 --> 01:06:57.799 align:start position:0%
some some recommendations that you know
 
01:06:58.870 --> 01:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
profession other professional
 
01:07:01.109 --> 01:07:01.119 align:start position:0%
organizations would disagree
 
01:07:05.589 --> 01:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
with um that being
 
01:07:08.549 --> 01:07:08.559 align:start position:0%
said uh I I will kind of try to talk
 
01:07:12.430 --> 01:07:12.440 align:start position:0%
about the nursing aspect a little bit um
 
01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
my experience was that many many nurses
 
01:07:21.069 --> 01:07:21.079 align:start position:0%
were upset with the mandates coming down
 
01:07:26.029 --> 01:07:26.039 align:start position:0%
um and personally I I've looked at
 
01:07:28.870 --> 01:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations and and it's
 
01:07:31.309 --> 01:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
it's it's encouraged in nursing school
 
01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
for us to be critical thinkers and to
 
01:07:36.309 --> 01:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
question um directives that come down
 
01:07:39.390 --> 01:07:39.400 align:start position:0%
from on high and to make sure that the
 
01:07:41.269 --> 01:07:41.279 align:start position:0%
evidence is robust and it really backs
 
01:07:42.549 --> 01:07:42.559 align:start position:0%
up those
 
01:07:46.109 --> 01:07:46.119 align:start position:0%
recommendations um I don't think
 
01:07:51.589 --> 01:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
that a private company carrying out
 
01:07:55.549 --> 01:07:55.559 align:start position:0%
their policies and basing it on uh
 
01:07:58.870 --> 01:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
organizations that they're used to and
 
01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:02.839 align:start position:0%
um typically provide good guidance on
 
01:08:06.349 --> 01:08:06.359 align:start position:0%
certain things like basic infection
 
01:08:10.190 --> 01:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
control measures um for diseases that
 
01:08:12.549 --> 01:08:12.559 align:start position:0%
have been around for a long time like
 
01:08:15.430 --> 01:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
TB and I I don't think that that is
 
01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
comparable to uh talking about the
 
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
government being able to site that
 
01:08:24.030 --> 01:08:24.040 align:start position:0%
organization that's a non-governmental
 
01:08:26.229 --> 01:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
it as
 
01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
justification for a law there has to be
 
01:08:31.309 --> 01:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
a constitutional
 
01:08:34.269 --> 01:08:34.279 align:start position:0%
justification and that's the only that's
 
01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
the only way that you can really justify
 
01:08:37.390 --> 01:08:37.400 align:start position:0%
any law that's
 
01:08:40.229 --> 01:08:40.239 align:start position:0%
made um but as far as nursing sorry I
 
01:08:43.149 --> 01:08:43.159 align:start position:0%
got um off track sometimes the
 
01:08:46.829 --> 01:08:46.839 align:start position:0%
recommendations are are questionable uh
 
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
and individual facilities will decide
 
01:08:52.110 --> 01:08:52.120 align:start position:0%
not to go with CDC recommendations and
 
01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:53.239 align:start position:0%
we'll go with another Professional
 
01:08:55.229 --> 01:08:55.239 align:start position:0%
Organization or they'll do literature
 
01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
review themselves and set their own
 
01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:02.400 align:start position:0%
policies and as far as it being a small
 
01:09:05.070 --> 01:09:05.080 align:start position:0%
amount of nurses I I very much disagree
 
01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
with that as I um I helped a lot of
 
01:09:10.749 --> 01:09:10.759 align:start position:0%
nurses seeking exemptions
 
01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
because just because you've had your
 
01:09:15.349 --> 01:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
rights trampled your constitutional
 
01:09:16.910 --> 01:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
rights which no one has a right to take
 
01:09:19.870 --> 01:09:19.880 align:start position:0%
from you um just because you've had them
 
01:09:21.510 --> 01:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
trampled over and over and you're used
 
01:09:24.070 --> 01:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
to it you're used to having that abuse
 
01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
that doesn't make it
 
01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
okay um and a lot of nurses realized
 
01:09:33.309 --> 01:09:33.319 align:start position:0%
that during the co mandate the covid
 
01:09:36.789 --> 01:09:36.799 align:start position:0%
vaccine mandates and they drew a line
 
01:09:40.749 --> 01:09:40.759 align:start position:0%
and we have an accelerated and
 
01:09:42.749 --> 01:09:42.759 align:start position:0%
exacerbated Staffing shortage as a
 
01:09:45.990 --> 01:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
result of it I can name I can give you
 
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
the names of 20 nurses who are no longer
 
01:09:51.189 --> 01:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
practicing nursing because of the way
 
01:09:52.870 --> 01:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
that everything was hand handled during
 
01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:55.590 align:start position:0%
that everything was hand handled during
Co

01:09:55.590 --> 01:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
Co
 
01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:58.590 align:start position:0%
Co
additionally

01:09:58.590 --> 01:09:58.600 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
01:10:01.550 --> 01:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
um I am not a member of the organization
 
01:10:03.510 --> 01:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
that was here speaking before so I just
 
01:10:05.470 --> 01:10:05.480 align:start position:0%
want to clarify that so I'm not speaking
 
01:10:10.590 --> 01:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
for them um I believe that some of the
 
01:10:12.630 --> 01:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
professional organizations are subject
 
01:10:15.870 --> 01:10:15.880 align:start position:0%
to bias as well and that's why I don't
 
01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
join um and it's unfortunate that
 
01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
there's no representation for the number
 
01:10:26.189 --> 01:10:26.199 align:start position:0%
of nurses who did push back and and and
 
01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to fix their profession and what
 
01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:28.950 align:start position:0%
wanted to fix their profession and what
was

01:10:28.950 --> 01:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:10:32.189 --> 01:10:32.199 align:start position:0%
happening and they were not supported
 
01:10:34.709 --> 01:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
and it's it's unfortunate that that had
 
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
to take place because it made it harder
 
01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
for all nurses when we lost a portion of
 
01:10:41.110 --> 01:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
some of them and it made it harder for
 
01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:43.830 align:start position:0%
some of them and it made it harder for
the

01:10:43.830 --> 01:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:46.189 --> 01:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
patients thank you representative uh
 
01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
would you take questions if there are
 
01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
any are there any
 
01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you so much thank you

welcome thank you Mr chair honorable

4 this Bill acts to nullify in a soft
 
01:11:23.630 --> 01:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
manner the World Health Organization and
 
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:11:28.870 --> 01:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
CDC now let me preface my comments with
 
01:11:32.229 --> 01:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
this I'm going to make some claims that
 
01:11:35.149 --> 01:11:35.159 align:start position:0%
will challenge you I will present
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
evidence for these claims but this
 
01:11:41.350 --> 01:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
evidence only barely scratches the

included the welding of doors shut in

they were intended
 
01:14:41.189 --> 01:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
to China developed the lockdown model
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
and went to Great Lengths to scare the

world into adopting
 
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
it and they had their man in the World

Health Organization make an official
 
01:14:53.709 --> 01:14:53.719 align:start position:0%

around the
 
01:14:59.189 --> 01:14:59.199 align:start position:0%

01:15:12.310 --> 01:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
overreach the CDC issued such things as
 
01:15:15.189 --> 01:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
Nationwide eviction moratoriums that
 
01:15:16.510 --> 01:15:16.520 align:start position:0%
lasted for
 
01:15:19.550 --> 01:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
years effectively a seizure of private
 
01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:23.320 align:start position:0%
property when this rule when this
 
01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
guideline from the CDC was ruled
 
01:15:28.590 --> 01:15:28.600 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional by the United States
 
01:15:32.709 --> 01:15:32.719 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court the CDC simply ignored the
 
01:15:35.189 --> 01:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court and continued trying to
 
01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:43.120 align:start position:0%

California licensed only to produce
 
01:15:49.550 --> 01:15:49.560 align:start position:0%

Chinese National with deep ties to the
 
01:15:54.510 --> 01:15:54.520 align:start position:0%
Chinese Communist Party was reported to
 
01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
local authorities for suspicious
 
01:16:00.830 --> 01:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
activity on Investigation the locals
 
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
discovered that the lab had dozens and
 
01:16:06.870 --> 01:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
dozens of samples of Highly dangerous
 
01:16:11.229 --> 01:16:11.239 align:start position:0%
dangerous pathogens on hand thousands of
 
01:16:16.350 --> 01:16:16.360 align:start position:0%
live lab mice and many human blood
 
01:16:18.669 --> 01:16:18.679 align:start position:0%
samples thanks to the Congressional
 
01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:20.719 align:start position:0%
report that was recently released we
 
01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
even know that there was a refrigerator
 
01:16:27.310 --> 01:16:27.320 align:start position:0%
labeled Ebola in
 
01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
Chinese when the locals contacted the
 
01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:35.360 align:start position:0%
CDC the CDC refused to come investigate
 
01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:36.750 align:start position:0%
CDC the CDC refused to come investigate
this

01:16:36.750 --> 01:16:36.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:16:39.270 --> 01:16:39.280 align:start position:0%
laboratory what did they do
 
01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
instead they ordered the immediate
 
01:16:44.990 --> 01:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
destruction of all of the samples and
 
01:16:46.149 --> 01:16:46.159 align:start position:0%
all of the
 
01:16:48.910 --> 01:16:48.920 align:start position:0%
evidence which made it impossible to
 
01:16:52.270 --> 01:16:52.280 align:start position:0%
determine the exact nature and extent of
 
01:16:54.070 --> 01:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
the threat
 
01:16:57.550 --> 01:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
make no mistake this was a clandestine
 
01:17:00.270 --> 01:17:00.280 align:start position:0%
biological warfare laboratory run by the
 
01:17:03.629 --> 01:17:03.639 align:start position:0%
Chinese government on us soil and the
 
01:17:06.310 --> 01:17:06.320 align:start position:0%
CDC covered it
 
01:17:10.350 --> 01:17:10.360 align:start position:0%
up these actions collectively are far
 
01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
more than mere
 
01:17:18.510 --> 01:17:18.520 align:start position:0%
incompetence the wh and the CDC are and
 
01:17:21.669 --> 01:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
have been acting as proxies of the
 
01:17:24.270 --> 01:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
Chinese Communist Party
 
01:17:26.910 --> 01:17:26.920 align:start position:0%
actively subverting American interests
 
01:17:29.629 --> 01:17:29.639 align:start position:0%
on behalf of a hostile nation that is
 
01:17:31.990 --> 01:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
waging unconventional warfare against
 
01:17:34.189 --> 01:17:34.199 align:start position:0%
the United States for those who are
 
01:17:36.709 --> 01:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
familiar with sunzu you will recognize
 
01:17:40.030 --> 01:17:40.040 align:start position:0%
this as Chinese military
 
01:17:43.030 --> 01:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
Doctrine these organizations represent
 
01:17:46.430 --> 01:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
an existential threat to our
 
01:17:51.470 --> 01:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:54.390 --> 01:17:54.400 align:start position:0%
self-defense and if I may end by
 
01:17:56.189 --> 01:17:56.199 align:start position:0%
answering a question I heard
 
01:17:58.950 --> 01:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
earlier we as legislators have no
 
01:18:01.830 --> 01:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
ability to bind legislators or future
 
01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
legislator this bill has no effect on
 
01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
legislators or future legislator as is
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
typical it is simply binding on the
 
01:18:13.350 --> 01:18:13.360 align:start position:0%
executive thank you and I will take
 
01:18:15.430 --> 01:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative for
 
01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
already answering a
 
01:18:21.550 --> 01:18:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:24.070 --> 01:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
Massa thank you Mr chairman and thank

you for taking my cron
 
01:18:28.870 --> 01:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
representative um you said in your
 
01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
testimony that uh ventilators created a
 
01:18:35.830 --> 01:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
more higher Mobility mobidity rate
 
01:18:38.149 --> 01:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
amongst patients could you tell me where
 
01:18:40.750 --> 01:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
your Source was for that information yes
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
that that is a fact that is widely
 
01:18:43.709 --> 01:18:43.719 align:start position:0%
recognized at this point among the
 
01:18:44.910 --> 01:18:44.920 align:start position:0%
medical community there have been
 
01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
multiple studies that have demonstrated
 
01:18:48.310 --> 01:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
this and I believe you can find that
 
01:18:50.590 --> 01:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
specifically in the Senate
 
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:54.480 align:start position:0%

don't but I can try to find that for you
thank

01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:04.440 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:19:08.750 --> 01:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
you other questions Pur seber yeah I
 
01:19:10.669 --> 01:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
just have sort of a comment and with all
 
01:19:13.830 --> 01:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
due respect um I'm originally from
 
01:19:18.229 --> 01:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
Atlanta home to the CDC no one knew um
 
01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:21.199 align:start position:0%
and I have I know a lot of people that H
 
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
that work there and
 
01:19:26.070 --> 01:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
they're not big doctors they just do
 
01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
they work at the CDC but um they're they
 
01:19:32.750 --> 01:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
happen to have a fire station their own
 
01:19:35.189 --> 01:19:35.199 align:start position:0%
fire station and so when you were
 
01:19:38.629 --> 01:19:38.639 align:start position:0%
mentioning um the destruction of you
 
01:19:40.590 --> 01:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
know the Ebola se you know they have
 
01:19:42.550 --> 01:19:42.560 align:start position:0%
different sections at the CDC where they
 
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
keep certain
 
01:19:47.070 --> 01:19:47.080 align:start position:0%
viruses and some are kept separate
 
01:19:49.270 --> 01:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
because the fire station knows to let a
 
01:19:51.870 --> 01:19:51.880 align:start position:0%
fire burn if something ever happens
 
01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
because the diseases need to burn versus
 
01:19:58.149 --> 01:19:58.159 align:start position:0%
being like sprayed with water and become
 
01:20:01.030 --> 01:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
further Airborne so I just wanted to
 
01:20:02.990 --> 01:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
reference that if you have a comment I
 
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
just that was more of a comment I guess
 
01:20:10.149 --> 01:20:10.159 align:start position:0%
I'm typically in a hearing we would
 
01:20:12.189 --> 01:20:12.199 align:start position:0%
somehow phrase that in the form of a
 
01:20:14.510 --> 01:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
question I should that was poorly worded
 
01:20:16.030 --> 01:20:16.040 align:start position:0%
would you would you believe or would you
 
01:20:18.030 --> 01:20:18.040 align:start position:0%
have a comment that was the question
 
01:20:19.629 --> 01:20:19.639 align:start position:0%
yeah do you have a response sure I
 
01:20:21.350 --> 01:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
believe I have I find a question in that
 
01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
but in this particular case with the
 
01:20:24.669 --> 01:20:24.679 align:start position:0%
laboratory that was discovered in
 
01:20:27.870 --> 01:20:27.880 align:start position:0%
California the CDC had no direct hand in
 
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
what happened they simply ordered the
 
01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
locals to destroy the evidence um it was
 
01:20:35.950 --> 01:20:35.960 align:start position:0%
it was part of the Congressional report
 
01:20:37.390 --> 01:20:37.400 align:start position:0%
that this should not have happened that
 
01:20:39.790 --> 01:20:39.800 align:start position:0%
the CDC should have investigated and
 
01:20:41.550 --> 01:20:41.560 align:start position:0%
they should have determined the exact
 
01:20:43.149 --> 01:20:43.159 align:start position:0%
nature of the threat that this
 
01:20:46.430 --> 01:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
clandestine laboratory
 
01:20:49.070 --> 01:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
posed other question representative
 
01:20:51.550 --> 01:20:51.560 align:start position:0%
Lloyd so in your testimony you had
 
01:20:54.750 --> 01:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned the propag Ganda around um
 
01:20:57.430 --> 01:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
certain lockdowns now um were you
 
01:21:01.229 --> 01:21:01.239 align:start position:0%
suggesting that uh these claims were
 
01:21:04.310 --> 01:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
exaggerated in order to exaggerate the
 
01:21:07.870 --> 01:21:07.880 align:start position:0%
claim that we needed to also lock down
 
01:21:11.310 --> 01:21:11.320 align:start position:0%
yes broadly so this uh the Chinese uh
 
01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:13.030 align:start position:0%
yes broadly so this uh the Chinese uh
government

01:21:13.030 --> 01:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:21:15.590 --> 01:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
undertook along with the release whether
 
01:21:17.310 --> 01:21:17.320 align:start position:0%
it was accidental or otherwise I can't
 
01:21:20.270 --> 01:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
say but along with the release of covid
 
01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
they undertook an advanced uh Psych iCal
 
01:21:25.270 --> 01:21:25.280 align:start position:0%
Warfare operation primarily using social
 
01:21:27.790 --> 01:21:27.800 align:start position:0%
media videos of people dropping dead in
 
01:21:30.189 --> 01:21:30.199 align:start position:0%
the streets again welding doors shut and
 
01:21:31.950 --> 01:21:31.960 align:start position:0%
all the things that happened because
 
01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
they had promulgated guidelines um for
 
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
lockdown that they wanted to convince
 
01:21:42.229 --> 01:21:42.239 align:start position:0%
the West broadly to adopt because that
 
01:21:44.669 --> 01:21:44.679 align:start position:0%
is part of their long-term plan to
 
01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
eclipse the West in uh economic and
 
01:21:51.110 --> 01:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
military activity um and I can point you
 
01:21:53.149 --> 01:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
to the gentleman from security studies
 
01:21:56.790 --> 01:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
group Michael J Waller um for far more
 
01:22:00.830 --> 01:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:13.870 --> 01:22:13.880 align:start position:0%
chaires uh I am really surprised of your
 
01:22:17.030 --> 01:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
testimony where is uh if you know where
 
01:22:21.149 --> 01:22:21.159 align:start position:0%
is uh Ted W where is he right now Ted
 
01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
Ros I I have no idea where he physically
 
01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
is at this exact moment he he is still
 
01:22:28.189 --> 01:22:28.199 align:start position:0%
in the position of the leadership over
 
01:22:30.709 --> 01:22:30.719 align:start position:0%
the world Health Health Organization
 
01:22:32.270 --> 01:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank
 
01:22:34.390 --> 01:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
you other
 
01:22:38.430 --> 01:22:38.440 align:start position:0%
questions representative krie so in your
 
01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
testimony uh you essentially testified
 
01:22:43.350 --> 01:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
that another tool of warfare that was
 
01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
used was social media so should this
 
01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
also be included maybe in terms of um
 
01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:51.550 align:start position:0%
also be included maybe in terms of um
protecting

01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:51.560 align:start position:0%
protecting
 
01:22:53.830 --> 01:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
Americans um thank you for the question
 
01:22:57.629 --> 01:22:57.639 align:start position:0%
and I I would say no um because there is
 
01:23:00.830 --> 01:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
only so much that we can and should do
 
01:23:03.709 --> 01:23:03.719 align:start position:0%
as a government actor in passing
 
01:23:06.870 --> 01:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
legislation um and to step into that
 
01:23:09.950 --> 01:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
territory would be for us to decide that
 
01:23:12.790 --> 01:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
we know better than the people and we
 
01:23:14.510 --> 01:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that the people have
 
01:23:17.470 --> 01:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
access to a broad variety of information
 
01:23:19.270 --> 01:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
so they can make these decisions for
 
01:23:20.990 --> 01:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
themselves so I don't think that that
 
01:23:22.669 --> 01:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
would be an appropriate Avenue for this
 
01:23:25.669 --> 01:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
particular bill so just to follow up if
 
01:23:27.629 --> 01:23:27.639 align:start position:0%
that's your belief then why would you
 
01:23:30.350 --> 01:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
want to restrict them from having access
 
01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
to CDC and wh
 
01:23:36.270 --> 01:23:36.280 align:start position:0%
data uh uh to clarify are we are we
 
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
speaking of people in general or I I
 
01:23:40.030 --> 01:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
don't believe there's anything in the
 
01:23:42.030 --> 01:23:42.040 align:start position:0%
bill that restricts the people from
 
01:23:43.550 --> 01:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
having access to that information this
 
01:23:45.189 --> 01:23:45.199 align:start position:0%
is purely binding on the executive
 
01:23:48.189 --> 01:23:48.199 align:start position:0%
branch so those people aren't allowed
 
01:23:50.590 --> 01:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
access but other people are no they're
 
01:23:52.149 --> 01:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
certainly allowed access in the private
 
01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
capacity it but they're not allowed as
 
01:23:58.590 --> 01:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
Government actors to utilize um wh or
 
01:24:02.270 --> 01:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
CDC promulgated things to justify their
 
01:24:03.910 --> 01:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
own actions if they want to take the
 
01:24:05.590 --> 01:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
same kind of actions they're going to
 
01:24:07.030 --> 01:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
have to justify it based on good
 
01:24:08.669 --> 01:24:08.679 align:start position:0%
information themselves that puts it sort
 
01:24:12.709 --> 01:24:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:15.189 --> 01:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
regulate other question representative
 
01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
who was first uh repon
 
01:24:20.229 --> 01:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
filat the the last sentence says
 
01:24:21.870 --> 01:24:21.880 align:start position:0%
furthermore any requirements mandates
 
01:24:23.709 --> 01:24:23.719 align:start position:0%
recommendations instructions or guidance
 
01:24:25.229 --> 01:24:25.239 align:start position:0%
by either organization shall not be used
 
01:24:28.110 --> 01:24:28.120 align:start position:0%
in the state to justify any max vaccine
 
01:24:29.550 --> 01:24:29.560 align:start position:0%
medical testing requirements and shall
 
01:24:32.110 --> 01:24:32.120 align:start position:0%
have no force or effect in New Hampshire
 
01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
this last sentence does not recom uh
 
01:24:37.430 --> 01:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
reference enforcement or the executive
 
01:24:40.390 --> 01:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
but the word justify is in the sentence
 
01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
which means that it could reference
 
01:24:46.030 --> 01:24:46.040 align:start position:0%
debate or uh con deliberation by a
 
01:24:48.709 --> 01:24:48.719 align:start position:0%
legislative body for example if
 
01:24:51.109 --> 01:24:51.119 align:start position:0%
I for example if I were to say on the
 
01:24:53.990 --> 01:24:54.000 align:start position:0%
floor of the house the CDC recommends
 
01:24:55.990 --> 01:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
everybody mask in the face of this
 
01:24:58.790 --> 01:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
pandemic that would be a justification
 
01:25:00.310 --> 01:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
and then if for the house were to then
 
01:25:02.790 --> 01:25:02.800 align:start position:0%
vote Upon A bill which would require
 
01:25:04.669 --> 01:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
individuals in the state to mask for a
 
01:25:07.149 --> 01:25:07.159 align:start position:0%
particular period of time that could be
 
01:25:08.629 --> 01:25:08.639 align:start position:0%
seen as part of the floor debate which
 
01:25:11.109 --> 01:25:11.119 align:start position:0%
were to justify that mask
 
01:25:14.270 --> 01:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
mandate and so to what extent does the
 
01:25:16.709 --> 01:25:16.719 align:start position:0%
final sentence comport with this the
 
01:25:18.750 --> 01:25:18.760 align:start position:0%
assertion that this doesn't only binds
 
01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:19.470 align:start position:0%
assertion that this doesn't only binds
the

01:25:19.470 --> 01:25:19.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
executive so it's it's it's General
 
01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
knowledge and generally understood um
 
01:25:26.629 --> 01:25:26.639 align:start position:0%
under our constitution in New Hampshire
 
01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
our legislature has no capacity to pass
 
01:25:31.510 --> 01:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
legislation that is binding on
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
legislators or future legislatures this
 
01:25:36.510 --> 01:25:36.520 align:start position:0%
would have no such effect our
 
01:25:39.470 --> 01:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
constitution is very clear very clear
 
01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
that our debate is so important in our
 
01:25:43.830 --> 01:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
deliberative sessions that it can form
 
01:25:46.830 --> 01:25:46.840 align:start position:0%
the basis of no complaint before anybody
 
01:25:49.470 --> 01:25:49.480 align:start position:0%
but the house itself so that's that's
 
01:25:51.149 --> 01:25:51.159 align:start position:0%
just it's not it's a non-issue it's a
 
01:25:53.430 --> 01:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
non- entity
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
re M MOA thank you again for taking my
 
01:25:59.870 --> 01:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
question um it seems like the problem is
 
01:26:03.790 --> 01:26:03.800 align:start position:0%
with the CDC so wouldn't it be more
 
01:26:07.070 --> 01:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate to contact the federal
 
01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
delegation and ask them to put in
 
01:26:12.990 --> 01:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
legislation regarding the accuracy of
 
01:26:17.070 --> 01:26:17.080 align:start position:0%
sources and testing used by the CDC uh
 
01:26:20.950 --> 01:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
thank you but no um it's it's it's my
 
01:26:22.350 --> 01:26:22.360 align:start position:0%
belief and I believe some of the others
 
01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
who are who are present that the federal
 
01:26:26.830 --> 01:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
government has thus far not been
 
01:26:29.390 --> 01:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
successful in reigning itself in and its
 
01:26:31.669 --> 01:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
own regulatory mechanisms in fact the
 
01:26:33.669 --> 01:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
CDC even ignored the Supreme Court
 
01:26:36.149 --> 01:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
ruling It's Time at this point for the
 
01:26:38.470 --> 01:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
states to take our own sovereignty that
 
01:26:41.510 --> 01:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
we have duly under our Constitution and
 
01:26:43.750 --> 01:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
say no we're not going to use your
 
01:26:45.950 --> 01:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
edicts that you have demonstrated are
 
01:26:48.149 --> 01:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
not in good faith to promulgate
 
01:26:49.830 --> 01:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
guidelines in our own State we have the
 
01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
we have our own capacity to do so we
 
01:26:53.590 --> 01:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
have our own professionals we have our
 
01:26:57.390 --> 01:26:57.400 align:start position:0%
own experts thank
 
01:27:00.990 --> 01:27:01.000 align:start position:0%
you uh I see a hand up uh representative
 
01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
Granger uh this is not how we usually do
 
01:27:04.990 --> 01:27:05.000 align:start position:0%
business but I want to recognize the
 
01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:15.350 align:start position:0%
business but I want to recognize the

01:28:17.709 --> 01:28:17.719 align:start position:0%
testimony specifically on the World
 
01:28:17.719 --> 01:28:18.709 align:start position:0%
testimony specifically on the World
Health

01:28:18.709 --> 01:28:18.719 align:start position:0%
Health
 
01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:20.639 align:start position:0%
Organization um I'll give you a little
 
01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
bit of a background on the World Health
 
01:28:25.629 --> 01:28:25.639 align:start position:0%
Organization and why I feel that is
 
01:28:29.350 --> 01:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
important um to actually support this
 
01:28:31.790 --> 01:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
bill so the World Health Organization
 
01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
was founded in 48 as the health arm of
 
01:28:37.709 --> 01:28:37.719 align:start position:0%
the United Nations and currently has 194
 
01:28:40.629 --> 01:28:40.639 align:start position:0%
member states initially it was 100%
 
01:28:42.870 --> 01:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
funded by the member states but in
 
01:28:45.550 --> 01:28:45.560 align:start position:0%
recent year this funding has changed
 
01:28:48.390 --> 01:28:48.400 align:start position:0%
today only 20% of the funding comes from
 
01:28:50.430 --> 01:28:50.440 align:start position:0%
the member states from the assessed
 
01:28:53.229 --> 01:28:53.239 align:start position:0%
contributions and 80% % comes from the
 
01:28:55.550 --> 01:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
voluntary contributions some of those
 
01:28:57.310 --> 01:28:57.320 align:start position:0%
contributions are coming from some of
 
01:28:59.030 --> 01:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
the member states but others are coming
 
01:29:01.550 --> 01:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
from the private Public Partnerships
 
01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
like uh Bill and Melinda Gates
 
01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
Foundation gab Alliance welcome trust
 
01:29:08.910 --> 01:29:08.920 align:start position:0%
and others these voluntary uh
 
01:29:11.030 --> 01:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
contributions are typically earmarked
 
01:29:13.629 --> 01:29:13.639 align:start position:0%
for specific projects or diseases
 
01:29:16.950 --> 01:29:16.960 align:start position:0%
meaning that who does not really have um
 
01:29:19.629 --> 01:29:19.639 align:start position:0%
control over that part of the budget in
 
01:29:23.390 --> 01:29:23.400 align:start position:0%
March of the 21st 25 heads of states and
 
01:29:26.189 --> 01:29:26.199 align:start position:0%
international agencies called for a new
 
01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
pandemic treaty that would protect the
 
01:29:30.750 --> 01:29:30.760 align:start position:0%
world from Future Health crisis
 
01:29:32.590 --> 01:29:32.600 align:start position:0%
currently the World Health Organization
 
01:29:34.790 --> 01:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
is simultaneously negotiating two
 
01:29:37.189 --> 01:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
documents one of them is the pandemic
 
01:29:40.629 --> 01:29:40.639 align:start position:0%
agreement also known as Accord treaty
 
01:29:44.109 --> 01:29:44.119 align:start position:0%
ca++ and zero draft it has changed names
 
01:29:46.030 --> 01:29:46.040 align:start position:0%
over time and the other one is the
 
01:29:48.510 --> 01:29:48.520 align:start position:0%
amendments to International Health
 
01:29:50.510 --> 01:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
regulations International Health
 
01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
regulations were actually adopted Ed in'
 
01:29:55.629 --> 01:29:55.639 align:start position:0%
69 and then amended in 2005 as a part of
 
01:29:59.669 --> 01:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
international law so um these drafts the
 
01:30:01.870 --> 01:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
draft International Health regulation
 
01:30:04.310 --> 01:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
amendments they would lay down new
 
01:30:06.390 --> 01:30:06.400 align:start position:0%
powers for the World Health Organization
 
01:30:08.790 --> 01:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
during Health emergencies and broaden
 
01:30:11.270 --> 01:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
the context with which uh they can be
 
01:30:13.709 --> 01:30:13.719 align:start position:0%
used the pandemic treaty on the other
 
01:30:15.870 --> 01:30:15.880 align:start position:0%
side is intended to support the
 
01:30:18.390 --> 01:30:18.400 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy finances and governance to
 
01:30:20.270 --> 01:30:20.280 align:start position:0%
underpin the expanded International
 
01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
Health regulations
 
01:30:25.149 --> 01:30:25.159 align:start position:0%
the war Health assembly is going to meet
 
01:30:28.270 --> 01:30:28.280 align:start position:0%
in May of this year to vote on adoption
 
01:30:31.189 --> 01:30:31.199 align:start position:0%
of both of these documents once approved
 
01:30:33.910 --> 01:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
by 2third of the World Health assembly
 
01:30:35.750 --> 01:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
the pandemic treaty will go to our
 
01:30:38.149 --> 01:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
Senate to be ratified and it will need
 
01:30:40.270 --> 01:30:40.280 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of the votes to be
 
01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
implemented as I mentioned before
 
01:30:44.470 --> 01:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
International Health regulations have
 
01:30:47.270 --> 01:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
already been adopted in 69 and then
 
01:30:50.709 --> 01:30:50.719 align:start position:0%
amended in 2005 they do not need any
 
01:30:53.229 --> 01:30:53.239 align:start position:0%
kind of special ratification by our
 
01:30:56.270 --> 01:30:56.280 align:start position:0%
Congress once they are adopted by the
 
01:30:58.950 --> 01:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
war Health assembly they are going to be
 
01:31:01.750 --> 01:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
implemented within 12 months unless the
 
01:31:03.910 --> 01:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
country member State specifically says
 
01:31:05.229 --> 01:31:05.239 align:start position:0%
we will not
 
01:31:07.510 --> 01:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
comply so first we're going to discuss
 
01:31:09.189 --> 01:31:09.199 align:start position:0%
the amendments to the international
 
01:31:09.199 --> 01:31:10.109 align:start position:0%
the amendments to the international
Health

01:31:10.109 --> 01:31:10.119 align:start position:0%
Health
 
01:31:12.430 --> 01:31:12.440 align:start position:0%
regulations the proposed amendments to
 
01:31:14.070 --> 01:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
the international Health regulations
 
01:31:16.550 --> 01:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
would give who authority over member
 
01:31:19.229 --> 01:31:19.239 align:start position:0%
states by changing the boarding so in
 
01:31:21.990 --> 01:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
the past their recommendations were nonb
 
01:31:24.070 --> 01:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
in they were recommendations but the
 
01:31:26.109 --> 01:31:26.119 align:start position:0%
non-binding has been stricken out and
 
01:31:29.070 --> 01:31:29.080 align:start position:0%
these are going to become binding
 
01:31:31.070 --> 01:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
recommendations that will now mandate
 
01:31:33.390 --> 01:31:33.400 align:start position:0%
the member states to follow instead just
 
01:31:34.709 --> 01:31:34.719 align:start position:0%
consider these
 
01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
recommendations States will accept the
 
01:31:39.950 --> 01:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
who as the authority in international
 
01:31:42.470 --> 01:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
Public Health emergencies and this is in
 
01:31:45.310 --> 01:31:45.320 align:start position:0%
the article one I gave you all um some
 
01:31:48.590 --> 01:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:51.550 --> 01:31:51.560 align:start position:0%
over the Amendments expanded the scope
 
01:31:53.870 --> 01:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
of the do documents from public health
 
01:31:56.709 --> 01:31:56.719 align:start position:0%
risk to all risk that might affect
 
01:31:58.990 --> 01:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
public health and those will include
 
01:32:02.430 --> 01:32:02.440 align:start position:0%
risk to animals ecosystems and
 
01:32:05.310 --> 01:32:05.320 align:start position:0%
climate specifically the article 18 of
 
01:32:07.109 --> 01:32:07.119 align:start position:0%
the Amendments will change the
 
01:32:08.790 --> 01:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
definition of the public health
 
01:32:11.550 --> 01:32:11.560 align:start position:0%
emergency of international concern to
 
01:32:13.790 --> 01:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
include not only actual but also
 
01:32:16.830 --> 01:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
potential concern that the general um
 
01:32:19.990 --> 01:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
director General would have so to give
 
01:32:22.350 --> 01:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
everyone an example let's say there is
 
01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
an outbreak of something in Jungle of
 
01:32:27.629 --> 01:32:27.639 align:start position:0%
Brazil and the who hears about it they
 
01:32:30.149 --> 01:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
send their team in and the team says
 
01:32:32.629 --> 01:32:32.639 align:start position:0%
well we're concerned the country itself
 
01:32:34.070 --> 01:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
might say this is really not a big
 
01:32:36.310 --> 01:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
concern this is something that happens
 
01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
this time of year every time if they
 
01:32:40.390 --> 01:32:40.400 align:start position:0%
decide that this is of concern they can
 
01:32:42.750 --> 01:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
declare Public Health Emergency of
 
01:32:45.910 --> 01:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
international concern by the article 18
 
01:32:48.629 --> 01:32:48.639 align:start position:0%
and I gave you guys an example of that
 
01:32:51.669 --> 01:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
in article 18 the who then would have
 
01:32:53.950 --> 01:32:53.960 align:start position:0%
have the powers to decide to close the
 
01:32:57.189 --> 01:32:57.199 align:start position:0%
borders to restrict travel require proof
 
01:33:00.149 --> 01:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
vaccination or other prophylaxis require
 
01:33:02.709 --> 01:33:02.719 align:start position:0%
vaccination Place suspects under Public
 
01:33:05.590 --> 01:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
Health observation Implement quarantine
 
01:33:09.310 --> 01:33:09.320 align:start position:0%
isolation tracing refuse entry of uh
 
01:33:12.629 --> 01:33:12.639 align:start position:0%
suspects and affected persons and refuse
 
01:33:15.030 --> 01:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
entry of unaffected persons to um
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
affected areas Implement exit screening
 
01:33:19.950 --> 01:33:19.960 align:start position:0%
and restrictions so the World Health
 
01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
Organization by this article in director
 
01:33:24.669 --> 01:33:24.679 align:start position:0%
General by declaring this Public Health
 
01:33:27.270 --> 01:33:27.280 align:start position:0%
Emergency of international concern would
 
01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
be able to close down that area whether
 
01:33:31.709 --> 01:33:31.719 align:start position:0%
the country agrees or
 
01:33:34.990 --> 01:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
not the who will have power to designate
 
01:33:37.030 --> 01:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
opinions or information as
 
01:33:38.830 --> 01:33:38.840 align:start position:0%
misinformation or
 
01:33:40.910 --> 01:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
disinformation and it can require
 
01:33:42.790 --> 01:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
country state governments to intervene
 
01:33:44.830 --> 01:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
and stop such expression and
 
01:33:47.350 --> 01:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
dissemination obviously that will
 
01:33:49.750 --> 01:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
interfere with US Constitution and it's
 
01:33:52.270 --> 01:33:52.280 align:start position:0%
Inc incompatible with Universal
 
01:33:55.189 --> 01:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
Declaration of Human Rights the specific
 
01:33:57.669 --> 01:33:57.679 align:start position:0%
article is article 44 in the Amendments
 
01:34:00.189 --> 01:34:00.199 align:start position:0%
of international Health
 
01:34:02.830 --> 01:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
regulations after declaring an emergency
 
01:34:04.629 --> 01:34:04.639 align:start position:0%
director General will also have powers
 
01:34:06.990 --> 01:34:07.000 align:start position:0%
to instruct the governments to provide
 
01:34:08.790 --> 01:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
the World Health Organization and other
 
01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
countries with resources funds and
 
01:34:13.109 --> 01:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
commodities countries will also give
 
01:34:15.109 --> 01:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
power to the World Health Organization
 
01:34:17.510 --> 01:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
over patent law and intellectual
 
01:34:19.870 --> 01:34:19.880 align:start position:0%
property including control of
 
01:34:22.350 --> 01:34:22.360 align:start position:0%
manufacturing commodities to be relevant
 
01:34:24.030 --> 01:34:24.040 align:start position:0%
to the potential or actual health
 
01:34:26.990 --> 01:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
problem that who considers of
 
01:34:29.870 --> 01:34:29.880 align:start position:0%
Interest so to summarize this draft of
 
01:34:31.390 --> 01:34:31.400 align:start position:0%
the amendments to International Health
 
01:34:33.669 --> 01:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
regulation it will expand the definition
 
01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:35.880 align:start position:0%
of pandemic and health emergencies
 
01:34:37.910 --> 01:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
including the introduction of potential
 
01:34:41.310 --> 01:34:41.320 align:start position:0%
for harm rather than actual harm it also

explains the definition of Health
 
01:34:45.189 --> 01:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
Products that fall under this to include
 
01:34:48.229 --> 01:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
any commodity or process that may impact
 
01:34:50.590 --> 01:34:50.600 align:start position:0%
on the response or improve quality of
 
01:34:53.390 --> 01:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
life it will change the recommendations
 
01:34:55.149 --> 01:34:55.159 align:start position:0%
of the international Health regulations
 
01:34:57.030 --> 01:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
from non-binding to mandatory
 
01:34:59.149 --> 01:34:59.159 align:start position:0%
instructions that the states will have

to undertake and follow and
 
01:35:04.430 --> 01:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
implement it will solidify the director

General's ability to independently
 
01:35:09.189 --> 01:35:09.199 align:start position:0%
declare emergencies it will set up an
 
01:35:11.229 --> 01:35:11.239 align:start position:0%
extensive surveillance process in all
 
01:35:14.590 --> 01:35:14.600 align:start position:0%
states which who will verify regularly
 
01:35:17.470 --> 01:35:17.480 align:start position:0%
through a county review mechanism it
 
01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
will enable wh to share country data
 
01:35:24.310 --> 01:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
without consent it will give who control
 
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
over certain country resources including
 
01:35:29.470 --> 01:35:29.480 align:start position:0%

intellectual property and knowhow it
 
01:35:36.629 --> 01:35:36.639 align:start position:0%
will ensure the national support for
 
01:35:39.550 --> 01:35:39.560 align:start position:0%
promotion of censorship activities by
 
01:35:42.669 --> 01:35:42.679 align:start position:0%
who to prevent contrary approaches and
 
01:35:44.669 --> 01:35:44.679 align:start position:0%
concerns from being freely
 
01:35:47.310 --> 01:35:47.320 align:start position:0%
disseminated it will change existing
 
01:35:48.990 --> 01:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
International Health regulation
 
01:35:51.510 --> 01:35:51.520 align:start position:0%

medical examination and medication of
 
01:36:04.189 --> 01:36:04.199 align:start position:0%
individuals so the next uh document that
 
01:36:07.030 --> 01:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
they are currently negotiating as well
 
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
is the pandemic treaty also known as
 
01:36:12.189 --> 01:36:12.199 align:start position:0%
Accord agreement
 
01:36:16.270 --> 01:36:16.280 align:start position:0%
ca++ and zero draft they kept changing
 
01:36:18.550 --> 01:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
the name as the public was responding to
 
01:36:21.470 --> 01:36:21.480 align:start position:0%
this document so the treaty would set up
 
01:36:24.390 --> 01:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
Global Supply Network overseen by who it
 
01:36:27.030 --> 01:36:27.040 align:start position:0%
will set up a governing body under wh
 
01:36:30.510 --> 01:36:30.520 align:start position:0%
offices a new who Secretariat and
 
01:36:32.590 --> 01:36:32.600 align:start position:0%
Conference of the parties to oversee the
 
01:36:35.790 --> 01:36:35.800 align:start position:0%

01:36:37.750 --> 01:36:37.760 align:start position:0%

National and international level to

control the information flow and Free
 
01:36:45.950 --> 01:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
Speech this is under article 18 of the
 
01:36:49.070 --> 01:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
treaty um in number one it will instruct
 
01:36:51.310 --> 01:36:51.320 align:start position:0%
the parties to combat false mislead
 
01:36:53.350 --> 01:36:53.360 align:start position:0%
leing misinformation and
 
01:36:55.229 --> 01:36:55.239 align:start position:0%
disinformation and anything that's
 
01:36:57.270 --> 01:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
considered false misleading
 
01:36:59.790 --> 01:36:59.800 align:start position:0%
misinformation or disinformation will be
 
01:37:03.270 --> 01:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
something that goes against what wh says
 
01:37:06.109 --> 01:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
under article three number two states
 
01:37:08.149 --> 01:37:08.159 align:start position:0%
have in ACC accordance with the charter
 
01:37:10.149 --> 01:37:10.159 align:start position:0%
of the United Nations and general

Sovereign right to legislate and
 
01:37:16.709 --> 01:37:16.719 align:start position:0%
Implement legislation in pursuance of
 
01:37:17.990 --> 01:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
their health
 
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
policies this specific language fails to
 
01:37:24.590 --> 01:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
address the issue of the W wh assuming
 
01:37:27.149 --> 01:37:27.159 align:start position:0%
sovereignty for health matters Over
 
01:37:29.629 --> 01:37:29.639 align:start position:0%
States through the treaty and in the
 
01:37:30.790 --> 01:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
event of the
 
01:37:34.229 --> 01:37:34.239 align:start position:0%
pandemic under article four treaty
 
01:37:36.390 --> 01:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
directs Nation to surveil for and
 
01:37:38.830 --> 01:37:38.840 align:start position:0%
perform genetic sequences of potential
 
01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
pandemic pathogens they find and to
 
01:37:45.149 --> 01:37:45.159 align:start position:0%
safely handle them under article six the
 
01:37:47.550 --> 01:37:47.560 align:start position:0%
parties will not only surveil for but
 
01:37:49.709 --> 01:37:49.719 align:start position:0%
will share the pathogens with pandemic
 
01:37:52.109 --> 01:37:52.119 align:start position:0%
potential and as they they are spe
 
01:37:55.109 --> 01:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
established in article 12 the pathogens
 
01:37:58.390 --> 01:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
are identified to infect humans have
 
01:38:01.350 --> 01:38:01.360 align:start position:0%
high transmissibility and are capable of
 
01:38:03.470 --> 01:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
widespread in human population are
 
01:38:06.070 --> 01:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
highly violent making them likely to
 
01:38:07.629 --> 01:38:07.639 align:start position:0%
cause significant morbidity and
 
01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
mortality in humans EXC excuse me Dr l a
 
01:38:13.830 --> 01:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
couple things real quick um I'm looking
 
01:38:16.030 --> 01:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
for your written testimonies that come
 
01:38:19.430 --> 01:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
coming this way okay uh that's on us not
 
01:38:21.830 --> 01:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
you no no problem I wanted to what what
 
01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
you were referring to and if you could
 
01:38:27.229 --> 01:38:27.239 align:start position:0%
get me a copy of this and if if we could
 
01:38:30.189 --> 01:38:30.199 align:start position:0%
ask you to uh kind of take a minute or
 
01:38:32.589 --> 01:38:32.599 align:start position:0%
two to uh focus on
 
01:38:35.149 --> 01:38:35.159 align:start position:0%
your remaining key point because we do
 
01:38:37.990 --> 01:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
have some of folks that that uh have
 
01:38:41.270 --> 01:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
been waiting so so proceed I'm towards
 
01:38:44.550 --> 01:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
the end anyway um another thing that is
 
01:38:46.430 --> 01:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
very important to understand that this
 
01:38:49.830 --> 01:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh pandemic Tre specifically it's um
 
01:38:51.950 --> 01:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
this one Health agenda
 
01:38:54.430 --> 01:38:54.440 align:start position:0%
that is actually under Article Five the
 
01:38:56.430 --> 01:38:56.440 align:start position:0%
one Health agenda doesn't have specific
 
01:38:58.270 --> 01:38:58.280 align:start position:0%
meaning if you look at the wording of it
 
01:39:00.229 --> 01:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult to understand what
 
01:39:03.030 --> 01:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
they mean but one Health agenda claims
 
01:39:04.629 --> 01:39:04.639 align:start position:0%
that humans animals plants and
 
01:39:07.629 --> 01:39:07.639 align:start position:0%
ecosystems are all part of one Health
 
01:39:09.629 --> 01:39:09.639 align:start position:0%
and that everything on the pl planet is
 
01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
interrelated and affects Health
 
01:39:13.990 --> 01:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
essentially under the guise of one
 
01:39:17.070 --> 01:39:17.080 align:start position:0%
Health wh would have control of life on
 
01:39:19.350 --> 01:39:19.360 align:start position:0%
the planet they will not need to
 
01:39:21.470 --> 01:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
prioritize human health but but rather
 
01:39:22.870 --> 01:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
they could choose to balance human
 
01:39:25.189 --> 01:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
health with animal and plant Health as
 
01:39:27.350 --> 01:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
well as envir Environmental Health in
 
01:39:29.270 --> 01:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
the name of climate
 
01:39:34.229 --> 01:39:34.239 align:start position:0%
change so to conclude why do I speak
 
01:39:36.709 --> 01:39:36.719 align:start position:0%
very strongly against what wh is
 
01:39:39.430 --> 01:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
currently doing they are simultaneously
 
01:39:41.350 --> 01:39:41.360 align:start position:0%
creating these two documents pandemic
 
01:39:42.709 --> 01:39:42.719 align:start position:0%
treaty and the amendments to
 
01:39:45.390 --> 01:39:45.400 align:start position:0%
International Health
 
01:39:48.229 --> 01:39:48.239 align:start position:0%
regulations in the event of future
 
01:39:50.070 --> 01:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
pandemics and they are telling us that
 
01:39:51.550 --> 01:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
the one will happen
 
01:39:53.589 --> 01:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
we're hearing about this disease X it's
 
01:39:56.149 --> 01:39:56.159 align:start position:0%
going to be 20 times deadlier we have no
 
01:39:58.229 --> 01:39:58.239 align:start position:0%
idea what it is that's what they're
 
01:40:00.149 --> 01:40:00.159 align:start position:0%
saying but it's going to be deadlier so
 
01:40:01.830 --> 01:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
we have to do something for future
 
01:40:03.870 --> 01:40:03.880 align:start position:0%
generations and our children that's one
 
01:40:05.510 --> 01:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
of their favorite
 
01:40:08.750 --> 01:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
phrases if these documents are passed in
 
01:40:10.790 --> 01:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
May in
 
01:40:14.229 --> 01:40:14.239 align:start position:0%
Geneva the pandemic treaty would give
 
01:40:16.270 --> 01:40:16.280 align:start position:0%
them and the amendments to International
 
01:40:17.990 --> 01:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
Health regulations would give them
 
01:40:19.750 --> 01:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
powers in the event of another pandemic
 
01:40:21.030 --> 01:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
to actually close down our country
 
01:40:23.910 --> 01:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
countries to issue these things and say
 
01:40:27.109 --> 01:40:27.119 align:start position:0%
you cannot travel you have to use these
 
01:40:29.030 --> 01:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
tests you have to use these medications
 
01:40:30.910 --> 01:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
you have to use these vaccinations for
 
01:40:34.270 --> 01:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
your population we will not have a
 
01:40:36.790 --> 01:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
discussion that we're having right now
 
01:40:39.229 --> 01:40:39.239 align:start position:0%
their recommendations now are going to
 
01:40:41.669 --> 01:40:41.679 align:start position:0%
become obligations and the countries
 
01:40:44.629 --> 01:40:44.639 align:start position:0%
will have to comply not only will will
 
01:40:46.350 --> 01:40:46.360 align:start position:0%
have to comply on the medical front
 
01:40:49.030 --> 01:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
we'll have to share all our data patents
 
01:40:51.350 --> 01:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
and different Commodities as they see it
 
01:40:54.310 --> 01:40:54.320 align:start position:0%
so they can change it in very Equitable
 
01:40:57.030 --> 01:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
way the word Equity is all over the
 
01:41:00.109 --> 01:41:00.119 align:start position:0%
document in my opinion this does take
 
01:41:00.119 --> 01:41:00.990 align:start position:0%
document in my opinion this does take
our

01:41:00.990 --> 01:41:01.000 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
sovereignty under attack because if we
 
01:41:07.109 --> 01:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
have a supernational agency and body
 
01:41:09.669 --> 01:41:09.679 align:start position:0%
tell us what we can and cannot
 
01:41:12.629 --> 01:41:12.639 align:start position:0%
do and that we have to close our borders
 
01:41:15.270 --> 01:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
not allow people in and out that is an
 
01:41:17.270 --> 01:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
attack on the sovereignty of the states
 
01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
and especially United States of America
 
01:41:22.629 --> 01:41:22.639 align:start position:0%
and then looking at the whole censorship
 
01:41:25.470 --> 01:41:25.480 align:start position:0%
Clause if anyone so if I feel that what
 
01:41:27.390 --> 01:41:27.400 align:start position:0%
they're telling me is not correct that
 
01:41:28.910 --> 01:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
this person in front of me needs a
 
01:41:30.510 --> 01:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
specific treatment but that's not the
 
01:41:32.669 --> 01:41:32.679 align:start position:0%
treatment that they allow and if I say
 
01:41:35.030 --> 01:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
that publicly they will consider that
 
01:41:37.589 --> 01:41:37.599 align:start position:0%
misinformation disinformation and then
 
01:41:41.229 --> 01:41:41.239 align:start position:0%
they they require my state to censor me
 
01:41:43.109 --> 01:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
and I do believe that that infringes on
 
01:41:45.750 --> 01:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
my freedom of speech as well thank you
 
01:41:48.070 --> 01:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you thank you Dr
 
01:41:49.950 --> 01:41:49.960 align:start position:0%
Lindley uh for the record could you
 
01:41:52.629 --> 01:41:52.639 align:start position:0%
again just uh tell us uh I know you
 
01:41:54.430 --> 01:41:54.440 align:start position:0%
travel to get here who who who are you
 
01:41:56.950 --> 01:41:56.960 align:start position:0%

medicine in Texas okay any other
 
01:42:09.109 --> 01:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
questions representative filot thank you
 
01:42:11.589 --> 01:42:11.599 align:start position:0%
for your testimony the the Senate of the
 
01:42:13.350 --> 01:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
United States would have to ratify both
 
01:42:14.629 --> 01:42:14.639 align:start position:0%
of these treaties for them to become
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
operative correct no sir uh the pandemic
 
01:42:19.750 --> 01:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
agreement or treaty does have to go to
 
01:42:22.189 --> 01:42:22.199 align:start position:0%
Senate and be ratified by 2/3 of the V
 
01:42:24.109 --> 01:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
vote the international Health
 
01:42:28.229 --> 01:42:28.239 align:start position:0%
regulations were already adopted in 69
 
01:42:30.550 --> 01:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
and then amended in 2005 and they're
 
01:42:32.750 --> 01:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
part of our international law they do
 
01:42:34.790 --> 01:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
not have to be ratified I have a chart
 
01:42:37.229 --> 01:42:37.239 align:start position:0%
at the end of the document that they
 
01:42:39.430 --> 01:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
will pass to you and it says
 
01:42:42.189 --> 01:42:42.199 align:start position:0%
specifically we we actually once the
 
01:42:44.510 --> 01:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
World Health assembly says that they are
 
01:42:45.990 --> 01:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
okay with all of the Amendments or they
 
01:42:48.229 --> 01:42:48.239 align:start position:0%
approve certain amendments we will have
 
01:42:50.229 --> 01:42:50.239 align:start position:0%
12 months to say that we don't accept
 
01:42:54.790 --> 01:42:54.800 align:start position:0%
that and which Statute in US law says
 
01:42:56.790 --> 01:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
that I'm not the lawyer so you're going
 
01:42:58.149 --> 01:42:58.159 align:start position:0%
to have to find a lawyer to give you the
 
01:43:00.350 --> 01:43:00.360 align:start position:0%
actual statutes the the other point that
 
01:43:02.310 --> 01:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
I would like to make is are you aware of
 
01:43:04.589 --> 01:43:04.599 align:start position:0%
the fact that in the zero draft the
 
01:43:07.470 --> 01:43:07.480 align:start position:0%
first sentences reaffirming the
 
01:43:09.310 --> 01:43:09.320 align:start position:0%
principle of sovereignty of States
 
01:43:11.229 --> 01:43:11.239 align:start position:0%
parties and addressing Public Health
 
01:43:13.669 --> 01:43:13.679 align:start position:0%
matters notably pandemic prevention
 
01:43:15.510 --> 01:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
preparedness response and Health Systems
 
01:43:17.870 --> 01:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
recovery and the word sovereignty and
 
01:43:19.629 --> 01:43:19.639 align:start position:0%
affirming sovereignty appears four times
 
01:43:21.709 --> 01:43:21.719 align:start position:0%
throughout the document
 
01:43:24.750 --> 01:43:24.760 align:start position:0%
I'm aware but my
 
01:43:29.070 --> 01:43:29.080 align:start position:0%
um my opinion is that if you have a
 
01:43:32.350 --> 01:43:32.360 align:start position:0%
agency who declares a pandemic emergency
 
01:43:34.709 --> 01:43:34.719 align:start position:0%
of international concern in your area
 
01:43:36.229 --> 01:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
and tells you that you have to close the
 
01:43:38.830 --> 01:43:38.840 align:start position:0%
borders that your people cannot leave
 
01:43:40.470 --> 01:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
that maybe put them in quarantine
 
01:43:42.629 --> 01:43:42.639 align:start position:0%
isolation that that actually infringes
 
01:43:45.629 --> 01:43:45.639 align:start position:0%
of the sovereignty of that
 
01:43:47.950 --> 01:43:47.960 align:start position:0%
country other
 
01:43:51.910 --> 01:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Dr Dr
 
01:43:53.910 --> 01:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
um representative Lloyd had a question
 
01:43:55.510 --> 01:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
rep representative Lloyd you know her
 
01:43:57.830 --> 01:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
already all right thank you thank you
 
01:44:01.669 --> 01:44:01.679 align:start position:0%
thank you um and thank you chair um so I
 
01:44:03.589 --> 01:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
guess with all due respects because I
 
01:44:06.350 --> 01:44:06.360 align:start position:0%
know you're a medical professional um so
 
01:44:09.589 --> 01:44:09.599 align:start position:0%
wouldn't the fact that this and I
 
01:44:11.189 --> 01:44:11.199 align:start position:0%
understand your concern about the
 
01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
infringement upon free speech I
 
01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:14.639 align:start position:0%
understand that side of it but also
 
01:44:17.629 --> 01:44:17.639 align:start position:0%
wouldn't this prevent um situations that
 
01:44:20.030 --> 01:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
we had gotten into with things like
 
01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
unapproved treatments having happened um
 
01:44:25.350 --> 01:44:25.360 align:start position:0%
during the covid pandemic things like
 
01:44:30.030 --> 01:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
ican being um taken or you know bleach
 
01:44:32.149 --> 01:44:32.159 align:start position:0%
or any of those types of things thank
 
01:44:35.310 --> 01:44:35.320 align:start position:0%
you for your question so as a physician
 
01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
um I treat a person in front of me and
 
01:44:41.470 --> 01:44:41.480 align:start position:0%
also I am allowed to to use medications
 
01:44:43.750 --> 01:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
that were not specifically approved for
 
01:44:46.270 --> 01:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
that intention so long as I discuss with
 
01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
my patient risk and benefits and uh as
 
01:44:52.390 --> 01:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
if I follow science and literature and
 
01:44:54.390 --> 01:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
see that there is a reason for certain
 
01:44:57.910 --> 01:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
things even Dr fouchi said that during
 
01:45:00.430 --> 01:45:00.440 align:start position:0%
um that for Corona virus's
 
01:45:02.910 --> 01:45:02.920 align:start position:0%
hydroxychloroquine is uh well known to
 
01:45:06.350 --> 01:45:06.360 align:start position:0%
work well he said it before the pandemic
 
01:45:09.070 --> 01:45:09.080 align:start position:0%
and then um the contention of many of
 
01:45:11.109 --> 01:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
our physician who have treated our
 
01:45:13.310 --> 01:45:13.320 align:start position:0%
patients and who did it really well is
 
01:45:15.189 --> 01:45:15.199 align:start position:0%
that the reason we were not allowed to
 
01:45:17.669 --> 01:45:17.679 align:start position:0%
actually treat patients was so that
 
01:45:19.709 --> 01:45:19.719 align:start position:0%
certain things could be put in place
 
01:45:21.709 --> 01:45:21.719 align:start position:0%
like emergency use authorization of the
 
01:45:24.270 --> 01:45:24.280 align:start position:0%
vaccines that could be approved another
 
01:45:27.189 --> 01:45:27.199 align:start position:0%
thing um to consider is when the
 
01:45:29.750 --> 01:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
pandemic started one thing that never
 
01:45:31.750 --> 01:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
made sense and it will never make sense
 
01:45:36.510 --> 01:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
to me is as Physicians we were told tell
 
01:45:39.149 --> 01:45:39.159 align:start position:0%
your patient to stay home until they can
 
01:45:42.709 --> 01:45:42.719 align:start position:0%
breathe and then tell them to go to the
 
01:45:46.030 --> 01:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
hospital so as a physician if in an
 
01:45:48.070 --> 01:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
event that something happens I would
 
01:45:50.030 --> 01:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
expect myself and my colleagues to be
 
01:45:52.790 --> 01:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
the first wants to go in even if we
 
01:45:54.950 --> 01:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
don't know what it is because it's our
 
01:45:58.229 --> 01:45:58.239 align:start position:0%
job to save lives so I would say that
 
01:46:01.109 --> 01:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
the intentions of CDC and the guidelines
 
01:46:02.910 --> 01:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
from these different organizations were
 
01:46:05.070 --> 01:46:05.080 align:start position:0%
wrong from the
 
01:46:07.390 --> 01:46:07.400 align:start position:0%
beginning thank you again Dr Lindley I
 
01:46:09.310 --> 01:46:09.320 align:start position:0%
know you have a plane to
 
01:46:11.589 --> 01:46:11.599 align:start position:0%
catch thank and thank you again for the
 
01:46:13.270 --> 01:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
written testimony that's always as I
 
01:46:15.149 --> 01:46:15.159 align:start position:0%
said appreciated okay we have seven more
 
01:46:17.350 --> 01:46:17.360 align:start position:0%
cards most of whom are asking for uh 2
 
01:46:20.229 --> 01:46:20.239 align:start position:0%
minutes or 3 minutes uh so let's get to
 
01:46:20.239 --> 01:46:20.950 align:start position:0%
minutes or 3 minutes uh so let's get to
them

01:46:20.950 --> 01:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:46:23.350 --> 01:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
and again is in the past uh we're
 
01:46:25.910 --> 01:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
looking the committee is looking for uh
 
01:46:29.270 --> 01:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
new new information so any points that
 
01:46:32.550 --> 01:46:32.560 align:start position:0%
have already been made uh don't feel a
 
01:46:34.750 --> 01:46:34.760 align:start position:0%
need to reiterate we're looking for for
 
01:46:37.350 --> 01:46:37.360 align:start position:0%
some new uh perspectives and new
 
01:46:40.629 --> 01:46:40.639 align:start position:0%
information as we uh as we finish up
 
01:46:44.189 --> 01:46:44.199 align:start position:0%
here uh representative Burnham is here
 
01:46:46.910 --> 01:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
um she asked for a minute we can do that
 
01:46:49.390 --> 01:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
easily representative Burnham thank
 
01:46:49.400 --> 01:46:52.669 align:start position:0%
easily representative Burnham thank
you

01:46:52.669 --> 01:46:52.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:54.430 --> 01:46:54.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and committee
 
01:46:57.510 --> 01:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
members um I'm going to try to skip over
 
01:46:59.589 --> 01:46:59.599 align:start position:0%
because some of the things are um
 
01:47:03.070 --> 01:47:03.080 align:start position:0%
replicated already so
 
01:47:07.550 --> 01:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
um so we can't necessarily change what
 
01:47:09.149 --> 01:47:09.159 align:start position:0%
happened in the past but we can learn
 
01:47:10.510 --> 01:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
from that and move forward and one of
 
01:47:12.550 --> 01:47:12.560 align:start position:0%
the things that I did want to bring up
 
01:47:14.870 --> 01:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
is at the state's level and how New
 
01:47:17.430 --> 01:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire handled the mandates coming
 
01:47:18.510 --> 01:47:18.520 align:start position:0%
down from the
 
01:47:21.470 --> 01:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
CDC every day that's we heard was about
 
01:47:23.990 --> 01:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
what the CDC recommends and we were
 
01:47:26.510 --> 01:47:26.520 align:start position:0%
pretty much imposed on those
 
01:47:28.390 --> 01:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
recommendations no matter where we went
 
01:47:30.709 --> 01:47:30.719 align:start position:0%
whether it was grocery shopping or to
 
01:47:35.629 --> 01:47:35.639 align:start position:0%
church or whatever so um however I Look
 
01:47:38.589 --> 01:47:38.599 align:start position:0%
to what other states did and one in
 
01:47:41.550 --> 01:47:41.560 align:start position:0%
particular was South Dakota um Governor
 
01:47:45.030 --> 01:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
Christy gnome did a impeccable job
 
01:47:48.870 --> 01:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
believing and trusting in her residence
 
01:47:51.390 --> 01:47:51.400 align:start position:0%
of South Dakota in and and for them to
 
01:47:56.109 --> 01:47:56.119 align:start position:0%
follow what is the best practices so
 
01:47:58.990 --> 01:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
um I actually pulled up an
 
01:48:02.550 --> 01:48:02.560 align:start position:0%
article from July 27th
 
01:48:04.990 --> 01:48:05.000 align:start position:0%
2021 and it says that Governor chrisye
 
01:48:07.350 --> 01:48:07.360 align:start position:0%
gome says South Dakota will not have
 
01:48:09.270 --> 01:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
mask mandate following the cdc's
 
01:48:11.950 --> 01:48:11.960 align:start position:0%
announcement Tuesday urging urging
 
01:48:14.070 --> 01:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and unvaccinated people to
 
01:48:17.750 --> 01:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
wear masks in indoor areas as the Delta
 
01:48:19.790 --> 01:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
variant of the covid-19 surges Across
 
01:48:21.830 --> 01:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
the Nation
 
01:48:25.030 --> 01:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
the shifts the CDC shifts their position
 
01:48:27.070 --> 01:48:27.080 align:start position:0%
again gome tweeted late Tuesday
 
01:48:29.629 --> 01:48:29.639 align:start position:0%
afternoon South Dakota's cases remain
 
01:48:32.270 --> 01:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
low if you're worried about the virus
 
01:48:34.229 --> 01:48:34.239 align:start position:0%
you're free to get vaccinated wear a
 
01:48:36.830 --> 01:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
mask or stay at home but we won't be
 
01:48:39.669 --> 01:48:39.679 align:start position:0%
mandating anything and the cdc's
 
01:48:42.589 --> 01:48:42.599 align:start position:0%
inconsistency doesn't help the American
 
01:48:45.550 --> 01:48:45.560 align:start position:0%
people the CDC issued new
 
01:48:47.910 --> 01:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
guidance that fully vaccinated people
 
01:48:50.310 --> 01:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
should wear masks indoors and high trans
 
01:48:52.270 --> 01:48:52.280 align:start position:0%
Mission areas as covid-19 numbers
 
01:48:54.870 --> 01:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
continue to rise and the CDC has also
 
01:48:56.430 --> 01:48:56.440 align:start position:0%
advised that children in schools wear
 
01:48:59.030 --> 01:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
masks this fall information on the Delta
 
01:49:00.750 --> 01:49:00.760 align:start position:0%
variant from several States and other
 
01:49:02.790 --> 01:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
countries indicates that in rare
 
01:49:04.310 --> 01:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
occasions some vaccinated people
 
01:49:06.149 --> 01:49:06.159 align:start position:0%
infected with Delta variant after

01:49:45.149 --> 01:49:45.159 align:start position:0%
Fearless I don't think that um our
 
01:49:48.629 --> 01:49:48.639 align:start position:0%
livefree or die state had that
 
01:49:51.790 --> 01:49:51.800 align:start position:0%
boldness we did well but we could have
 
01:49:54.830 --> 01:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
done a lot better and I think that it's
 
01:49:57.070 --> 01:49:57.080 align:start position:0%
reflective as
 
01:50:01.830 --> 01:50:01.840 align:start position:0%
to giving that freedom of choice to our
 
01:50:03.790 --> 01:50:03.800 align:start position:0%
residents and it comes from the state
 
01:50:05.990 --> 01:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
level I am an elected official at the
 
01:50:09.470 --> 01:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
municipal level and all I heard was the
 
01:50:11.390 --> 01:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
recommendations of the CDC we must
 
01:50:13.350 --> 01:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
follow the recommendations of the CDC it
 
01:50:16.750 --> 01:50:16.760 align:start position:0%
was like a broken record and I chose not
 
01:50:20.589 --> 01:50:20.599 align:start position:0%
to and little by little people chose not
 
01:50:23.910 --> 01:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
to also and some chose to continue to
 
01:50:25.709 --> 01:50:25.719 align:start position:0%
wear masks as they felt that that was
 
01:50:28.790 --> 01:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
the best thing for them and that is okay
 
01:50:30.430 --> 01:50:30.440 align:start position:0%
I just don't feel
 
01:50:33.550 --> 01:50:33.560 align:start position:0%
that we did the right thing all the time
 
01:50:36.109 --> 01:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
during that situation that's the first
 
01:50:37.589 --> 01:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
time we've ever had to deal with it but
 
01:50:40.149 --> 01:50:40.159 align:start position:0%
moving forward we need to do better for
 
01:50:43.310 --> 01:50:43.320 align:start position:0%
our residents thank you thank you
 
01:50:45.390 --> 01:50:45.400 align:start position:0%
representative you take a quick a quick
 
01:50:47.950 --> 01:50:47.960 align:start position:0%
question sure uh I just was wondering
 
01:50:50.229 --> 01:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
you quoted Governor gnome what what what
 
01:50:52.550 --> 01:50:52.560 align:start position:0%
was the date when did she say what the
 
01:50:54.149 --> 01:50:54.159 align:start position:0%
things that you said she said yes I
 
01:50:57.990 --> 01:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
believe it was July 27th 2021 and during
 
01:51:01.830 --> 01:51:01.840 align:start position:0%
the pandemic okay other
 
01:51:04.350 --> 01:51:04.360 align:start position:0%
questions repres Carrie do you think
 
01:51:07.350 --> 01:51:07.360 align:start position:0%
part of her success was in fact twofold
 
01:51:09.510 --> 01:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
one she has a state with a really small
 
01:51:12.510 --> 01:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
population and two by telling people
 
01:51:14.430 --> 01:51:14.440 align:start position:0%
they're not mandated to do things they
 
01:51:17.950 --> 01:51:17.960 align:start position:0%
very often will do what they should do I
 
01:51:21.470 --> 01:51:21.480 align:start position:0%
can't really speak to what her um I I
 
01:51:22.629 --> 01:51:22.639 align:start position:0%
believe that she believed in their
 
01:51:24.470 --> 01:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
freedoms and their choice is what it
 
01:51:26.750 --> 01:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
really came down to uh and I think that
 
01:51:30.310 --> 01:51:30.320 align:start position:0%
that's what we need to adhere to in New
 
01:51:34.550 --> 01:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire other questions Ripon Lloyd so
 
01:51:36.189 --> 01:51:36.199 align:start position:0%
I used to work for the New England organ
 
01:51:40.069 --> 01:51:40.079 align:start position:0%
bank and often times any uh transplant
 
01:51:42.990 --> 01:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
um patients have to are are forever
 
01:51:46.149 --> 01:51:46.159 align:start position:0%
imuno compromised um
 
01:51:51.229 --> 01:51:51.239 align:start position:0%
how how can uh we as a state justify
 
01:51:52.790 --> 01:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
saying no you don't have to mask
 
01:51:56.149 --> 01:51:56.159 align:start position:0%
whatever and we have we have people who
 
01:51:57.950 --> 01:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
have received organ transplants here in
 
01:51:59.550 --> 01:51:59.560 align:start position:0%
the state that we need to take care of
 
01:52:01.270 --> 01:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
and make sure that they like they're not
 
01:52:03.149 --> 01:52:03.159 align:start position:0%
exposed to
 
01:52:05.390 --> 01:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
things I just don't think that at the
 
01:52:07.390 --> 01:52:07.400 align:start position:0%
state level we need to mandate if that
 
01:52:09.830 --> 01:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
is something under your organization and
 
01:52:12.870 --> 01:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
that is something that you believe is uh
 
01:52:15.229 --> 01:52:15.239 align:start position:0%
important to the security and the and
 
01:52:18.709 --> 01:52:18.719 align:start position:0%
the U well-being of the patients then
 
01:52:22.069 --> 01:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:25.790 --> 01:52:25.800 align:start position:0%
follow up were we ever taking people off
 
01:52:29.149 --> 01:52:29.159 align:start position:0%
of the street and forcing them to mask
 
01:52:31.790 --> 01:52:31.800 align:start position:0%
yes people were arrested and they called
 
01:52:34.870 --> 01:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
it trespassing for not following the
 
01:52:37.790 --> 01:52:37.800 align:start position:0%
mask mandate that was imposed on the
 
01:52:40.669 --> 01:52:40.679 align:start position:0%
state I actually I am one that actually
 
01:52:42.550 --> 01:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
lost the job because I would not wear a
 
01:52:44.750 --> 01:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
mask and I worked at a therapeutic
 
01:52:46.790 --> 01:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
boarding school which really greatly
 
01:52:49.030 --> 01:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
affected our youth I can't even imagine
 
01:52:50.589 --> 01:52:50.599 align:start position:0%
where those children are today as young
 
01:52:54.109 --> 01:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
adults you take one more followup sure
 
01:52:56.669 --> 01:52:56.679 align:start position:0%
so but these were organizations that you
 
01:53:00.790 --> 01:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
were working in or or um entering into
 
01:53:04.390 --> 01:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:06.950 --> 01:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
street well I wouldn't say it's off on
 
01:53:09.470 --> 01:53:09.480 align:start position:0%
the street but obviously when when it's
 
01:53:13.470 --> 01:53:13.480 align:start position:0%
being imposed and by the state your
 
01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
local levels your organizations your um
 
01:53:20.189 --> 01:53:20.199 align:start position:0%
uh businesses are going to take on those
 
01:53:22.669 --> 01:53:22.679 align:start position:0%
mandates as law and that's what we saw
 
01:53:24.870 --> 01:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
we saw people saying it's the law I saw
 
01:53:27.390 --> 01:53:27.400 align:start position:0%
signs in Lebanon that had signs up on
 
01:53:29.669 --> 01:53:29.679 align:start position:0%
the sidewalks that said wear your mask
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
it's the law and it was not a law so I
 
01:53:36.270 --> 01:53:36.280 align:start position:0%
think it was taken um
 
01:53:40.550 --> 01:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
indirectly um by the those businesses
 
01:53:43.390 --> 01:53:43.400 align:start position:0%
organizations schools municipalities as
 
01:53:47.030 --> 01:53:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:50.189 --> 01:53:50.199 align:start position:0%
law rep representative Sebert yeah I
 
01:53:52.189 --> 01:53:52.199 align:start position:0%
need to look up the exact date but I
 
01:53:54.109 --> 01:53:54.119 align:start position:0%
know I even printed it out for a
 
01:53:57.510 --> 01:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
business near me but um but the the
 
01:54:00.870 --> 01:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
governor did order a temporary Mass
 
01:54:03.430 --> 01:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
mandate it was an emergency Mass mandate
 
01:54:05.910 --> 01:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
yes I think businesses This was later on
 
01:54:07.990 --> 01:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
into the pandemic probably like maybe a
 
01:54:09.790 --> 01:54:09.800 align:start position:0%
year after maybe within the first year
 
01:54:11.589 --> 01:54:11.599 align:start position:0%
I'll look it up it was right after his
 
01:54:16.109 --> 01:54:16.119 align:start position:0%
election yeah yeah so I was just curious
 
01:54:20.910 --> 01:54:20.920 align:start position:0%
um you know with that said and what with
 
01:54:23.030 --> 01:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
what you just stated you know and
 
01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
businesses also could choose am I right
 
01:54:29.470 --> 01:54:29.480 align:start position:0%
um you know even before he did that they
 
01:54:31.790 --> 01:54:31.800 align:start position:0%
could choose to not let people in you
 
01:54:34.990 --> 01:54:35.000 align:start position:0%
know or clo either close or put up a
 
01:54:38.470 --> 01:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
sciencing wear a mask in here you know
 
01:54:40.950 --> 01:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
well there there was um a lot of
 
01:54:43.870 --> 01:54:43.880 align:start position:0%
businesses and especially when they're
 
01:54:47.510 --> 01:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
um you know catering or dealing with the
 
01:54:50.950 --> 01:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
public um they they were required to
 
01:54:54.109 --> 01:54:54.119 align:start position:0%
wear masks to in order to um conduct
 
01:54:56.990 --> 01:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
business what was this under the time
 
01:54:59.629 --> 01:54:59.639 align:start position:0%
that the governor had that in place yes
 
01:55:02.109 --> 01:55:02.119 align:start position:0%
and it continued even when he he removed
 
01:55:03.750 --> 01:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
the mask
 
01:55:05.990 --> 01:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
mandate for specific
 
01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
businesses thank
 
01:55:12.870 --> 01:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
you represent gagy thank you Mr chairman
 
01:55:15.910 --> 01:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
in your opinion
 
01:55:20.310 --> 01:55:20.320 align:start position:0%
okay the continuing mask mandates in
 
01:55:23.830 --> 01:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
restaurants and businesses or whatnot u
 
01:55:25.790 --> 01:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
in your opinion would it be because
 
01:55:27.270 --> 01:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps the
 
01:55:30.669 --> 01:55:30.679 align:start position:0%
businesses because of the sort of
 
01:55:36.870 --> 01:55:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:39.750 --> 01:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
lawsuits in my opinion I believe that
 
01:55:43.629 --> 01:55:43.639 align:start position:0%
many of them were threatened by the um
 
01:55:45.830 --> 01:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
Health uh organizations that they would
 
01:55:48.589 --> 01:55:48.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:48.599 --> 01:55:50.790 align:start position:0%
 
down

01:55:50.790 --> 01:55:50.800 align:start position:0%

into how much um influence I guess you
 
01:56:06.910 --> 01:56:06.920 align:start position:0%
could say was came down from the you
 
01:56:08.950 --> 01:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
know to the businesses from their
 
01:56:11.629 --> 01:56:11.639 align:start position:0%

01:57:01.149 --> 01:57:01.159 align:start position:0%
happened and let me just tell you from
 
01:57:03.430 --> 01:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
that perspective um every so the local
 
01:57:05.589 --> 01:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
control in New Hampshire is awesome
 
01:57:07.229 --> 01:57:07.239 align:start position:0%
right and when this all broke we were
 
01:57:10.270 --> 01:57:10.280 align:start position:0%
all kind of deciding our own path if you
 
01:57:12.390 --> 01:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
will besides the original two weeks to
 
01:57:14.270 --> 01:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
slow the spread there was an executive
 
01:57:15.990 --> 01:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
order and then each School District was
 
01:57:19.109 --> 01:57:19.119 align:start position:0%
allowed to decide how to proceed um so
 
01:57:21.030 --> 01:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
we you know went remote in my school
 
01:57:22.830 --> 01:57:22.840 align:start position:0%
district and then um when it came time
 
01:57:26.790 --> 01:57:26.800 align:start position:0%
to open for uh the next year my school
 
01:57:28.950 --> 01:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
which um is a prek to8 school and then
 
01:57:30.750 --> 01:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
we tuition out to high school we were
 
01:57:34.709 --> 01:57:34.719 align:start position:0%
the only ones in our area to open so
 
01:57:37.149 --> 01:57:37.159 align:start position:0%
every other school around us was doing
 
01:57:40.790 --> 01:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
either a um a split schedule where some
 
01:57:42.430 --> 01:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
kids came on some days other came in
 
01:57:45.709 --> 01:57:45.719 align:start position:0%
other days or they did a remote um
 
01:57:48.270 --> 01:57:48.280 align:start position:0%
teaching role until mid October until
 
01:57:49.550 --> 01:57:49.560 align:start position:0%
everyone got more comfortable and then
 
01:57:51.790 --> 01:57:51.800 align:start position:0%
they started having kids back so I
 
01:57:53.390 --> 01:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
commend our school board for Having the
 
01:57:54.910 --> 01:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
courage to do that figuring out the
 
01:57:57.430 --> 01:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
space needed according to what we were
 
01:57:59.069 --> 01:57:59.079 align:start position:0%
following now that brings me to this
 
01:58:01.870 --> 01:58:01.880 align:start position:0%
this bill is that we chose to follow the
 
01:58:04.709 --> 01:58:04.719 align:start position:0%
state uh meaning Department of Education
 
01:58:08.550 --> 01:58:08.560 align:start position:0%
and DHHS um instructions we never went
 
01:58:11.189 --> 01:58:11.199 align:start position:0%
with the CDC which was fast changing so
 
01:58:12.830 --> 01:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
we set a precedence we weren't told what
 
01:58:14.589 --> 01:58:14.599 align:start position:0%
to do but there were districts around us
 
01:58:16.510 --> 01:58:16.520 align:start position:0%
who were pivoting constantly based on
 
01:58:22.069 --> 01:58:22.079 align:start position:0%
CDC updates so it was kind of chaotic um
 
01:58:24.189 --> 01:58:24.199 align:start position:0%
I think DHHS was modeling a lot of their
 
01:58:27.030 --> 01:58:27.040 align:start position:0%
guidance to based on CDC guidance as
 
01:58:28.870 --> 01:58:28.880 align:start position:0%
well but that's what we did we kind of
 
01:58:31.310 --> 01:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
waited for directives from the state
 
01:58:33.030 --> 01:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
because New Hampshire is big on local
 
01:58:35.870 --> 01:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
control so I support this bill uh in a
 
01:58:38.950 --> 01:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
nutshell um On A Private Matter um I had
 
01:58:40.350 --> 01:58:40.360 align:start position:0%
young children during this period who
 
01:58:41.790 --> 01:58:41.800 align:start position:0%
were speech and language delayed and it
 
01:58:44.350 --> 01:58:44.360 align:start position:0%
was very damaging to a lot of young
 
01:58:46.550 --> 01:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
children to have their peers mask we did
 
01:58:48.830 --> 01:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
uh face coverings the uh policy that we
 
01:58:50.229 --> 01:58:50.239 align:start position:0%
adopted so there were children who were
 
01:58:52.430 --> 01:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
allowed to wear plastic face Shields
 
01:58:54.030 --> 01:58:54.040 align:start position:0%
especially young children or children
 
01:58:56.550 --> 01:58:56.560 align:start position:0%
with any any reason really um and some
 
01:58:58.350 --> 01:58:58.360 align:start position:0%
parents chose plastic face Shields but
 
01:59:01.189 --> 01:59:01.199 align:start position:0%
my daughter who uh was non-verbal at 5
 
01:59:04.189 --> 01:59:04.199 align:start position:0%
years old could not see her face uh
 
01:59:06.510 --> 01:59:06.520 align:start position:0%
sorry her peers faces or the service
 
01:59:07.709 --> 01:59:07.719 align:start position:0%
providers Her speech and language
 
01:59:10.189 --> 01:59:10.199 align:start position:0%
teachers were not wearing um face
 
01:59:12.390 --> 01:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
Shields based on fear right or guidance
 
01:59:14.669 --> 01:59:14.679 align:start position:0%
that it wasn't as protective so um we
 
01:59:16.149 --> 01:59:16.159 align:start position:0%
actually homeschooled last year because
 
01:59:18.270 --> 01:59:18.280 align:start position:0%
we needed a whole mental year of of a
 
01:59:20.109 --> 01:59:20.119 align:start position:0%
mental health year if you will and now
 
01:59:21.830 --> 01:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
we're back in a public charter school
 
01:59:23.830 --> 01:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
because everything is more relaxed now
 
01:59:27.350 --> 01:59:27.360 align:start position:0%
but jumping to what the CDC says has
 
01:59:29.950 --> 01:59:29.960 align:start position:0%
damaged an entire generation and I think
 
01:59:31.470 --> 01:59:31.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of people can agree on that so I
 
01:59:32.669 --> 01:59:32.679 align:start position:0%
just think that they've made a lot of
 
01:59:35.430 --> 01:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
mistakes and New Hampshire is very
 
01:59:37.270 --> 01:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
unique in New Hampshire is not New York
 
01:59:40.109 --> 01:59:40.119 align:start position:0%
or Manhattan or North Dakota it's like I
 
01:59:41.709 --> 01:59:41.719 align:start position:0%
I like this local control thing so I
 
01:59:43.830 --> 01:59:43.840 align:start position:0%
don't I would like this bill to pass
 
01:59:45.109 --> 01:59:45.119 align:start position:0%
because we should not be following the
 
01:59:47.910 --> 01:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
CDC based on their past performance and
 
01:59:53.990 --> 01:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:58.990 --> 01:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
here questions R some car I too was a
 
02:00:02.430 --> 02:00:02.440 align:start position:0%
school board member for 18 years and um
 
02:00:04.750 --> 02:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
one of the challenges I had and I don't
 
02:00:07.669 --> 02:00:07.679 align:start position:0%
feel it's reflected in this bill was the
 
02:00:09.790 --> 02:00:09.800 align:start position:0%
school board in fact did not have
 
02:00:14.229 --> 02:00:14.239 align:start position:0%
control over the mask mandates in terms
 
02:00:18.270 --> 02:00:18.280 align:start position:0%
of guidance from the state we were told
 
02:00:21.830 --> 02:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
if the state masks you mask right so my
 
02:00:24.069 --> 02:00:24.079 align:start position:0%
thought was if we could just mask you
 
02:00:26.629 --> 02:00:26.639 align:start position:0%
know when we needed to within our school
 
02:00:29.030 --> 02:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
district area not when the entire State
 
02:00:32.189 --> 02:00:32.199 align:start position:0%
or the entire County needed to mask but
 
02:00:34.669 --> 02:00:34.679 align:start position:0%
we weren't given that flexibility but
 
02:00:36.790 --> 02:00:36.800 align:start position:0%
that was the state that did
 
02:00:39.870 --> 02:00:39.880 align:start position:0%
that so we were told um here's the
 
02:00:41.709 --> 02:00:41.719 align:start position:0%
guidance here's the recommendations each
 
02:00:44.790 --> 02:00:44.800 align:start position:0%
district uh school board can make their
 
02:00:47.550 --> 02:00:47.560 align:start position:0%
own decision so we passed a policy that
 
02:00:49.270 --> 02:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
said face coverings which is the
 
02:00:51.350 --> 02:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
terminology that was used and a lot of
 
02:00:53.149 --> 02:00:53.159 align:start position:0%
places didn't they did put cloth face
 
02:00:55.709 --> 02:00:55.719 align:start position:0%
masks um so I think that that was
 
02:00:57.510 --> 02:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
partially me pushing that through the
 
02:00:59.790 --> 02:00:59.800 align:start position:0%
face covering so that we could allow
 
02:01:01.950 --> 02:01:01.960 align:start position:0%
children or other people to wear clear
 
02:01:04.069 --> 02:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
plastic face Shields um you know we have
 
02:01:05.750 --> 02:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
a whole community of children early on
 
02:01:07.790 --> 02:01:07.800 align:start position:0%
who couldn't wear masks for disability
 
02:01:09.709 --> 02:01:09.719 align:start position:0%
reasons autism all sorts of sensory
 
02:01:10.870 --> 02:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
issues which is what I was concerned
 
02:01:13.990 --> 02:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
about more so than the the the the
 
02:01:16.550 --> 02:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
freedom relation to it but it's it's
 
02:01:19.310 --> 02:01:19.320 align:start position:0%
hard for so I I I disagree because we
 
02:01:20.550 --> 02:01:20.560 align:start position:0%
were because we were very different from
 
02:01:21.910 --> 02:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
schools around us and like I said we're
 
02:01:23.229 --> 02:01:23.239 align:start position:0%
in Fremont so we were surrounded by a
 
02:01:24.629 --> 02:01:24.639 align:start position:0%
lot of bigger schools who had very
 
02:01:27.629 --> 02:01:27.639 align:start position:0%
different policies very specific so
 
02:01:28.990 --> 02:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
maybe it's just we took a Gamble and no
 
02:01:31.430 --> 02:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
one sued us I don't know but um I do
 
02:01:33.030 --> 02:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
like the local control aspect because
 
02:01:35.189 --> 02:01:35.199 align:start position:0%
every district is unique versus just
 
02:01:37.350 --> 02:01:37.360 align:start position:0%
following whatever the CDC or World
 
02:01:39.109 --> 02:01:39.119 align:start position:0%
Health Organization recommends in these
 
02:01:40.589 --> 02:01:40.599 align:start position:0%
situations and we were all learning as
 
02:01:43.669 --> 02:01:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:46.149 --> 02:01:46.159 align:start position:0%
chaos representative seir did you have
 
02:01:50.430 --> 02:01:50.440 align:start position:0%

other measures this morning one of them
 
02:01:58.910 --> 02:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
is the prime sponsor asked it be
 
02:02:01.109 --> 02:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
recessed and rescheduled so it leaves us
 
02:02:03.069 --> 02:02:03.079 align:start position:0%
with one more measure this morning after
 
02:02:04.510 --> 02:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
we finish here I want to honor
 
02:02:07.270 --> 02:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
everyone's time who has uh sat here for
 
02:02:11.629 --> 02:02:11.639 align:start position:0%
so long uh and get to everyone um

10 minutes a lot of what I was going to
 
02:02:32.750 --> 02:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
say has already been covered so I just
 
02:02:35.030 --> 02:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
um uh or for the record I'm

Belmont New Hampshire I cover the towns

District 8 my intent today was to cover
 
02:02:49.550 --> 02:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
um a Supreme Court
 
02:02:52.310 --> 02:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh fight that's going on now Missouri V
 
02:02:54.870 --> 02:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
Biden I don't know if you've uh had some
 
02:02:56.910 --> 02:02:56.920 align:start position:0%
really uh downtime and want some real
 
02:02:58.790 --> 02:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
boring reading but it wasn't boring to
 
02:03:02.790 --> 02:03:02.800 align:start position:0%
me uh it's about 155 pages long uh
 
02:03:04.910 --> 02:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
didn't want to print that all out for
 
02:03:06.310 --> 02:03:06.320 align:start position:0%
each of you having a copy but it's
 
02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:07.510 align:start position:0%
each of you having a copy but it's
accessible

02:03:07.510 --> 02:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
accessible
 
02:03:10.510 --> 02:03:10.520 align:start position:0%
online where I have determined The
 
02:03:14.709 --> 02:03:14.719 align:start position:0%
credibility of the CDC is total trash is
 
02:03:17.669 --> 02:03:17.679 align:start position:0%
if you read the uh documents in that
 
02:03:19.990 --> 02:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
court case
 
02:03:24.669 --> 02:03:24.679 align:start position:0%
um their motives with the White House um
 
02:03:28.109 --> 02:03:28.119 align:start position:0%
Administration the Surgeon General and
 
02:03:32.629 --> 02:03:32.639 align:start position:0%
uh the FBI to censor free speech of
 
02:03:36.430 --> 02:03:36.440 align:start position:0%
Americans on social media and other
 
02:03:39.069 --> 02:03:39.079 align:start position:0%
platforms because it didn't comport to a
 
02:03:41.149 --> 02:03:41.159 align:start position:0%
narrative that the World Health
 
02:03:45.310 --> 02:03:45.320 align:start position:0%
Organization and the CDC were
 
02:03:48.549 --> 02:03:48.559 align:start position:0%
promulgating that is uh automatically
 
02:03:51.390 --> 02:03:51.400 align:start position:0%
dis qualifying anything else they say
 
02:03:54.109 --> 02:03:54.119 align:start position:0%
about anything should be looked at in a
 
02:03:54.119 --> 02:03:55.229 align:start position:0%
about anything should be looked at in a
skeptical

02:03:55.229 --> 02:03:55.239 align:start position:0%
skeptical
 
02:03:58.350 --> 02:03:58.360 align:start position:0%
sense just because it doesn't fit
 
02:04:03.310 --> 02:04:03.320 align:start position:0%
their uh narrative so that makes you it
 
02:04:05.149 --> 02:04:05.159 align:start position:0%
makes you it should force anyone with a
 
02:04:07.549 --> 02:04:07.559 align:start position:0%
critical mind to question everything
 
02:04:11.510 --> 02:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
they say just that this one case alone
 
02:04:13.790 --> 02:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
and they're appealing decisions
 
02:04:16.950 --> 02:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
throughout the way uh why are they
 
02:04:19.629 --> 02:04:19.639 align:start position:0%
appealing Court ruling that are finding
 
02:04:22.510 --> 02:04:22.520 align:start position:0%
them uh yes they've been in violation of
 
02:04:25.069 --> 02:04:25.079 align:start position:0%
censoring uh American's First Amendment
 
02:04:27.350 --> 02:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
right to free speech why would
 
02:04:30.549 --> 02:04:30.559 align:start position:0%
government entities be appealing those
 
02:04:33.510 --> 02:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
decisions it's because as the TV people
 
02:04:36.189 --> 02:04:36.199 align:start position:0%
say the walls are closing in it's
 
02:04:39.149 --> 02:04:39.159 align:start position:0%
getting discovered that they are nothing
 
02:04:42.950 --> 02:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
more than taxpayer funded marketing
 
02:04:46.149 --> 02:04:46.159 align:start position:0%
entities for big Pharma that is my
 
02:04:48.950 --> 02:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
obviously my opinion but I I I think
 
02:04:50.910 --> 02:04:50.920 align:start position:0%
that's pretty well founded just from
 
02:04:54.470 --> 02:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
reading this court uh situation online
 
02:04:56.709 --> 02:04:56.719 align:start position:0%
which you can all find Missouri V Biden
 
02:04:59.350 --> 02:04:59.360 align:start position:0%
but it's Missouri at all versus Biden at
 
02:05:02.069 --> 02:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
all um so I was going to go into a lot
 
02:05:04.510 --> 02:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
of detail about that until I was driving
 
02:05:07.470 --> 02:05:07.480 align:start position:0%
out of my driveway this morning
 
02:05:11.030 --> 02:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
and I live next door to a nurse she's 44
 
02:05:13.189 --> 02:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
years old works for the conquered
 
02:05:13.199 --> 02:05:14.950 align:start position:0%
years old works for the conquered
hospital

02:05:14.950 --> 02:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
hospital
 
02:05:17.790 --> 02:05:17.800 align:start position:0%
system did everything she was uh
 
02:05:20.709 --> 02:05:20.719 align:start position:0%
directed to do part of her employment uh
 
02:05:22.149 --> 02:05:22.159 align:start position:0%
through the conquered hospital system
 
02:05:23.990 --> 02:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
got all her vaccinations and her
 
02:05:27.069 --> 02:05:27.079 align:start position:0%
boosters again she is 44 years
 
02:05:30.470 --> 02:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
old in the last 18 months she has now
 
02:05:31.870 --> 02:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
three different
 
02:05:34.149 --> 02:05:34.159 align:start position:0%
cancers that she has been battling and
 
02:05:35.830 --> 02:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
having surgeries on I saw her this
 
02:05:37.669 --> 02:05:37.679 align:start position:0%
morning Wheeling her garbage Barrel out
 
02:05:40.310 --> 02:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
with a walker she's also going blind
 
02:05:42.109 --> 02:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
she's unable to
 
02:05:45.470 --> 02:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
drive she's not allowed to file a V's
 
02:05:47.709 --> 02:05:47.719 align:start position:0%
report because she suspects that this is
 
02:05:49.669 --> 02:05:49.679 align:start position:0%
a vaccine injury
 
02:05:54.549 --> 02:05:54.559 align:start position:0%
CDC she believes has some sort of a I
 
02:05:55.790 --> 02:05:55.800 align:start position:0%
don't know a hold over the
 
02:05:57.669 --> 02:05:57.679 align:start position:0%
administration in that hospital system
 
02:06:00.069 --> 02:06:00.079 align:start position:0%
that they're not allowed to even uh
 
02:06:02.510 --> 02:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
explore whether or not this is vaccine
 
02:06:05.510 --> 02:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh injury related she did what she was
 
02:06:08.669 --> 02:06:08.679 align:start position:0%
told to do per a CDC
 
02:06:12.390 --> 02:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
recommended procedure at her Hospital
 
02:06:16.910 --> 02:06:16.920 align:start position:0%
group she's 44 years old my youngest
 
02:06:18.669 --> 02:06:18.679 align:start position:0%
stepdaughter she's had her menstrual per
 
02:06:21.229 --> 02:06:21.239 align:start position:0%
period for going on 2 years now in about
 
02:06:23.709 --> 02:06:23.719 align:start position:0%
uh 6 weeks it'll be 2 years and that was
 
02:06:26.510 --> 02:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
after getting a CDC recommended vaccine
 
02:06:28.470 --> 02:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
at nhti when she was going through the
 
02:06:31.470 --> 02:06:31.480 align:start position:0%
Radiology program she is 22 years old
 
02:06:34.189 --> 02:06:34.199 align:start position:0%
and she has had her period since she was
 
02:06:36.510 --> 02:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
20 her doctors also through the
 
02:06:38.910 --> 02:06:38.920 align:start position:0%
conquered Hospital group will refuse to
 
02:06:40.910 --> 02:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
even investigate whether this is a
 
02:06:43.270 --> 02:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
vaccine related injury and submit any
 
02:06:46.470 --> 02:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
kind of a record through the Vees
 
02:06:50.950 --> 02:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:53.709 --> 02:06:53.719 align:start position:0%
I really do think that it's on us as
 
02:06:58.430 --> 02:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
legislators to make our own medical uh
 
02:07:01.189 --> 02:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
judgments based on our in-house experts
 
02:07:05.229 --> 02:07:05.239 align:start position:0%
at DHHS we don't need the CDC giving
 
02:07:07.669 --> 02:07:07.679 align:start position:0%
advice guidance
 
02:07:10.430 --> 02:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations January 10th of this
 
02:07:15.589 --> 02:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
year uh nhid whatever that organization
 
02:07:18.709 --> 02:07:18.719 align:start position:0%
is there Dr fouchy works for he was is
 
02:07:21.390 --> 02:07:21.400 align:start position:0%
being investigated and deposed by
 
02:07:24.950 --> 02:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
Congress on January 10th and in open
 
02:07:28.510 --> 02:07:28.520 align:start position:0%
court said that the six foot distancing
 
02:07:30.430 --> 02:07:30.440 align:start position:0%
just came out of nowhere that wasn't
 
02:07:33.790 --> 02:07:33.800 align:start position:0%
based on science we just invented it we
 
02:07:35.750 --> 02:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
closed schools we close
 
02:07:38.629 --> 02:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
churches we put stupid stickers on the
 
02:07:40.990 --> 02:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
floor and grocery stores to go this way
 
02:07:42.990 --> 02:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
don't go this
 
02:07:46.910 --> 02:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
way The cdc's credibility is trash and
 
02:07:49.470 --> 02:07:49.480 align:start position:0%
all of these things document that
 
02:07:51.510 --> 02:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not a scientist I'm not a lawyer I
 
02:07:52.950 --> 02:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
just can
 
02:07:55.470 --> 02:07:55.480 align:start position:0%

02:08:18.109 --> 02:08:18.119 align:start position:0%
this time okay Deborah Johnson Deborah

02:08:27.990 --> 02:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
bill hi there
 
02:08:32.669 --> 02:08:32.679 align:start position:0%
um first thing I want to say is that I
 
02:08:35.589 --> 02:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
have never in my life which is pretty
 
02:08:38.470 --> 02:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
long you can tell by my gray hair been
 
02:08:42.229 --> 02:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
this concerned about losing our
 
02:08:45.109 --> 02:08:45.119 align:start position:0%
Republic this this meeting that's coming
 
02:08:48.589 --> 02:08:48.599 align:start position:0%
up in May with who is complete power
 
02:08:50.870 --> 02:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
grab and that's after the power grab
 
02:08:54.390 --> 02:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
that they did during what I consider the
 
02:08:56.669 --> 02:08:56.679 align:start position:0%
planemic so a lot of things have been
 
02:08:58.310 --> 02:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
covered here and I'm going to go through
 
02:09:00.149 --> 02:09:00.159 align:start position:0%
my notes and pick out what I haven't
 
02:09:03.310 --> 02:09:03.320 align:start position:0%
heard people say uh one thing was was um
 
02:09:05.229 --> 02:09:05.239 align:start position:0%
you know I I I wanted to respond to that
 
02:09:08.189 --> 02:09:08.199 align:start position:0%
nurse I raised my hand I realized you
 
02:09:11.069 --> 02:09:11.079 align:start position:0%
don't what is to the best of my
 
02:09:14.270 --> 02:09:14.280 align:start position:0%
knowledge this vaccine is still under
 
02:09:18.589 --> 02:09:18.599 align:start position:0%
emergency use it has not been approved
 
02:09:21.990 --> 02:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
or licensed by the FDA and she said well
 
02:09:24.109 --> 02:09:24.119 align:start position:0%
I take a lot of vaccines I want to know
 
02:09:26.109 --> 02:09:26.119 align:start position:0%
how many nurses have taken an
 
02:09:28.790 --> 02:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
experimental vac or have been pressured
 
02:09:31.189 --> 02:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
into taking an experimental vaccine
 
02:09:33.669 --> 02:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
before it's one thing to take vaccines
 
02:09:35.149 --> 02:09:35.159 align:start position:0%
that are approved it's a whole other
 
02:09:37.709 --> 02:09:37.719 align:start position:0%
thing to to pressure people and force
 
02:09:39.669 --> 02:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
people out of their jobs if they won't
 
02:09:42.669 --> 02:09:42.679 align:start position:0%
take an experimental vaccine that said
 
02:09:44.990 --> 02:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
this experimental vaccine is turning out
 
02:09:48.750 --> 02:09:48.760 align:start position:0%
to be a horrible thing when you when you
 
02:09:51.910 --> 02:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
it it when the people when the experts
 
02:09:54.870 --> 02:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
that they silenced including the doctor
 
02:09:57.350 --> 02:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
that was here which I watched I'm not a
 
02:10:01.069 --> 02:10:01.079 align:start position:0%
doctor I'm not but I also read and and
 
02:10:03.149 --> 02:10:03.159 align:start position:0%
I've been following this and I've been I
 
02:10:04.910 --> 02:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
can't tell you how many hours I've spent
 
02:10:06.830 --> 02:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
watching hearings and watching
 
02:10:09.149 --> 02:10:09.159 align:start position:0%
testimonies and reading books and
 
02:10:10.870 --> 02:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
finding out what's going on here and
 
02:10:12.589 --> 02:10:12.599 align:start position:0%
this is this has been nothing but a
 
02:10:14.470 --> 02:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
power grab and it and they intend to
 
02:10:16.910 --> 02:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
keep it going I'm going to give you and
 
02:10:18.910 --> 02:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
I will if somebody gives an email
 
02:10:20.470 --> 02:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
address or something to send this stuff
 
02:10:22.149 --> 02:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
to I'm going to give you some of the
 
02:10:25.950 --> 02:10:25.960 align:start position:0%
things that I have been uh watching and
 
02:10:28.709 --> 02:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
you know testimony and and and and
 
02:10:31.430 --> 02:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
consuming so that you can consume it too
 
02:10:33.109 --> 02:10:33.119 align:start position:0%
so that you can see what some of these
 
02:10:35.149 --> 02:10:35.159 align:start position:0%
experts are saying I don't know if have
 
02:10:37.870 --> 02:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
you ever heard of Dr mccth um have you
 
02:10:39.830 --> 02:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
ever heard of of all the other doctors
 
02:10:43.510 --> 02:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
that have been silenced but do
 
02:10:46.750 --> 02:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
um I I I can't tell you you know it's
 
02:10:48.030 --> 02:10:48.040 align:start position:0%
hard to come up here and speak when
 
02:10:50.350 --> 02:10:50.360 align:start position:0%
you're as angry as I am and and as
 
02:10:53.069 --> 02:10:53.079 align:start position:0%
afraid as I am for our country so I you
 
02:10:57.149 --> 02:10:57.159 align:start position:0%
know my voice is like this but um
 
02:10:58.669 --> 02:10:58.679 align:start position:0%
there's there's a man named Carrie
 
02:11:00.310 --> 02:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
Mullis I don't know if anybody's ever
 
02:11:02.709 --> 02:11:02.719 align:start position:0%
heard of him but he invented the PCR
 
02:11:06.109 --> 02:11:06.119 align:start position:0%
test interestingly he died and he wasn't
 
02:11:08.189 --> 02:11:08.199 align:start position:0%
that old in
 
02:11:10.589 --> 02:11:10.599 align:start position:0%
2019 um that those are always
 
02:11:12.270 --> 02:11:12.280 align:start position:0%
interesting things but you can find
 
02:11:14.990 --> 02:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
testimony you can find interviews online
 
02:11:16.709 --> 02:11:16.719 align:start position:0%
with him and I'll be glad to look all
 
02:11:18.470 --> 02:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
these all this what I'm going to mention
 
02:11:21.990 --> 02:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
up and send it to all of you he there he
 
02:11:23.950 --> 02:11:23.960 align:start position:0%
he was interviewed I don't know how many
 
02:11:25.669 --> 02:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
years ago it was but quite a few years
 
02:11:28.310 --> 02:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
ago about this PCR test and he's the one
 
02:11:30.830 --> 02:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
that invented it and he was the one that
 
02:11:33.629 --> 02:11:33.639 align:start position:0%
said if you if you use a PCR test to
 
02:11:36.310 --> 02:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
look for a virus you will find it
 
02:11:38.629 --> 02:11:38.639 align:start position:0%
whether it's there or not because the
 
02:11:42.270 --> 02:11:42.280 align:start position:0%
PCR test apparently just uh amplifies up
 
02:11:44.790 --> 02:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
a piece of of something and and apparent
 
02:11:46.750 --> 02:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
and and and like I said I'm not a
 
02:11:48.229 --> 02:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
scientist or a doctor but the way he
 
02:11:50.390 --> 02:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
explains it is there's so much stuff in
 
02:11:53.350 --> 02:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
the air we have stuff that's that we're
 
02:11:54.990 --> 02:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
breathing in that are just pieces
 
02:11:56.350 --> 02:11:56.360 align:start position:0%
they're not really going to make us sick
 
02:11:58.069 --> 02:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
but they're there and if you keep
 
02:11:59.870 --> 02:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
amplifying them and amplifying them and
 
02:12:01.790 --> 02:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
that's why during the PCR testing they
 
02:12:03.750 --> 02:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
talked about how many revolutions they
 
02:12:06.549 --> 02:12:06.559 align:start position:0%
did so you need to you need to look into
 
02:12:08.390 --> 02:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
some of this and he explains it well
 
02:12:10.870 --> 02:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
I'll send it to you I I you know I'm not
 
02:12:12.709 --> 02:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
going to take all the time Senator Ron
 
02:12:15.629 --> 02:12:15.639 align:start position:0%
Johnson I think he had two hearings with
 
02:12:17.350 --> 02:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
some of the doctors that disagreed with
 
02:12:19.629 --> 02:12:19.639 align:start position:0%
the CDC these are these are doctors that
 
02:12:21.990 --> 02:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
are world renowned peer-reviewed all
 
02:12:23.589 --> 02:12:23.599 align:start position:0%
over the place muli is one of the
 
02:12:26.390 --> 02:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
biggest he's he's one he's one of he's a
 
02:12:28.830 --> 02:12:28.840 align:start position:0%
world-renowned doctor and he was
 
02:12:32.069 --> 02:12:32.079 align:start position:0%
silenced um so I I will send you the
 
02:12:35.109 --> 02:12:35.119 align:start position:0%
links to the Senator Ron Johnson's uh
 
02:12:38.189 --> 02:12:38.199 align:start position:0%
like three or four or five hour um
 
02:12:40.149 --> 02:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
hearings where guess who didn't show up
 
02:12:42.589 --> 02:12:42.599 align:start position:0%
Dr fouchy or anybody from the CDC or the
 
02:12:45.189 --> 02:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
FDA none of them showed up no Democrat
 
02:12:48.069 --> 02:12:48.079 align:start position:0%
showed up no Democrat representative or
 
02:12:50.109 --> 02:12:50.119 align:start position:0%
anybody showed up for these these
 
02:12:51.510 --> 02:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
hearings in the
 
02:12:54.390 --> 02:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
Senate um so I mean this has become such
 
02:12:56.310 --> 02:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
a political thing that makes it even
 
02:12:59.669 --> 02:12:59.679 align:start position:0%
scarier MTG Marjorie Taylor green had a
 
02:13:03.310 --> 02:13:03.320 align:start position:0%
hearing um in in Congress in December
 
02:13:05.589 --> 02:13:05.599 align:start position:0%
and I'll send you that link where these
 
02:13:08.270 --> 02:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
doctors came and explained um what they
 
02:13:10.709 --> 02:13:10.719 align:start position:0%
were doing
 
02:13:13.549 --> 02:13:13.559 align:start position:0%
um there are people dying from the shot
 
02:13:16.510 --> 02:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
we've got I we've got people dropping
 
02:13:18.750 --> 02:13:18.760 align:start position:0%
young people dropping dead on the on the
 
02:13:20.750 --> 02:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
athletic fields and that is from
 
02:13:23.350 --> 02:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
myocarditis and from what I'm hearing is
 
02:13:24.990 --> 02:13:25.000 align:start position:0%
the reason it's young people and
 
02:13:26.790 --> 02:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
athletes that we're seeing dropped at is
 
02:13:29.069 --> 02:13:29.079 align:start position:0%
because the heart has been weakened and
 
02:13:30.870 --> 02:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
when they're out there at at their
 
02:13:33.790 --> 02:13:33.800 align:start position:0%
highest level of of athleticism that's
 
02:13:36.549 --> 02:13:36.559 align:start position:0%
when the heart can't take anymore when
 
02:13:38.030 --> 02:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
it normally would if they hadn't taken
 
02:13:40.589 --> 02:13:40.599 align:start position:0%
this vaccine and it has to do with Spike
 
02:13:40.599 --> 02:13:42.549 align:start position:0%
this vaccine and it has to do with Spike
protein

02:13:42.549 --> 02:13:42.559 align:start position:0%
protein
 
02:13:44.790 --> 02:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
um there
 
02:13:47.430 --> 02:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
is there I don't know if anybody's here
 
02:13:50.270 --> 02:13:50.280 align:start position:0%
heard of event 2011 did you ever hear
 
02:13:52.270 --> 02:13:52.280 align:start position:0%
that event
 
02:13:55.109 --> 02:13:55.119 align:start position:0%
2011 uh that's on the Center for Disease
 
02:13:57.310 --> 02:13:57.320 align:start position:0%
controls website and I'll send you that
 
02:14:00.430 --> 02:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
link to that was a a
 
02:14:03.350 --> 02:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
tabletop exercise with people from all
 
02:14:05.430 --> 02:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
over the world these these experts from
 
02:14:06.470 --> 02:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
all over the
 
02:14:09.310 --> 02:14:09.320 align:start position:0%
world and they were basically practicing
 
02:14:12.669 --> 02:14:12.679 align:start position:0%
for covid-19 it happened in October that
 
02:14:15.510 --> 02:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
that event happened event 2011 was done
 
02:14:21.589 --> 02:14:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:25.430 --> 02:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
um it was done in in October of uh 2019
 
02:14:27.669 --> 02:14:27.679 align:start position:0%
just before all this but it was they had
 
02:14:30.910 --> 02:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
all the all the it was like a a a
 
02:14:34.069 --> 02:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
practice session and they had TV cameras
 
02:14:36.430 --> 02:14:36.440 align:start position:0%
and they had fake news reporters on all
 
02:14:38.350 --> 02:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
these TV cameras and they were they did
 
02:14:40.030 --> 02:14:40.040 align:start position:0%

going to give you one more sure um
 
02:15:21.709 --> 02:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
Robert F Kennedy Jr he wrote a book
 
02:15:23.750 --> 02:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
called the real Anthony fouches anybody
 
02:15:26.390 --> 02:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
read that that is an incredible book and
 
02:15:28.830 --> 02:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
that has a lot of background on the
 
02:15:31.270 --> 02:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
stuff that he had fouchy has been doing
 
02:15:33.510 --> 02:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
for all these years it's the most
 
02:15:36.669 --> 02:15:36.679 align:start position:0%
referenced book I have ever read There
 
02:15:38.830 --> 02:15:38.840 align:start position:0%
is reference to every single thing he
 
02:15:42.109 --> 02:15:42.119 align:start position:0%
says in there it cannot be disputed and
 
02:15:43.950 --> 02:15:43.960 align:start position:0%
let me just see if there's anything in
 
02:15:45.350 --> 02:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
here else
 
02:15:52.390 --> 02:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:56.709 --> 02:15:56.719 align:start position:0%
oh the you asked why everybody was doing
 
02:15:58.870 --> 02:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
what what the federal governments or
 
02:16:02.030 --> 02:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
what the CDC said Remember the incentive
 
02:16:04.669 --> 02:16:04.679 align:start position:0%
packages that went out don't forget
 
02:16:06.470 --> 02:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
about the money that went out if the
 
02:16:09.229 --> 02:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
schools did not do what the CDC said
 
02:16:10.910 --> 02:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
they weren't going to get all that extra
 
02:16:13.510 --> 02:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
money so and and not just the schools
 
02:16:14.870 --> 02:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
but everybody else that was getting
 
02:16:16.709 --> 02:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
money so there was those Federal
 
02:16:18.950 --> 02:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
incentives in there for those kinds of
 
02:16:21.510 --> 02:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
things and and and the ventilator story
 
02:16:23.870 --> 02:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's absolutely true too but
 
02:16:24.950 --> 02:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
there are other people that want to
 
02:16:27.149 --> 02:16:27.159 align:start position:0%
speak I will get that address and I will
 
02:16:29.669 --> 02:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
send you uh a lot of stuff I'm not sure
 
02:16:31.390 --> 02:16:31.400 align:start position:0%

02:16:34.030 --> 02:16:34.040 align:start position:0%

all right we have two more two more here
 
02:17:00.830 --> 02:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
um uh Matthew roads looking for three
 
02:17:08.190 --> 02:17:08.200 align:start position:0%

good the chair is doing good I can't
 
02:17:20.750 --> 02:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
speak for the committee but thanks for
 
02:17:22.509 --> 02:17:22.519 align:start position:0%
asking this well it's a very emotional
 
02:17:25.629 --> 02:17:25.639 align:start position:0%
issue so it's easy to uh you know for
 
02:17:28.709 --> 02:17:28.719 align:start position:0%
things to get uh uneasy we're talking
 
02:17:30.830 --> 02:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
about something that nobody wants to
 
02:17:33.190 --> 02:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
talk about and that's death and dying
 
02:17:35.910 --> 02:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
and so but the reaction of a society to
 
02:17:39.709 --> 02:17:39.719 align:start position:0%
crisis is what defines it so um so I
 
02:17:41.030 --> 02:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring us back a little bit
 
02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
more to the point of Michael Granger's
 
02:17:46.230 --> 02:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh nullification Bill uh Michael is not
 
02:17:48.309 --> 02:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
saying that there will be no no time any
 
02:17:51.549 --> 02:17:51.559 align:start position:0%
advisement from any organization to uh
 
02:17:53.429 --> 02:17:53.439 align:start position:0%
make recommendations on how to deal with
 
02:17:55.830 --> 02:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
crisis as such as this what he simply
 
02:17:58.830 --> 02:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
saying in this in this bill is to not
 
02:18:00.629 --> 02:18:00.639 align:start position:0%
allow the World Health Organization or
 
02:18:03.870 --> 02:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
the CDC to participate in any part of
 
02:18:06.150 --> 02:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
the public life of New Hampshire and
 
02:18:08.469 --> 02:18:08.479 align:start position:0%
that's what a nullification is it's a
 
02:18:11.629 --> 02:18:11.639 align:start position:0%
divorce from these two groups now uh it
 
02:18:13.709 --> 02:18:13.719 align:start position:0%
came up earlier that the
 
02:18:17.669 --> 02:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
CDC uh whether or not they had Authority
 
02:18:19.950 --> 02:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
uh over the states and in fact they do
 
02:18:21.469 --> 02:18:21.479 align:start position:0%
according to their website they could
 
02:18:24.429 --> 02:18:24.439 align:start position:0%
actually Commander the local police to
 
02:18:26.830 --> 02:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
uh enforce the mandates that are
 
02:18:29.830 --> 02:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
recommended by by them and of course we
 
02:18:32.389 --> 02:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
know that they maybe there's not a
 
02:18:34.349 --> 02:18:34.359 align:start position:0%
direct relationship between the CDC and
 
02:18:36.469 --> 02:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
the World Health Organization but actual
 
02:18:38.349 --> 02:18:38.359 align:start position:0%
or implied Authority is still just as
 
02:18:41.750 --> 02:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
strong so so we have that um so in this
 
02:18:44.709 --> 02:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
situation you know and we look at why
 
02:18:47.509 --> 02:18:47.519 align:start position:0%
the state would make a decision about uh
 
02:18:50.469 --> 02:18:50.479 align:start position:0%
protecting the people from a virus or an
 
02:18:52.950 --> 02:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
unknown pathogen I grew up in the time
 
02:18:55.110 --> 02:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
as a nursing student uh when AIDS was
 
02:18:59.150 --> 02:18:59.160 align:start position:0%
still a very uh very unknown plague they
 
02:19:01.110 --> 02:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
weren't sure about how it was being
 
02:19:03.750 --> 02:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
transmitted uh wasn't in in 1981 they
 
02:19:08.309 --> 02:19:08.319 align:start position:0%
found the first death cases um 1983 they
 
02:19:09.669 --> 02:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
they definitely knew that it was
 
02:19:11.950 --> 02:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
transmitted by Blood and it wasn't until
 
02:19:15.070 --> 02:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
1987 when Lady Diana shook hands with an
 
02:19:16.990 --> 02:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
AIDS patient that they realized that you
 
02:19:19.790 --> 02:19:19.800 align:start position:0%
couldn't get from touching each other so
 
02:19:23.190 --> 02:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
in the presence of any crisis uh uh
 
02:19:25.790 --> 02:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
extreme prejudice arises and so the
 
02:19:27.509 --> 02:19:27.519 align:start position:0%
state is hopefully going to try to
 
02:19:30.349 --> 02:19:30.359 align:start position:0%
protect its citizens at least from that
 
02:19:33.150 --> 02:19:33.160 align:start position:0%
uh that metric or that situation as well
 
02:19:36.509 --> 02:19:36.519 align:start position:0%
so uh so that's what this does now if if
 
02:19:37.910 --> 02:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
the St the
 
02:19:40.709 --> 02:19:40.719 align:start position:0%
state uh was taking advice from an
 
02:19:42.309 --> 02:19:42.319 align:start position:0%
organization that was incompetent at
 
02:19:44.349 --> 02:19:44.359 align:start position:0%
least three times they would say yeah
 
02:19:46.669 --> 02:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
this is not a good organization to work
 
02:19:49.590 --> 02:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
with let's find somebody else uh so what
 
02:19:53.190 --> 02:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
I've done is I've brought to
 
02:19:56.070 --> 02:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
you uh brought it to you a report from
 
02:19:58.429 --> 02:19:58.439 align:start position:0%
the AIDS Healthcare Foundation which
 
02:20:01.190 --> 02:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
shows you step by step how incompetent
 
02:20:03.710 --> 02:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
the World Health Organization was and uh
 
02:20:05.469 --> 02:20:05.479 align:start position:0%
made some points in my testimony that I
 
02:20:07.830 --> 02:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
didn't talk about right now about how
 
02:20:10.950 --> 02:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
incompetent the CDC was um so they were
 
02:20:14.870 --> 02:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
treating it like it was influenza but it
 
02:20:17.070 --> 02:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
it wasn't it wasn't influenza it was it
 
02:20:19.469 --> 02:20:19.479 align:start position:0%
was much worse you know so um there
 
02:20:20.790 --> 02:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
there were just ways things that they
 
02:20:23.150 --> 02:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
were doing that were not helpful to
 
02:20:25.590 --> 02:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
anybody and so the question here is that
 
02:20:27.070 --> 02:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
does the State of New Hampshire want to
 
02:20:29.309 --> 02:20:29.319 align:start position:0%
do business with an organization that
 
02:20:31.990 --> 02:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
failed in their measure cost a taxpayers
 
02:20:34.190 --> 02:20:34.200 align:start position:0%
a ton of ton of money didn't really come
 
02:20:35.670 --> 02:20:35.680 align:start position:0%
up with the appropriate measures I mean
 
02:20:37.070 --> 02:20:37.080 align:start position:0%
at least with AIDS like they came up
 
02:20:38.790 --> 02:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
with those toilet seat covers you know I
 
02:20:41.349 --> 02:20:41.359 align:start position:0%
mean that was a good thing but masks are
 
02:20:44.710 --> 02:20:44.720 align:start position:0%
you know probably not a great uh
 
02:20:46.270 --> 02:20:46.280 align:start position:0%
recommendation they might stop some
 
02:20:47.990 --> 02:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
droplets you know but are they
 
02:20:49.950 --> 02:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
preventative so the question we have to
 
02:20:52.670 --> 02:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
ask ourselves is what can we do to
 
02:20:54.150 --> 02:20:54.160 align:start position:0%
prevent people from getting sick and
 
02:20:55.270 --> 02:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
that's what we're really trying to get
 
02:20:57.469 --> 02:20:57.479 align:start position:0%
around I mean you you're never going to
 
02:21:00.870 --> 02:21:00.880 align:start position:0%
stop everybody from making somebody sick
 
02:21:03.309 --> 02:21:03.319 align:start position:0%
and so and I think that's what they were
 
02:21:04.910 --> 02:21:04.920 align:start position:0%
wrestling with it so their objectives
 
02:21:07.070 --> 02:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
weren't clear so that's what this bill
 
02:21:09.750 --> 02:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
does and I hope that you support it at
 
02:21:12.150 --> 02:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
least to say these groups are no good
 
02:21:14.030 --> 02:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
United Nations World Health Organization
 
02:21:16.550 --> 02:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
CDC they're failures and we're Duty
 
02:21:18.790 --> 02:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
bound to protect the people of the State
 
02:21:21.070 --> 02:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire from incompetency
 
02:21:23.110 --> 02:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
that's all this bill is is for you to
 
02:21:25.670 --> 02:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
step up and say hey let's protect the
 
02:21:27.550 --> 02:21:27.560 align:start position:0%
people in New Hampshire and give them
 
02:21:31.150 --> 02:21:31.160 align:start position:0%
better options when they can and uh yeah
 
02:21:33.750 --> 02:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
so hi any questions thank you for that
 
02:21:33.760 --> 02:21:35.469 align:start position:0%
so hi any questions thank you for that
questions

02:21:35.469 --> 02:21:35.479 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:21:38.710 --> 02:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
um Cena thank you for your patience and
 
02:21:40.750 --> 02:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
speaking of patience uh our final pink
 
02:21:44.830 --> 02:21:44.840 align:start position:0%
car Gary York is was here early and is
 
02:21:49.389 --> 02:21:49.399 align:start position:0%
uh hung in there uh from hton um
 
02:21:52.150 --> 02:21:52.160 align:start position:0%
representing New Hampshire citizens uh
 
02:21:55.670 --> 02:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
so Gary thank you for being our uh our
 
02:21:59.670 --> 02:21:59.680 align:start position:0%
final uh test testifier and uh welcome
 
02:22:01.790 --> 02:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
02:22:01.800 --> 02:22:04.150 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
committee

02:22:04.150 --> 02:22:04.160 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:22:08.150 --> 02:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
um what I'd like to present to you is uh
 
02:22:11.309 --> 02:22:11.319 align:start position:0%
basically a short hopefully short cron
 
02:22:14.110 --> 02:22:14.120 align:start position:0%
chronology of the events of the past
 
02:22:17.990 --> 02:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
four years this synoptic form
 
02:22:22.150 --> 02:22:22.160 align:start position:0%
um and I think uh it does involve very
 
02:22:25.670 --> 02:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
much entities like the wh and the CDC
 
02:22:31.349 --> 02:22:31.359 align:start position:0%
but other bedmates the NIH the FDA
 
02:22:35.190 --> 02:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
wh uh I I think U someone mentioned a
 
02:22:38.990 --> 02:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
book about Dr fouchi and um I would
 
02:22:42.910 --> 02:22:42.920 align:start position:0%
agree to read that it's very well
 
02:22:45.510 --> 02:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
referenced um I consider that what
 
02:22:47.710 --> 02:22:47.720 align:start position:0%
happened is really a a following a
 
02:22:50.910 --> 02:22:50.920 align:start position:0%
Playbook uh probably engineered by Dr
 
02:22:53.630 --> 02:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
foui uh and the first thing to ignite
 
02:22:57.230 --> 02:22:57.240 align:start position:0%
the whole series of Advance back in
 
02:22:59.510 --> 02:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
whenever it started I've lost track of
 
02:23:03.750 --> 02:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
time uh was uh fear the four letter word
 
02:23:06.990 --> 02:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
the f word the four letters fear and we
 
02:23:09.190 --> 02:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
all know how powerful truth is we
 
02:23:11.190 --> 02:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
consider it to me I consider it the the
 
02:23:11.200 --> 02:23:12.349 align:start position:0%
consider it to me I consider it the the
ultimate

02:23:12.349 --> 02:23:12.359 align:start position:0%
ultimate
 
02:23:16.670 --> 02:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
powerful uh entity but uh if you want to
 
02:23:18.990 --> 02:23:19.000 align:start position:0%
make it hard to people to find the truth
 
02:23:22.309 --> 02:23:22.319 align:start position:0%
or derail the truth you'll introduce
 
02:23:26.950 --> 02:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
that fear word and it took a huge toll
 
02:23:30.269 --> 02:23:30.279 align:start position:0%
especially when it was
 
02:23:34.710 --> 02:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
uh it was accelerated and propagated by
 
02:23:34.720 --> 02:23:35.510 align:start position:0%
uh it was accelerated and propagated by
the

02:23:35.510 --> 02:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:23:37.750 --> 02:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
media uh
 
02:23:40.550 --> 02:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
247 so we have to have fear and then we
 
02:23:43.790 --> 02:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
have to have a poster boy for the for
 
02:23:45.670 --> 02:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
the whole Playbook and that was Dr
 
02:23:48.670 --> 02:23:48.680 align:start position:0%
fouchi the father figure from Brooklyn
 
02:23:51.670 --> 02:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
accent and so on like that so that was a
 
02:23:56.190 --> 02:23:56.200 align:start position:0%
start of it and his declaration as a uh
 
02:23:58.429 --> 02:23:58.439 align:start position:0%
self-anointed Authority
 
02:24:01.309 --> 02:24:01.319 align:start position:0%
expert uh was that he declared that the
 
02:24:04.269 --> 02:24:04.279 align:start position:0%
only way out of this pandemic was
 
02:24:07.309 --> 02:24:07.319 align:start position:0%
through a vaccine the only
 
02:24:11.510 --> 02:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
way by saying so he was in effect
 
02:24:15.230 --> 02:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
agreeing that uh if I believe that and I
 
02:24:18.230 --> 02:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
want to promote that then I'm going to
 
02:24:22.590 --> 02:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
uh suppress any contrary evidence to
 
02:24:22.600 --> 02:24:24.469 align:start position:0%
uh suppress any contrary evidence to
that

02:24:24.469 --> 02:24:24.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:24:27.870 --> 02:24:27.880 align:start position:0%
declaration and so that was done by
 
02:24:30.150 --> 02:24:30.160 align:start position:0%
cancelling maligning and even
 
02:24:30.160 --> 02:24:31.750 align:start position:0%
cancelling maligning and even
sanctioning

02:24:31.750 --> 02:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
sanctioning
 
02:24:35.790 --> 02:24:35.800 align:start position:0%
experts in our country with any kind of
 
02:24:39.150 --> 02:24:39.160 align:start position:0%
uh anti-narrative uh
 
02:24:41.790 --> 02:24:41.800 align:start position:0%
information uh names that have been
 
02:24:45.269 --> 02:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
mentioned Dr Peter McCulla Pierre Corey
 
02:24:48.190 --> 02:24:48.200 align:start position:0%
uh Merill Nass uh who was sanctioned in
 
02:24:50.230 --> 02:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
Maine lost her license had to go before
 
02:24:53.110 --> 02:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
the board for prescribing Iva mechon
 
02:24:55.710 --> 02:24:55.720 align:start position:0%
even though Iva mechon is recognized now
 
02:24:59.469 --> 02:24:59.479 align:start position:0%
finally too late sorry uh as a means for
 
02:25:01.550 --> 02:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
Early Intervention which was never
 
02:25:05.030 --> 02:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
attempted during the initial uh uh
 
02:25:07.309 --> 02:25:07.319 align:start position:0%
approach to this
 
02:25:10.349 --> 02:25:10.359 align:start position:0%
outbreak I'll call it a planemic as well
 
02:25:12.389 --> 02:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
some people call it a scamdemic there
 
02:25:12.399 --> 02:25:13.110 align:start position:0%
some people call it a scamdemic there
you

02:25:13.110 --> 02:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:25:17.750 --> 02:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
go anyway so so by by inhibiting or or
 
02:25:22.710 --> 02:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
um preventing this news of alternative
 
02:25:24.630 --> 02:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
therapies that open the door for the
 
02:25:26.630 --> 02:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
Emergency use
 
02:25:28.710 --> 02:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
authorization so that was part of the
 
02:25:30.670 --> 02:25:30.680 align:start position:0%
Playbook because Normal vaccine
 
02:25:32.389 --> 02:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
development takes years and there's got
 
02:25:34.309 --> 02:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
to be safety development but by giving
 
02:25:37.670 --> 02:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
it a label for emergency use
 
02:25:40.269 --> 02:25:40.279 align:start position:0%
authorization you've you've Sid stepped
 
02:25:42.230 --> 02:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
those those requirements that would
 
02:25:46.309 --> 02:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
normally follow for a many months long
 
02:25:48.670 --> 02:25:48.680 align:start position:0%
uh p production of a final
 
02:25:51.070 --> 02:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine so you're limiting any kind of
 
02:25:53.870 --> 02:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
clinical trials safety data
 
02:25:59.150 --> 02:25:59.160 align:start position:0%
Etc so um there was um that was
 
02:26:00.510 --> 02:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned that was going to take some
 
02:26:02.830 --> 02:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
time but suddenly well we may have it
 
02:26:04.710 --> 02:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
sooner than later and it might be only
 
02:26:07.790 --> 02:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
months now and it came out pretty fast
 
02:26:10.910 --> 02:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
um wow I mean makes you think that they
 
02:26:13.429 --> 02:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
may have thought about this vaccine
 
02:26:14.990 --> 02:26:15.000 align:start position:0%
already you know maybe they've already
 
02:26:17.349 --> 02:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
planned for this vaccine
 
02:26:20.190 --> 02:26:20.200 align:start position:0%
and and by the way vaccine um most of us
 
02:26:24.150 --> 02:26:24.160 align:start position:0%
were referring to it as the jab but
 
02:26:26.750 --> 02:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
conveniently the definition of vaccine
 
02:26:30.190 --> 02:26:30.200 align:start position:0%
was altered by the
 
02:26:32.710 --> 02:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
CDC we just had a hearing the other day
 
02:26:34.750 --> 02:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
that addressed the issue of the
 
02:26:36.710 --> 02:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
definition of vaccine it was altered by
 
02:26:38.870 --> 02:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
the cdz to
 
02:26:41.110 --> 02:26:41.120 align:start position:0%
accommodate something that is a gene
 
02:26:44.510 --> 02:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
therapy product mRNA vaccines how
 
02:26:47.070 --> 02:26:47.080 align:start position:0%
convenient so if we call it a vaccine
 
02:26:48.990 --> 02:26:49.000 align:start position:0%
everyone knows that vaccines are good
 
02:26:51.110 --> 02:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
for you oh this is what we
 
02:26:54.070 --> 02:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
assume not everybody by the
 
02:26:56.670 --> 02:26:56.680 align:start position:0%
way uh so that that led to the rapid
 
02:26:58.590 --> 02:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
development and the deployment of all
 
02:27:01.630 --> 02:27:01.640 align:start position:0%
these doses to the population including
 
02:27:04.309 --> 02:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
untested patients like pregnant women
 
02:27:04.319 --> 02:27:06.190 align:start position:0%
untested patients like pregnant women
children

02:27:06.190 --> 02:27:06.200 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:27:08.910 --> 02:27:08.920 align:start position:0%
Etc didn't seem to matter to the CDC
 
02:27:11.349 --> 02:27:11.359 align:start position:0%
because now when we talk about the
 
02:27:13.269 --> 02:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
things like the children's vaccine
 
02:27:15.510 --> 02:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
schedule this was something that was
 
02:27:17.070 --> 02:27:17.080 align:start position:0%
recommended for the children's vaccine
 
02:27:20.349 --> 02:27:20.359 align:start position:0%
scheduled the covid-19 shot with no
 
02:27:25.349 --> 02:27:25.359 align:start position:0%
scientific basis At All by a subsidiary
 
02:27:28.070 --> 02:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh a subsidiary organization under the
 
02:27:32.230 --> 02:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
CDC called the um as asep advisory
 
02:27:35.670 --> 02:27:35.680 align:start position:0%
committee of immunization practices who
 
02:27:37.990 --> 02:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
voted and tell me if you think this is
 
02:27:43.990 --> 02:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
suspect 16 to0 members voted to approve
 
02:27:47.469 --> 02:27:47.479 align:start position:0%
this for children 16 to zero no one had
 
02:27:50.030 --> 02:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
any thought that
 
02:27:53.750 --> 02:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
we Common Sense tells you that children
 
02:27:56.110 --> 02:27:56.120 align:start position:0%
who get covid don't get terribly sick
 
02:27:59.710 --> 02:27:59.720 align:start position:0%
they don't die why are we recommending
 
02:28:03.349 --> 02:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
this this is the power that the CDC has
 
02:28:05.630 --> 02:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
on other states because other states
 
02:28:07.870 --> 02:28:07.880 align:start position:0%
rely on recommendations of the
 
02:28:11.990 --> 02:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
CDC wrongly in a case like this and you
 
02:28:13.710 --> 02:28:13.720 align:start position:0%
think of the vaccine schedule when my
 
02:28:15.990 --> 02:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
daughter my youngest child were born in
 
02:28:19.790 --> 02:28:19.800 align:start position:0%
1992 to she had 24 vaccines throughout
 
02:28:23.670 --> 02:28:23.680 align:start position:0%
her her her childhood today there are
 
02:28:27.030 --> 02:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
three times that amount of vaccines
 
02:28:29.469 --> 02:28:29.479 align:start position:0%
given including one that's just been
 
02:28:33.750 --> 02:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
added this RSV monoclonal antibody which
 
02:28:36.710 --> 02:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
is a which is actually a monoclonal
 
02:28:39.710 --> 02:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
antibody is a therapy it's not but
 
02:28:41.710 --> 02:28:41.720 align:start position:0%
they've changed the definitions to
 
02:28:45.590 --> 02:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
include that in the vaccine
 
02:28:48.910 --> 02:28:48.920 align:start position:0%
schedule this is again untested
 
02:28:52.630 --> 02:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
territory foreign protein injected into
 
02:28:56.349 --> 02:28:56.359 align:start position:0%
kids at Birth in this
 
02:28:59.950 --> 02:28:59.960 align:start position:0%
case uh so as the story went on there
 
02:29:03.389 --> 02:29:03.399 align:start position:0%
was some opposition but there was always
 
02:29:05.750 --> 02:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
an answer to the opposition phrases were
 
02:29:08.309 --> 02:29:08.319 align:start position:0%
invented like believe the science
 
02:29:10.910 --> 02:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
remember Dr fouchi was the science he
 
02:29:14.389 --> 02:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
declared that the omnipotent Tony FY I
 
02:29:15.510 --> 02:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
am the
 
02:29:15.520 --> 02:29:17.030 align:start position:0%
am the
science

02:29:17.030 --> 02:29:17.040 align:start position:0%
science
 
02:29:18.790 --> 02:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
terms like misinformation which
 
02:29:20.670 --> 02:29:20.680 align:start position:0%
basically uh is
 
02:29:25.750 --> 02:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
a another term for cancellation or
 
02:29:28.070 --> 02:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
invalidation it's convenient
 
02:29:32.070 --> 02:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
term uh phrases like pandemic of the
 
02:29:35.510 --> 02:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated this was even spewed by pus
 
02:29:37.950 --> 02:29:37.960 align:start position:0%
at one of his Fireside Chats he'd get
 
02:29:40.230 --> 02:29:40.240 align:start position:0%
real close to them like this is the
 
02:29:41.910 --> 02:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
pandemic of the
 
02:29:45.670 --> 02:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated untrue untrue untrue the
 
02:29:47.429 --> 02:29:47.439 align:start position:0%
highest death rate rates across the
 
02:29:49.950 --> 02:29:49.960 align:start position:0%
world were in countries that had the
 
02:29:52.750 --> 02:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
highest vaccination rate so throw that
 
02:29:53.950 --> 02:29:53.960 align:start position:0%
out the
 
02:29:55.990 --> 02:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
window safe and
 
02:30:01.469 --> 02:30:01.479 align:start position:0%
effective uh no and no safe well that's
 
02:30:05.150 --> 02:30:05.160 align:start position:0%
covered by the ver system which is a
 
02:30:08.110 --> 02:30:08.120 align:start position:0%
dinosaur of a data Gathering system that
 
02:30:10.550 --> 02:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
is filled out by patients and or
 
02:30:13.269 --> 02:30:13.279 align:start position:0%
Physicians or not in the case of
 
02:30:17.630 --> 02:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
previous testimony of uh Adverse Events
 
02:30:20.190 --> 02:30:20.200 align:start position:0%
including death which is not on the
 
02:30:22.830 --> 02:30:22.840 align:start position:0%
website for this like death is a side
 
02:30:24.790 --> 02:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
effect not
 
02:30:31.389 --> 02:30:31.399 align:start position:0%
included um effective no no um this did
 
02:30:35.269 --> 02:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
not stop the spread of covid vaccine in
 
02:30:39.269 --> 02:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
any manner in fact if people were
 
02:30:41.870 --> 02:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
vaccinated they felt that they could now
 
02:30:44.630 --> 02:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
freely mingle with other people and
 
02:30:46.670 --> 02:30:46.680 align:start position:0%
there you go with spreading the
 
02:30:49.429 --> 02:30:49.439 align:start position:0%
spreading the
 
02:30:51.710 --> 02:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
disease um I don't know if I said this
 
02:30:56.230 --> 02:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
or not but um in the when I mentioned um
 
02:30:57.950 --> 02:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
the only way out of this is through a
 
02:31:01.150 --> 02:31:01.160 align:start position:0%
vaccine uh it's not in the middle of a
 
02:31:04.110 --> 02:31:04.120 align:start position:0%
pandemic you do not vaccinate people in
 
02:31:05.870 --> 02:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
the middle of a pandemic you're not
 
02:31:08.150 --> 02:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
going to achieve her immunity
 
02:31:13.230 --> 02:31:13.240 align:start position:0%
because simply put the the vaccine is or
 
02:31:15.830 --> 02:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
or the virus in this case or or pathogen
 
02:31:19.429 --> 02:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
is exposed goes to insults and the virus
 
02:31:22.590 --> 02:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
as Tiny as it is figures out a way to
 
02:31:25.910 --> 02:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
mutate to create variance and that's
 
02:31:28.510 --> 02:31:28.520 align:start position:0%
what happens when you when you vaccinate
 
02:31:31.630 --> 02:31:31.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:34.910 --> 02:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
pandemic um so
 
02:31:37.670 --> 02:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
um I was lost my trying of thought safe
 
02:31:41.190 --> 02:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
and effective is where I left off but
 
02:31:45.429 --> 02:31:45.439 align:start position:0%
today and this is on the NIH website
 
02:31:48.830 --> 02:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
another bedmate NH which Dr fouchi
 
02:31:51.469 --> 02:31:51.479 align:start position:0%
belongs to in a in a
 
02:31:53.590 --> 02:31:53.600 align:start position:0%

02:31:53.600 --> 02:31:54.469 align:start position:0%

covid-19 question mark
 
02:32:32.269 --> 02:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
answer get vaccinated and boosted
 
02:32:37.389 --> 02:32:37.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:39.910 --> 02:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
wrong another phrase I was put out there
 
02:32:43.630 --> 02:32:43.640 align:start position:0%
vaccine hesitancy it's not vaccine
 
02:32:46.510 --> 02:32:46.520 align:start position:0%
hesitancy this is vaccine resistance
 
02:32:49.269 --> 02:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
we're not going to take this
 
02:32:51.750 --> 02:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine these are just convenient words
 
02:32:53.630 --> 02:32:53.640 align:start position:0%
to use against
 
02:32:57.389 --> 02:32:57.399 align:start position:0%
us talk talked about uh lockdowns social
 
02:32:57.399 --> 02:32:58.950 align:start position:0%
us talk talked about uh lockdowns social
distancing

02:32:58.950 --> 02:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
distancing
 
02:32:58.960 --> 02:33:00.750 align:start position:0%
distancing
isolating

02:33:00.750 --> 02:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
isolating
 
02:33:03.110 --> 02:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
masking uh we had an expert here at
 
02:33:05.150 --> 02:33:05.160 align:start position:0%
testimony whenever it was a couple years
 
02:33:05.160 --> 02:33:06.269 align:start position:0%
testimony whenever it was a couple years
ago

02:33:06.269 --> 02:33:06.279 align:start position:0%
ago
 
02:33:10.309 --> 02:33:10.319 align:start position:0%
environmental uh uh issues was his uh
 
02:33:12.990 --> 02:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
area of expertise and he demonstrated
 
02:33:15.190 --> 02:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
that the masking had no effect on the
 
02:33:16.750 --> 02:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
spread of vaccinees based on the
 
02:33:19.429 --> 02:33:19.439 align:start position:0%
particle size Etc so that was pretty
 
02:33:22.990 --> 02:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
convincing evidence um I I I don't care
 
02:33:24.710 --> 02:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
if you wear a mask Everyone's entitled
 
02:33:28.750 --> 02:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
to wear a mask but as a resident of New
 
02:33:31.269 --> 02:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I have the constitutional
 
02:33:34.510 --> 02:33:34.520 align:start position:0%
right to not wear a mask this is my body
 
02:33:36.910 --> 02:33:36.920 align:start position:0%
this is my bodily autonomy that was I
 
02:33:39.469 --> 02:33:39.479 align:start position:0%
was born with I I have to interrupt
 
02:33:41.030 --> 02:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
we've had the me we've talked a lot
 
02:33:43.429 --> 02:33:43.439 align:start position:0%
about masks today so it's and you've had
 
02:33:45.590 --> 02:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
some wonderful compelling testimony but
 
02:33:48.110 --> 02:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
to to to wrap this up we don't want to

slowly trying to make ends
 
02:35:03.630 --> 02:35:03.640 align:start position:0%
meet uh my niece worked at Mass Mass
 
02:35:07.630 --> 02:35:07.640 align:start position:0%
General Hospital she uh did not get the
 
02:35:09.630 --> 02:35:09.640 align:start position:0%
vaccination was against the
 
02:35:15.429 --> 02:35:15.439 align:start position:0%
vaccination she was uh advised that if
 
02:35:18.910 --> 02:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
she left left by her supervisor advised
 
02:35:20.670 --> 02:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
by her supervisor if she left she would
 
02:35:24.150 --> 02:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
be basically blackballed she had to move
 
02:35:28.750 --> 02:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
with her husband and her young child to
 
02:35:31.550 --> 02:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
Montana her home is in Massachusetts and
 
02:35:34.269 --> 02:35:34.279 align:start position:0%
now she's her family's been separated
 
02:35:36.910 --> 02:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
from the grandmother of the young
 
02:35:39.469 --> 02:35:39.479 align:start position:0%
child other other family members in that
 
02:35:42.389 --> 02:35:42.399 align:start position:0%
same family moved to Utah that's the
 
02:35:44.550 --> 02:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
disruption that this has
 
02:35:49.510 --> 02:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
caused so um I guess in summary is uh
 
02:35:52.030 --> 02:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
people assume that the CDC is this
 
02:35:55.830 --> 02:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
omnipotent all knowing
 
02:35:59.870 --> 02:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
uh Wizard of Oz I guess um but in fact
 
02:36:02.429 --> 02:36:02.439 align:start position:0%
it's just another bureaucracy with
 
02:36:05.150 --> 02:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
appointed officials not unelected
 
02:36:06.950 --> 02:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
officials and that includes all these
 
02:36:09.990 --> 02:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
departments including the who with huge
 
02:36:13.510 --> 02:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:16.670 --> 02:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
uh so I'm I'm I'm I'm just
 
02:36:19.230 --> 02:36:19.240 align:start position:0%
reme reminding everyone that New
 
02:36:21.790 --> 02:36:21.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens live in a state that
 
02:36:27.070 --> 02:36:27.080 align:start position:0%
where we really put a lot of emphasis on
 
02:36:29.870 --> 02:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
sovereignty of our bodies and of our of
 
02:36:34.990 --> 02:36:35.000 align:start position:0%

52 uh we will uh in that hearing uh we
 
02:37:25.110 --> 02:37:25.120 align:start position:0%
have one more this morning I have one I
 
02:37:26.630 --> 02:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
have one pink card from the prime
 
02:37:30.950 --> 02:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
sponsor on 1485 it's House Bill HB 1485
 
02:37:32.950 --> 02:37:32.960 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher is warmed up he's
 
02:37:35.309 --> 02:37:35.319 align:start position:0%
already spoken to us today the eloquent
 
02:37:37.349 --> 02:37:37.359 align:start position:0%
representative Bela
 
02:37:40.030 --> 02:37:40.040 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you so much Mr chair and
 
02:37:43.429 --> 02:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
committee this one is going to go much
 
02:37:46.349 --> 02:37:46.359 align:start position:0%
easier um so this bill would establish a
 
02:37:48.990 --> 02:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
committee to to study the totality of
 
02:37:52.230 --> 02:37:52.240 align:start position:0%
circumstances surrounding the covid-19
 
02:37:55.870 --> 02:37:55.880 align:start position:0%
pandemic okay now at the time this was
 
02:37:57.630 --> 02:37:57.640 align:start position:0%
entered nothing else was going on but as
 
02:38:00.150 --> 02:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
of right now the speaker of the house
 
02:38:04.269 --> 02:38:04.279 align:start position:0%
has appointed a special committee to
 
02:38:08.590 --> 02:38:08.600 align:start position:0%
investigate the response to the covid-19
 
02:38:10.590 --> 02:38:10.600 align:start position:0%
pandemic now I believe it's still
 
02:38:13.110 --> 02:38:13.120 align:start position:0%
important ultimately to broaden this and
 
02:38:15.910 --> 02:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
look at the whole picture but I do not
 
02:38:17.590 --> 02:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
want to see a duplication of efforts
 
02:38:20.150 --> 02:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
that's going to waste time um so what I
 
02:38:22.150 --> 02:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
would ask you to do is if you would is
 
02:38:27.030 --> 02:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
please consider um an interim study on
 
02:38:29.590 --> 02:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
this bill that the current committee can
 
02:38:32.670 --> 02:38:32.680 align:start position:0%
do its work and issue a report and this
 
02:38:34.870 --> 02:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
can be examined again in a later time to
 
02:38:37.550 --> 02:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
expand on that uh report and investigate
 
02:38:39.469 --> 02:38:39.479 align:start position:0%
any other issues that might come up
 
02:38:39.479 --> 02:38:42.030 align:start position:0%
any other issues that might come up
thank

02:38:42.030 --> 02:38:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:44.870 --> 02:38:44.880 align:start position:0%

legislative history on
 
02:38:53.389 --> 02:38:53.399 align:start position:0%
1485 and uh there there has been this
 
02:38:56.590 --> 02:38:56.600 align:start position:0%
type of uh uh issue has come up before
 
02:38:57.870 --> 02:38:57.880 align:start position:0%
and it's been referred to Health and
 
02:38:59.950 --> 02:38:59.960 align:start position:0%

02:39:02.990 --> 02:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
the legislative history on this subject
 
02:39:04.790 --> 02:39:04.800 align:start position:0%

recommendation um on interim study
 
02:39:08.710 --> 02:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
ultimately that's something that the
 
02:39:12.190 --> 02:39:12.200 align:start position:0%
committee will uh decide but it uh the
 
02:39:14.389 --> 02:39:14.399 align:start position:0%

and

03:46:11.790 --> 03:46:11.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:11.800 --> 03:46:38.590 align:start position:0%
 
one

03:46:38.590 --> 03:46:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:38.600 --> 03:46:52.149 align:start position:0%

on
 
03:47:07.030 --> 03:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
HB 20 uh hr22 before we get to that a
 
03:47:09.870 --> 03:47:09.880 align:start position:0%
couple quick housekeeping points uh we
 
03:47:11.990 --> 03:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
have uh eight subs today I think that's
 
03:47:14.110 --> 03:47:14.120 align:start position:0%
a record and some of them are coming in
 
03:47:16.070 --> 03:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
we'll welcome them all uh when we start
 
03:47:19.389 --> 03:47:19.399 align:start position:0%
a exec session uh so we'll do this one
 
03:47:22.229 --> 03:47:22.239 align:start position:0%
bill and then we'll take a short break
 
03:47:25.349 --> 03:47:25.359 align:start position:0%
uh the uh the red team will have a short
 
03:47:28.750 --> 03:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
caucus in the office and then we'll come
 
03:47:31.030 --> 03:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
back and we will run through the exact
 
03:47:34.149 --> 03:47:34.159 align:start position:0%
uh schedule there are three amendments
 
03:47:37.389 --> 03:47:37.399 align:start position:0%
um representative mcarter uh has an
 
03:47:41.149 --> 03:47:41.159 align:start position:0%
amendment which uh representative uh
 
03:47:44.110 --> 03:47:44.120 align:start position:0%
Carrie will introduce on hcr9 so that
 
03:47:45.790 --> 03:47:45.800 align:start position:0%
should she passed those out everybody
 
03:47:48.510 --> 03:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
should have those um representative
 
03:47:50.950 --> 03:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
Sebert has an amendment on
 
03:47:54.070 --> 03:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
hr28 and those have been passed out and
 
03:47:55.950 --> 03:47:55.960 align:start position:0%
representative philio has an amendment
 
03:47:58.990 --> 03:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
that's printed out that will go uh I
 
03:48:00.469 --> 03:48:00.479 align:start position:0%
think he still has that those will be
 
03:48:02.910 --> 03:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
passed out as well by exec session so
 
03:48:05.030 --> 03:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
there are three amendments that every
 
03:48:08.469 --> 03:48:08.479 align:start position:0%
should be at every place uh by the time
 
03:48:10.790 --> 03:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
we start exact
 
03:48:13.309 --> 03:48:13.319 align:start position:0%
okay at this time uh the prime sponsor
 
03:48:15.309 --> 03:48:15.319 align:start position:0%

prime sponsor

03:48:24.469 --> 03:48:24.479 align:start position:0%
hello um for the record I'm Amanda
 
03:48:26.750 --> 03:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
Balden I'm represent hillsbor District
 
03:48:31.229 --> 03:48:31.239 align:start position:0%
25 um I promise I do have bills this
 
03:48:32.950 --> 03:48:32.960 align:start position:0%
year that aren't about the 13th
 
03:48:37.349 --> 03:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
Amendment but you guys got the good ones
 
03:48:40.950 --> 03:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
um so I passed out a few hand outs the
 
03:48:40.960 --> 03:48:41.950 align:start position:0%
um so I passed out a few hand outs the
13th

03:48:41.950 --> 03:48:41.960 align:start position:0%
13th
 
03:48:44.950 --> 03:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment a map that printed a little
 
03:48:47.349 --> 03:48:47.359 align:start position:0%
weird on the fourth floor and an article
 
03:48:49.750 --> 03:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
from the Associated Press that also
 
03:48:51.710 --> 03:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
printed a little weird so if you want to
 
03:48:53.590 --> 03:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
Google it you can read it
 
03:48:56.870 --> 03:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
online um so I'm sure by now you're all
 
03:48:58.269 --> 03:48:58.279 align:start position:0%
familiar with the wording of the 13th
 
03:49:00.389 --> 03:49:00.399 align:start position:0%
Amendment of the US Constitution neither
 
03:49:03.910 --> 03:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
slavery nor involuntary servitude except
 
03:49:06.349 --> 03:49:06.359 align:start position:0%
as a punishment for Crime where of the
 
03:49:08.309 --> 03:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
party shall have been duly
 
03:49:10.670 --> 03:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
convicted shall exist within the United
 
03:49:12.790 --> 03:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
States or any place subject to their
 
03:49:17.349 --> 03:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction so this resolution and I'm
 
03:49:18.550 --> 03:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
sure as members of this committee I was
 
03:49:20.710 --> 03:49:20.720 align:start position:0%
on this committee for three terms um so
 
03:49:21.830 --> 03:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
as members of this committee I'm sure
 
03:49:23.309 --> 03:49:23.319 align:start position:0%
you know by now that a house resolution
 
03:49:27.229 --> 03:49:27.239 align:start position:0%
is a strongly worded letter that goes to
 
03:49:28.990 --> 03:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
whoever it's intended for and whether
 
03:49:30.990 --> 03:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
they read it or not whether they do what
 
03:49:34.070 --> 03:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
we ask or not is beyond our control so
 
03:49:36.830 --> 03:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
this is more um representative of the
 
03:49:39.309 --> 03:49:39.319 align:start position:0%
sentiment of New Hampshire and in
 
03:49:41.349 --> 03:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
particular of the New Hampshire
 
03:49:45.110 --> 03:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
house um so there is a loophole in the
 
03:49:46.750 --> 03:49:46.760 align:start position:0%
13th Amendment that allows for
 
03:49:49.110 --> 03:49:49.120 align:start position:0%
enslavement of humans within the United
 
03:49:51.950 --> 03:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
States if those humans are
 
03:49:54.870 --> 03:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
incarcerated this interpretation isn't
 
03:49:57.590 --> 03:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
just mine in the case of ruffen V
 
03:50:01.990 --> 03:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
Commonwealth in 1871 not long after the
 
03:50:05.269 --> 03:50:05.279 align:start position:0%
um 13th amendment was added to our
 
03:50:08.030 --> 03:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
constitution the Supreme Court declared
 
03:50:11.309 --> 03:50:11.319 align:start position:0%
that an inmate is a Slave of the state
 
03:50:13.830 --> 03:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
so due to this loophole almost as soon
 
03:50:16.110 --> 03:50:16.120 align:start position:0%
as the 13th amendment was ratified
 
03:50:18.630 --> 03:50:18.640 align:start position:0%
States and municipalities began passing
 
03:50:20.950 --> 03:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
petty crime laws known as the Black
 
03:50:23.750 --> 03:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
Codes these laws criminalized actions
 
03:50:25.670 --> 03:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
that were most likely to be committed by
 
03:50:28.590 --> 03:50:28.600 align:start position:0%
recently freed slaves such as loitering
 
03:50:30.389 --> 03:50:30.399 align:start position:0%
and homelessness or
 
03:50:32.670 --> 03:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
vagrancy some of these laws prohibited
 
03:50:34.309 --> 03:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
former slaves from holding certain types
 
03:50:37.189 --> 03:50:37.199 align:start position:0%
of jobs and other laws punished former
 
03:50:41.070 --> 03:50:41.080 align:start position:0%
slaves for being unemployed
 
03:50:42.910 --> 03:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
plantations accustomed to slave labor
 
03:50:44.630 --> 03:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
were suffering a labor shortage as a
 
03:50:46.870 --> 03:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
result of the 13th Amendment so area
 
03:50:50.630 --> 03:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
prisons sold prisoner labor to those
 
03:50:53.510 --> 03:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
plantations on the cheap the prisoners
 
03:50:54.830 --> 03:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
themselves received no money for their
 
03:50:56.870 --> 03:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
work as returning to their former slave
 
03:50:58.830 --> 03:50:58.840 align:start position:0%
life was considered a fair punishment
 
03:51:00.870 --> 03:51:00.880 align:start position:0%
for the crime of loitering bancy
 
03:51:00.880 --> 03:51:02.110 align:start position:0%
for the crime of loitering bancy
unemployment

03:51:02.110 --> 03:51:02.120 align:start position:0%
unemployment
 
03:51:04.469 --> 03:51:04.479 align:start position:0%
Etc the Black Codes have been expanding
 
03:51:06.030 --> 03:51:06.040 align:start position:0%
ever since albeit under different
 
03:51:08.269 --> 03:51:08.279 align:start position:0%
terminology such as the War on Drugs
 
03:51:10.550 --> 03:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimum sentencing and so
 
03:51:13.189 --> 03:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
forth in the early 1900s the Black Codes
 
03:51:14.990 --> 03:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
were used to justify over incarceration
 
03:51:16.910 --> 03:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
and harassment of Italian Americans
 
03:51:18.110 --> 03:51:18.120 align:start position:0%
during a period of time in which
 
03:51:20.750 --> 03:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
Italians were widely hated in the United
 
03:51:22.910 --> 03:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
States the exception in the 13th
 
03:51:25.229 --> 03:51:25.239 align:start position:0%
Amendment laid the essential ground
 
03:51:26.510 --> 03:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
workor for mass
 
03:51:28.590 --> 03:51:28.600 align:start position:0%
incarceration in fact the prison
 
03:51:30.269 --> 03:51:30.279 align:start position:0%
population in proportion to the total
 
03:51:32.030 --> 03:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
population has increased by more than 10
 
03:51:34.269 --> 03:51:34.279 align:start position:0%
times since the ratification of the 13th
 
03:51:36.189 --> 03:51:36.199 align:start position:0%
Amendment in other words the prison
 
03:51:38.229 --> 03:51:38.239 align:start position:0%
population is growing more than 10 times
 
03:51:40.670 --> 03:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
faster than the population of the
 
03:51:44.429 --> 03:51:44.439 align:start position:0%
country as an aside from a nonpartisan
 
03:51:47.229 --> 03:51:47.239 align:start position:0%
perspective um support for this change
 
03:51:50.070 --> 03:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
to the 13th Amendment isn't partisan in
 
03:51:53.630 --> 03:51:53.640 align:start position:0%
2018 Kanye West met with uh former
 
03:51:56.630 --> 03:51:56.640 align:start position:0%
president Donald Trump asking for the
 
03:51:58.950 --> 03:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
same change that this resolution asks
 
03:52:02.469 --> 03:52:02.479 align:start position:0%
Congress um to take
 
03:52:05.510 --> 03:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
up also bipartisan efforts are underway
 
03:52:07.590 --> 03:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
in Congress to close the loophole so
 
03:52:09.910 --> 03:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
we're simply encouraging them along what
 
03:52:11.830 --> 03:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
they're already working on and it should
 
03:52:14.750 --> 03:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
be noted that New Hampshire has uh was
 
03:52:16.349 --> 03:52:16.359 align:start position:0%
historically not very economically
 
03:52:18.950 --> 03:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
dependent upon slave labor and as I
 
03:52:20.349 --> 03:52:20.359 align:start position:0%
recall New Hampshire's only major
 
03:52:22.510 --> 03:52:22.520 align:start position:0%
influence on the slave trade was in
 
03:52:25.349 --> 03:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
importing because you know the New
 
03:52:27.269 --> 03:52:27.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Advantage um they weren't
 
03:52:29.590 --> 03:52:29.600 align:start position:0%
taxing the import of slaves so if you
 
03:52:31.309 --> 03:52:31.319 align:start position:0%
wanted to bring slaves into the country
 
03:52:33.510 --> 03:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
it's good to Loop them through New
 
03:52:37.110 --> 03:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for a minute um but evidence
 
03:52:38.630 --> 03:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
of slavery existing within New Hampshire
 
03:52:40.510 --> 03:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
Peters out in the early
 
03:52:43.389 --> 03:52:43.399 align:start position:0%
1800s so just as New Hampshire didn't
 
03:52:45.309 --> 03:52:45.319 align:start position:0%
have any privately held slaves for
 
03:52:48.189 --> 03:52:48.199 align:start position:0%
decades prior to the Civil War and was
 
03:52:50.469 --> 03:52:50.479 align:start position:0%
on the right side of history at the time
 
03:52:53.309 --> 03:52:53.319 align:start position:0%
today we don't use publicly held slave
 
03:52:56.229 --> 03:52:56.239 align:start position:0%
labor in our prisons with this
 
03:52:58.269 --> 03:52:58.279 align:start position:0%
resolution we're calling on the federal
 
03:53:00.030 --> 03:53:00.040 align:start position:0%
government to close the book on slavery
 
03:53:02.309 --> 03:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
once and for all so New Hampshire can be
 
03:53:04.830 --> 03:53:04.840 align:start position:0%
on the right side of History again and
 
03:53:08.349 --> 03:53:08.359 align:start position:0%
if there's any question as to whether
 
03:53:09.910 --> 03:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
this practice
 
03:53:12.870 --> 03:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
um occurs in New Hampshire I did include
 
03:53:14.630 --> 03:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
a map that printed like I said a little
 
03:53:18.189 --> 03:53:18.199 align:start position:0%
weird but the darker spots on the
 
03:53:21.429 --> 03:53:21.439 align:start position:0%
map which kind of follow a certain line
 
03:53:23.030 --> 03:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
you may have learned about in History
 
03:53:27.790 --> 03:53:27.800 align:start position:0%
Class um are the locations of Prisons
 
03:53:29.750 --> 03:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
that have
 
03:53:33.590 --> 03:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
agricultural um programs where the
 
03:53:36.269 --> 03:53:36.279 align:start position:0%
facility receives money from private
 
03:53:37.790 --> 03:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
businesses when the
 
03:53:40.309 --> 03:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
prisoners um um engage in agricultural
 
03:53:43.750 --> 03:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
work and the lighter spots are where
 
03:53:46.309 --> 03:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
slave labor is not used
 
03:53:49.149 --> 03:53:49.159 align:start position:0%
and philosophically or like from a
 
03:53:52.670 --> 03:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
scholarly perspective the difference
 
03:53:56.750 --> 03:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
between working in jail versus slavery
 
03:53:59.670 --> 03:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
is when you work in jail you may be paid
 
03:54:01.429 --> 03:54:01.439 align:start position:0%
you may be paid a very small amount I
 
03:54:03.070 --> 03:54:03.080 align:start position:0%
think in New Hampshire it's something
 
03:54:05.469 --> 03:54:05.479 align:start position:0%
along 75 cents a day but you are
 
03:54:09.349 --> 03:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
paid um you may be required to work to
 
03:54:10.950 --> 03:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
the extent of restitution like if you've
 
03:54:12.429 --> 03:54:12.439 align:start position:0%
done some graffiti you're going to need
 
03:54:14.630 --> 03:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
to clean that up all of those are not
 
03:54:17.469 --> 03:54:17.479 align:start position:0%
considered slavery um you may have the
 
03:54:20.030 --> 03:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
option to participate while you're
 
03:54:22.870 --> 03:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
incarcerated in cleaning or cooking
 
03:54:26.389 --> 03:54:26.399 align:start position:0%
that's not slavery slavy
 
03:54:29.790 --> 03:54:29.800 align:start position:0%
is you're required to work for the
 
03:54:32.389 --> 03:54:32.399 align:start position:0%
benefit of someone who can punish you if
 
03:54:34.110 --> 03:54:34.120 align:start position:0%
you don't work you're working and
 
03:54:36.630 --> 03:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
providing benefit to someone who can
 
03:54:39.349 --> 03:54:39.359 align:start position:0%
punish you when you refuse to work and
 
03:54:41.670 --> 03:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
there may be reasonable conditions in
 
03:54:44.550 --> 03:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
which someone would refuse to work maybe
 
03:54:45.870 --> 03:54:45.880 align:start position:0%
they're while they're incarcerated a
 
03:54:48.030 --> 03:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
family member's past and they're trying
 
03:54:50.070 --> 03:54:50.080 align:start position:0%
to mourn maybe they're sick maybe
 
03:54:52.710 --> 03:54:52.720 align:start position:0%
they're in pain and if they refuse to
 
03:54:54.830 --> 03:54:54.840 align:start position:0%
work even given those probably
 
03:54:56.670 --> 03:54:56.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable circumstances there are
 
03:54:58.110 --> 03:54:58.120 align:start position:0%
facilities in this country that will
 
03:55:00.950 --> 03:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
punish prisoners who refuse to work even
 
03:55:04.710 --> 03:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
with those reasons and the AP article
 
03:55:06.990 --> 03:55:07.000 align:start position:0%
shows us the full extent
 
03:55:09.389 --> 03:55:09.399 align:start position:0%
of um
 
03:55:12.229 --> 03:55:12.239 align:start position:0%
the realities of slave labor where
 
03:55:15.070 --> 03:55:15.080 align:start position:0%
Americans are enslaved in this country
 
03:55:17.389 --> 03:55:17.399 align:start position:0%
and how it plays into our economy um it
 
03:55:19.670 --> 03:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
was a 2-year long investigation by the
 
03:55:22.710 --> 03:55:22.720 align:start position:0%
AP and they found that um in these
 
03:55:22.720 --> 03:55:23.910 align:start position:0%
AP and they found that um in these
agricultural

03:55:23.910 --> 03:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
agricultural
 
03:55:26.550 --> 03:55:26.560 align:start position:0%
departments south of a certain line for
 
03:55:29.750 --> 03:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
the most part in this country um
 
03:55:32.269 --> 03:55:32.279 align:start position:0%
prisoners are producing things that end
 
03:55:34.510 --> 03:55:34.520 align:start position:0%
up at McDonald's that end up at Walmart
 
03:55:36.710 --> 03:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
that you've probably purchased and eaten
 
03:55:39.550 --> 03:55:39.560 align:start position:0%
in your home and in your life
 
03:55:42.110 --> 03:55:42.120 align:start position:0%
um and and I feel like the map just
 
03:55:42.120 --> 03:55:43.309 align:start position:0%
um and and I feel like the map just
really

03:55:43.309 --> 03:55:43.319 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:55:46.030 --> 03:55:46.040 align:start position:0%
underscores the oral history of the
 
03:55:49.189 --> 03:55:49.199 align:start position:0%
Contemporary intent of the 13th
 
03:55:51.030 --> 03:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment and the exception included in
 
03:55:53.910 --> 03:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
it um and it more specifically the
 
03:55:58.030 --> 03:55:58.040 align:start position:0%
article speaks to um in the first let's
 
03:56:01.790 --> 03:56:01.800 align:start position:0%
see I think it's on the first page but
 
03:56:03.990 --> 03:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
um yeah they speak to the fact that
 
03:56:07.630 --> 03:56:07.640 align:start position:0%
there were plantations in the South that
 
03:56:09.429 --> 03:56:09.439 align:start position:0%
are now
 
03:56:12.110 --> 03:56:12.120 align:start position:0%
prisons there's this isn't conspiracy
 
03:56:13.510 --> 03:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
theory this
 
03:56:16.990 --> 03:56:17.000 align:start position:0%
is we have plantations now they're
 
03:56:19.030 --> 03:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
prisons and the prisoners are working on
 
03:56:21.910 --> 03:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
them on on that same land producing the
 
03:56:23.510 --> 03:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
same Agricultural Product that was
 
03:56:25.910 --> 03:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
produced in the 1800s there are people
 
03:56:28.550 --> 03:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
today in America who are incarcerated
 
03:56:31.750 --> 03:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason who are picking
 
03:56:34.950 --> 03:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
cotton um and not being compensated for
 
03:56:37.790 --> 03:56:37.800 align:start position:0%
that labor and a large portion of them
 
03:56:39.630 --> 03:56:39.640 align:start position:0%
are people of color
 
03:56:42.510 --> 03:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
so I'm hoping that this committee will
 
03:56:46.229 --> 03:56:46.239 align:start position:0%
support a strongly worded letter to the
 
03:56:48.349 --> 03:56:48.359 align:start position:0%
federal government asking them to close
 
03:56:51.429 --> 03:56:51.439 align:start position:0%
this loophole so that we can as we were
 
03:56:53.389 --> 03:56:53.399 align:start position:0%
in the 1800s be on the right side of
 
03:56:56.429 --> 03:56:56.439 align:start position:0%
history on this issue just as we're on
 
03:56:59.429 --> 03:56:59.439 align:start position:0%
the right side of that
 
03:57:02.110 --> 03:57:02.120 align:start position:0%
line that you all read about in history
 
03:57:04.950 --> 03:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
class I'm happy to take any
 
03:57:07.590 --> 03:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative Bal
 
03:57:09.389 --> 03:57:09.399 align:start position:0%
and as you mentioned about the 13th
 
03:57:11.830 --> 03:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment yesterday uh in the house
 
03:57:13.710 --> 03:57:13.720 align:start position:0%
session we spent a lot of time talking
 
03:57:16.550 --> 03:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
about the 13th Amendment with uh
 
03:57:19.030 --> 03:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
anniversaries uh which is some great
 
03:57:21.229 --> 03:57:21.239 align:start position:0%
history my my quick question has to do
 
03:57:24.269 --> 03:57:24.279 align:start position:0%
with uh something you did touch on uh
 
03:57:26.189 --> 03:57:26.199 align:start position:0%
the prisoners who make the license
 
03:57:27.830 --> 03:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
plates that most of us Sho that all of
 
03:57:31.590 --> 03:57:31.600 align:start position:0%
us shoes um get paid uh I don't know
 
03:57:33.149 --> 03:57:33.159 align:start position:0%
what it is it's very small as you
 
03:57:36.750 --> 03:57:36.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned so the fact that they are paid
 
03:57:39.269 --> 03:57:39.279 align:start position:0%
uh that means they cannot be considered
 
03:57:42.990 --> 03:57:43.000 align:start position:0%
slave labor that that's is that fair to
 
03:57:45.110 --> 03:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
say I think that's something that a
 
03:57:47.990 --> 03:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
judge would have to decide um I if
 
03:57:51.349 --> 03:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
there's uh any case law on that now I'm
 
03:57:54.309 --> 03:57:54.319 align:start position:0%
not familiar but I do know that it took
 
03:57:56.910 --> 03:57:56.920 align:start position:0%
me a minute yesterday I I'll speak to
 
03:57:58.309 --> 03:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
that in a second but I feel like you're
 
03:57:59.590 --> 03:57:59.600 align:start position:0%
getting at
 
03:58:02.510 --> 03:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
something um no no go ahead U you can
 
03:58:05.269 --> 03:58:05.279 align:start position:0%
speak to that a after the debate
 
03:58:06.870 --> 03:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
yesterday and that sort of surprise
 
03:58:11.149 --> 03:58:11.159 align:start position:0%
Amendment attempt on um the cacr that
 
03:58:12.830 --> 03:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
you all unanimously passed with this
 
03:58:15.590 --> 03:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
committee um I went home I rewatched the
 
03:58:17.830 --> 03:58:17.840 align:start position:0%
events of the day on that bill and it
 
03:58:19.269 --> 03:58:19.279 align:start position:0%
finally occurred to me that that
 
03:58:21.269 --> 03:58:21.279 align:start position:0%
Amendment wasn't
 
03:58:24.149 --> 03:58:24.159 align:start position:0%
about prison labor at all that that
 
03:58:25.950 --> 03:58:25.960 align:start position:0%
apparently at some point in American
 
03:58:29.189 --> 03:58:29.199 align:start position:0%
history someone who had an unwanted
 
03:58:32.389 --> 03:58:32.399 align:start position:0%
pregnancy claimed that not being able to
 
03:58:35.309 --> 03:58:35.319 align:start position:0%
access an abortion was involuntary
 
03:58:38.349 --> 03:58:38.359 align:start position:0%
servitude a court decision was made that
 
03:58:41.110 --> 03:58:41.120 align:start position:0%
that is not involuntary servitude and
 
03:58:43.030 --> 03:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
the person who presented that Amendment
 
03:58:45.149 --> 03:58:45.159 align:start position:0%
yesterday wanted that case law to follow
 
03:58:45.159 --> 03:58:45.910 align:start position:0%
yesterday wanted that case law to follow
our

03:58:45.910 --> 03:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:58:48.510 --> 03:58:48.520 align:start position:0%
wording uh into our wording in the state
 
03:58:52.830 --> 03:58:52.840 align:start position:0%
constitution here um and that but it you
 
03:58:54.309 --> 03:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
know I had to tried to talk to the
 
03:58:56.309 --> 03:58:56.319 align:start position:0%
person who put in that Amendment
 
03:58:58.309 --> 03:58:58.319 align:start position:0%
yesterday and I didn't gain that
 
03:59:00.229 --> 03:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
clarification till I got home but for
 
03:59:02.030 --> 03:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
what it's worth all of this is indeed
 
03:59:06.110 --> 03:59:06.120 align:start position:0%
about prison labor enslavement and uh
 
03:59:07.790 --> 03:59:07.800 align:start position:0%
you know the state's rights and and that
 
03:59:11.349 --> 03:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
we have an um responsibility to make
 
03:59:13.590 --> 03:59:13.600 align:start position:0%
sure that all of our ducks are in a row
 
03:59:16.189 --> 03:59:16.199 align:start position:0%
should anything ever happen to the union
 
03:59:18.950 --> 03:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
and um that we're standing by our values
 
03:59:21.830 --> 03:59:21.840 align:start position:0%
our long held values as a state and as
 
03:59:23.950 --> 03:59:23.960 align:start position:0%
part of this country um and has nothing
 
03:59:26.830 --> 03:59:26.840 align:start position:0%
to do with abortion just by The
 
03:59:30.229 --> 03:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
Bu other questions for the prime
 
03:59:33.670 --> 03:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
sponsor represent Rollins thank you Mr
 
03:59:36.269 --> 03:59:36.279 align:start position:0%
chairman you mentioned about some of the
 
03:59:38.550 --> 03:59:38.560 align:start position:0%
Southern prisons that have plantations
 
03:59:40.790 --> 03:59:40.800 align:start position:0%
are those prisoners forced to go out
 
03:59:42.229 --> 03:59:42.239 align:start position:0%
into the fields and works or are they
 
03:59:43.550 --> 03:59:43.560 align:start position:0%
offered to go out in the work for a
 
03:59:43.560 --> 03:59:46.670 align:start position:0%
offered to go out in the work for a
reduced

03:59:46.670 --> 03:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:49.070 --> 03:59:49.080 align:start position:0%
sentence it's the other way around if
 
03:59:50.670 --> 03:59:50.680 align:start position:0%
they don't go out and work they'll
 
03:59:53.149 --> 03:59:53.159 align:start position:0%
they're any kind of like good um time
 
03:59:55.510 --> 03:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
like any good uh What do they call that
 
03:59:58.630 --> 03:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
like time served time served it's like
 
04:00:00.429 --> 04:00:00.439 align:start position:0%
you get out earlier earlier release for
 
04:00:02.149 --> 04:00:02.159 align:start position:0%
good oh good behavior like that gets
 
04:00:04.149 --> 04:00:04.159 align:start position:0%
stricken so it's a punishment for not
 
04:00:07.189 --> 04:00:07.199 align:start position:0%
going working on the plantation is a
 
04:00:09.070 --> 04:00:09.080 align:start position:0%
component of being in
 
04:00:10.990 --> 04:00:11.000 align:start position:0%
so in New Hampshire you commit whatever
 
04:00:13.429 --> 04:00:13.439 align:start position:0%
crime you lose your Liberty you're
 
04:00:16.389 --> 04:00:16.399 align:start position:0%
incarcerated right you read books maybe
 
04:00:18.189 --> 04:00:18.199 align:start position:0%
you go back to school you get your GED
 
04:00:21.790 --> 04:00:21.800 align:start position:0%
you start studying law in these other
 
04:00:24.710 --> 04:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
facilities you are convicted of maybe
 
04:00:27.469 --> 04:00:27.479 align:start position:0%
the same type of crime and you work the
 
04:00:29.950 --> 04:00:29.960 align:start position:0%
fields as part of your incarceration so
 
04:00:33.830 --> 04:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
your refusal to work the fields is in a
 
04:00:36.269 --> 04:00:36.279 align:start position:0%
sense considered a refusal to experience
 
04:00:39.110 --> 04:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
your sentence but
 
04:00:42.309 --> 04:00:42.319 align:start position:0%
there's but the reason there are only
 
04:00:45.149 --> 04:00:45.159 align:start position:0%
purely economic and financial motives in
 
04:00:46.830 --> 04:00:46.840 align:start position:0%
forcing these prisoners to work these
 
04:00:49.710 --> 04:00:49.720 align:start position:0%
fields um it is
 
04:00:52.389 --> 04:00:52.399 align:start position:0%
not there is no
 
04:00:55.870 --> 04:00:55.880 align:start position:0%
evidence whatsoever that forced labor
 
04:00:59.710 --> 04:00:59.720 align:start position:0%
has any relationship to um restoring the
 
04:01:03.870 --> 04:01:03.880 align:start position:0%
person or uh rehabilitating them it's
 
04:01:06.189 --> 04:01:06.199 align:start position:0%
and that's that's what's wild about this
 
04:01:07.830 --> 04:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
map I didn't make this map it's from the
 
04:01:09.429 --> 04:01:09.439 align:start position:0%
associate press and it's based on a
 
04:01:11.429 --> 04:01:11.439 align:start position:0%
study from some other organization and
 
04:01:14.750 --> 04:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
and the AP just visualized it but when
 
04:01:17.229 --> 04:01:17.239 align:start position:0%
we talk about the 123 in American
 
04:01:20.229 --> 04:01:20.239 align:start position:0%
history 13th Amendment Black Codes petty
 
04:01:22.269 --> 04:01:22.279 align:start position:0%
crime laws suddenly a whole lot of
 
04:01:23.870 --> 04:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
former slaves are now
 
04:01:25.950 --> 04:01:25.960 align:start position:0%
incarcerated and then they're converting
 
04:01:28.590 --> 04:01:28.600 align:start position:0%
the prisons uh the plantations into
 
04:01:31.469 --> 04:01:31.479 align:start position:0%
prisons and so you can see with the the
 
04:01:34.349 --> 04:01:34.359 align:start position:0%
darker spots are the areas where the
 
04:01:36.149 --> 04:01:36.159 align:start position:0%
prisoners are required to work and
 
04:01:38.229 --> 04:01:38.239 align:start position:0%
punished if they don't as a comp
 
04:01:39.510 --> 04:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
opponent of their
 
04:01:41.870 --> 04:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
incarceration um and it's and it lines
 
04:01:44.830 --> 04:01:44.840 align:start position:0%
up pretty well with the economic needs
 
04:01:46.990 --> 04:01:47.000 align:start position:0%
of certain areas of the country and
 
04:01:49.670 --> 04:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
their relationship to agricultural work
 
04:01:52.429 --> 04:01:52.439 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative
 
04:01:54.990 --> 04:01:55.000 align:start position:0%
lungren thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:01:57.429 --> 04:01:57.439 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:01:59.469 --> 04:01:59.479 align:start position:0%
uh so they're
 
04:02:03.550 --> 04:02:03.560 align:start position:0%
prisoners they're there to be
 
04:02:08.349 --> 04:02:08.359 align:start position:0%
punished um as far as slave labor I I
 
04:02:10.429 --> 04:02:10.439 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to put myself into a
 
04:02:13.030 --> 04:02:13.040 align:start position:0%
prison cell and if I had the opportunity
 
04:02:14.870 --> 04:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
to go out
 
04:02:18.670 --> 04:02:18.680 align:start position:0%
and pick apples I think I'd be really
 
04:02:20.830 --> 04:02:20.840 align:start position:0%
happy to get the heck out of the prison
 
04:02:25.630 --> 04:02:25.640 align:start position:0%
so so the issue I'm having is uh number
 
04:02:27.870 --> 04:02:27.880 align:start position:0%
one they're there to be
 
04:02:31.429 --> 04:02:31.439 align:start position:0%
punished and I I I just think this is a
 
04:02:35.229 --> 04:02:35.239 align:start position:0%
move point I don't think it it it's I I
 
04:02:38.229 --> 04:02:38.239 align:start position:0%
don't consider it slavery I I consider
 
04:02:41.030 --> 04:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
what they're doing is uh a
 
04:02:44.830 --> 04:02:44.840 align:start position:0%
punishment serving behind time and you
 
04:02:47.950 --> 04:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to work in the iron
 
04:02:50.149 --> 04:02:50.159 align:start position:0%
uh Factory at the prison or you have the
 
04:02:53.110 --> 04:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go outside and do
 
04:02:56.670 --> 04:02:56.680 align:start position:0%
something so if if you're inside
 
04:02:59.670 --> 04:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
working the metal shop or something so
 
04:03:02.830 --> 04:03:02.840 align:start position:0%
would you consider that slavery as
 
04:03:05.349 --> 04:03:05.359 align:start position:0%
well I don't I hope I came across all
 
04:03:08.950 --> 04:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
right I do so um
 
04:03:10.710 --> 04:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
there's a lot to unpack there I just
 
04:03:17.349 --> 04:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:20.149 --> 04:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
sec the going back to something I said
 
04:03:21.630 --> 04:03:21.640 align:start position:0%
earlier I know you stepped out for a
 
04:03:23.790 --> 04:03:23.800 align:start position:0%
minute so I don't know if this was like
 
04:03:26.429 --> 04:03:26.439 align:start position:0%
um while you're in the hall but
 
04:03:30.429 --> 04:03:30.439 align:start position:0%
um the difference from
 
04:03:34.389 --> 04:03:34.399 align:start position:0%
a um philosophical perspective and I
 
04:03:38.070 --> 04:03:38.080 align:start position:0%
think in many places a legal perspective
 
04:03:43.990 --> 04:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
Ive between slavery and working is
 
04:03:47.710 --> 04:03:47.720 align:start position:0%
choice and so I know that and I think
 
04:03:50.269 --> 04:03:50.279 align:start position:0%
there's um some lawmakers in the New
 
04:03:52.510 --> 04:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire house uh that are formally
 
04:03:54.510 --> 04:03:54.520 align:start position:0%
incarcerated and they'll tell you that
 
04:03:55.670 --> 04:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
people who are incarcerated are
 
04:03:57.590 --> 04:03:57.600 align:start position:0%
generally anxious to work they want
 
04:03:59.550 --> 04:03:59.560 align:start position:0%
something to do with their time no one
 
04:04:01.630 --> 04:04:01.640 align:start position:0%
likes to sit around and be a lump except
 
04:04:05.229 --> 04:04:05.239 align:start position:0%
me but um
 
04:04:08.750 --> 04:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
so that's not the issue it's not that
 
04:04:11.110 --> 04:04:11.120 align:start position:0%
they work the issue is that they are
 
04:04:14.670 --> 04:04:14.680 align:start position:0%
punished when they decline work and that
 
04:04:14.680 --> 04:04:15.510 align:start position:0%
punished when they decline work and that
is

04:04:15.510 --> 04:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:04:19.870 --> 04:04:19.880 align:start position:0%
slavery and more specifically after the
 
04:04:22.710 --> 04:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
um Victory yesterday on the house floor
 
04:04:27.189 --> 04:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
with cacr 13 um to move it into to the
 
04:04:29.269 --> 04:04:29.279 align:start position:0%
Senate to hopefully make progress on
 
04:04:31.830 --> 04:04:31.840 align:start position:0%
adding that to our constitution I
 
04:04:33.750 --> 04:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
thought maybe I should write something
 
04:04:35.110 --> 04:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
maybe an noted or something kind of
 
04:04:37.030 --> 04:04:37.040 align:start position:0%
celebrating it being black history month
 
04:04:38.990 --> 04:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
and um and the process decided to go
 
04:04:40.750 --> 04:04:40.760 align:start position:0%
back and the last time that I was here
 
04:04:43.510 --> 04:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
on that bill I talked about my ancestry
 
04:04:46.030 --> 04:04:46.040 align:start position:0%
my slave owning ancestry and I was
 
04:04:50.149 --> 04:04:50.159 align:start position:0%
looking at a very painfully long speech
 
04:04:52.229 --> 04:04:52.239 align:start position:0%
it had it been 10 20 minutes in real
 
04:04:56.510 --> 04:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
time made by my um fifth grade Uncle
 
04:04:58.469 --> 04:04:58.479 align:start position:0%
James Wood Balden in Congress he was a
 
04:05:01.469 --> 04:05:01.479 align:start position:0%
congressman for Virginia and he was
 
04:05:04.469 --> 04:05:04.479 align:start position:0%
saying and this was
 
04:05:08.710 --> 04:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
1830s that the black population they use
 
04:05:10.590 --> 04:05:10.600 align:start position:0%
a different word back then that started
 
04:05:14.070 --> 04:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
with an N um was likely incapable of
 
04:05:17.590 --> 04:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
functioning if free and they didn't they
 
04:05:20.229 --> 04:05:20.239 align:start position:0%
also did not consider it
 
04:05:23.710 --> 04:05:23.720 align:start position:0%
slavery as um you said that you don't
 
04:05:25.469 --> 04:05:25.479 align:start position:0%
consider it slavery they also did not
 
04:05:28.309 --> 04:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
consider it slavery they didn't have a
 
04:05:30.510 --> 04:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
moral problem with it because they
 
04:05:33.389 --> 04:05:33.399 align:start position:0%
fundamentally believed that black people
 
04:05:35.990 --> 04:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
were not entirely human and he made
 
04:05:39.030 --> 04:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
these remarks in a speech in congress
 
04:05:42.389 --> 04:05:42.399 align:start position:0%
with no shame no no like hear me out
 
04:05:45.070 --> 04:05:45.080 align:start position:0%
guys or anything no prefacing it he said
 
04:05:46.630 --> 04:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
it because he expected people in the
 
04:05:49.349 --> 04:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
room to agree with him and they argued
 
04:05:51.030 --> 04:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
and believed in that time and in his
 
04:05:53.349 --> 04:05:53.359 align:start position:0%
speech he argued that if these folks
 
04:05:56.750 --> 04:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
were not held captive that they wouldn't
 
04:05:58.750 --> 04:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
be able to live proper lives and that
 
04:06:02.469 --> 04:06:02.479 align:start position:0%
they were better because of their
 
04:06:04.790 --> 04:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
enslavement and he was speaking as a
 
04:06:10.149 --> 04:06:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:13.429 --> 04:06:13.439 align:start position:0%
so there I think there is no denying
 
04:06:18.670 --> 04:06:18.680 align:start position:0%
when you combine the American history of
 
04:06:20.710 --> 04:06:20.720 align:start position:0%
the 13th Amendment the ensuing Black
 
04:06:24.870 --> 04:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
Codes the petty crime laws the over
 
04:06:27.030 --> 04:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
representation of a certain race of
 
04:06:29.910 --> 04:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
people in our prison system and when you
 
04:06:32.149 --> 04:06:32.159 align:start position:0%
combine all of that with this map
 
04:06:34.630 --> 04:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
knowing that a certain chunk of the
 
04:06:37.790 --> 04:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
country financially benefits from for
 
04:06:41.189 --> 04:06:41.199 align:start position:0%
forcing prisoners to work against their
 
04:06:43.750 --> 04:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
will and punishing them when they don't
 
04:06:46.389 --> 04:06:46.399 align:start position:0%
that this is slavery and it was the
 
04:06:49.229 --> 04:06:49.239 align:start position:0%
intent of the loophole in the 13th
 
04:06:52.590 --> 04:06:52.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment to allow for slavery so long
 
04:06:54.590 --> 04:06:54.600 align:start position:0%
as these people that were not considered
 
04:06:56.550 --> 04:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
entirely human and were believed to be
 
04:06:58.389 --> 04:06:58.399 align:start position:0%
completely dysfunctional and incapable
 
04:07:00.870 --> 04:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
of living productive lives so long as
 
04:07:02.910 --> 04:07:02.920 align:start position:0%
they were incarcerated and then they set
 
04:07:05.590 --> 04:07:05.600 align:start position:0%
the bar for incarceration incredibly low
 
04:07:07.830 --> 04:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
and that bar was are you hanging out
 
04:07:09.830 --> 04:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
outside of a store did you spit on the
 
04:07:11.710 --> 04:07:11.720 align:start position:0%
sidewalk do you have nowhere to live do
 
04:07:13.510 --> 04:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
you not have a job guess who doesn't
 
04:07:16.229 --> 04:07:16.239 align:start position:0%
have a a job and has nowhere to live a
 
04:07:17.710 --> 04:07:17.720 align:start position:0%
recently freed
 
04:07:20.750 --> 04:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
slave so the the connection I think is
 
04:07:23.510 --> 04:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
very clear and I do want to acknowledge
 
04:07:28.229 --> 04:07:28.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:31.349 --> 04:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
long-winded thank you other
 
04:07:34.189 --> 04:07:34.199 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none uh representative
 
04:07:36.710 --> 04:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
Lev your hand is up thank you chair mfet
 
04:07:38.590 --> 04:07:38.600 align:start position:0%
I should have stayed in 20 like you and
 
04:07:40.710 --> 04:07:40.720 align:start position:0%
I would have had to work so hard but
 
04:07:43.189 --> 04:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
thank you um quickly
 
04:07:46.910 --> 04:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
um was there anybody
 
04:07:49.630 --> 04:07:49.640 align:start position:0%
from the prison system
 
04:07:52.950 --> 04:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
authorities come to uh testify today and
 
04:07:55.389 --> 04:07:55.399 align:start position:0%
a followup to know and do you know what
 
04:07:57.830 --> 04:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
their position is on this because
 
04:08:01.229 --> 04:08:01.239 align:start position:0%
obviously um they don't agree with it or
 
04:08:04.630 --> 04:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't be trying to pass this
 
04:08:07.389 --> 04:08:07.399 align:start position:0%
bill this is a a house resolution a
 
04:08:09.070 --> 04:08:09.080 align:start position:0%
house resolution is a strongly worded
 
04:08:11.870 --> 04:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
letter to whoever the identified
 
04:08:14.269 --> 04:08:14.279 align:start position:0%
recipient is that's all that it is so
 
04:08:15.790 --> 04:08:15.800 align:start position:0%
last term when we had a house resolution
 
04:08:17.389 --> 04:08:17.399 align:start position:0%
in this committee asking Netflix to pull
 
04:08:20.389 --> 04:08:20.399 align:start position:0%
down a particular TV show proposed by
 
04:08:23.710 --> 04:08:23.720 align:start position:0%
the illustrious Max Abramson of CBR
 
04:08:26.950 --> 04:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
um that was passed by this committee and
 
04:08:28.910 --> 04:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
I presumably Netflix received a letter
 
04:08:30.469 --> 04:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
asking them to take down that movie and
 
04:08:33.269 --> 04:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
I don't think that they did um Netflix
 
04:08:36.189 --> 04:08:36.199 align:start position:0%
didn't come testify I don't know if
 
04:08:39.590 --> 04:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
anyone did other than the sponsor but um
 
04:08:41.990 --> 04:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
so similarly with this house resolution
 
04:08:43.870 --> 04:08:43.880 align:start position:0%
it's a strongly worded letter calling on
 
04:08:46.349 --> 04:08:46.359 align:start position:0%
Congress to do something and it's
 
04:08:47.950 --> 04:08:47.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't require anything it doesn't
 
04:08:51.670 --> 04:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
affect our prison system um it affects
 
04:08:54.429 --> 04:08:54.439 align:start position:0%
the areas covered by the 13th Amendment
 
04:08:57.309 --> 04:08:57.319 align:start position:0%
which are identified on this map um that
 
04:08:59.590 --> 04:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
you have in front of you and you can see
 
04:09:00.990 --> 04:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire is not included the
 
04:09:03.189 --> 04:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
light colored spots are the areas where
 
04:09:04.750 --> 04:09:04.760 align:start position:0%
I had to mess with the coloring to get
 
04:09:05.950 --> 04:09:05.960 align:start position:0%
it to print right on a black and white
 
04:09:06.870 --> 04:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
printer because they were green and
 
04:09:09.269 --> 04:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
purple in the arttic but the light
 
04:09:10.870 --> 04:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
colored areas are areas where prisoners
 
04:09:12.750 --> 04:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
work but they are compensated or they're
 
04:09:15.990 --> 04:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
not punished when they decline to work
 
04:09:17.389 --> 04:09:17.399 align:start position:0%
and the dark colored areas are where
 
04:09:19.870 --> 04:09:19.880 align:start position:0%
enslavement occurs in our facilities and
 
04:09:21.510 --> 04:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
this is just with regard to agriculture
 
04:09:23.229 --> 04:09:23.239 align:start position:0%
there may be other products that deserve
 
04:09:27.309 --> 04:09:27.319 align:start position:0%
their own map um so to be clear I would
 
04:09:29.870 --> 04:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
imagine that the docc isn't here today
 
04:09:31.710 --> 04:09:31.720 align:start position:0%
because this doesn't affect them and
 
04:09:33.349 --> 04:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
that's why they don't have a perspective
 
04:09:34.349 --> 04:09:34.359 align:start position:0%
it doesn't affect them because they
 
04:09:36.510 --> 04:09:36.520 align:start position:0%
don't engage in this and it doesn't
 
04:09:38.750 --> 04:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
affect them because it's a resolution
 
04:09:42.109 --> 04:09:42.119 align:start position:0%
it's just a letter it doesn't change any
 
04:09:44.189 --> 04:09:44.199 align:start position:0%
law thank you for that and that's that's
 
04:09:45.790 --> 04:09:45.800 align:start position:0%
well put the distinction between a
 
04:09:48.189 --> 04:09:48.199 align:start position:0%
resolution and a HB is significant and
 
04:09:50.950 --> 04:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
do as we mentioned yesterday at the
 
04:09:55.269 --> 04:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
house session um is is already weighed
 
04:09:58.910 --> 04:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
in on on this okay um representative
 
04:10:02.149 --> 04:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
gagy thank you so to boil it down to its
 
04:10:04.750 --> 04:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
simplest thing which is the only I
 
04:10:06.149 --> 04:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
understand simple
 
04:10:09.870 --> 04:10:09.880 align:start position:0%
things this does not prevent
 
04:10:12.630 --> 04:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
incarceration what it would prevent is
 
04:10:12.640 --> 04:10:14.469 align:start position:0%
incarceration what it would prevent is
forced

04:10:14.469 --> 04:10:14.479 align:start position:0%
forced
 
04:10:16.550 --> 04:10:16.560 align:start position:0%
labor it's a resolution it doesn't
 
04:10:18.469 --> 04:10:18.479 align:start position:0%
prevent anything it's just a letter but
 
04:10:21.830 --> 04:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
if DC were to remove the loophole
 
04:10:23.510 --> 04:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
language in the 13th Amendment which
 
04:10:26.269 --> 04:10:26.279 align:start position:0%
would be a long process and may be
 
04:10:27.710 --> 04:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
outside of the length of any of our
 
04:10:30.950 --> 04:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
lives in this room um it would
 
04:10:34.510 --> 04:10:34.520 align:start position:0%
prevent enslavement in incarc systems it
 
04:10:36.429 --> 04:10:36.439 align:start position:0%
would not prevent incarceration in any
 
04:10:36.439 --> 04:10:38.070 align:start position:0%
would not prevent incarceration in any
capacity

04:10:38.070 --> 04:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
04:10:40.389 --> 04:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
thank you rep representative Balden uh
 
04:10:44.510 --> 04:10:44.520 align:start position:0%
seeing no other hands uh we'll we will
 
04:10:47.269 --> 04:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
move on speaking of good behavior uh
 
04:10:51.710 --> 04:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:53.910 --> 04:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
minute thank you there I knew that the
 
04:10:55.070 --> 04:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
prime was going to do such a great job
 
04:10:56.830 --> 04:10:56.840 align:start position:0%
in doing the background and that AP news
 
04:10:58.469 --> 04:10:58.479 align:start position:0%
article I suggest everybody read it came
 
04:10:59.950 --> 04:10:59.960 align:start position:0%
out I think earlier this week my
 
04:11:00.990 --> 04:11:01.000 align:start position:0%
girlfriend actually sent it to me
 
04:11:02.349 --> 04:11:02.359 align:start position:0%
because she knows that I rant about the
 
04:11:04.630 --> 04:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
this exclusion in the 13th Amendment a
 
04:11:06.109 --> 04:11:06.119 align:start position:0%
lot and I'm I'm happy to know that she
 
04:11:08.389 --> 04:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
listens to me um
 
04:11:10.990 --> 04:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
so my big from the libertarian
 
04:11:13.109 --> 04:11:13.119 align:start position:0%
perspective that carv out is basically
 
04:11:15.389 --> 04:11:15.399 align:start position:0%
an incentive for governments including
 
04:11:17.550 --> 04:11:17.560 align:start position:0%
the federal to just continue making laws
 
04:11:19.670 --> 04:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
that can persecute either politically
 
04:11:21.870 --> 04:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
racially whatever it is and they can uh
 
04:11:24.269 --> 04:11:24.279 align:start position:0%
Target specific groups and it could be
 
04:11:26.109 --> 04:11:26.119 align:start position:0%
it could even be political dissidence of
 
04:11:27.630 --> 04:11:27.640 align:start position:0%
the government for example like Edward
 
04:11:30.229 --> 04:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
Snowden is uh you know to a lot of us a
 
04:11:32.229 --> 04:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
hero if that man came back I'm sure he
 
04:11:34.269 --> 04:11:34.279 align:start position:0%
would be doing hard time hard labor and
 
04:11:36.349 --> 04:11:36.359 align:start position:0%
the same with Chelsea Manning she was in
 
04:11:38.389 --> 04:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
prison and she expose war crimes
 
04:11:40.269 --> 04:11:40.279 align:start position:0%
committed by the United States and this
 
04:11:42.389 --> 04:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
is just touching like small instances of
 
04:11:44.790 --> 04:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
political prisoners and that's why I've
 
04:11:45.710 --> 04:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
always had a problem with this
 
04:11:48.030 --> 04:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
exclusionary phase because not only has
 
04:11:49.990 --> 04:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
this been used historically uh for
 
04:11:52.149 --> 04:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
racial reasons but it's we're moving
 
04:11:55.109 --> 04:11:55.119 align:start position:0%
into a phase where sometimes I I fear
 
04:12:00.109 --> 04:12:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:02.830 --> 04:12:02.840 align:start position:0%
reasons questions for the
 
04:12:05.269 --> 04:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor seeing none uh we have one
 
04:12:08.510 --> 04:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
more pink card and that is from ofilia I
 
04:12:12.229 --> 04:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
believe it's it Barett or Barnett from
 
04:12:12.239 --> 04:12:15.510 align:start position:0%
believe it's it Barett or Barnett from
um

04:12:15.510 --> 04:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:20.870 --> 04:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:23.670 --> 04:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
welcome so the prime sponsor did a very
 
04:12:26.229 --> 04:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
good job um explaining the bill and what
 
04:12:27.830 --> 04:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
it's about so I'm going to try to skim
 
04:12:30.389 --> 04:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
through this as quick as I
 
04:12:30.399 --> 04:12:32.750 align:start position:0%
through this as quick as I
can

04:12:32.750 --> 04:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
can
 
04:12:35.070 --> 04:12:35.080 align:start position:0%
okay hello good afternoon thank you
 
04:12:36.590 --> 04:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the committee
 
04:12:38.950 --> 04:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my my testimony today my name
 
04:12:40.830 --> 04:12:40.840 align:start position:0%
is ailia brette and I am the healing
 
04:12:42.550 --> 04:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
Justice program associate for the
 
04:12:44.349 --> 04:12:44.359 align:start position:0%
American friend service committee and I
 
04:12:46.510 --> 04:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
am here to urge the committee to vote
 
04:12:49.870 --> 04:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
all to pass on Bill hr22 the 13th
 
04:12:51.950 --> 04:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment to the US Constitution reads
 
04:12:53.950 --> 04:12:53.960 align:start position:0%
in part quotes neither slavery or
 
04:12:56.349 --> 04:12:56.359 align:start position:0%
involuntary servitude except as a
 
04:12:58.229 --> 04:12:58.239 align:start position:0%
punishment of a crime whereof the party
 
04:13:00.710 --> 04:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
shall have been duly convicted shall
 
04:13:02.910 --> 04:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
exist within the United States when
 
04:13:04.990 --> 04:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
people hear end slavery in New Hampshire
 
04:13:06.990 --> 04:13:07.000 align:start position:0%
or in the United States they say we
 
04:13:09.229 --> 04:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
don't have slavery we haven't had
 
04:13:10.590 --> 04:13:10.600 align:start position:0%
slavery since
 
04:13:13.429 --> 04:13:13.439 align:start position:0%
1865 my partners at abolish slavery
 
04:13:15.349 --> 04:13:15.359 align:start position:0%
national network did a poll with worth
 
04:13:16.710 --> 04:13:16.720 align:start position:0%
Rises back in
 
04:13:19.309 --> 04:13:19.319 align:start position:0%
2021 on the federal level and we
 
04:13:21.349 --> 04:13:21.359 align:start position:0%
discover that about 80% of the US
 
04:13:23.630 --> 04:13:23.640 align:start position:0%
population has no idea about the
 
04:13:26.030 --> 04:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
exception clause in the 13th Amendment
 
04:13:27.790 --> 04:13:27.800 align:start position:0%
specifically allowing slavery and
 
04:13:29.870 --> 04:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
involuntary servitude as a punishment of
 
04:13:32.349 --> 04:13:32.359 align:start position:0%
a crime and people are also unaware of
 
04:13:34.710 --> 04:13:34.720 align:start position:0%
the missing link that still exists to
 
04:13:37.149 --> 04:13:37.159 align:start position:0%
this day which is convict Leasing convi
 
04:13:39.030 --> 04:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
leing was before
 
04:13:41.590 --> 04:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
1865 which by a lot of historians say
 
04:13:43.630 --> 04:13:43.640 align:start position:0%
was worse than slavery but it was all
 
04:13:45.349 --> 04:13:45.359 align:start position:0%
put in full effect after the
 
04:13:48.030 --> 04:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
ratification of the 13th Amendment in
 
04:13:51.309 --> 04:13:51.319 align:start position:0%
1865 During the Reconstruction period
 
04:13:53.189 --> 04:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
they criminalized black lives and
 
04:13:55.510 --> 04:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
started using Black Codes as Amanda was
 
04:13:57.830 --> 04:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
suggesting and different mechanism like
 
04:14:00.389 --> 04:14:00.399 align:start position:0%
loitering to continue to incarcerate
 
04:14:02.269 --> 04:14:02.279 align:start position:0%
black people and force them to work in
 
04:14:05.030 --> 04:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
mines railroads and in some instances
 
04:14:06.550 --> 04:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
forcing them to work in the same
 
04:14:09.269 --> 04:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
Plantation that they were just slaves at
 
04:14:11.710 --> 04:14:11.720 align:start position:0%
all of this was all of this was legal
 
04:14:13.309 --> 04:14:13.319 align:start position:0%
because of the exception clause in the
 
04:14:16.030 --> 04:14:16.040 align:start position:0%
13th Amendment so effectively took the
 
04:14:18.750 --> 04:14:18.760 align:start position:0%
power to own individuals from the
 
04:14:20.710 --> 04:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
individuals themselves and instead of
 
04:14:23.349 --> 04:14:23.359 align:start position:0%
having your normal slave owners you now
 
04:14:25.590 --> 04:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
have the state that became the slave
 
04:14:27.349 --> 04:14:27.359 align:start position:0%
owner and they will lease those
 
04:14:29.830 --> 04:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
individuals out to various companies and
 
04:14:31.910 --> 04:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
organizations this allegedly went on
 
04:14:33.149 --> 04:14:33.159 align:start position:0%
till about
 
04:14:35.870 --> 04:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
1928 I say allegedly because confict
 
04:14:38.670 --> 04:14:38.680 align:start position:0%
leasing hasn't ended just like slavery
 
04:14:41.510 --> 04:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
hasn't ended after a cave in Alabama in
 
04:14:45.429 --> 04:14:45.439 align:start position:0%
1928 128 people all black children men
 
04:14:47.990 --> 04:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
women were killed the globe was so upset
 
04:14:49.550 --> 04:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
what America was doing that they
 
04:14:52.109 --> 04:14:52.119 align:start position:0%
demanded that all of this has to end so
 
04:14:54.349 --> 04:14:54.359 align:start position:0%
America decided to end it but my
 
04:14:56.910 --> 04:14:56.920 align:start position:0%
partners at asnn had a report came out a
 
04:14:59.229 --> 04:14:59.239 align:start position:0%
couple days ago from the assorted press
 
04:15:01.109 --> 04:15:01.119 align:start position:0%
that specifically in Louisiana and
 
04:15:03.189 --> 04:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
Alabama they're literally leasing out
 
04:15:05.590 --> 04:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
individuals and I say individuals
 
04:15:07.630 --> 04:15:07.640 align:start position:0%
because I don't like to say in me
 
04:15:10.030 --> 04:15:10.040 align:start position:0%
or combats because they are still people
 
04:15:11.870 --> 04:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
so they are leasing out individuals to
 
04:15:13.630 --> 04:15:13.640 align:start position:0%
private companies where they service
 
04:15:16.750 --> 04:15:16.760 align:start position:0%
goods are sold on the open market so so
 
04:15:19.349 --> 04:15:19.359 align:start position:0%
the idea that slavery has not ended has
 
04:15:21.429 --> 04:15:21.439 align:start position:0%
been so hard for people to grasp or
 
04:15:23.229 --> 04:15:23.239 align:start position:0%
fathom because for so long it's been
 
04:15:25.149 --> 04:15:25.159 align:start position:0%
something we all have been taught that
 
04:15:28.830 --> 04:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
it has ended 159 years ago to the day
 
04:15:30.670 --> 04:15:30.680 align:start position:0%
but if you take a look at all the people
 
04:15:32.710 --> 04:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
we have in prisons you see that
 
04:15:35.189 --> 04:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
statement is far from true we now have a
 
04:15:37.630 --> 04:15:37.640 align:start position:0%
new phenomenon in the United States
 
04:15:39.910 --> 04:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
before it was based on labor if you were
 
04:15:42.309 --> 04:15:42.319 align:start position:0%
locked up and enslaved it was about how
 
04:15:44.309 --> 04:15:44.319 align:start position:0%
much labor you performed but now we have
 
04:15:46.790 --> 04:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
this thing called warehousing bodies for
 
04:15:48.950 --> 04:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
profit and control where prisons are
 
04:15:51.750 --> 04:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
being built just to be filled it doesn't
 
04:15:53.790 --> 04:15:53.800 align:start position:0%
matter if you work or not as long as
 
04:15:55.830 --> 04:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
they have possession of your body they
 
04:15:57.830 --> 04:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
get an x amount of dollars for that it's
 
04:16:00.389 --> 04:16:00.399 align:start position:0%
a revenue generator let's take Riker's
 
04:16:01.990 --> 04:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
Island one of the worst jails in the
 
04:16:04.030 --> 04:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
country and I know because I've been
 
04:16:07.070 --> 04:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
there before they are making $56,000 to
 
04:16:09.830 --> 04:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
incarcerate one person and in New Jersey
 
04:16:12.229 --> 04:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
for kids under 18 years old they are
 
04:16:16.349 --> 04:16:16.359 align:start position:0%
making $620,000 a year it's not a cost
 
04:16:18.590 --> 04:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
at this point it's an incentive that's
 
04:16:20.429 --> 04:16:20.439 align:start position:0%
why we are still being criminalized
 
04:16:22.750 --> 04:16:22.760 align:start position:0%
hunted down captured and put in these
 
04:16:26.109 --> 04:16:26.119 align:start position:0%
cages then to make matters even worse
 
04:16:28.830 --> 04:16:28.840 align:start position:0%
these these private prons are often sold
 
04:16:30.910 --> 04:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
on the international open market in the
 
04:16:33.229 --> 04:16:33.239 align:start position:0%
form of prison stocks and jail bonds
 
04:16:35.149 --> 04:16:35.159 align:start position:0%
which is a literal and technically a
 
04:16:38.030 --> 04:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
slave trade so I am just going to leave
 
04:16:40.630 --> 04:16:40.640 align:start position:0%
it at that here for now cuz I can go on
 
04:16:42.790 --> 04:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
for hours on this subject but with all
 
04:16:45.189 --> 04:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
that being said I ask for you chairman
 
04:16:48.269 --> 04:16:48.279 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee to finish
 
04:16:50.469 --> 04:16:50.479 align:start position:0%
what Lincoln has started and let's end
 
04:16:52.469 --> 04:16:52.479 align:start position:0%
slavery and its entirety by urging
 
04:16:54.189 --> 04:16:54.199 align:start position:0%
Congress to remove the exception from
 
04:16:56.710 --> 04:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
the 13 Amendment to the United States
 
04:16:59.990 --> 04:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you ailia I do want to
 
04:17:03.149 --> 04:17:03.159 align:start position:0%
say that uh between cacr 13 yesterday
 
04:17:06.030 --> 04:17:06.040 align:start position:0%
and in this resolution today a lot of
 
04:17:07.349 --> 04:17:07.359 align:start position:0%
history has
 
04:17:10.710 --> 04:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
learned and is being learned and uh that
 
04:17:14.189 --> 04:17:14.199 align:start position:0%
uh I think is wonderful
 
04:17:16.910 --> 04:17:16.920 align:start position:0%
questions see seeing none thank you
 
04:17:18.870 --> 04:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
again for your testimony for being here
 
04:17:21.070 --> 04:17:21.080 align:start position:0%
yes no problem that is the last pink
 
04:17:23.990 --> 04:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
card that I have so at this time I will
 
04:17:26.349 --> 04:17:26.359 align:start position:0%
uh call an end to the hearing on that
 
04:17:29.389 --> 04:17:29.399 align:start position:0%

lunchtime at the end of lunchtime we
 
04:17:39.830 --> 04:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
needed to reschedule that because uh it
 
04:17:42.990 --> 04:17:43.000 align:start position:0%
was explained that we needed to uh uh
 
04:17:45.389 --> 04:17:45.399 align:start position:0%

today thank you chairman and members of
the

04:36:31.109 --> 04:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:36:33.109 --> 04:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
committee I want to extend deep
 
04:36:37.109 --> 04:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:39.949 --> 04:36:39.959 align:start position:0%
and Tom Mullen who's here with his wife
 
04:36:42.789 --> 04:36:42.799 align:start position:0%
Mickey they travel from Florida and
 
04:36:42.799 --> 04:36:44.590 align:start position:0%
Mickey they travel from Florida and
Maine

04:36:44.590 --> 04:36:44.600 align:start position:0%
Maine
 
04:36:48.150 --> 04:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
respectively they came to support this
 
04:36:50.310 --> 04:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
investigation into the attack on their
 
04:36:52.750 --> 04:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
ship and their Shipmates a number of
 
04:36:55.590 --> 04:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
years ago but still very personal to
 
04:36:59.629 --> 04:36:59.639 align:start position:0%
them I was able to have dinner with with
 
04:37:02.390 --> 04:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
Mr Mullen and his wife last night and
 
04:37:04.551 --> 04:37:04.561 align:start position:0%
it's it's unfortunate that the na ill
 
04:37:06.189 --> 04:37:06.199 align:start position:0%
just testified today because I think
 
04:37:07.551 --> 04:37:07.561 align:start position:0%
it's important to realize that just
 
04:37:09.390 --> 04:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
because something happened many decades
 
04:37:10.789 --> 04:37:10.799 align:start position:0%
ago it's not something you deal with
 
04:37:13.230 --> 04:37:13.240 align:start position:0%
every single day it's very personal for
 
04:37:16.510 --> 04:37:16.520 align:start position:0%
them and I'm going to do my best to try
 
04:37:16.520 --> 04:37:17.429 align:start position:0%
them and I'm going to do my best to try
to

04:37:17.429 --> 04:37:17.439 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:37:20.150 --> 04:37:20.160 align:start position:0%
convey the importance of this to you
 
04:37:23.230 --> 04:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
today and to just address a couple
 
04:37:26.709 --> 04:37:26.719 align:start position:0%
different documents that were not fully
 
04:37:28.551 --> 04:37:28.561 align:start position:0%
understood I believe at the
 
04:37:30.150 --> 04:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
representative we only have a couple
 
04:37:31.830 --> 04:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
minutes and I don't want to get into
 
04:37:33.470 --> 04:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
documents I just wanted to give you a
 
04:37:35.910 --> 04:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
minute or two to recognize these
 
04:37:37.590 --> 04:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
Survivors by name and then we need to
 
04:37:41.189 --> 04:37:41.199 align:start position:0%
begin the exact process okay well I just
 
04:37:43.510 --> 04:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to say then that the court of
 
04:37:45.029 --> 04:37:45.039 align:start position:0%
inquiry was the only United States
 
04:37:46.590 --> 04:37:46.600 align:start position:0%
government investigation into the attack
 
04:37:48.990 --> 04:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
this is proven in a 2005 letter to a
 
04:37:52.150 --> 04:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
congressman and that in 2013 the VFW
 
04:37:54.869 --> 04:37:54.879 align:start position:0%
passed a resolution for investigation
 
04:37:57.150 --> 04:37:57.160 align:start position:0%
and in 2017 the American Legion passed a
 
04:37:58.869 --> 04:37:58.879 align:start position:0%
resolution for an investigation into
 
04:38:01.470 --> 04:38:01.480 align:start position:0%
this attack so major organizations
 
04:38:03.310 --> 04:38:03.320 align:start position:0%
support this I support this and I want
 
04:38:05.150 --> 04:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
to thank the gentleman for making the
 
04:38:08.070 --> 04:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
trip today and I encourage you to weigh
 
04:38:10.910 --> 04:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
your decision and to to get this done
 
04:38:13.150 --> 04:38:13.160 align:start position:0%
this this needs to get done thank you
 
04:38:14.789 --> 04:38:14.799 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and as I said
 
04:38:18.310 --> 04:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
earlier uh this process uh has
 
04:38:21.789 --> 04:38:21.799 align:start position:0%
definitely raised awareness to a lot of
 
04:38:24.750 --> 04:38:24.760 align:start position:0%
people hundreds of people have watched
 
04:38:27.709 --> 04:38:27.719 align:start position:0%
the the two sessions the hearing in the
 
04:38:29.390 --> 04:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
first executive session where we
 
04:38:34.269 --> 04:38:34.279 align:start position:0%
discussed the 1967 attack uh so if
 
04:38:36.709 --> 04:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
nothing else whatever uh ultimately
 
04:38:39.910 --> 04:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
plays out uh please know that a lot of
 
04:38:42.670 --> 04:38:42.680 align:start position:0%
many people in New Hampshire and Beyond
 
04:38:44.869 --> 04:38:44.879 align:start position:0%
uh have learned or if they didn't know
 
04:38:47.629 --> 04:38:47.639 align:start position:0%
they were reminded of what happened in
 
04:38:51.070 --> 04:38:51.080 align:start position:0%
1967 all that said uh let's get to it
 
04:38:54.349 --> 04:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
and uh so on HB 1041 uh representative
 
04:38:56.750 --> 04:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
Manion you have a uh a motion yes I'd
 
04:38:59.189 --> 04:38:59.199 align:start position:0%
like to motion interim study we have a
 
04:39:01.189 --> 04:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
second second second from representative
 
04:39:03.189 --> 04:39:03.199 align:start position:0%
gagy would you speak to your motion uh
 
04:39:05.629 --> 04:39:05.639 align:start position:0%
representative Manion absolutely so uh
 
04:39:07.470 --> 04:39:07.480 align:start position:0%
we had a failed OTP motion and there was
 
04:39:09.390 --> 04:39:09.400 align:start position:0%
like a lot of discussion about like uh
 
04:39:10.830 --> 04:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
you know consequences of the thing and
 
04:39:12.750 --> 04:39:12.760 align:start position:0%
how it would look like the Optics of the
 
04:39:14.750 --> 04:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
bill and all that but I I don't feel
 
04:39:17.189 --> 04:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
that this uh like we can make
 
04:39:18.789 --> 04:39:18.799 align:start position:0%
modifications to the problems that they
 
04:39:19.949 --> 04:39:19.959 align:start position:0%
had with the bill with the study
 
04:39:21.470 --> 04:39:21.480 align:start position:0%
committee we can look into it we can
 
04:39:23.109 --> 04:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
address all the concerns and we make
 
04:39:24.269 --> 04:39:24.279 align:start position:0%
sure we can all come together around
 
04:39:26.109 --> 04:39:26.119 align:start position:0%
this for these men I feel like they were
 
04:39:27.349 --> 04:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
betrayed by the federal government by
 
04:39:29.349 --> 04:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
not having a very good uh investigation
 
04:39:31.470 --> 04:39:31.480 align:start position:0%
into this like catastrophe and it's just
 
04:39:33.150 --> 04:39:33.160 align:start position:0%
kind of been forgotten about at the
 
04:39:34.470 --> 04:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
federal level so we need to do something
 
04:39:35.709 --> 04:39:35.719 align:start position:0%
about this at the state level in my
 
04:39:38.590 --> 04:39:38.600 align:start position:0%
opinion thank you thank you represent
 
04:39:40.470 --> 04:39:40.480 align:start position:0%

my why I second this this I don't want
 
04:40:07.070 --> 04:40:07.080 align:start position:0%
this thing to die I want those people
 
04:40:08.868 --> 04:40:08.878 align:start position:0%
out there who are listening to this
 
04:40:11.390 --> 04:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
maybe the Congressional Delegation maybe
 
04:40:14.150 --> 04:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
some of their staffers or their age will
 
04:40:17.190 --> 04:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
be listening to this and dig into this
 
04:40:19.628 --> 04:40:19.638 align:start position:0%
and don't let this die because whatever
 
04:40:22.350 --> 04:40:22.360 align:start position:0%
we do here unless they get involved
 
04:40:25.310 --> 04:40:25.320 align:start position:0%

higher and why were they basically
 
04:40:46.948 --> 04:40:46.958 align:start position:0%

04:40:49.550 --> 04:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
prevented from uh what I read from this

doesn't understand interim study means
 
04:42:50.150 --> 04:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
that we will continue to work with this

a committee will be uh assigned uh we
 
04:42:55.750 --> 04:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
don't know who will be on it yet we will
 
04:42:57.470 --> 04:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
figure that out and the committee will
 
04:43:00.030 --> 04:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
take this up again and try to look at
 
04:43:02.350 --> 04:43:02.360 align:start position:0%
the language of the original measure and
 
04:43:04.670 --> 04:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
see what recommendations they might make
 
04:43:07.830 --> 04:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
for uh reording approaching it

04:51:51.390 --> 04:51:51.400 align:start position:0%

Manion uh would you care to speak to
 
04:51:59.868 --> 04:51:59.878 align:start position:0%
your motion yeah so the the Article 5
 
04:52:01.708 --> 04:52:01.718 align:start position:0%
system is in the constitution is another
 
04:52:03.708 --> 04:52:03.718 align:start position:0%
way for us to for the states themselves
 
04:52:04.948 --> 04:52:04.958 align:start position:0%
to propose amendments to the
 
04:52:06.910 --> 04:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution uh we know that uh Congress
 
04:52:08.150 --> 04:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
has until
 
04:52:10.990 --> 04:52:11.000 align:start position:0%
now proposed every single Amendment we
 
04:52:12.868 --> 04:52:12.878 align:start position:0%
know to date uh I think it's time for
 
04:52:14.110 --> 04:52:14.120 align:start position:0%
the states to take back some of that
 
04:52:15.990 --> 04:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
power ourselves to make sure that we uh
 
04:52:18.270 --> 04:52:18.280 align:start position:0%

04:52:42.868 --> 04:52:42.878 align:start position:0%
to you um two terms ago this this
 
04:52:46.350 --> 04:52:46.360 align:start position:0%
committee opposed uh the Article 5
 
04:52:49.030 --> 04:52:49.040 align:start position:0%
concept almost unanimously it just did
 
04:52:51.150 --> 04:52:51.160 align:start position:0%
not have any legs at that time it's it
 
04:52:54.510 --> 04:52:54.520 align:start position:0%
comes up regularly however last term uh
 
04:52:57.390 --> 04:52:57.400 align:start position:0%
we spent a lot of time on this uh we had
 
04:52:59.590 --> 04:52:59.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of testimony on this and several
 
04:53:02.070 --> 04:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
of us uh given the new information the
 
04:53:04.190 --> 04:53:04.200 align:start position:0%
new testimony the time we been on it
 
04:53:07.910 --> 04:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
several of us uh decided that we were no
 
04:53:11.190 --> 04:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
longer uh as concerned with mostly the
 
04:53:12.548 --> 04:53:12.558 align:start position:0%
run the the biggest thing was the
 
04:53:14.708 --> 04:53:14.718 align:start position:0%
so-called runaway
 
04:53:17.868 --> 04:53:17.878 align:start position:0%
convention uh issue and to my
 
04:53:20.708 --> 04:53:20.718 align:start position:0%
satisfaction and to others as well the
 
04:53:23.070 --> 04:53:23.080 align:start position:0%
the notion of a possible runaway
 
04:53:25.708 --> 04:53:25.718 align:start position:0%
convention was uh our our fears were
 
04:53:28.708 --> 04:53:28.718 align:start position:0%
alleviated and in the bipartisan fashion
 
04:53:32.230 --> 04:53:32.240 align:start position:0%
uh we this committee last year supported
 
04:53:34.310 --> 04:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
the the Article 5
 
04:53:38.510 --> 04:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
concept um so some think that the 1787
 
04:53:42.110 --> 04:53:42.120 align:start position:0%
1787 constitu Convention was a uh which
 
04:53:44.110 --> 04:53:44.120 align:start position:0%
created our wondrous Constitution was
 
04:53:46.110 --> 04:53:46.120 align:start position:0%
that a runaway convention some some make
 
04:53:49.150 --> 04:53:49.160 align:start position:0%
that case uh did it work out uh I think
 
04:53:51.430 --> 04:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
so I think it's maybe one of the most
 
04:53:54.150 --> 04:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
wondrous documents that ever occurred
 
04:53:56.628 --> 04:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
and that came from that Constitutional
 
04:53:58.990 --> 04:53:59.000 align:start position:0%
Convention and so at that Constitutional
 
04:54:01.310 --> 04:54:01.320 align:start position:0%
Convention the founders uh created the
 
04:54:03.590 --> 04:54:03.600 align:start position:0%
Article 5 provision the founders put
 
04:54:06.230 --> 04:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
this in our constitution as a as a
 
04:54:10.470 --> 04:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
viable method to address possible needs
 
04:54:13.150 --> 04:54:13.160 align:start position:0%
to amend the Constitution uh this is
 
04:54:14.990 --> 04:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
from the founders it's called Article
 
04:54:17.350 --> 04:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
Five because it's in the
 
04:54:19.670 --> 04:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
Constitution several amendments to the
 
04:54:21.310 --> 04:54:21.320 align:start position:0%
Constitution that came about the
 
04:54:24.310 --> 04:54:24.320 align:start position:0%
traditional way probably came about uh
 
04:54:26.708 --> 04:54:26.718 align:start position:0%
due to the energy created by people
 
04:54:29.470 --> 04:54:29.480 align:start position:0%
looking to do an article 5 movement and
 
04:54:32.150 --> 04:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
and subsequently uh to preempt an
 
04:54:34.070 --> 04:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
article 5 movement a amendment that
 
04:54:36.230 --> 04:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
deserved to be passed became part of the
 
04:54:38.070 --> 04:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
Constitution and the last thing I want
 
04:54:41.470 --> 04:54:41.480 align:start position:0%
to say is New Hampshire has had several
 
04:54:43.510 --> 04:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional conventions of our own
 
04:54:46.470 --> 04:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire uh we've had at
 
04:54:48.510 --> 04:54:48.520 align:start position:0%
least five maybe maybe more I think the
 
04:54:51.750 --> 04:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
last one was in 1970s so the notion of a
 
04:54:51.760 --> 04:54:53.350 align:start position:0%
last one was in 1970s so the notion of a
constitutional

04:54:53.350 --> 04:54:53.360 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
04:54:57.548 --> 04:54:57.558 align:start position:0%
convention uh as a means to uh review in
 
04:54:59.670 --> 04:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
and possibly amend the Constitution
 
04:55:01.548 --> 04:55:01.558 align:start position:0%
happens in the state level it's happened
 
04:55:05.030 --> 04:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
on our level 1933 it it was it provided
 
04:55:07.708 --> 04:55:07.718 align:start position:0%
the energy for the repeal of uh
 
04:55:09.628 --> 04:55:09.638 align:start position:0%
prohibition which was the uh 18th
 
04:55:14.590 --> 04:55:14.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment so I am uh I am okay with uh
 
04:55:17.708 --> 04:55:17.718 align:start position:0%
hcr8 and I support the notion of uh an
 
04:55:20.430 --> 04:55:20.440 align:start position:0%
article 5 convention so that is is me
 
04:55:22.110 --> 04:55:22.120 align:start position:0%
and representative fard has some things
 
04:55:23.150 --> 04:55:23.160 align:start position:0%
to say
 
04:55:25.030 --> 04:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
representative uh really would I ever
 
04:55:26.510 --> 04:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
admit to this but my uh thinking may
 
04:55:28.270 --> 04:55:28.280 align:start position:0%
have evolved on this issue and of course
 
04:55:30.548 --> 04:55:30.558 align:start position:0%
that may mean that perhaps before I was
 
04:55:32.548 --> 04:55:32.558 align:start position:0%
maybe wrong but that never happened so
 
04:55:34.030 --> 04:55:34.040 align:start position:0%
I'm just becoming more perfect in my
 
04:55:35.390 --> 04:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
thinking on this
 
04:55:38.788 --> 04:55:38.798 align:start position:0%
issue uh my concerns before were perhaps
 
04:55:40.990 --> 04:55:41.000 align:start position:0%
about those of a runaway convention or
 
04:55:44.510 --> 04:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
the unknowns on the issue but in the end
 
04:55:46.110 --> 04:55:46.120 align:start position:0%
this was something that was left To Us
 
04:55:48.470 --> 04:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
by our Founders because the founders
 
04:55:51.230 --> 04:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
trusted us to have the wisdom to amend
 
04:55:53.990 --> 04:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
our constitution as was needed
 
04:55:56.190 --> 04:55:56.200 align:start position:0%
ultimately we will get the government we
 
04:55:58.310 --> 04:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
deserve so if we have the possible
 
04:56:00.948 --> 04:56:00.958 align:start position:0%
runaway convention that's the government
 
04:56:04.110 --> 04:56:04.120 align:start position:0%
we deserve ultimately we as the people
 
04:56:06.670 --> 04:56:06.680 align:start position:0%
have to trust us as the people to give
 
04:56:09.990 --> 04:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
us ourselves our government so if we
 
04:56:11.990 --> 04:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
don't trust a runaway convention if we
 
04:56:14.230 --> 04:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
don't trust our delegates we ultimately
 
04:56:16.350 --> 04:56:16.360 align:start position:0%
need to trust the Democratic process as
 
04:56:18.868 --> 04:56:18.878 align:start position:0%
we have for the last 250 years we will
 
04:56:20.910 --> 04:56:20.920 align:start position:0%
get the government we
 
04:56:23.830 --> 04:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
deserve thank you representative filot
 
04:56:26.830 --> 04:56:26.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative gallager uh our
 
04:56:28.868 --> 04:56:28.878 align:start position:0%
tradition is to allow anyone to speak
 
04:56:31.590 --> 04:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
here including sub so uh what what have
 
04:56:31.600 --> 04:56:32.270 align:start position:0%
here including sub so uh what what have
you

04:56:32.270 --> 04:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:56:37.190 --> 04:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
got um so the comments so far have
 
04:56:40.430 --> 04:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
mostly been um just about the idea of an
 
04:56:44.948 --> 04:56:44.958 align:start position:0%
article 5 um convention in general but
 
04:56:50.270 --> 04:56:50.280 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to point out um the specific
 
04:56:55.310 --> 04:56:55.320 align:start position:0%
nature of this one which is uh relative
 
04:56:58.110 --> 04:56:58.120 align:start position:0%
to elections um and specifically
 
04:57:03.948 --> 04:57:03.958 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance reform um and I I think
 
04:57:07.030 --> 04:57:07.040 align:start position:0%
the fact that this is for campaign
 
04:57:09.310 --> 04:57:09.320 align:start position:0%
Finance reform
 
04:57:13.310 --> 04:57:13.320 align:start position:0%
specifically um is a pretty important
 
04:57:17.350 --> 04:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
fact because we have seen
 
04:57:21.070 --> 04:57:21.080 align:start position:0%
um we we we have seen uh
 
04:57:23.510 --> 04:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
campaigns CA uh campaign spending get
 
04:57:25.708 --> 04:57:25.718 align:start position:0%
out of control recently and um I mean
 
04:57:28.670 --> 04:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
this is something that members of both
 
04:57:30.868 --> 04:57:30.878 align:start position:0%
parties have agreed on um we had the
 
04:57:36.548 --> 04:57:36.558 align:start position:0%
granny birthday celebration in the um in
 
04:57:37.990 --> 04:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
the SE house
 
04:57:41.910 --> 04:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
cafeteria uh the other week and um yeah
 
04:57:45.390 --> 04:57:45.400 align:start position:0%
she was she was there campaigning for uh
 
04:57:49.150 --> 04:57:49.160 align:start position:0%
the main fight fine gold um campaign
 
04:57:51.110 --> 04:57:51.120 align:start position:0%
Finance reform which unfortunately has
 
04:57:53.030 --> 04:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
been which was by parison but has
 
04:57:55.750 --> 04:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately been largely overturned by
 
04:57:59.150 --> 04:57:59.160 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court decisions um and yeah one
 
04:58:03.430 --> 04:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
of the speakers there um Jim Rubin was a
 
04:58:08.270 --> 04:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
Republican and then another um the um
 
04:58:11.510 --> 04:58:11.520 align:start position:0%
Matt Greg was a Democrat so that's yeah
 
04:58:13.510 --> 04:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
members of both parties supporting
 
04:58:16.430 --> 04:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance reform so um I think
 
04:58:18.510 --> 04:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
that shows that this is a topic that
 
04:58:20.548 --> 04:58:20.558 align:start position:0%
there's widespread agreement on and
 
04:58:22.830 --> 04:58:22.840 align:start position:0%
therefore is something we should have a
 
04:58:24.548 --> 04:58:24.558 align:start position:0%
constitutional convention
 
04:58:26.350 --> 04:58:26.360 align:start position:0%
about thank you representative you
 
04:58:28.470 --> 04:58:28.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned Jim Rubin former state senator
 
04:58:30.070 --> 04:58:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh who's been an activist in this area
 
04:58:32.628 --> 04:58:32.638 align:start position:0%
somebody I respect very much and his his
 
04:58:33.670 --> 04:58:33.680 align:start position:0%
uh word
 
04:58:36.150 --> 04:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
I I will admit also have influenced me
 
04:58:37.510 --> 04:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
anyone else on
 
04:58:39.548 --> 04:58:39.558 align:start position:0%
this uh rep
 
04:58:41.310 --> 04:58:41.320 align:start position:0%
representative representative Connie
 
04:58:43.788 --> 04:58:43.798 align:start position:0%
Lane yes um thank you for letting me ask
 
04:58:47.270 --> 04:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
a question it follows up with
 
04:58:48.948 --> 04:58:48.958 align:start position:0%
representative Gallaghers I was trying
 
04:58:52.788 --> 04:58:52.798 align:start position:0%
to figure out what the exact purpose of
 
04:58:55.750 --> 04:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
this is because it says it will restore
 
04:58:57.590 --> 04:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
free and fair
 
04:59:00.270 --> 04:59:00.280 align:start position:0%
elections then it says as described here
 
04:59:03.310 --> 04:59:03.320 align:start position:0%
in so is it really because free Fair

04:59:14.510 --> 04:59:14.520 align:start position:0%
about is it only about the citizens you
 
04:59:17.430 --> 04:59:17.440 align:start position:0%

04:59:20.390 --> 04:59:20.400 align:start position:0%

fair elections everything about free and
fair

04:59:21.708 --> 04:59:21.718 align:start position:0%
fair
 
04:59:24.310 --> 04:59:24.320 align:start position:0%
elections thank you representative uh
 
04:59:27.990 --> 04:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
the resolution uh on the page one it
 
04:59:30.030 --> 04:59:30.040 align:start position:0%
says applying to Congress for a limited
 
04:59:31.868 --> 04:59:31.878 align:start position:0%
national Convention for the exclusive
 
04:59:33.628 --> 04:59:33.638 align:start position:0%
purpose of proposing an Amendment to the
 
04:59:35.910 --> 04:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
United States con Constitution relative
 
04:59:38.510 --> 04:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
to elections and then the rest of the
 
04:59:42.110 --> 04:59:42.120 align:start position:0%
verbi is uh amplifies and explains that
 
04:59:45.750 --> 04:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh the there's a need for a specific as
 
04:59:48.390 --> 04:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher pointed out uh
 
04:59:49.830 --> 04:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
you don't just ask for a convention you
 
04:59:52.670 --> 04:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
need to have specific so in this case
 
04:59:54.750 --> 04:59:54.760 align:start position:0%
they made the in this measure this
 
04:59:57.390 --> 04:59:57.400 align:start position:0%
resolution they made the case uh be it
 
04:59:58.788 --> 04:59:58.798 align:start position:0%
resolved that the people of New
 
04:59:59.868 --> 04:59:59.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire speaking through its
 
05:00:02.110 --> 05:00:02.120 align:start position:0%
legislature pursuant to Article 5 hereby
 
05:00:03.548 --> 05:00:03.558 align:start position:0%
apply to the United States Congress to
 
05:00:05.310 --> 05:00:05.320 align:start position:0%
call a convention for the exclusive
 
05:00:07.590 --> 05:00:07.600 align:start position:0%
purpose of proposing an amendment to the
 
05:00:09.750 --> 05:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution that restore free and fair
 
05:00:12.430 --> 05:00:12.440 align:start position:0%
elections as described here and so
 
05:00:14.750 --> 05:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
without going through in rereading and
 
05:00:19.110 --> 05:00:19.120 align:start position:0%
and red debating uh the other the verbi
 
05:00:22.350 --> 05:00:22.360 align:start position:0%
in this uh the intent I I think to me is
 
05:00:26.110 --> 05:00:26.120 align:start position:0%
clear that to have this brought up at
 
05:00:28.910 --> 05:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
the convention the ultimate wording of
 
05:00:31.628 --> 05:00:31.638 align:start position:0%
improving our election policies would
 
05:00:33.390 --> 05:00:33.400 align:start position:0%
were this ever to get to a convention
 
05:00:34.510 --> 05:00:34.520 align:start position:0%
would would be something that would be
 
05:00:37.030 --> 05:00:37.040 align:start position:0%
rung out at the convention but the
 
05:00:39.190 --> 05:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
purpose as I understand it is is to have
 
05:00:42.750 --> 05:00:42.760 align:start position:0%
the election issue uh a specific issue
 
05:00:47.070 --> 05:00:47.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:47.080 --> 05:00:48.830 align:start position:0%
 
convention

05:00:48.830 --> 05:00:48.840 align:start position:0%
convention
 
05:00:53.310 --> 05:00:53.320 align:start position:0%
other comments uh represent Lloyd so
 
05:00:55.990 --> 05:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
didn't we also hear um some testimony
 
05:00:58.510 --> 05:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
that said something about uh potential
 
05:01:01.390 --> 05:01:01.400 align:start position:0%
to have excuse me even though that this
 
05:01:04.150 --> 05:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
is coming up as very limited bill that
 
05:01:06.070 --> 05:01:06.080 align:start position:0%
there could be some combination that
 
05:01:08.310 --> 05:01:08.320 align:start position:0%
happens when an if an article 5
 
05:01:09.990 --> 05:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
convention was
 
05:01:12.310 --> 05:01:12.320 align:start position:0%
called yes as I kind of touched on a
 
05:01:14.150 --> 05:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
little bit in responding to
 
05:01:18.510 --> 05:01:18.520 align:start position:0%
representative Lane uh the the E exact
 
05:01:21.310 --> 05:01:21.320 align:start position:0%
wording of anything that's discussed or
 
05:01:23.830 --> 05:01:23.840 align:start position:0%
voted on at such a convention if it ever
 
05:01:26.548 --> 05:01:26.558 align:start position:0%
happened would would be the product of
 
05:01:31.470 --> 05:01:31.480 align:start position:0%
the the work at the convention so uh yes
 
05:01:34.430 --> 05:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
I agree my understanding is that the the
 
05:01:37.708 --> 05:01:37.718 align:start position:0%
ultimate wording uh on any issue in this
 
05:01:38.990 --> 05:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
case an election issue would be
 
05:01:40.830 --> 05:01:40.840 align:start position:0%
something that would be rung out uh as
 
05:01:43.430 --> 05:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
part of the discussion process at the
 
05:01:45.830 --> 05:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
con at the Article 5
 
05:01:49.590 --> 05:01:49.600 align:start position:0%
convention uh rep represent M py thank
 
05:01:52.030 --> 05:01:52.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I used to serve on this
 
05:01:55.190 --> 05:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
committee for two terms way back in my
 
05:01:58.030 --> 05:01:58.040 align:start position:0%
past life but
 
05:02:01.430 --> 05:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh understanding the con um Article 5
 
05:02:03.948 --> 05:02:03.958 align:start position:0%
convention and
 
05:02:06.628 --> 05:02:06.638 align:start position:0%
where are the guard rails to make sure
 
05:02:08.350 --> 05:02:08.360 align:start position:0%
that it
 
05:02:13.350 --> 05:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
stays with within the defined con uh
 
05:02:16.190 --> 05:02:16.200 align:start position:0%
parameters of the convention and that is
 
05:02:20.070 --> 05:02:20.080 align:start position:0%
one of the fears of runaway if there are
 
05:02:25.190 --> 05:02:25.200 align:start position:0%
no specific guard rails sure uh and I
 
05:02:27.390 --> 05:02:27.400 align:start position:0%
know you were in the committee with
 
05:02:29.230 --> 05:02:29.240 align:start position:0%
regard to guard rails the folks the
 
05:02:31.590 --> 05:02:31.600 align:start position:0%
permanent so-called permanent members of
 
05:02:34.230 --> 05:02:34.240 align:start position:0%
the security Council I I mean the
 
05:02:36.510 --> 05:02:36.520 align:start position:0%
uh the permanent me members of this
 
05:02:39.030 --> 05:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
committee uh in terms of gu reels we
 
05:02:42.070 --> 05:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
received uh I want to say tons I don't
 
05:02:43.830 --> 05:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
know if that's the right word lots and
 
05:02:46.948 --> 05:02:46.958 align:start position:0%
lots and lots of testimony reassuring us
 
05:02:49.230 --> 05:02:49.240 align:start position:0%
that uh to use your term guard rails are
 
05:02:52.628 --> 05:02:52.638 align:start position:0%
in place uh I I won't go back into all
 
05:02:56.150 --> 05:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
that now it we have uh we received so
 
05:02:58.030 --> 05:02:58.040 align:start position:0%
much testimony from so many people in so
 
05:03:01.270 --> 05:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
many ways reassuring us that uh all
 
05:03:03.110 --> 05:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
manner of guard rails are place to
 
05:03:05.150 --> 05:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
prevent The Runaway convention which is
 
05:03:07.230 --> 05:03:07.240 align:start position:0%
why we ended up uh being convinced to
 
05:03:11.070 --> 05:03:11.080 align:start position:0%
support it uh uh representative philia
 
05:03:13.070 --> 05:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
and then representative gaging to to
 
05:03:14.948 --> 05:03:14.958 align:start position:0%
address that question the best answer
 
05:03:16.670 --> 05:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
that I've heard about the guard rail for
 
05:03:18.830 --> 05:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
a runaway convention is that ultimately
 
05:03:20.230 --> 05:03:20.240 align:start position:0%
whatever comes out of the convention
 
05:03:21.830 --> 05:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
still needs to be ratified by three
 
05:03:24.230 --> 05:03:24.240 align:start position:0%
quarters of states and if something is
 
05:03:26.110 --> 05:03:26.120 align:start position:0%
ratified by three quarters of states it
 
05:03:28.350 --> 05:03:28.360 align:start position:0%
probably deserves to be ratified
 
05:03:30.230 --> 05:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
anyhow thank you that's an important
 
05:03:32.510 --> 05:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
point that was in my notes to mention uh
 
05:03:34.030 --> 05:03:34.040 align:start position:0%
I think a lot of folks don't understand
 
05:03:35.350 --> 05:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
I think if there's an article 5
 
05:03:37.670 --> 05:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
convention the convention will make
 
05:03:41.390 --> 05:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
uh by the by itself would make a new uh
 
05:03:43.548 --> 05:03:43.558 align:start position:0%
Constitution uh in the reality thank you
 
05:03:46.548 --> 05:03:46.558 align:start position:0%
for pointing that out is uh any proposed
 
05:03:48.390 --> 05:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
amendments from such a convention would
 
05:03:49.830 --> 05:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
still need to be ratified by three
 
05:03:51.590 --> 05:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
quarters of the States Representative
 
05:03:54.750 --> 05:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
gagy uh and then representative Manion
 
05:03:54.760 --> 05:03:55.830 align:start position:0%
gagy uh and then representative Manion
yeah

05:03:55.830 --> 05:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:03:58.350 --> 05:03:58.360 align:start position:0%
um I'm thinking from all this testimony
 
05:04:00.350 --> 05:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
that we heard over that long length of
 
05:04:03.070 --> 05:04:03.080 align:start position:0%
time that what's going to be discussed
 
05:04:06.150 --> 05:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
at this article 5 convention has already
 
05:04:09.548 --> 05:04:09.558 align:start position:0%
been decided and anyone who goes Rogue
 
05:04:11.948 --> 05:04:11.958 align:start position:0%
and tries to change that around gets
 
05:04:15.150 --> 05:04:15.160 align:start position:0%
pulled am I correct yeah to that we uh
 
05:04:17.150 --> 05:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
passed out of the Senate there was a um
 
05:04:18.948 --> 05:04:18.958 align:start position:0%
uh delegate instruction bill that says
 
05:04:20.590 --> 05:04:20.600 align:start position:0%
basically what you just said that within
 
05:04:22.030 --> 05:04:22.040 align:start position:0%
the confines of what we sent you down
 
05:04:23.628 --> 05:04:23.638 align:start position:0%
there to do you can't do the runaway
 
05:04:26.670 --> 05:04:26.680 align:start position:0%
convention they they're not allowed to
 
05:04:29.990 --> 05:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
and this committee uh also passed an HB
 
05:04:31.750 --> 05:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
I believe the the representative from
 
05:04:33.430 --> 05:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
New Market and a representative from
 
05:04:35.628 --> 05:04:35.638 align:start position:0%
pelen were part of that so we've
 
05:04:37.868 --> 05:04:37.878 align:start position:0%
addressed that and passed that HB uh
 
05:04:40.590 --> 05:04:40.600 align:start position:0%
last year to address that concern uh
 
05:04:40.600 --> 05:04:41.708 align:start position:0%
last year to address that concern uh
other

05:04:41.708 --> 05:04:41.718 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:04:46.788 --> 05:04:46.798 align:start position:0%
hands seeing none the motion is uh OTP
 
05:04:50.510 --> 05:04:50.520 align:start position:0%

HCR 9 hcr9 is uh I don't want to say
 
05:06:14.708 --> 05:06:14.718 align:start position:0%
it's the opposite of hcr8 but when we
 
05:06:16.230 --> 05:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
had the hearing on these two measures
 
05:06:20.670 --> 05:06:20.680 align:start position:0%
back to back uh we had a a very uh
 
05:06:25.070 --> 05:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
lengthy hearing on uh both of these and
 
05:06:27.910 --> 05:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
the same uh the same folks pretty much
 
05:06:31.708 --> 05:06:31.718 align:start position:0%
the same folks who testified uh for hcr8
 
05:06:33.430 --> 05:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
at the hearing stayed around and
 
05:06:36.948 --> 05:06:36.958 align:start position:0%
testified against hcr9 at the uh
 
05:06:39.670 --> 05:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
subsequent hearing and conversely when
 
05:06:41.708 --> 05:06:41.718 align:start position:0%
we had the hearings uh the folks who
 
05:06:44.070 --> 05:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
were opposed hcr8 stuck around and and
 
05:06:47.230 --> 05:06:47.240 align:start position:0%
and supported hcr9 so they're they're
 
05:06:50.310 --> 05:06:50.320 align:start position:0%
kind of contrary measures so I'm looking
 
05:06:52.628 --> 05:06:52.638 align:start position:0%
for uh and I understand there's an
 
05:06:55.868 --> 05:06:55.878 align:start position:0%
amendment uh that we have that everyone
 
05:06:57.270 --> 05:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
should have in front of them
 
05:06:58.548 --> 05:06:58.558 align:start position:0%
representative carry would would you
 
05:07:00.628 --> 05:07:00.638 align:start position:0%
care to introduce the amendment sure
 
05:07:04.270 --> 05:07:04.280 align:start position:0%
this um is an amendment to to hcr9 it's
 
05:07:07.030 --> 05:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
been passed out uh part of the
 
05:07:10.110 --> 05:07:10.120 align:start position:0%
discussion that was had when hcr9 was
 
05:07:12.230 --> 05:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
presented was that the language was a
 
05:07:14.910 --> 05:07:14.920 align:start position:0%
little with so many whereas is a little
 
05:07:17.350 --> 05:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
um difficult to understand so this has
 
05:07:17.360 --> 05:07:18.708 align:start position:0%
um difficult to understand so this has
been

05:07:18.708 --> 05:07:18.718 align:start position:0%
been
 
05:07:23.310 --> 05:07:23.320 align:start position:0%
reconfigured to make it a little more
 
05:07:27.350 --> 05:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
targeted do you have it you don't have
 
05:07:31.470 --> 05:07:31.480 align:start position:0%
it oh dear okay well I've got a couple
 
05:07:33.190 --> 05:07:33.200 align:start position:0%
more copies
 
05:07:36.910 --> 05:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
did okay I got it you got it yes uh
 
05:07:38.948 --> 05:07:38.958 align:start position:0%
there was a copy of the amendment placed
 
05:07:42.628 --> 05:07:42.638 align:start position:0%
in front of every uh every microphone so
 
05:07:43.910 --> 05:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
there should and we have one or two
 
05:07:45.470 --> 05:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
extras but everyone should have an
 
05:07:47.628 --> 05:07:47.638 align:start position:0%
amendment uh for their review in front
 
05:07:50.190 --> 05:07:50.200 align:start position:0%
of them uh might be under some other
 
05:07:52.750 --> 05:07:52.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment or
 
05:07:55.470 --> 05:07:55.480 align:start position:0%
paper anybody else need one has
 
05:07:58.150 --> 05:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
everybody found theirs so we would need
 
05:08:02.510 --> 05:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
a second to uh the amendment and the
 
05:08:06.030 --> 05:08:06.040 align:start position:0%
amendment number for the record uh
 
05:08:06.040 --> 05:08:08.470 align:start position:0%
amendment number for the record uh
is

05:08:08.470 --> 05:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:08:10.788 --> 05:08:10.798 align:start position:0%
04338 uh amendment to
 
05:08:15.190 --> 05:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
hcr9 uh offered by representative Kerry
 
05:08:18.470 --> 05:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh do we have a second to the
 
05:08:24.868 --> 05:08:24.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:26.910 --> 05:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
motion I'll
 
05:08:30.110 --> 05:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
second okay we have a second um to the
 
05:08:31.708 --> 05:08:31.718 align:start position:0%
amending motion from representative
 
05:08:34.190 --> 05:08:34.200 align:start position:0%
lungren uh represent lungren would you
 
05:08:36.990 --> 05:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
um or representative K's already spoken
 
05:08:38.310 --> 05:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
to her Amendment do you care to speak to
 
05:08:39.868 --> 05:08:39.878 align:start position:0%
your second
 
05:08:44.030 --> 05:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
or okay uh I will uh I have a couple
 
05:08:45.310 --> 05:08:45.320 align:start position:0%
comments on
 
05:08:48.788 --> 05:08:48.798 align:start position:0%
this um having looked at the amendment
 
05:08:51.590 --> 05:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
um as is so often the case I think the
 
05:08:55.868 --> 05:08:55.878 align:start position:0%
amendment improves the uh the original
 
05:08:59.390 --> 05:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
measure uh when I was a a rookie uh
 
05:09:02.190 --> 05:09:02.200 align:start position:0%
legislator I was in one of my first exec
 
05:09:05.830 --> 05:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
SS and there was a sub actually who uh
 
05:09:08.350 --> 05:09:08.360 align:start position:0%
voted for an amendment and then she
 
05:09:10.708 --> 05:09:10.718 align:start position:0%
later voted against the amended motion
 
05:09:13.350 --> 05:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
and I being new I said why did you vote
 
05:09:15.390 --> 05:09:15.400 align:start position:0%
for the amendment and not the amended
 
05:09:16.708 --> 05:09:16.718 align:start position:0%
she said well the amendment made the
 
05:09:19.270 --> 05:09:19.280 align:start position:0%
measure better uh but not good enough
 
05:09:21.030 --> 05:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
for me to support the second time around
 
05:09:22.788 --> 05:09:22.798 align:start position:0%
so I learned something that day so what
 
05:09:26.350 --> 05:09:26.360 align:start position:0%
I'm saying here is I uh not saying how I
 
05:09:28.430 --> 05:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
would vote on the amended motion I I
 
05:09:30.470 --> 05:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
would vote for the amendment because I
 
05:09:32.430 --> 05:09:32.440 align:start position:0%
do think it improves the language of the
 
05:09:36.030 --> 05:09:36.040 align:start position:0%
mo of the measure uh that's that's me uh
 
05:09:36.040 --> 05:09:39.070 align:start position:0%
mo of the measure uh that's that's me uh
other

05:09:39.070 --> 05:09:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:42.350 --> 05:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
thoughts seeing none uh the motion on
 
05:09:44.190 --> 05:09:44.200 align:start position:0%

the there were to me and to many others
 
05:14:43.830 --> 05:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
it's unclear if you can resend some say
 
05:14:47.750 --> 05:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
you can and some say you can't uh is a
 
05:14:51.070 --> 05:14:51.080 align:start position:0%
as a concurrent example uh some of you
 
05:14:52.750 --> 05:14:52.760 align:start position:0%
might be old enough to remember the uh
 
05:14:55.430 --> 05:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
proposed Equal Rights Amendment which uh
 
05:14:59.030 --> 05:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
was proposed uh to the federal con our
 
05:15:02.030 --> 05:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
Federal Constitution in 1972 and quickly
 
05:15:06.788 --> 05:15:06.798 align:start position:0%
got 10 20 30 uh uh they needed 38 and it
 
05:15:10.310 --> 05:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
got to 35 but then uh the more time
 
05:15:12.510 --> 05:15:12.520 align:start position:0%
passed certain aspects of it were
 
05:15:17.070 --> 05:15:17.080 align:start position:0%
flagged so several States sought and and
 
05:15:20.350 --> 05:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
passed resolutions resending their uh
 
05:15:24.150 --> 05:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
ratification of the ER and that was uh
 
05:15:26.548 --> 05:15:26.558 align:start position:0%
judged to be uh something you could not
 
05:15:29.190 --> 05:15:29.200 align:start position:0%
do if a state approved the Equal Rights
 
05:15:32.030 --> 05:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment um they could not resend their
 
05:15:35.350 --> 05:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
approval so this is uh not exactly the
 
05:15:37.150 --> 05:15:37.160 align:start position:0%
same thing but the the concept that I'm
 
05:15:39.110 --> 05:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
struggling with with in terms of
 
05:15:42.310 --> 05:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
recision is or resending is uh I don't
 
05:15:43.990 --> 05:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
know that it's clear that you
 
05:15:46.788 --> 05:15:46.798 align:start position:0%
can and that's one thing and then the
 
05:15:49.030 --> 05:15:49.040 align:start position:0%
second thing for me is I personally I
 
05:15:52.070 --> 05:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
would not resend it anyway I I I support
 
05:15:55.390 --> 05:15:55.400 align:start position:0%
the uh resolution that this uh seeks to
 
05:15:58.070 --> 05:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
resend so those are my thoughts on this
 
05:16:00.510 --> 05:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
and I will be voting against
 
05:16:03.708 --> 05:16:03.718 align:start position:0%
otpa other
 
05:16:07.628 --> 05:16:07.638 align:start position:0%
thoughts representative Gallagher um so
 
05:16:10.470 --> 05:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to consider this
 
05:16:12.030 --> 05:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
together with the previous one since
 
05:16:14.868 --> 05:16:14.878 align:start position:0%
they're both on the topic of Article 5
 
05:16:17.708 --> 05:16:17.718 align:start position:0%
conventions um so I think the subject
 
05:16:20.590 --> 05:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
matter matters here since this one's
 
05:16:23.708 --> 05:16:23.718 align:start position:0%
about um a balanced budget amendment and
 
05:16:26.830 --> 05:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
the other ones about um campaign Finance
 
05:16:28.830 --> 05:16:28.840 align:start position:0%
I personally think we should only have
 
05:16:32.510 --> 05:16:32.520 align:start position:0%
one Article Five uh convention
 
05:16:35.788 --> 05:16:35.798 align:start position:0%
application open at a time and I think
 
05:16:37.430 --> 05:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
if we're going to have one it would be
 
05:16:40.070 --> 05:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
better to have it be about campaign
 
05:16:42.750 --> 05:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
Finance reform as in the previous one
 
05:16:45.070 --> 05:16:45.080 align:start position:0%
rather than the um balanced budget
 
05:16:47.510 --> 05:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
amendment like the previous one
 
05:16:50.590 --> 05:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
was okay thank you representative other
 
05:16:52.788 --> 05:16:52.798 align:start position:0%
thoughts represent Manion I prefer the
 
05:16:54.510 --> 05:16:54.520 align:start position:0%
shotgun approach and try to get as many
 
05:16:57.310 --> 05:16:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:59.430 --> 05:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
possible thank you representative uh a
 
05:17:01.470 --> 05:17:01.480 align:start position:0%
quick comment from me on that I I can
 
05:17:02.548 --> 05:17:02.558 align:start position:0%
agree with what you said if you're going
 
05:17:07.310 --> 05:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
to have a uh a convention and and deploy
 
05:17:08.868 --> 05:17:08.878 align:start position:0%
all the resources to bring people
 
05:17:11.990 --> 05:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
together if you can do um a little bit
 
05:17:14.350 --> 05:17:14.360 align:start position:0%
more business uh that makes some sense
 
05:17:17.750 --> 05:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
to me other thoughts or
 
05:17:21.628 --> 05:17:21.638 align:start position:0%
comments uh represent Lloyd so um this
 
05:17:23.510 --> 05:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
is just a quick thought and comment
 
05:17:25.590 --> 05:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
about um
 
05:17:28.430 --> 05:17:28.440 align:start position:0%
the whether we can or not I think will
 
05:17:31.030 --> 05:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
be decided after we like kind of vote on
 
05:17:35.270 --> 05:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
this um but the primary sponsor of the
 
05:17:38.270 --> 05:17:38.280 align:start position:0%
original um Amendment wanted to or the
 
05:17:40.590 --> 05:17:40.600 align:start position:0%
original resolution wanted to resend
 
05:17:44.670 --> 05:17:44.680 align:start position:0%
that and I am inclined to fall in line
 
05:17:47.430 --> 05:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
with what the primary sponsor wanted to
 
05:17:50.910 --> 05:17:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:53.270 --> 05:17:53.280 align:start position:0%

05:23:28.120 --> 05:23:29.390 align:start position:0%
by the way uh is will there be a u a
Minority

05:23:29.390 --> 05:23:29.400 align:start position:0%

okay yeah so we're good we're good we're
 
05:25:06.670 --> 05:25:06.680 align:start position:0%
good so many papers that brings us to uh
 
05:25:09.270 --> 05:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
we have two more measures hr19 uh with
 
05:25:10.750 --> 05:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
regard to the Jones act that is a
 
05:25:12.230 --> 05:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
measure that I had introduced and I'm
 
05:25:14.628 --> 05:25:14.638 align:start position:0%
going to make a motion of course uh for
 
05:25:17.070 --> 05:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
OTP on
 
05:25:20.110 --> 05:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
hr19 do I have a second
 
05:25:23.150 --> 05:25:23.160 align:start position:0%
hopefully I'll second that thank you
 
05:25:26.190 --> 05:25:26.200 align:start position:0%
representative Rollins uh so uh the
 
05:25:29.830 --> 05:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
motion uh by the chair is OTP on hr19
 
05:25:31.910 --> 05:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
seconded by the the vice chair I will
 
05:25:36.230 --> 05:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
speak to my motion uh briefly uh we had
 
05:25:38.150 --> 05:25:38.160 align:start position:0%
a pretty good hearing on I this I think
 
05:25:40.190 --> 05:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
we had a number of State refs who came
 
05:25:43.270 --> 05:25:43.280 align:start position:0%
in uh representative Maguire uh Dan
 
05:25:45.270 --> 05:25:45.280 align:start position:0%
Maguire representative MGO from mamac
 
05:25:47.948 --> 05:25:47.958 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi uh spoke at
 
05:25:50.788 --> 05:25:50.798 align:start position:0%
length and they they I thought uh
 
05:25:54.350 --> 05:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
supported my my remarks on why the Jones
 
05:25:57.190 --> 05:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
act uh we need to shine a light on it
 
05:25:59.830 --> 05:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
and we need to have people look at uh in
 
05:26:02.150 --> 05:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
in Washington at the value of repealing
 
05:26:04.830 --> 05:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
it uh that's the purpose of this house
 
05:26:06.510 --> 05:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
house resolution is to shine a light and
 
05:26:09.868 --> 05:26:09.878 align:start position:0%
I think that the testimony uh was was I
 
05:26:12.110 --> 05:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
thought was very powerful representative
 
05:26:15.548 --> 05:26:15.558 align:start position:0%
schliff uh asked a good question at the
 
05:26:17.990 --> 05:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
hearing which I hadn't thought of uh he
 
05:26:21.110 --> 05:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
had mentioned uh you know food uh you
 
05:26:23.070 --> 05:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
know the Jones act having a negative
 
05:26:26.430 --> 05:26:26.440 align:start position:0%
impact on on food to like Puerto Rico
 
05:26:28.990 --> 05:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire talked about Hawaii
 
05:26:31.230 --> 05:26:31.240 align:start position:0%
and in uh represent Senator Bernardi
 
05:26:33.830 --> 05:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
talked about you know pipelines can't we
 
05:26:37.190 --> 05:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
need fuel natural gas or oil uh can't
 
05:26:40.070 --> 05:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
get the pipelines apparently uh that we
 
05:26:42.548 --> 05:26:42.558 align:start position:0%
would like uh through New York or or
 
05:26:44.708 --> 05:26:44.718 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts or or Vermont to get to
 
05:26:47.750 --> 05:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so uh whereas
 
05:26:50.190 --> 05:26:50.200 align:start position:0%
representative Shirl mentioned food
 
05:26:53.270 --> 05:26:53.280 align:start position:0%
which I think was was a great comment I
 
05:26:54.990 --> 05:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
hadn't thought of that my focus was on
 
05:26:56.788 --> 05:26:56.798 align:start position:0%
other things particularly
 
05:27:00.350 --> 05:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
fuel uh and we gave the example and I
 
05:27:02.270 --> 05:27:02.280 align:start position:0%
know the folks there were folks who flew
 
05:27:05.548 --> 05:27:05.558 align:start position:0%
in from Detroit to uh speak for the
 
05:27:09.830 --> 05:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
Jones act um the the fuel piece of it I
 
05:27:12.510 --> 05:27:12.520 align:start position:0%
gave an example in testimony originally
 
05:27:16.030 --> 05:27:16.040 align:start position:0%
about uh oil fuel from uh Texas
 
05:27:18.628 --> 05:27:18.638 align:start position:0%
Louisiana not being able to come to New
 
05:27:20.628 --> 05:27:20.638 align:start position:0%
England because it the the boats that
 
05:27:22.628 --> 05:27:22.638 align:start position:0%
could have brought it to New England
 
05:27:24.590 --> 05:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
didn't pass the Jones act uh
 
05:27:26.830 --> 05:27:26.840 align:start position:0%
requirements of being uh American
 
05:27:30.150 --> 05:27:30.160 align:start position:0%
constructed vessels now this oil fuel
 
05:27:32.430 --> 05:27:32.440 align:start position:0%
could go go to Europe which it did and
 
05:27:34.310 --> 05:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
then there were boats in in Holland in
 
05:27:35.830 --> 05:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
that one example that could bring them
 
05:27:38.590 --> 05:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
back to New England so uh this is just
 
05:27:40.830 --> 05:27:40.840 align:start position:0%
one of many issues many of us have with
 
05:27:44.990 --> 05:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
the Jones act uh it's over a century old
 
05:27:46.628 --> 05:27:46.638 align:start position:0%
and and the purpose of this resolution
 
05:27:49.070 --> 05:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
is to recommend taking a look at it so
 
05:27:53.230 --> 05:27:53.240 align:start position:0%
that uh the F the fuel example I gave uh
 
05:27:55.430 --> 05:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
that does not make fuel less expensive
 
05:27:58.350 --> 05:27:58.360 align:start position:0%
when it has to go from Texas to Europe
 
05:28:00.548 --> 05:28:00.558 align:start position:0%
before it comes to New England so there
 
05:28:02.270 --> 05:28:02.280 align:start position:0%
are my thoughts on that those those of
 
05:28:04.070 --> 05:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
you who are regular committee members
 
05:28:06.430 --> 05:28:06.440 align:start position:0%
will recollect the uh all the testimony
 
05:28:10.430 --> 05:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
at the hearing and uh Mr Vice chair do
 
05:28:13.030 --> 05:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
you want to speak to your second uh
 
05:28:14.590 --> 05:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
that's okay Mr chair you did an
 
05:28:16.868 --> 05:28:16.878 align:start position:0%
excellent job and there's nothing I can
 
05:28:19.310 --> 05:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
add that you didn't say Thank you Mr
 
05:28:21.030 --> 05:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
Vice chair uh other representative
 
05:28:23.390 --> 05:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
Manion yeah I I wholly support repealing
 
05:28:24.948 --> 05:28:24.958 align:start position:0%
in the Jones act it's it's kind of like
 
05:28:26.708 --> 05:28:26.718 align:start position:0%
crony protectionism for a very like a
 
05:28:29.270 --> 05:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
niche market uh they they they want to
 
05:28:30.590 --> 05:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
say that we should keep the Jones act
 
05:28:31.430 --> 05:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
because it allows us to keep
 
05:28:32.750 --> 05:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturing ships and all that but the
 
05:28:34.430 --> 05:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturing is already decreasing one
 
05:28:36.110 --> 05:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
of the funny things that M uh
 
05:28:37.708 --> 05:28:37.718 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire mentioned is like
 
05:28:40.110 --> 05:28:40.120 align:start position:0%
we can't even have like a a cruise ship
 
05:28:41.788 --> 05:28:41.798 align:start position:0%
that travels down the east coast of the
 
05:28:43.230 --> 05:28:43.240 align:start position:0%
United States hitting ports because of
 
05:28:44.990 --> 05:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
the Jones act you have to hit a foreign
 
05:28:49.628 --> 05:28:49.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:52.350 --> 05:28:52.360 align:start position:0%
ridiculous thank you representative
 
05:28:55.628 --> 05:28:55.638 align:start position:0%
other representative Philly up thank you
 
05:28:57.150 --> 05:28:57.160 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and of course I do respect
 
05:28:59.910 --> 05:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
those who uh support this provision
 
05:29:03.230 --> 05:29:03.240 align:start position:0%
however I cannot and as pointed out uh
 
05:29:05.830 --> 05:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
at the previous hearing Commerce heard
 
05:29:07.628 --> 05:29:07.638 align:start position:0%
this last year because there is no new
 
05:29:12.110 --> 05:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
idea Under the Sun and as we heard it as
 
05:29:13.430 --> 05:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
was pointed out in the hearing we heard
 
05:29:16.070 --> 05:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
a testimony just related to the uh fuel
 
05:29:17.990 --> 05:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
industry environmental Pro Provisions
 
05:29:20.470 --> 05:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
related to it but as you begin to
 
05:29:22.948 --> 05:29:22.958 align:start position:0%
unravel it everything is related as you
 
05:29:24.548 --> 05:29:24.558 align:start position:0%
look at the environmental Provisions you
 
05:29:26.150 --> 05:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
start to look at jobs and as you start
 
05:29:27.548 --> 05:29:27.558 align:start position:0%
to look at jobs you look at matters
 
05:29:30.708 --> 05:29:30.718 align:start position:0%
related to National Security calling for
 
05:29:34.230 --> 05:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
a repeal starts to involve us as a state
 
05:29:36.350 --> 05:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
in matters that are well beyond State
 
05:29:39.110 --> 05:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
expertise for example National Security
 
05:29:42.590 --> 05:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
concerns there's a lot to do with this
 
05:29:46.390 --> 05:29:46.400 align:start position:0%
act that we can't necessarily opine on
 
05:29:48.750 --> 05:29:48.760 align:start position:0%
not passing this resolution doesn't stop
 
05:29:50.310 --> 05:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
any individual from sending a very
 
05:29:52.510 --> 05:29:52.520 align:start position:0%
firmly worded letter to our delegation
 
05:29:52.520 --> 05:29:53.350 align:start position:0%
firmly worded letter to our delegation
in

05:29:53.350 --> 05:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:29:55.390 --> 05:29:55.400 align:start position:0%
Washington but as a matter first of all
 
05:29:57.708 --> 05:29:57.718 align:start position:0%
of state power we probably don't want to
 
05:29:59.868 --> 05:29:59.878 align:start position:0%
get involved in something that is this
 
05:30:02.030 --> 05:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
complex and in fact that was the opinion
 
05:30:04.470 --> 05:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
that ultimately came back to the
 
05:30:06.910 --> 05:30:06.920 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee was that the uh
 
05:30:08.628 --> 05:30:08.638 align:start position:0%
report that would be required to even
 
05:30:11.510 --> 05:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
opine on this would be so complex and so
 
05:30:14.310 --> 05:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
costly for the state we don't want to go
 
05:30:17.548 --> 05:30:17.558 align:start position:0%
there because it is a complex act beyond
 
05:30:19.190 --> 05:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
that even if I were to be voting on this
 
05:30:20.670 --> 05:30:20.680 align:start position:0%
today because magically I end up in
 
05:30:23.350 --> 05:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
Congress God forbid then I still would
 
05:30:25.548 --> 05:30:25.558 align:start position:0%
vote for it because I do believe that it
 
05:30:28.310 --> 05:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
protects American jobs we can find data
 
05:30:31.510 --> 05:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
on both sides of the fence it does lower
 
05:30:33.948 --> 05:30:33.958 align:start position:0%
energy cost or at least keep energy J
 
05:30:36.230 --> 05:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
the same because we can find data on
 
05:30:38.350 --> 05:30:38.360 align:start position:0%
both sides of the fence sometimes when
 
05:30:40.430 --> 05:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
you look at an ink blot you begin to see
 
05:30:42.270 --> 05:30:42.280 align:start position:0%
what it is that you want to
 
05:30:44.868 --> 05:30:44.878 align:start position:0%
see thank you represent filia let me ask
 
05:30:47.708 --> 05:30:47.718 align:start position:0%
you um so when you in Commerce and you
 
05:30:49.910 --> 05:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
heard A Jones act type measure that was
 
05:30:52.110 --> 05:30:52.120 align:start position:0%
not a resolution that was a a Senate
 
05:30:54.628 --> 05:30:54.638 align:start position:0%
bill was it not it was a Senate bill
 
05:30:56.628 --> 05:30:56.638 align:start position:0%
that was looking to do a study committee
 
05:30:59.430 --> 05:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
related to the energy cost Provisions
 
05:31:01.548 --> 05:31:01.558 align:start position:0%
related to the to study of the energy
 
05:31:04.470 --> 05:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
cost effects of the Jones
 
05:31:07.270 --> 05:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
act thank you representative uh the fact
 
05:31:09.350 --> 05:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
that it passed the Senate do does that
 
05:31:11.788 --> 05:31:11.798 align:start position:0%
carry any weight with you
 
05:31:14.390 --> 05:31:14.400 align:start position:0%
um uh not much of what the Senate does
 
05:31:16.910 --> 05:31:16.920 align:start position:0%
really carries that much weight with me
 
05:31:20.590 --> 05:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
however uh because of the the fact that
 
05:31:23.190 --> 05:31:23.200 align:start position:0%
it was calling for a study committee
 
05:31:26.670 --> 05:31:26.680 align:start position:0%
related to just the energy Provisions I
 
05:31:30.670 --> 05:31:30.680 align:start position:0%
mean what was very narrow and that
 
05:31:33.510 --> 05:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
was telling because ultimately when you
 
05:31:36.270 --> 05:31:36.280 align:start position:0%
start to hone in that narrowly is The
 
05:31:38.190 --> 05:31:38.200 align:start position:0%
Telltale to me that something else
 
05:31:40.190 --> 05:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
broader is going on and as soon as you
 
05:31:42.628 --> 05:31:42.638 align:start position:0%
go to that broader view suddenly
 
05:31:43.948 --> 05:31:43.958 align:start position:0%
everything unrattled
 
05:31:47.030 --> 05:31:47.040 align:start position:0%
sure thank you and I again I would point
 
05:31:48.750 --> 05:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
out which I kind of think I just did
 
05:31:50.910 --> 05:31:50.920 align:start position:0%
that the the Senate measure was a bill
 
05:31:52.990 --> 05:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
on a study committee and this is is to
 
05:31:55.990 --> 05:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
be clear is is a resolution uh which
 
05:31:57.910 --> 05:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
does call for Congress to take a look
 
05:32:02.830 --> 05:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
and rethink the Jones act uh other
 
05:32:05.628 --> 05:32:05.638 align:start position:0%
comments representative Carrie uh I
 
05:32:07.830 --> 05:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
would just say as this relates to New
 
05:32:10.830 --> 05:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 12200 New Hampshire jobs we're
 
05:32:12.910 --> 05:32:12.920 align:start position:0%
talking about we're talking about
 
05:32:16.510 --> 05:32:16.520 align:start position:0%
americanmade ships americanmade jobs
 
05:32:19.430 --> 05:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a teeny tiny Harbor
 
05:32:21.910 --> 05:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
in Port in Portsmith which could not
 
05:32:26.150 --> 05:32:26.160 align:start position:0%
accommodate the enormous um cargo ships
 
05:32:28.910 --> 05:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
that are foreign made so you know kind
 
05:32:31.708 --> 05:32:31.718 align:start position:0%
of we're we're using our own ports with
 
05:32:35.590 --> 05:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
our own people right now um and uh we
 
05:32:39.110 --> 05:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
did have some response um from the
 
05:32:41.910 --> 05:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
individual when you talked about stuff
 
05:32:43.868 --> 05:32:43.878 align:start position:0%
having to go from Louisiana to Holland
 
05:32:46.110 --> 05:32:46.120 align:start position:0%
and then back and he said he was unaware
 
05:32:48.190 --> 05:32:48.200 align:start position:0%
of that and he would check back on that
 
05:32:49.910 --> 05:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
and he said a lot of it has to do with
 
05:32:51.628 --> 05:32:51.638 align:start position:0%
the cargo they're carrying and the size
 
05:32:54.070 --> 05:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
of the ship and that that size ship
 
05:32:58.110 --> 05:32:58.120 align:start position:0%
could not fit into Portsmouth Harbor and
 
05:33:02.110 --> 05:33:02.120 align:start position:0%
where we are now so um to me it goes
 
05:33:04.548 --> 05:33:04.558 align:start position:0%
back to the whole concept of buy local
 
05:33:08.470 --> 05:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
shop local I I'd rather protect our New
 
05:33:10.430 --> 05:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire jobs and they're great paying
 
05:33:12.310 --> 05:33:12.320 align:start position:0%
jobs and I know there are 1,200
 
05:33:14.390 --> 05:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
individuals in the state that benefit
 
05:33:17.110 --> 05:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:18.910 --> 05:33:18.920 align:start position:0%
so thank you
 
05:33:21.430 --> 05:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
representative other representative
 
05:33:24.510 --> 05:33:24.520 align:start position:0%
filot i i i Echo those thoughts that
 
05:33:27.070 --> 05:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
ultimately our job here is as New
 
05:33:29.548 --> 05:33:29.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representatives and we have a
 
05:33:32.548 --> 05:33:32.558 align:start position:0%
job to protect New Hampshire jobs we did
 
05:33:34.868 --> 05:33:34.878 align:start position:0%
hear testimony that it may increase
 
05:33:38.070 --> 05:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
energy costs by less than 1 cent is the
 
05:33:40.190 --> 05:33:40.200 align:start position:0%
value of protecting about 1,00 New
 
05:33:44.110 --> 05:33:44.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Jobs worth about 1 cent yes
 
05:33:46.788 --> 05:33:46.798 align:start position:0%
absolutely we it also likely in
 
05:33:49.430 --> 05:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
increases or uh protects National
 
05:33:52.150 --> 05:33:52.160 align:start position:0%
Security what is the value of National
 
05:33:55.470 --> 05:33:55.480 align:start position:0%
Security it's intangible but does it
 
05:33:58.230 --> 05:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
protect New Hampshire yes and our job is
 
05:34:01.350 --> 05:34:01.360 align:start position:0%
as New Hampshire state representatives
 
05:34:04.788 --> 05:34:04.798 align:start position:0%
to uh uh myself and interrupts man s
 
05:34:05.910 --> 05:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
brought up National Security another
 
05:34:07.350 --> 05:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
piece of this though has to do with ship
 
05:34:09.230 --> 05:34:09.240 align:start position:0%
building and our ship building industry
 
05:34:12.750 --> 05:34:12.760 align:start position:0%
is gone uh South so to speak uh we don't
 
05:34:14.430 --> 05:34:14.440 align:start position:0%
build ships anymore why don't we build
 
05:34:15.830 --> 05:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
ships we talked about this at the
 
05:34:17.830 --> 05:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
hearing uh the Jones act the
 
05:34:19.788 --> 05:34:19.798 align:start position:0%
protectionism of the Jones act uh
 
05:34:21.628 --> 05:34:21.638 align:start position:0%
doesn't have competition we talked about
 
05:34:24.190 --> 05:34:24.200 align:start position:0%
or I talked about why the Auto industry
 
05:34:26.948 --> 05:34:26.958 align:start position:0%
which does have foreign competition is
 
05:34:28.548 --> 05:34:28.558 align:start position:0%
relatively thriving they're better
 
05:34:31.230 --> 05:34:31.240 align:start position:0%
because of competition the Jones act uh
 
05:34:32.990 --> 05:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
hurts our ship building is to it's also
 
05:34:34.788 --> 05:34:34.798 align:start position:0%
hurts uh you know the infrastructure
 
05:34:36.548 --> 05:34:36.558 align:start position:0%
that builds ships whether it's at Bath
 
05:34:40.788 --> 05:34:40.798 align:start position:0%
Iron Works or pick a shipyard uh our
 
05:34:44.430 --> 05:34:44.440 align:start position:0%
Navy it it's way more expensive than it
 
05:34:47.190 --> 05:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
should be to build a naval vessel why
 
05:34:48.868 --> 05:34:48.878 align:start position:0%
because of the Jones act so the Jones
 
05:34:50.910 --> 05:34:50.920 align:start position:0%
act I think threatens National Security
 
05:34:52.430 --> 05:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
and that it makes it expensive and
 
05:34:55.110 --> 05:34:55.120 align:start position:0%
harder to build Naval vessels that's a
 
05:34:58.230 --> 05:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
comment to the to the National Security
 
05:35:01.788 --> 05:35:01.798 align:start position:0%
piece uh represent Manion that one scent
 
05:35:04.230 --> 05:35:04.240 align:start position:0%
was specifically for gasoline they even
 
05:35:05.628 --> 05:35:05.638 align:start position:0%
when we asked the individuals that came
 
05:35:07.948 --> 05:35:07.958 align:start position:0%
here they seem to not understand or they
 
05:35:09.070 --> 05:35:09.080 align:start position:0%
didn't I don't know if they were
 
05:35:10.948 --> 05:35:10.958 align:start position:0%
intentionally dodging but the natural
 
05:35:12.708 --> 05:35:12.718 align:start position:0%
gas question was a big one where most of
 
05:35:14.708 --> 05:35:14.718 align:start position:0%
our power is coming from National Gas
 
05:35:16.708 --> 05:35:16.718 align:start position:0%
and that's where that pipeline from
 
05:35:18.548 --> 05:35:18.558 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the Appalachia up here
 
05:35:19.948 --> 05:35:19.958 align:start position:0%
would be beneficial that we can't get
 
05:35:21.430 --> 05:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
through New York and
 
05:35:23.470 --> 05:35:23.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that's so the one scent
 
05:35:25.030 --> 05:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
was specifically about gasoline they
 
05:35:27.030 --> 05:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
couldn't really give us a data on the uh
 
05:35:28.708 --> 05:35:28.718 align:start position:0%
natural gas which is obviously more
 
05:35:30.150 --> 05:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
expensive we can't get through a
 
05:35:32.628 --> 05:35:32.638 align:start position:0%
pipeline well and that that they sent an
 
05:35:34.948 --> 05:35:34.958 align:start position:0%
email um thank you representative man
 
05:35:36.948 --> 05:35:36.958 align:start position:0%
representative Carrie go ahead they um
 
05:35:40.070 --> 05:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
sent an email a response that I guess
 
05:35:42.948 --> 05:35:42.958 align:start position:0%
our gas comes in a liquefied form and
 
05:35:46.030 --> 05:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
the size of the ships that would come
 
05:35:49.070 --> 05:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
here with that it's way larger than what
 
05:35:50.350 --> 05:35:50.360 align:start position:0%
would fit in our Harbor and we don't
 
05:35:51.990 --> 05:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
have the facilities to store that
 
05:35:53.590 --> 05:35:53.600 align:start position:0%
liquefied gas the one thing I would say
 
05:35:54.628 --> 05:35:54.638 align:start position:0%
is like that could potentially be a
 
05:35:56.270 --> 05:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
chicken and egg thing like why build the
 
05:35:57.510 --> 05:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
facilities if they can't get the big
 
05:35:59.910 --> 05:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
ships in in the first place so like if
 
05:36:01.548 --> 05:36:01.558 align:start position:0%
the Jones Act is preventing like
 
05:36:03.110 --> 05:36:03.120 align:start position:0%
infrastructure expansion for something
 
05:36:04.948 --> 05:36:04.958 align:start position:0%
like that it could be a chicken and egg
 
05:36:07.030 --> 05:36:07.040 align:start position:0%
thing in my
 
05:36:11.030 --> 05:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
opinion represent Lloyd so I understand
 
05:36:13.030 --> 05:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
the concerns around building ships and
 
05:36:14.788 --> 05:36:14.798 align:start position:0%
and that piece of our national security
 
05:36:17.430 --> 05:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
and I can get behind you on that um but
 
05:36:20.070 --> 05:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
my question I I guess my biggest concern
 
05:36:22.910 --> 05:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
here is the testimony that was emailed
 
05:36:26.230 --> 05:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
to us at one point about this that um
 
05:36:29.150 --> 05:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
these ships also Supply our ships that
 
05:36:33.230 --> 05:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
are at see with our troops um and the
 
05:36:35.590 --> 05:36:35.600 align:start position:0%
chances of a foreign ship being able to
 
05:36:38.070 --> 05:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
go and approach our our ships that are
 
05:36:42.070 --> 05:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
at Sea um are a huge concern to me and I
 
05:36:44.548 --> 05:36:44.558 align:start position:0%
would support you know looking into the
 
05:36:46.750 --> 05:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
ship building aspect if it was somehow
 
05:36:50.270 --> 05:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
separated from the security piece of our
 
05:36:52.548 --> 05:36:52.558 align:start position:0%
ships that are currently at
 
05:36:55.350 --> 05:36:55.360 align:start position:0%
Sea sure thank you for that the Marine
 
05:36:57.390 --> 05:36:57.400 align:start position:0%
Corps actually has a maritime
 
05:37:00.230 --> 05:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
pre-positioned uh prepositioning
 
05:37:02.788 --> 05:37:02.798 align:start position:0%
uh plan where they have pre-staged ships
 
05:37:06.270 --> 05:37:06.280 align:start position:0%
and supplies around the world and uh our
 
05:37:08.628 --> 05:37:08.638 align:start position:0%
own Naval vessels which are built in in
 
05:37:12.830 --> 05:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
America do c already uh you know we
 
05:37:15.670 --> 05:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
don't Farm out or delegate out much in
 
05:37:18.830 --> 05:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
the way of uh moving military uh
 
05:37:22.910 --> 05:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
transport uh to uh civilian carriers so
 
05:37:26.230 --> 05:37:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh to your point uh anything that's
 
05:37:28.948 --> 05:37:28.958 align:start position:0%
ammunition or or important supplies
 
05:37:31.190 --> 05:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
would uh inherently be delivered by the
 
05:37:34.910 --> 05:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
Navy uh there may be some situations
 
05:37:39.310 --> 05:37:39.320 align:start position:0%
where where nonmilitary typee of uh
 
05:37:41.350 --> 05:37:41.360 align:start position:0%
supplies that would go to Diego Garcia
 
05:37:44.910 --> 05:37:44.920 align:start position:0%
for example might need to uh Jones Z
 
05:37:48.470 --> 05:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
might uh impact that I but I I think
 
05:37:51.390 --> 05:37:51.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's fairly minimal uh so to to
 
05:37:53.110 --> 05:37:53.120 align:start position:0%
your point which which is a reasonable
 
05:37:56.150 --> 05:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
Point uh my response would be that uh
 
05:38:00.030 --> 05:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
our existing Navy would get the this
 
05:38:01.628 --> 05:38:01.638 align:start position:0%
ammunition and the secret stuff where it
 
05:38:04.310 --> 05:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
needs to go um and I don't think it
 
05:38:07.110 --> 05:38:07.120 align:start position:0%
would the Jones act would would have
 
05:38:09.948 --> 05:38:09.958 align:start position:0%
much impact on um you know doing
 
05:38:11.708 --> 05:38:11.718 align:start position:0%
anything different from
 
05:38:13.830 --> 05:38:13.840 align:start position:0%
that um
 
05:38:15.788 --> 05:38:15.798 align:start position:0%
other other
 
05:38:19.030 --> 05:38:19.040 align:start position:0%

have a the motion was OTP which did not
 
05:41:17.190 --> 05:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
pass we need an itl motion uh which I I
 
05:41:18.548 --> 05:41:18.558 align:start position:0%
think I know was going to come out but
 
05:41:21.070 --> 05:41:21.080 align:start position:0%
we need to um have somebody make a
 
05:41:23.430 --> 05:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
motion to itl represent filot has a
 
05:41:27.110 --> 05:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
motion to itl and do we have a second uh
 
05:41:30.788 --> 05:41:30.798 align:start position:0%
move itl on hr19 not seeing any second
 
05:41:33.510 --> 05:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
well do we have a second uh uh repres M
 
05:41:36.150 --> 05:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
millisecond at okay so the motion is uh
 
05:41:38.150 --> 05:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
Madam clerk when you're ready the motion
 
05:41:46.670 --> 05:41:46.680 align:start position:0%

voting for The itl because I think our
 
05:42:29.868 --> 05:42:29.878 align:start position:0%
number one priority should be to the
 
05:42:32.270 --> 05:42:32.280 align:start position:0%

procedural question so um I mean I know

we're on itl now but I'm wondering if
 
05:43:01.868 --> 05:43:01.878 align:start position:0%
there might be room for of um for if
 
05:43:05.430 --> 05:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
like we could have done interim study
 
05:43:07.390 --> 05:43:07.400 align:start position:0%
instead uh that would have been an
 
05:43:10.270 --> 05:43:10.280 align:start position:0%
option um of course anybody can make
 
05:43:11.830 --> 05:43:11.840 align:start position:0%
that motion we have a motion on the
 
05:43:14.230 --> 05:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
floor now of itl that we're about to
 
05:43:14.240 --> 05:43:16.670 align:start position:0%

representative filot will do the other
 
05:44:31.390 --> 05:44:31.400 align:start position:0%
report so uh there we go all right we
 
05:44:34.190 --> 05:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
have one more uh one more measure uh and
 
05:44:38.230 --> 05:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
that's hcr1 hcr1 is a resolution a house
 
05:44:41.270 --> 05:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution hcr1 uh condemning
 
05:44:43.510 --> 05:44:43.520 align:start position:0%
medically unnecessary restrictions on
 
05:44:46.750 --> 05:44:46.760 align:start position:0%
medication abortion so we're looking for
 
05:44:49.150 --> 05:44:49.160 align:start position:0%
a motion I did like to make a motion of
 
05:44:51.350 --> 05:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
ought to pass representative Sebert
 
05:44:55.030 --> 05:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
moves OTP ought to pass on acr11 and do
 
05:44:58.350 --> 05:44:58.360 align:start position:0%
we have a second I'll second it
 
05:45:00.430 --> 05:45:00.440 align:start position:0%
representative milliseconds uh
 
05:45:02.310 --> 05:45:02.320 align:start position:0%
representative Sebert uh would you care
 
05:45:05.150 --> 05:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
to speak to your motion yeah um just
 
05:45:07.150 --> 05:45:07.160 align:start position:0%
real quick I just uh think this is
 
05:45:09.390 --> 05:45:09.400 align:start position:0%
really important um especially because
 
05:45:12.430 --> 05:45:12.440 align:start position:0%
it sends a message to Providers across
 
05:45:15.030 --> 05:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
the state that they that they matter
 
05:45:17.468 --> 05:45:17.478 align:start position:0%
that their word matters and their
 
05:45:19.788 --> 05:45:19.798 align:start position:0%
opinion matters when it comes to what we
 
05:45:19.798 --> 05:45:20.868 align:start position:0%
opinion matters when it comes to what we
are

05:45:20.868 --> 05:45:20.878 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:45:23.948 --> 05:45:23.958 align:start position:0%
legislating and um I think that's who we
 
05:45:26.548 --> 05:45:26.558 align:start position:0%
need to listen to um if Mass Miller has
 
05:45:28.830 --> 05:45:28.840 align:start position:0%
anything I concur I think the Prov
 
05:45:31.628 --> 05:45:31.638 align:start position:0%
providers need to have a say as well
 
05:45:31.638 --> 05:45:33.510 align:start position:0%
providers need to have a say as well
thank

05:45:33.510 --> 05:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
thank
 
05:45:37.390 --> 05:45:37.400 align:start position:0%
you okay I have a couple comments uh and
 
05:45:39.990 --> 05:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
then uh anyone else of course will spend
 
05:45:42.670 --> 05:45:42.680 align:start position:0%
as much time as uh as we as anyone wants
 
05:45:45.910 --> 05:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
to speak to it all I want to say as I
 
05:45:50.150 --> 05:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
look at this resolution um uh I honestly
 
05:45:53.190 --> 05:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
I am I'm sympathetic to uh certain types
 
05:45:55.990 --> 05:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
of uh medicines the uh notion of an
 
05:46:00.030 --> 05:46:00.040 align:start position:0%
ectopic pregnancy which uh uh all agree
 
05:46:03.670 --> 05:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
needs would need to be um terminated uh
 
05:46:05.030 --> 05:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
you know even the the church the
 
05:46:06.590 --> 05:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
pro-life people they don't even consider
 
05:46:09.548 --> 05:46:09.558 align:start position:0%
that to be an abortion to terminate an
 
05:46:09.558 --> 05:46:11.110 align:start position:0%
that to be an abortion to terminate an
un

05:46:11.110 --> 05:46:11.120 align:start position:0%
un
 
05:46:16.548 --> 05:46:16.558 align:start position:0%
un unviable ectopic pregnancy so uh to
 
05:46:18.670 --> 05:46:18.680 align:start position:0%
have uh medicine available for that I'm
 
05:46:21.430 --> 05:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
very sympathetic to uh if that was the
 
05:46:25.310 --> 05:46:25.320 align:start position:0%
narrower Focus I think that um that's
 
05:46:26.708 --> 05:46:26.718 align:start position:0%
something I could certainly try to
 
05:46:29.830 --> 05:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
support if that was the sole Focus uh uh
 
05:46:31.230 --> 05:46:31.240 align:start position:0%
this is something that's very difficult
 
05:46:34.030 --> 05:46:34.040 align:start position:0%
for me or folks like myself to uh
 
05:46:36.430 --> 05:46:36.440 align:start position:0%
support uh if you look at the We ases
 
05:46:40.628 --> 05:46:40.638 align:start position:0%
There are are many we asses that uh uh
 
05:46:40.638 --> 05:46:41.670 align:start position:0%
There are are many we asses that uh uh
some

05:46:41.670 --> 05:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
some
 
05:46:46.990 --> 05:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
are hard to for folks on one side to um
 
05:46:51.430 --> 05:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
to endorse um so for that reason and
 
05:46:53.230 --> 05:46:53.240 align:start position:0%
there are so many pieces to this and I
 
05:46:56.150 --> 05:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
don't know that we need to get into uh
 
05:46:59.190 --> 05:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
we can if anybody wants to uh all the
 
05:47:03.110 --> 05:47:03.120 align:start position:0%
different Arguments for against um uh
 
05:47:05.948 --> 05:47:05.958 align:start position:0%
abortion RIT large the the the
 
05:47:08.830 --> 05:47:08.840 align:start position:0%
major issues with with so many offshoots
 
05:47:11.150 --> 05:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
to that so because of all the whereases
 
05:47:13.830 --> 05:47:13.840 align:start position:0%
because it is so much there that pieces
 
05:47:16.430 --> 05:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
of it some of us cannot support I I
 
05:47:20.750 --> 05:47:20.760 align:start position:0%
cannot vote for for this uh ACR or a
 
05:47:24.708 --> 05:47:24.718 align:start position:0%
yeah acr1 other comments representative
 
05:47:27.350 --> 05:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
Lloyd um I just wanted to speak to the
 
05:47:29.948 --> 05:47:29.958 align:start position:0%
way that the um the resolution was
 
05:47:32.390 --> 05:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
written I believe that the wording is in
 
05:47:34.788 --> 05:47:34.798 align:start position:0%
here because our providers are needing
 
05:47:38.030 --> 05:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
it to be as written um in order to have
 
05:47:40.548 --> 05:47:40.558 align:start position:0%
things um processed through correctly
 
05:47:42.750 --> 05:47:42.760 align:start position:0%
and um be heard
 
05:47:46.110 --> 05:47:46.120 align:start position:0%
correctly so thank you representative
 
05:47:49.868 --> 05:47:49.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:52.590 --> 05:47:52.600 align:start position:0%
levit I need to make everybody on the
 
05:47:56.548 --> 05:47:56.558 align:start position:0%
committee aware that this is an ongoing
 
05:48:01.350 --> 05:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
litigation in the Supreme court and that
 
05:48:06.190 --> 05:48:06.200 align:start position:0%
any action by this committee would may
 
05:48:11.350 --> 05:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
end up to be of no value to be
 
05:48:14.230 --> 05:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
mute thank you representative other
 
05:48:16.910 --> 05:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
thoughts comments representative Philly
 
05:48:20.390 --> 05:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
up uh without going to the discussion
 
05:48:23.390 --> 05:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
about uh the points about abortion since
 
05:48:25.430 --> 05:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
much of what has been said has been said
 
05:48:28.910 --> 05:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
before will be said again uh in probably
 
05:48:30.750 --> 05:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
will be said again when this goes to the
 
05:48:33.230 --> 05:48:33.240 align:start position:0%
floor this is a case that's before The
 
05:48:35.590 --> 05:48:35.600 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court which is the value of the
 
05:48:37.868 --> 05:48:37.878 align:start position:0%
HCR first of course as an HDR this
 
05:48:40.190 --> 05:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't bind the body to anything it's
 
05:48:43.390 --> 05:48:43.400 align:start position:0%
an expression of where we stand on this
 
05:48:45.670 --> 05:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
issue the case that is before The
 
05:48:49.190 --> 05:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court should horrify any
 
05:48:53.270 --> 05:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
rational individual it seeks to upend 20
 
05:48:56.430 --> 05:48:56.440 align:start position:0%
years of established administrative law
 
05:48:59.788 --> 05:48:59.798 align:start position:0%
by undoing administrative fact finding
 
05:49:00.628 --> 05:49:00.638 align:start position:0%
by the
 
05:49:05.070 --> 05:49:05.080 align:start position:0%
FDA this has never happened before where
 
05:49:08.510 --> 05:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
the a federal district court has gone
 
05:49:13.070 --> 05:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
back and undone agency fact finding 20
 
05:49:15.868 --> 05:49:15.878 align:start position:0%
years after the fact were the Supreme
 
05:49:19.910 --> 05:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
Court to uphold this this would undo
 
05:49:22.430 --> 05:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
what we know of administrative law in
 
05:49:26.350 --> 05:49:26.360 align:start position:0%
the United States let's set aside the
 
05:49:30.110 --> 05:49:30.120 align:start position:0%
Live Wire issue here were this to happen
 
05:49:32.868 --> 05:49:32.878 align:start position:0%
what we think we know is the law in the
 
05:49:35.070 --> 05:49:35.080 align:start position:0%
United States what we think is settled
 
05:49:39.110 --> 05:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
law is undone we don't know what the
 
05:49:41.910 --> 05:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
landscape of this country looks like we
 
05:49:43.830 --> 05:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
don't know what the legal landscape of
 
05:49:46.310 --> 05:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
this country looks like if this case
 
05:49:49.670 --> 05:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
goes through and that should horrify
 
05:49:52.310 --> 05:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
rational thinking people because judges
 
05:49:56.190 --> 05:49:56.200 align:start position:0%
can go back and undo agency fact finding
 
05:49:58.510 --> 05:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
and most of the law in this country is
 
05:50:00.390 --> 05:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
is done by those agencies those
 
05:50:03.070 --> 05:50:03.080 align:start position:0%
three-letter organizations so regardless
 
05:50:04.670 --> 05:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
of where you stand on this issue and I
 
05:50:07.150 --> 05:50:07.160 align:start position:0%
would hope that you support individuals
 
05:50:09.110 --> 05:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
right to choose but of course we're not
 
05:50:11.628 --> 05:50:11.638 align:start position:0%
going to go there but I would hope that
 
05:50:14.548 --> 05:50:14.558 align:start position:0%
you would at least support this case
 
05:50:16.910 --> 05:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
because what the law looks like if this
 
05:50:18.788 --> 05:50:18.798 align:start position:0%
case were to not go that way in the
 
05:50:21.868 --> 05:50:21.878 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court is
 
05:50:24.110 --> 05:50:24.120 align:start position:0%
Unthinkable thank you
 
05:50:27.628 --> 05:50:27.638 align:start position:0%
representative uh representative uh
 
05:50:29.830 --> 05:50:29.840 align:start position:0%
Gallagher and then representative
 
05:50:32.708 --> 05:50:32.718 align:start position:0%
levit uh so qu question for
 
05:50:36.030 --> 05:50:36.040 align:start position:0%
representative f um if I may um so when
 
05:50:39.190 --> 05:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
you talk about um undoing administrative
 
05:50:41.708 --> 05:50:41.718 align:start position:0%
loss does that mean that this case the
 
05:50:44.468 --> 05:50:44.478 align:start position:0%
case in question here is the one that
 
05:50:46.590 --> 05:50:46.600 align:start position:0%
could potentially overturn the Chevron
 
05:50:46.600 --> 05:50:47.750 align:start position:0%
could potentially overturn the Chevron
Doctrine

05:50:47.750 --> 05:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
Doctrine
 
05:50:49.830 --> 05:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
then or is that a different one yeah
 
05:50:51.030 --> 05:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
that's a different one this one would
 
05:50:54.230 --> 05:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
say ask whether or not an agency finding
 
05:50:58.948 --> 05:50:58.958 align:start position:0%
a fact could be undone by by a court TP
 
05:51:00.708 --> 05:51:00.718 align:start position:0%
what has happened to this point is that
 
05:51:04.270 --> 05:51:04.280 align:start position:0%
a when an agency does fact finding we
 
05:51:06.110 --> 05:51:06.120 align:start position:0%
tend to We Trust the agency to do the
 
05:51:08.070 --> 05:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
fact finding because they're the experts
 
05:51:10.628 --> 05:51:10.638 align:start position:0%
in what they do whatever it is whatever
 
05:51:12.590 --> 05:51:12.600 align:start position:0%
field it is the FDA we trust that the
 
05:51:14.468 --> 05:51:14.478 align:start position:0%
FDA knows what they're doing in
 
05:51:17.110 --> 05:51:17.120 align:start position:0%
Pharmaceuticals and that a judge who is
 
05:51:19.310 --> 05:51:19.320 align:start position:0%
sitting on a bench doesn't know as much
 
05:51:21.030 --> 05:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
about pharmaceuticals as do the people
 
05:51:23.350 --> 05:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
who deal with Pharmaceuticals every day
 
05:51:25.548 --> 05:51:25.558 align:start position:0%
if this happens then what we are saying
 
05:51:27.750 --> 05:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
is that a judge sitting on a bench now
 
05:51:29.708 --> 05:51:29.718 align:start position:0%
can overturn turn the findings of fact
 
05:51:31.788 --> 05:51:31.798 align:start position:0%
of the people who deal with those facts
 
05:51:34.948 --> 05:51:34.958 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis whether or not you like
 
05:51:38.190 --> 05:51:38.200 align:start position:0%
that what we deal with a settled fact
 
05:51:40.230 --> 05:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
every day in our world the law we deal
 
05:51:42.190 --> 05:51:42.200 align:start position:0%
with every day in our world is based on
 
05:51:43.628 --> 05:51:43.638 align:start position:0%
the fact that we trust the people and
 
05:51:46.110 --> 05:51:46.120 align:start position:0%
the agencies who know the facts to keep
 
05:51:48.030 --> 05:51:48.040 align:start position:0%
those facts it would be a Brave New
 
05:51:49.430 --> 05:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
World that we would head into if judges
 
05:51:51.190 --> 05:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
can UND do those agency fact findings
 
05:51:53.070 --> 05:51:53.080 align:start position:0%
what we have here is the an agency the
 
05:51:55.590 --> 05:51:55.600 align:start position:0%
FDA 20 years ago found this drug was
 
05:51:57.750 --> 05:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
safe and effective now suddenly one
 
05:52:00.350 --> 05:52:00.360 align:start position:0%
judge and District hordon uh Texas said
 
05:52:03.070 --> 05:52:03.080 align:start position:0%
this was not safe and effective based on
 
05:52:05.310 --> 05:52:05.320 align:start position:0%
whatever evidence was presented that's
 
05:52:07.468 --> 05:52:07.478 align:start position:0%
that's dangerous because this is a safe
 
05:52:08.910 --> 05:52:08.920 align:start position:0%
and effective drug and how do we know
 
05:52:11.510 --> 05:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
that well it's been used for 20 years
 
05:52:13.868 --> 05:52:13.878 align:start position:0%
and the large large majority of the
 
05:52:15.390 --> 05:52:15.400 align:start position:0%
evidence that's out there virtually 100%
 
05:52:16.548 --> 05:52:16.558 align:start position:0%
of the evidence that's out there based
 
05:52:18.628 --> 05:52:18.638 align:start position:0%
on now clinical use in the real world
 
05:52:21.670 --> 05:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
says it's safe and effective St
 
05:52:23.750 --> 05:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
represent repres LE you had your hand
 
05:52:27.230 --> 05:52:27.240 align:start position:0%
up well if you want to talk about
 
05:52:32.510 --> 05:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
facts fact is that this is exactly why
 
05:52:35.510 --> 05:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
these issues get adjudicated in a court
 
05:52:35.520 --> 05:52:36.390 align:start position:0%
these issues get adjudicated in a court
of

05:52:36.390 --> 05:52:36.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:52:40.510 --> 05:52:40.520 align:start position:0%
law court of law not here at the New
 
05:52:45.868 --> 05:52:45.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:49.628 --> 05:52:49.638 align:start position:0%
committee other hands other comments uh
 
05:52:52.230 --> 05:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
represent Lane um yes thank you for
 
05:52:54.910 --> 05:52:54.920 align:start position:0%
letting me speak um I would be remiss as
 
05:52:58.390 --> 05:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
someone who has been fighting for
 
05:53:01.270 --> 05:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
medical abortions since I was about 18
 
05:53:04.350 --> 05:53:04.360 align:start position:0%
years old so I would just like to say
 
05:53:07.670 --> 05:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
that this is in line with what I have
 
05:53:10.590 --> 05:53:10.600 align:start position:0%
come to learn in New Hampshire since
 
05:53:13.868 --> 05:53:13.878 align:start position:0%
1986 that we bipartisan support the
 
05:53:17.310 --> 05:53:17.320 align:start position:0%
right to a woman's choice and that um
 
05:53:19.788 --> 05:53:19.798 align:start position:0%
these are medical abortions that fall
 
05:53:23.590 --> 05:53:23.600 align:start position:0%
within the timeline the 24-week timeline
 
05:53:25.868 --> 05:53:25.878 align:start position:0%
and if we don't have them it will
 
05:53:28.190 --> 05:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
severely restrict and it's being done
 
05:53:33.830 --> 05:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
done in a way that is um I think as our
 
05:53:36.708 --> 05:53:36.718 align:start position:0%
representative mentioned in a way that
 
05:53:39.788 --> 05:53:39.798 align:start position:0%
um is goes back to 20 years to ban a
 
05:53:42.590 --> 05:53:42.600 align:start position:0%
drug that has been found safe and has
 
05:53:45.310 --> 05:53:45.320 align:start position:0%
never really had any issues with it in
 
05:53:48.030 --> 05:53:48.040 align:start position:0%
those 20 years and also is available for
 
05:53:50.708 --> 05:53:50.718 align:start position:0%
other things thank you thank you
 
05:53:53.990 --> 05:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
represent Lane I suspect that when we do
 
05:53:56.510 --> 05:53:56.520 align:start position:0%
whoever does the committee reports uh I
 
05:53:58.150 --> 05:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
suspect that these reports will be a
 
05:54:00.390 --> 05:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
little bit longer than uh some of the
 
05:54:02.868 --> 05:54:02.878 align:start position:0%
other ones that we've exec today and
 
05:54:05.948 --> 05:54:05.958 align:start position:0%
that's important and that's good uh
 
05:54:07.510 --> 05:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
because this obviously will go to the
 
05:54:10.190 --> 05:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
floor and uh so I think that whoever
 
05:54:13.990 --> 05:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
does the reports uh I I trust will will
 
05:54:17.708 --> 05:54:17.718 align:start position:0%
fully uh make the case um for the the
 
05:54:20.430 --> 05:54:20.440 align:start position:0%
the two different perspectives on this
 
05:54:23.670 --> 05:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
other comments uh representative
 
05:54:27.430 --> 05:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
Lloyd yeah I just wanted to make a a a
 
05:54:30.548 --> 05:54:30.558 align:start position:0%
note um considering your um what you had
 
05:54:33.230 --> 05:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh or what representative Lev
 
05:54:36.948 --> 05:54:36.958 align:start position:0%
had mentioned um this is a resolution it
 
05:54:39.590 --> 05:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
is a as we heard earlier a strongly
 
05:54:43.270 --> 05:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
worded letter it does not have any
 
05:54:45.350 --> 05:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
bearing on the current court case other
 
05:54:47.390 --> 05:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
than to tell them what New Hampshire's
 
05:54:50.110 --> 05:54:50.120 align:start position:0%
position is and if we look back at the
 
05:54:52.628 --> 05:54:52.638 align:start position:0%
testimony that we had heard in the 90s
 
05:54:54.628 --> 05:54:54.638 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire New Hampshire was the
 
05:54:57.670 --> 05:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
first state and Republicans co-sponsored
 
05:55:01.628 --> 05:55:01.638 align:start position:0%
this to allow Mya prone and uh medical
 
05:55:04.948 --> 05:55:04.958 align:start position:0%
and to look uh to look through
 
05:55:08.708 --> 05:55:08.718 align:start position:0%
um uh the the the applications of this
 
05:55:11.910 --> 05:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
drug so I don't think that we're
 
05:55:16.030 --> 05:55:16.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily um doing anything incorrect
 
05:55:19.430 --> 05:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
by supporting um showing our side it
 
05:55:21.590 --> 05:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
would basically be like us submitting
 
05:55:24.468 --> 05:55:24.478 align:start position:0%
testimony to a bill that was being heard
 
05:55:26.510 --> 05:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
um by showing our support to what's
 
05:55:30.230 --> 05:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
going on um and our side of it in the
 
05:55:32.030 --> 05:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
courts thank you representative
 
05:55:34.430 --> 05:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
represent man py you have a hand up
 
05:55:36.868 --> 05:55:36.878 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just want to put my
 
05:55:42.070 --> 05:55:42.080 align:start position:0%
two cents 20 years of medically advised
 
05:55:45.830 --> 05:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
medication that was effective safe and
 
05:55:50.150 --> 05:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
for women in the state and all of a
 
05:55:54.310 --> 05:55:54.320 align:start position:0%
sudden that has not somehow has become
 
05:55:57.948 --> 05:55:57.958 align:start position:0%
unsafe ineffective and this is a choice
 
05:56:01.070 --> 05:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
it's a health of a woman and health of a
 
05:56:04.350 --> 05:56:04.360 align:start position:0%
mother or the person who's carrying it
 
05:56:09.110 --> 05:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
so this to me is a medical decision and
 
05:56:12.510 --> 05:56:12.520 align:start position:0%
if somebody said the diabetic medication
 
05:56:15.110 --> 05:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
cannot be used anymore I wouldn't be
 
05:56:19.310 --> 05:56:19.320 align:start position:0%
able to live so it's similarly like that
 
05:56:21.910 --> 05:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
it's in terms of it's a medically
 
05:56:24.590 --> 05:56:24.600 align:start position:0%
necessity or
 
05:56:28.150 --> 05:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
medically needed it's it's not when not
 
05:56:31.548 --> 05:56:31.558 align:start position:0%
talking about willy-nilly so if that is
 
05:56:34.670 --> 05:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
the decision between the provider and
 
05:56:38.868 --> 05:56:38.878 align:start position:0%
the person why should we take that into
 
05:56:42.868 --> 05:56:42.878 align:start position:0%
a legislative body and with that I
 
05:56:48.390 --> 05:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
would strongly support the OTP of this
 
05:56:49.230 --> 05:56:49.240 align:start position:0%
