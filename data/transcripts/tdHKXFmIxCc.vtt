and just here to introduce senate bill
 
00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:38.710 align:start position:0%
and just here to introduce senate bill
35

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
35
 
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
in 1995 schoolcare was founded by five
 
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire educational
 
00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 align:start position:0%
organizations and the purpose of school
 
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
care was to provide school employees
 
00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 align:start position:0%
with access to more affordable health
 
00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 align:start position:0%
care options
 
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
when the life and health insurance risk
 
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
pool program was created by school care
 
00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
nea new hampshire was the only founding
 
00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
member excluded from participating in it
 
00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
therefore this bill would allow anya new
 
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire to participate
 
00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
in the existing risk pool program only
 
00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
after having gained
 
00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:09.439 align:start position:0%
approval from the governing board of the
 
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
risk pool
 
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
significantly this bill is narrowly
 
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
tailored tailored to prevent
 
00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
any unintended unintended expansion
 
00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 align:start position:0%
of who can participate in the risk pool
 
00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
program programs that are covered under
 
00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:22.069 align:start position:0%
program programs that are covered under
rsa

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
rsa
 
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
5-b and we did work it was last year
 
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
with the secretary of state's office on
 
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
this language to make sure it was very
 
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 align:start position:0%
finely tuned
 
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
and it did go through the senate
 
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
commerce and a 5-0 vote and was on the
 
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
consent calendar calendar in the senate
 
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 align:start position:0%
and i can take any questions
 
00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 align:start position:0%
mr chairman thank you uh representative
 
00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
bartlett has a question
 
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
thanks very much mr chair and thanks for
 
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
coming to see us um senator cavanaugh
 
00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i missed when the um school
 
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
care was
 
00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
organized in 1995 95
 
00:04:57.909 --> 00:04:57.919 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you
 
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
so this means like for instance teachers
 
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
or aft teachers who are
 
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
eligible but the nea teachers were not
 
00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 align:start position:0%
correct nea is the only founding member
 
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
member organization that was excluded
 
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
for whatever
 
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
reason they weren't included in it so it
 
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
would just be for that for that group to
 
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
be added in
 
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
and it's got to be the government party
 
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
of the board still has to say yes to it
 
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
just by passing this it still gives them
 
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
the authority to say yes or no
 
00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
right so i guess other than those two
 
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
what other teacher unions that are in
 
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:25.029 align:start position:0%
what other teacher unions that are in
this

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
association um you know i'm not even
 
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
sure i'd have to probably defer that to
 
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
um i think ryan hawkins might be
 
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
testifying maybe yep
 
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
you see him all right great uh
 
00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
seeing no more questions thank you very
 
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
much okay i'm going to jump off i have
 
00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 align:start position:0%

programs
 
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 align:start position:0%
just as senator kavanaugh indicated the
 
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.270 align:start position:0%
just as senator kavanaugh indicated the
bureau

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
bureau
 
00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:35.919 align:start position:0%
we did meet with senator cavanaugh last
 
00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:36.469 align:start position:0%
we did meet with senator cavanaugh last
year

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
to discuss this and uh as he indicated
 
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
um this is really very narrowly tailored
 
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.270 align:start position:0%
um this is really very narrowly tailored
um

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
and uh in order for a member
 
00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
uh to be able to participate in this
 
00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:50.479 align:start position:0%
pool it does require the approval of the
 
00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:51.919 align:start position:0%
governing board so there is some
 
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
oversight there
 
00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh and so in effect we we support
 
00:07:00.309 --> 00:07:00.319 align:start position:0%
sb 35 and encourage its passage
 
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
any questions we have the answers so so
 
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
why did it require legislation to allow
 
00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
why couldn't the board just vote
 
00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
vote to have more members
 
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
i believe was the the language uh in uh
 
00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:17.759 align:start position:0%
5b uh that did not actually uh
 
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
include them uh which is the reason why
 
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
senator kavanaugh was asked to
 
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
pursue an amendment to 5b
 
00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:34.479 align:start position:0%

00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%

uh thank you
 
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
just to say that at the top um and so it
 
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
was founded when the
 
00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:41.039 align:start position:0%
executive director of nea new hampshire
 
00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
at the time
 
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
approached the school boards association
 
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
and some of the other associations
 
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.790 align:start position:0%
and some of the other associations
representing

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
representing
 
00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
management in school districts to
 
00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
respond to what they felt was the need
 
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
to have another choice
 
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
when accessing healthcare for school
 
00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:56.949 align:start position:0%
when accessing healthcare for school
employees

00:08:56.949 --> 00:08:56.959 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
as well as to hopefully have some more
 
00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
affordable options
 
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
for health insurance something that
 
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
would benefit school districts
 
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
employees and taxpayers so the
 
00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
partnership was founded by the
 
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
association of school business officials
 
00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire school boards
 
00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.389 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire school boards
association

00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
nea new hampshire the school board's
 
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
insurance trust
 
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
and the new hampshire school
 
00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:22.160 align:start position:0%
administrators association um
 
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
the goal uh and the premise of this was
 
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
this uh coalition was to have a true
 
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
labor management enterprise in seeking
 
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
to provide
 
00:09:35.269 --> 00:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
again districts and and other political
 
00:09:35.279 --> 00:09:36.630 align:start position:0%
again districts and and other political
subdivisions

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
subdivisions
 
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
um options that were a good fit for them
 
00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:39.760 align:start position:0%
for their health care
 
00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959 align:start position:0%
and over the last uh 25 26 years we feel
 
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
the coalition has been a truly
 
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
successful one a collaborative one and
 
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
one that's uh
 
00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
worked well toward what it wasn't
 
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
intended to do again that
 
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
a labor management part partnership um
 
00:09:59.350 --> 00:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
and today the na new hampshire president
 
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
continues to sit on the board of school
 
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.269 align:start position:0%
continues to sit on the board of school
care

00:10:01.269 --> 00:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
care
 
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
and we continue to have new hampshire
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
indianapolis continues to have a
 
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
you know staff person dedicated to
 
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:08.720 align:start position:0%
helping uh
 
00:10:10.949 --> 00:10:10.959 align:start position:0%
facilitate that process uh especially
 
00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
for the for the labor side
 
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839 align:start position:0%
in um in and helping our members with
 
00:10:15.839 --> 00:10:16.230 align:start position:0%
in um in and helping our members with
their

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
uh health insurance
 
00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
needs so now of the founding members
 
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
that i just mentioned
 
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
as senator kavanaugh said there's only
 
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
one of those organizations
 
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
that cannot participate in the risk pool
 
00:10:30.389 --> 00:10:30.399 align:start position:0%
as an employer
 
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
for their own employees and that is nea
 
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:34.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:37.360 align:start position:0%
um um and that's because of the way the
 
00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:37.990 align:start position:0%
um um and that's because of the way the
5b

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
5b
 
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
statute is currently written so i think
 
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.590 align:start position:0%
statute is currently written so i think
um

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
just to clarify that it this is uh
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
because i think that uh mr chairman you
 
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
asked the question of uh
 
00:10:51.829 --> 00:10:51.839 align:start position:0%
senator kavanaugh uh so this is uh
 
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
that any a new hampshire as an employer
 
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
would be participating
 
00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
in um in the risk in
 
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
the rest pool so the teachers are
 
00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
already in
 
00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
teachers are already covered you just
 
00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
want the management of nda
 
00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
to be else to also be covered under this
 
00:11:09.279 --> 00:11:10.389 align:start position:0%
to be else to also be covered under this
pool

00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
pool
 
00:11:12.550 --> 00:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
so this so uh actually this is this was
 
00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
the next point i was going to make my
 
00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:14.959 align:start position:0%
testimony but
 
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
it was actually uh so um
 
00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:21.680 align:start position:0%
so if you are the the way the
 
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
statute is currently uh written um
 
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
you're asking uh mr glennon earlier
 
00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
um it's sort of a broad definition that
 
00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.069 align:start position:0%
um it's sort of a broad definition that
includes

00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
includes
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
any of the entities that are sort of
 
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
created by some of the
 
00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
the other you know town
 
00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
school district so for example if you
 
00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.269 align:start position:0%
school district so for example if you
are

00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:45.279 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh the new hampshire school boards or
 
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
school administrators association
 
00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:54.839 align:start position:0%
you you are inc they are included as an
 
00:11:57.269 --> 00:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
employer in the definition of who can
 
00:11:57.279 --> 00:11:58.069 align:start position:0%
employer in the definition of who can
participate

00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
participate
 
00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
in a 5b risk pool plan
 
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
those other partners in founding school
 
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
care and continuing to
 
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
you know sit on the board of school care
 
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:13.990 align:start position:0%
you know sit on the board of school care
they

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
all are able to participate for
 
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
that as employers as well so not just
 
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
the school districts that they represent
 
00:12:24.949 --> 00:12:24.959 align:start position:0%
but the school boards
 
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
association for example as an employer
 
00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
can participate
 
00:12:30.629 --> 00:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
in the plan same thing goes for health
 
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
trust with respect to the municipal
 
00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:33.190 align:start position:0%
trust with respect to the municipal
association

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:12:37.269 --> 00:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
so so so again if there's only one
 
00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:39.200 align:start position:0%
left out of that and that simply has to
 
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
do with the definition of
 
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
of of or the way the statute was written
 
00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
so it wasn't necessarily
 
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
specifically including or excuse me
 
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
excluding us
 
00:12:52.069 --> 00:12:52.079 align:start position:0%
as a is just the the categories of of
 
00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
who could be included
 
00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
and so the bill seeks to correct this
 
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
issue by allowing
 
00:12:57.990 --> 00:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
founding organizations of risk pool
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
management programs
 
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
to participate in specifically just the
 
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
health and life insurances so i'll point
 
00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:05.030 align:start position:0%
health and life insurances so i'll point
out

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
in the bill it specifically references
 
00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:08.389 align:start position:0%
in the bill it specifically references
just

00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
um 5b 3 roman 3 f
 
00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
and g and so this does not include
 
00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:17.200 align:start position:0%
this does not include workers
 
00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
compensation or anything
 
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
else like that is just a the health and
 
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:22.389 align:start position:0%
else like that is just a the health and
life

00:13:22.389 --> 00:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
life
 
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
so um again this legislation is is
 
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
is is really about acknowledging the
 
00:13:30.629 --> 00:13:30.639 align:start position:0%
integral role that
 
00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
a founding organization of a risk will
 
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:33.760 align:start position:0%
like any of new hampshire's played in
 
00:13:35.829 --> 00:13:35.839 align:start position:0%
the formation and success of school care
 
00:13:35.839 --> 00:13:36.629 align:start position:0%
the formation and success of school care
by

00:13:36.629 --> 00:13:36.639 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
by fixing this um provision in in the
 
00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.790 align:start position:0%
by fixing this um provision in in the
statute

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:43.839 align:start position:0%
um as has
 
00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
been stated it is narrowly tailored so
 
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:48.160 align:start position:0%
we would have to receive
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
authorization from the board
 
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
not the nda new hampshire board but the
 
00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:54.870 align:start position:0%
not the nda new hampshire board but the
uh

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:56.320 align:start position:0%
the board of school care which has a
 
00:13:58.629 --> 00:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
fiduciary responsibility to
 
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
the pool um in order to uh
 
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
in order to participate um
 
00:14:07.829 --> 00:14:07.839 align:start position:0%
and so throughout this process uh i just
 
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
want to uh
 
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
thank uh uh the secretary of state's
 
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
office uh secretary gardner mr glenn
 
00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
for for their uh uh assistance as well
 
00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:18.470 align:start position:0%
for for their uh uh assistance as well
as

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
uh you know the folks at school care
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh for working with us on this and for
 
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh senate and to senator cavanaugh for
 
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
bringing the bill forward
 
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
so i'll close my testimony there and
 
00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
again i'll i'll
 
00:14:33.509 --> 00:14:33.519 align:start position:0%
i will submit um my written version of
 
00:14:33.519 --> 00:14:34.470 align:start position:0%
i will submit um my written version of
this

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:14:36.069 --> 00:14:36.079 align:start position:0%
to the committee for the record and
 
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
okay so i'm still i still make sure i
 
00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:43.519 align:start position:0%
want to answer
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
so again i'm using my example as the aft
 
00:14:47.829 --> 00:14:47.839 align:start position:0%
which is the other big teachers union
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
right so aft wasn't barred because
 
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
their representatives were actual
 
00:14:56.069 --> 00:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
teachers and therefore they were getting
 
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
the benefits
 
00:15:00.389 --> 00:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
or that right out of the beginning you
 
00:15:00.949 --> 00:15:00.959 align:start position:0%
know it was
 
00:15:03.189 --> 00:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
how how did well against first is there
 
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
aft members
 
00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
in this in this risk pool
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
um i i presume there are school
 
00:15:15.189 --> 00:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
districts who have you know
 
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh school employees represented by aft
 
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:18.310 align:start position:0%
uh school employees represented by aft
that

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
are in the risk pool
 
00:15:25.509 --> 00:15:25.519 align:start position:0%
okay um so it's it's not the um
 
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
it is not the actual educators
 
00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
school staff that are excluded so our
 
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:35.519 align:start position:0%
members certainly are not excluded from
 
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
if their employer joins the pool okay
 
00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
so that means i guess what i think
 
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
you're saying
 
00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
is that the nea is so big that it has
 
00:15:47.749 --> 00:15:47.759 align:start position:0%
employees that are not
 
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
actually teachers and
 
00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
you would like them to be able to join
 
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
in this risk pool
 
00:15:57.509 --> 00:15:57.519 align:start position:0%
simply because they work for the nea and
 
00:15:58.790 --> 00:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
they're not teacher even though they're
 
00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
not teachers
 
00:16:04.389 --> 00:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh you know so we we
 
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
any new hampshire would have to
 
00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
participate as an employer for their
 
00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
employees but
 
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
but yes i think i think you're i think
 
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
got it okay um and i just say just as
 
00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
just as the other associations
 
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
that are part of this plan can do right
 
00:16:23.829 --> 00:16:23.839 align:start position:0%
now so
 
00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:25.440 align:start position:0%
okay so let's say you with some of the
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
other ones you met you mentioned school
 
00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:27.350 align:start position:0%
other ones you met you mentioned school
boards

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
boards
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
yeah so that means that anybody who's on
 
00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
is a school board could get in on this
 
00:16:34.949 --> 00:16:34.959 align:start position:0%
policy even though
 
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
they're elected and only there for a
 
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
couple of years
 
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
no so you would have to be it would be
 
00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
an employee
 
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
or as an employee the school boards
 
00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:44.949 align:start position:0%
or as an employee the school boards
association

00:16:44.949 --> 00:16:44.959 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:16:48.550 --> 00:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
as um you know a
 
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
small number of employees i think so as
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
as as an employer
 
00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
um they can they can buy into school
 
00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
care for their employees
 
00:17:02.949 --> 00:17:02.959 align:start position:0%
because they're not it's not which might
 
00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
might have about 10 employees i mean i
 
00:17:04.789 --> 00:17:04.799 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
how they have right we also yes and
 
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
that's exactly right and so any new
 
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire has a
 
00:17:11.669 --> 00:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
you know we have less than 20 employees
 
00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
who else is yeah so read that list again
 
00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
not going to pay more
 
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
oh sure uh so um the
 
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
member and this will be in my uh this is
 
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
part of my testimony too so you have
 
00:17:24.549 --> 00:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
the school business officials the school
 
00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
boards association
 
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
us uh the school boards uh and the
 
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire school administrators
 
00:17:32.549 --> 00:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
association though
 
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
uh that'd be like the superintendent the
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
superintendents and
 
00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
but again it's for their employees not
 
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:45.039 align:start position:0%
so to cite the example you use
 
00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
a school a member of a school board
 
00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:49.919 align:start position:0%
would not be eligible
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
for this it would only be uh
 
00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
the the the the employees who have a
 
00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
full-time job of working for
 
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
these the associations right exactly
 
00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
holy moly well i guess the awkwardness
 
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
is that that
 
00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
we money some of us think the nea is a
 
00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh and i know it's supposed to be
 
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
advancement of teachers
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
but we think of as a union so what we're
 
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
doing is we're taking the union office
 
00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
and we're saying
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to treat you just like a
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
teacher so that's
 
00:18:24.789 --> 00:18:24.799 align:start position:0%
that's that's simply an interesting
 
00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
sorry yes thank you
 
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
as i understand this bill tell me if i'm
 
00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.909 align:start position:0%
as i understand this bill tell me if i'm
correct

00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:41.919 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:18:44.470 --> 00:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
well it would be necessary for the
 
00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.710 align:start position:0%
well it would be necessary for the
legislature

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:46.720 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:18:48.549 --> 00:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
to pass this bill and the governor to
 
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
sign it in order
 
00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
to expand who's eligible
 
00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
to participate there
 
00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
in no way does this affect taxpayers
 
00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
that is uh there's there's no there's no
 
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
cost to the taxpayer could could you
 
00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:07.190 align:start position:0%
cost to the taxpayer could could you
just

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
address if that's if that is correct
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh that that's absolutely correct um
 
00:19:16.390 --> 00:19:16.400 align:start position:0%
and uh i think there may be a
 
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
representative in the
 
00:19:21.669 --> 00:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
uh uh in the
 
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
audience the virtual audience of from
 
00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
school care if you wanted to hear from
 
00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:27.039 align:start position:0%
them as well
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
but um you know we we would obviously
 
00:19:31.669 --> 00:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
like any other
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
you know school district or other
 
00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:35.110 align:start position:0%
you know school district or other
employer

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
employer
 
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
was participating would actually have to
 
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
pay our pay the full cost of
 
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
participating so so you're absolutely
 
00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.510 align:start position:0%
participating so so you're absolutely
correct

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:19:45.029 --> 00:19:45.039 align:start position:0%
there's no cost to the state or to the
 
00:19:45.039 --> 00:19:47.190 align:start position:0%
there's no cost to the state or to the
locality

00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
locality
 
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
representative van halen thank you mr
 
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
chair good morning thank you mr hawkins
 
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
for being here
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
i just like to clarify something too i
 
00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
think some of us are going in directions
 
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
that may or may not be the right
 
00:19:59.909 --> 00:19:59.919 align:start position:0%
directions and i'd like to just be 100
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
sure first of all we're talking about a
 
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
small number of employees who probably
 
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
should have been there in the first
 
00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:05.590 align:start position:0%
should have been there in the first
place

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
and had did not get residents in that
 
00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
pool am i correct
 
00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:10.640 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that's a fair assessment
 
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
yes and secondly
 
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
this is totally divorced from anything
 
00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
union related this is simply a matter of
 
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
doing the right thing by employees and
 
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
offering them this kind of coverage is
 
00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
that correct as well
 
00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039 align:start position:0%
that's correct again you know this is
 
00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:24.799 align:start position:0%
this is correcting the only
 
00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:26.559 align:start position:0%
the only group that is making this a
 
00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:28.070 align:start position:0%
the only group that is making this a
successful

00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
successful
 
00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:31.919 align:start position:0%
uh you know enterprise the school is not
 
00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
able to participate
 
00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions from the
 
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.149 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions from the
committee

00:20:42.149 --> 00:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh great so is anybody the attendees
 
00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
does anybody else would like to testify
 
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much mr
 
00:20:54.549 --> 00:20:54.559 align:start position:0%
chairman i appreciate your time and i'll
 
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
i'll get this
 
00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
written stuff over to you thank you very
 
00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:58.950 align:start position:0%
written stuff over to you thank you very
much

00:20:58.950 --> 00:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
so i i don't have anybody else signed up
 
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
for it and
 
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh and i don't see any hands popping up
 
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh who want to want to testify so i
 
00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.149 align:start position:0%
uh who want to want to testify so i
guess

00:21:10.149 --> 00:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
guess
 
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
we will end the public hearing on
 
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
senate bill 35 and we had nine
 
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
support and not opposed and
 
00:21:22.870 --> 00:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
nobody neutral so with that we'll close
 
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on senate bill 35
 
00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:30.799 align:start position:0%
all right what's next
 
00:21:40.789 --> 00:21:40.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
oh if you're looking for that piece of
 
00:21:45.029 --> 00:21:45.039 align:start position:0%
paper not like so what's the next one
 
00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
the next one is at 9 45 and it's senate
 
00:21:49.909 --> 00:21:49.919 align:start position:0%
bill 38.
 
00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
okay all right so that one
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
all right well i guess we we're going to
 
00:21:58.789 --> 00:21:58.799 align:start position:0%
be brief set recess until 9 45.
 
00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm looking at the old one you're
 
00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
you're right calendar has 9 45.
 
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
oh all right schedule it came out
 
00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
yeah the revised schedule is 9 45. right
 
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
okay the uh what have was there was some
 
00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:20.950 align:start position:0%
okay the uh what have was there was some
bills

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
that didn't didn't appear so we had to
 
00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
work around it
 
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
right right because i like i say i have
 
00:22:30.149 --> 00:22:30.159 align:start position:0%
9 30
 
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
but that was okay
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
so um okay so
 
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
we'll just in brief recess until uh the
 
00:22:42.149 --> 00:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
if the calendar says nine for the key
 
00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
elements the calendar
 
00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:46.960 align:start position:0%
so if the calendar says 9 45 then yeah
 
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
it says 9 45 on the calendar okay so
 
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
that that's that's the rules
 
00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
we play by okay you all
 
00:23:15.029 --> 00:23:15.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:16.789 --> 00:23:16.799 align:start position:0%
you guys in the committee rooms i guess
 
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
what you have to do is turn
 
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
off your volume on your computers
 
00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
because you've got the speaker in the
 
00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:24.470 align:start position:0%
because you've got the speaker in the
room

00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
room
 
00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
right we i would mine as long as low as
 
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
it will go it won't
 
00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
shut off anymore so i don't have my
 
00:23:32.549 --> 00:23:32.559 align:start position:0%
speaker on in my
 
00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:35.039 align:start position:0%
and on my i think it's your it's your
 
00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:37.230 align:start position:0%
microphone right so it's not speaker
 
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:38.789 align:start position:0%
microphone right so it's not speaker
[Music]

00:23:38.789 --> 00:23:38.799 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know that's a good question
 
00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
sounds like a cricket
 
00:23:45.830 --> 00:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
yeah it does feels like late summer
 
00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:46.630 align:start position:0%
yeah it does feels like late summer
already

00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
right i think if you go to the bottom
 
00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
well in my my screen and you go
 
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
to the speaker you can actually turn it
 
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.110 align:start position:0%
to the speaker you can actually turn it
off

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
off
 
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
right or maybe the f1 keep
 
00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:03.910 align:start position:0%
i got my tablet tablet
 
00:24:03.910 --> 00:24:09.830 align:start position:0%
i got my tablet tablet
[Music]

00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
they keep trying to get me to take buy
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
one of those
 
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes i um did receive in the
 
00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:00.950 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes i um did receive in the
mail

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
mail
 
00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:04.720 align:start position:0%
the printed um bills that were dealing
 
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
with yesterday and today of course it
 
00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
came yesterday afternoon
 
00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
but uh one was missing and we don't have
 
00:25:11.669 --> 00:25:11.679 align:start position:0%
any for next week
 
00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
so um would be your suggestion that i go
 
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
to the clerk's office and ask them
 
00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
to mail the bills out to us
 
00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:23.039 align:start position:0%
my memory was that bills were always the
 
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the
 
00:25:27.669 --> 00:25:27.679 align:start position:0%
sergeant of arms are you around him
 
00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
yeah i am i mean you know this is a
 
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
sort of different situation where
 
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
our our office has been mailing them out
 
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:38.480 align:start position:0%
but only on requests
 
00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:40.799 align:start position:0%
you know we haven't we tried to do that
 
00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
automatic mailing early in january but
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of the bills weren't printed yet
 
00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
so it created
 
00:25:51.909 --> 00:25:51.919 align:start position:0%
you know it wasn't smooth and to do the
 
00:25:51.919 --> 00:25:52.870 align:start position:0%
you know it wasn't smooth and to do the
400

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
400
 
00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
um rings right
 
00:25:58.149 --> 00:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
you know we don't have like like mailing
 
00:26:00.149 --> 00:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
lists sorted by committee we had them
 
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
sorted alphabetically for the whole 400
 
00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:03.510 align:start position:0%
sorted alphabetically for the whole 400
and

00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
anyway it was um you know as you can
 
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
understand a big shore so we've been
 
00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
doing them
 
00:26:14.549 --> 00:26:14.559 align:start position:0%
on requests for the senate bills and
 
00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
but the mail is not you know as quick as
 
00:26:17.679 --> 00:26:17.990 align:start position:0%
but the mail is not you know as quick as
it

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:26:21.909 --> 00:26:21.919 align:start position:0%
once was so well i hoped in concord she
 
00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
can get them pretty quickly
 
00:26:27.029 --> 00:26:27.039 align:start position:0%
yeah i know i know it would happen
 
00:26:29.669 --> 00:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
i mean everything comes from manchester
 
00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
united or nashville whatever the big
 
00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:31.269 align:start position:0%
united or nashville whatever the big
circle

00:26:31.269 --> 00:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
circle
 
00:26:32.789 --> 00:26:32.799 align:start position:0%
exactly well i mean that's the thing i
 
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
mean representative bartlett
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
they were mailed out i remember the
 
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
discussion i don't remember which day
 
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
but it certainly wasn't
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
friday you know no they didn't they no
 
00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:46.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
so yeah it's actually a lobbyist who's
 
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
calling me
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
so our office is the short answer is
 
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
that our office is the right place to go
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
okay um we do our best but you know if
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
people can pick them up that's fantastic
 
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
that's clearly an
 
00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
option i'm sure she can pick them up
 
00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah or she can do that for you
 
00:27:06.549 --> 00:27:06.559 align:start position:0%
right that
 
00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:08.799 align:start position:0%
that makes sense we'd love to be able to
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
you know get them immediately to
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
everybody but it's
 
00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
it's trickier than you might first right
 
00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
and don you were able to get that
 
00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:18.559 align:start position:0%
big report for the liquor commission by
 
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
picking it up right don
 
00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:24.320 align:start position:0%
yes she did she did and she got the um
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
status report when she was in yesterday
 
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
or monday so
 
00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
coming to concord excellent we can do
 
00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:37.669 align:start position:0%
coming to concord excellent we can do
that

00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:40.389 --> 00:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
well i hope to be there soon to be there
 
00:27:40.399 --> 00:27:42.310 align:start position:0%
well i hope to be there soon to be there
soon

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.320 align:start position:0%

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
hi i'm i'm i'm assuming by
 
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
by uh may
 
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:52.480 align:start position:0%

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
so um so should
 
00:27:59.190 --> 00:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
i mean if i if i request these bills
 
00:28:01.750 --> 00:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
and go down to the security office in
 
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
the state house
 
00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
could they have an envelope of those
 
00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
bills for me
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
reception desk
 
00:28:12.389 --> 00:28:12.399 align:start position:0%

00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
me i
 
00:30:47.669 --> 00:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
i just um so i'll continue to
 
00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
just continue to do it and uh
 
00:30:54.549 --> 00:30:54.559 align:start position:0%
if it keeps going into spam i
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
don't know what to do well what you're
 
00:30:57.669 --> 00:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
supposed to do is you're supposed to
 
00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
a um make that email that's coming in as
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
as a a favorite you're supposed to like
 
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
actually put it cut and paste it into
 
00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:07.509 align:start position:0%
actually put it cut and paste it into
your

00:31:07.509 --> 00:31:07.519 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
customer or your contacts list so that
 
00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
it's a contact that
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
it's a preferred contact so that is
 
00:31:15.909 --> 00:31:15.919 align:start position:0%
supposed to uh one way
 
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
to stop to stop it from going into junk
 
00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:19.350 align:start position:0%
to stop to stop it from going into junk
mail

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
mail
 
00:31:21.190 --> 00:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
you can kind of make it up and you're in
 
00:31:22.389 --> 00:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
your email
 
00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
and then look at your junk mail account
 
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
your your rules
 
00:31:29.029 --> 00:31:29.039 align:start position:0%
in junk mail and see what your rules are
 
00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
um you might have your rules might be a
 
00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
little too strict
 
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
because for instance if she's sending
 
00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
him out bulk with multiple names on that
 
00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
with that email then you're no
 
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
you do one each person yeah zoom just
 
00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
you you set you you load all the
 
00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:44.470 align:start position:0%
you you set you you load all the
addresses

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
addresses
 
00:31:47.909 --> 00:31:47.919 align:start position:0%
and names into zoom directly and it
 
00:31:51.029 --> 00:31:51.039 align:start position:0%
sends them you know i don't it isn't
 
00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
but it's not me you know me it doesn't
 
00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
like whatever
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
it doesn't like whoever was sending it
 
00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:57.750 align:start position:0%
it doesn't like whoever was sending it
like

00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:31:59.669 --> 00:31:59.679 align:start position:0%
like for a longest time because i have
 
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
you know my email address prodigy is
 
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
older than aol it's the
 
00:32:04.710 --> 00:32:04.720 align:start position:0%
like the oldest out there so i was
 
00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
having trouble with
 
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
the liquor commission they couldn't get
 
00:32:09.509 --> 00:32:09.519 align:start position:0%
any of my emails i couldn't
 
00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
couldn't get it and even when i was on
 
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
the board of new hampshire children's
 
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
health foundation
 
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
they they had to use my gmail account
 
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:17.039 align:start position:0%
they ended up having use of different
 
00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
accounts i believe
 
00:32:20.789 --> 00:32:20.799 align:start position:0%
because they that my prodigy was blocked
 
00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:21.760 align:start position:0%
and that we
 
00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
when actually i had the same problem at
 
00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
the state house and that we figured out
 
00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:25.269 align:start position:0%
the state house and that we figured out
was

00:32:25.269 --> 00:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:32:27.909 --> 00:32:27.919 align:start position:0%
actually the state house internet
 
00:32:27.919 --> 00:32:28.630 align:start position:0%
actually the state house internet
provider

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
provider
 
00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
here in concord had was throwing anybody
 
00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:38.789 --> 00:32:38.799 align:start position:0%
i remember i thought was gone for a
 
00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
while but now it's back
 
00:32:42.149 --> 00:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
well now probably he's always been there
 
00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
it's just it's just had multiple owners
 
00:32:46.389 --> 00:32:46.399 align:start position:0%
i feel like a bank customer right
 
00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
every couple of years i have a new new
 
00:32:49.509 --> 00:32:49.519 align:start position:0%
name for my account
 
00:32:52.230 --> 00:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
so right now it's now it's a t so i'm
 
00:32:53.669 --> 00:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
i'm pretty safe that
 
00:32:57.029 --> 00:32:57.039 align:start position:0%
we're not going to be shuffled again but
 
00:32:58.870 --> 00:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
but they did drop my dial up i don't
 
00:33:00.789 --> 00:33:00.799 align:start position:0%
have my dial up feature anymore
 
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
um which i never used it but the good
 
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
news is they then refunded me all the
 
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
money i was paying
 
00:33:10.149 --> 00:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
that i was paying for for that feature
 
00:33:10.950 --> 00:33:10.960 align:start position:0%
because i knew it was
 
00:33:12.789 --> 00:33:12.799 align:start position:0%
i was paying it just to keep my email
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
address but turned out like you know
 
00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:15.360 align:start position:0%
maybe i didn't need to do that or
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
whatever but
 
00:33:21.669 --> 00:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
i mean this come the zoom invitations
 
00:33:23.679 --> 00:33:24.950 align:start position:0%
i mean this come the zoom invitations
come

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
come
 
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
addressed from hcs but
 
00:33:31.029 --> 00:33:31.039 align:start position:0%
anyway it's yeah there's a there's
 
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
definitely a
 
00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
some people there are issues and we've
 
00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:37.039 align:start position:0%
we've tried to just use as many
 
00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
addresses as people have and hope that
 
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
one of them gets through
 
00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
right but i don't know what what happens
 
00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
with representative mcaleer because
 
00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
yeah hey chris are you there chris
 
00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
michael are you there
 
00:33:51.669 --> 00:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
or have you gone to get your coffee yeah
 
00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:53.200 align:start position:0%
i might have stepped away because
 
00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
he he comes in as an attendee and i
 
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
right he's keep hitting the wrong thing
 
00:33:58.630 --> 00:33:58.640 align:start position:0%
coming in so i just want to know whether
 
00:34:00.310 --> 00:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
because i noticed that
 
00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:04.640 align:start position:0%
the new link we got today was at 7 57
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
right and so i just wanted to have him
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
go through his
 
00:34:12.069 --> 00:34:12.079 align:start position:0%
his mail might see that that one at 757
 
00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
and know that that's the one he needs to
 
00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
click on to get in
 
00:34:17.349 --> 00:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
right i'm sure he just uses the calendar
 
00:34:19.349 --> 00:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
zoom address
 
00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
right as a participant right which then
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
no as again as a
 
00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
he's attendee as an attendee and then
 
00:34:27.589 --> 00:34:27.599 align:start position:0%
you know i move him over
 
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
or or representative hunt moves him over
 
00:34:31.109 --> 00:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
but right at
 
00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:33.040 align:start position:0%

00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
i like the mail and apparently all my
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
email goes to spam anyway so
 
00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
we've got to get through to you somehow
 
00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
that's impossible well one thing i
 
00:37:31.750 --> 00:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
one thing i did solve in terms of my
 
00:37:33.349 --> 00:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
email type issues is that i
 
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
i do have a gmail account but i don't
 
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
tell anybody
 
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's you know sort of a secret
 
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
secret i keep it you know
 
00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
i just assume not get too much stuff in
 
00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
that account but
 
00:37:45.349 --> 00:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
then every time one of these things come
 
00:37:47.109 --> 00:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
up so pam
 
00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
for a period of time was using my gmail
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
account but then then
 
00:37:53.109 --> 00:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
the state house got solved my prodigy
 
00:37:53.119 --> 00:37:54.230 align:start position:0%
the state house got solved my prodigy
problem

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
so that you might want to have that and
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
you know it came and i got it first
 
00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:01.839 align:start position:0%
because i was a samsung android phone so
 
00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
it made sense to have a gmail account so
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
and i don't do facebook that's the other
 
00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
nice feature of the gmail is that
 
00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes you can join an organization
 
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
get in with using the gmail account
 
00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
as you log in rather than and then the
 
00:38:16.630 --> 00:38:16.640 align:start position:0%
other one is facebook which i
 
00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
i don't go near facebook i'm deathly
 
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:30.069 --> 00:38:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
it's a blessing and a curse yeah well
 
00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:37.890 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:42.069 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

00:38:42.069 --> 00:38:42.079 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sure good comes out of it i'm sure
 
00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
some people i mean i i have a gmail
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
account let me have a facebook account
 
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
which i have to have because there's
 
00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes right like restaurants you
 
00:38:53.670 --> 00:38:53.680 align:start position:0%
can't get their menus you can't
 
00:38:55.589 --> 00:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
you can't get anything unless it's on
 
00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
paper so you have to be able to
 
00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
get in but i whether anybody would ever
 
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
find my personality whatever find my
 
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
whatever it is that you find
 
00:39:07.589 --> 00:39:07.599 align:start position:0%
on facebook yeah my profile so
 
00:39:09.030 --> 00:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
because i'm i'm pretty sure there's no
 
00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:12.829 align:start position:0%
because i'm i'm pretty sure there's no
picture

00:39:12.829 --> 00:39:12.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:12.839 --> 00:39:14.950 align:start position:0%
 
done

00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:39:16.710 --> 00:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't know i'm too afraid to go
 
00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:21.349 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't know i'm too afraid to go
check

00:39:21.349 --> 00:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
i do as little of it as possible very
 
00:39:28.069 --> 00:39:28.079 align:start position:0%
very little
 
00:39:29.829 --> 00:39:29.839 align:start position:0%

00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
spend all that yeah every time people
 
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
post stuff and
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%

benefit
 
00:42:58.069 --> 00:42:58.079 align:start position:0%
uh as other corp uh non-uh
 
00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
nonprofits by um there are
 
00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
because it's the scheduled c drug and uh
 
00:43:07.190 --> 00:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
there are some federal regulations that
 
00:43:09.349 --> 00:43:09.359 align:start position:0%
go with that they're not able to benefit
 
00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
as a non-profit and pass the savings on
 
00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
to their patients so they're asking
 
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
that they can use the option to turn
 
00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
into a
 
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
for-profit organization so that they can
 
00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
pass the savings on to the patients
 
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
if they're operating costs if they have
 
00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
to take out a loan they can
 
00:43:30.069 --> 00:43:30.079 align:start position:0%
uh generally be paying up to the 15
 
00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
interest on those loans and so instead
 
00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
of passing savings on to their customers
 
00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
they have to pay off the loans or
 
00:43:38.309 --> 00:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
capital investments that that they have
 
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
so this this really is a simple bill it
 
00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't change anything with the laws it
 
00:43:43.349 --> 00:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't legalize
 
00:43:45.109 --> 00:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
marijuana across the board or anything
 
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
like that doesn't do anything drastic
 
00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:49.480 align:start position:0%
it just allows them to operate as a
 
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
for-profit organization
 
00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
allows them to lower their prices so
 
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
that the people that
 
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
that need the cannabis for medical you
 
00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
can get it at a
 
00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
a reduced rate rather than uh
 
00:44:03.990 --> 00:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
the rates that they're charging right
 
00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
now other states are doing that by
 
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
lowering interest rates with loans and
 
00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:08.710 align:start position:0%
lowering interest rates with loans and
uh

00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
but because they're a non-profit they
 
00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
they can't do that here in new hampshire
 
00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
so they're just asking uh to change
 
00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh the language a little bit allowing
 
00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
them specifically to
 
00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
go into a for-profit status or llc it's
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
that simple nothing more complicated
 
00:44:29.589 --> 00:44:29.599 align:start position:0%
we've had this bill before apparently
 
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
you did
 
00:44:33.510 --> 00:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
yes uh and so hopefully it passes
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
musters this time it passed the senate
 
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
so so yeah what was the history so
 
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
let's have uh like i guess my memory is
 
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
i've never voted for it but
 
00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
uh what was what was the history what
 
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
i was in here last year that's so uh i
 
00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
think uh
 
00:44:55.589 --> 00:44:55.599 align:start position:0%
it uh passed the house somebody's i
 
00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
think it
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
this is another attempt maybe we changed
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
the language a little bit there were
 
00:45:05.349 --> 00:45:05.359 align:start position:0%
some concerns about creating
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
senator french had a concern about it
 
00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
becoming a monopoly so they amended it
 
00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
so that it wouldn't
 
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
they couldn't become monopolies once
 
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
they went for-profit if you folks
 
00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh decided to uh push this forward
 
00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
yeah but the idea is that you're you're
 
00:45:20.069 --> 00:45:20.079 align:start position:0%
going to get venture capital not
 
00:45:23.349 --> 00:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
a bank loan because uh because banks
 
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
don't want a loan to it so you're going
 
00:45:26.069 --> 00:45:26.079 align:start position:0%
to go out and try to get
 
00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
venture capital and the question would
 
00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
be is what happens if the venture
 
00:45:32.069 --> 00:45:32.079 align:start position:0%
capital was rj reynolds
 
00:45:35.829 --> 00:45:35.839 align:start position:0%
i've never heard of them i'm kidding
 
00:45:39.829 --> 00:45:39.839 align:start position:0%
i'm kidding uh that question never came
 
00:45:39.839 --> 00:45:40.309 align:start position:0%
i'm kidding uh that question never came
up

00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that there's uh there's some
 
00:45:43.349 --> 00:45:43.359 align:start position:0%
folks that can
 
00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
can talk to that specific because that
 
00:45:49.829 --> 00:45:49.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
okay representative herbert uh thank you
 
00:45:55.829 --> 00:45:55.839 align:start position:0%
uh chairman hunt and thank you uh
 
00:45:55.839 --> 00:45:56.550 align:start position:0%
uh chairman hunt and thank you uh
senator

00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
senator
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
um two questions basically uh are you
 
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
related to uh uh the school board member
 
00:46:05.750 --> 00:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh avart here in manchester it all
 
00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:08.430 align:start position:0%
uh avart here in manchester it all
depends

00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:08.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:10.470 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:46:13.349 --> 00:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
just a curious question the other yeah
 
00:46:14.230 --> 00:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
you are okay
 
00:46:17.349 --> 00:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
good the other thing was um if i recall
 
00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
the last time this bill came up
 
00:46:24.069 --> 00:46:24.079 align:start position:0%
um and i could be uh totally wrong here
 
00:46:25.829 --> 00:46:25.839 align:start position:0%
but um
 
00:46:29.109 --> 00:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
the concern was that
 
00:46:32.309 --> 00:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
besides the inability to
 
00:46:37.349 --> 00:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:40.829 --> 00:46:40.839 align:start position:0%
was the concern over
 
00:46:43.430 --> 00:46:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh quality i think that because there
 
00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
are some
 
00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
organizations that are have a license
 
00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
and specifically
 
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
right to provide a a very
 
00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:56.800 align:start position:0%
pure high quality uh product
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
and um and so if somebody
 
00:47:03.349 --> 00:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh you know venture capital or whatever
 
00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:04.400 align:start position:0%
i came in
 
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
i think there was a little bit of
 
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
concern that there would be
 
00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
these uh particular organizations that
 
00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
specialized in making a medicinal
 
00:47:17.109 --> 00:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
quality that's what this is this is
 
00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
municipal these are the municipal
 
00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:21.920 align:start position:0%
providers here in new hampshire well
 
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
that i guess that's what i'm saying is
 
00:47:26.309 --> 00:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
back then i think the concern was that
 
00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
somehow they might
 
00:47:31.109 --> 00:47:31.119 align:start position:0%
uh get put out of business so i i just
 
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
don't know if uh that's a concern today
 
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
as it was then yeah this actually helps
 
00:47:38.549 --> 00:47:38.559 align:start position:0%
them uh
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
in to survive as as an organization
 
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
according to them and it also
 
00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
uh it changes nothing with the quality
 
00:47:47.349 --> 00:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
or the licensures or
 
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
or the restrictions or the distribution
 
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
or anything of that nature
 
00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
it really just changes a very simple
 
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
status from non-profit to for-profit
 
00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh and there might be some venture
 
00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
capitalists but i think that was one of
 
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh senator french's concerns uh and he
 
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
was concerned about monopolies and i
 
00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
believe in the language
 
00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:07.200 align:start position:0%
i can't show it to you right now i think
 
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
maybe michael mclaughlin
 
00:48:11.589 --> 00:48:11.599 align:start position:0%
mr mclaughlin can uh can talk about that
 
00:48:11.599 --> 00:48:12.150 align:start position:0%
mr mclaughlin can uh can talk about that
uh

00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
but uh that was one of senator's
 
00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
french's concerns and he didn't want
 
00:48:18.549 --> 00:48:18.559 align:start position:0%
that to happen
 
00:48:20.549 --> 00:48:20.559 align:start position:0%
so i think we amended it in such a way
 
00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so i guess that answer
 
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
uh representative weston's question so
 
00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
we have uh representative bartlett
 
00:48:35.349 --> 00:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um no just to go back
 
00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
this was
 
00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
um passed by our committee last term
 
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
and tabled um so that no that's
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
one of the histories this i think is the
 
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
third time we've heard this bill
 
00:48:48.549 --> 00:48:48.559 align:start position:0%
um and it didn't have anything to do
 
00:48:50.549 --> 00:48:50.559 align:start position:0%
with medicinal versus
 
00:48:53.829 --> 00:48:53.839 align:start position:0%
for you know um legalization or anything
 
00:48:55.589 --> 00:48:55.599 align:start position:0%
like this it was really a
 
00:48:58.630 --> 00:48:58.640 align:start position:0%
simple bill about allowing um the
 
00:49:00.549 --> 00:49:00.559 align:start position:0%
not-for-profit to become for-profit
 
00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
mostly because of the cost of doing
 
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
business um so i don't really see a
 
00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:06.710 align:start position:0%
business um so i don't really see a
problem

00:49:06.710 --> 00:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
with passing this was already you know
 
00:49:12.150 --> 00:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
would you believe it yes i would believe
 
00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
that you're right
 
00:49:14.470 --> 00:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
would you would you believe
 
00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:20.710 align:start position:0%
would you would you believe
representative

00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:23.040 align:start position:0%

name is michael mclaughlin i represent
 
00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
sanctuary atc and i can do a quick um
 
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
review of what's happened in the past
 
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
senate bill 145
 
00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
came to the from the senate in 2019
 
00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
it passed the senate it moved to the
 
00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:12.800 align:start position:0%
house where it passed the house on a
 
00:50:14.069 --> 00:50:14.079 align:start position:0%
voice vote
 
00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
the governor vetoed that bill uh on the
 
00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:17.349 align:start position:0%
the governor vetoed that bill uh on the
his

00:50:17.349 --> 00:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
his
 
00:50:21.109 --> 00:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
uh theory that somehow uh changing the
 
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
way they do business could lead to
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
industrial commercialization of
 
00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
the marijuana industry
 
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
that reasoning we feel fails
 
00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:35.680 align:start position:0%
in that the marijuana industry so-called
 
00:50:37.589 --> 00:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
today's new hampshire therapeutic
 
00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
cannabis uh distribution
 
00:50:44.069 --> 00:50:44.079 align:start position:0%
centers are controlled by the state
 
00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
the license or the registration that
 
00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
they have to go through
 
00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
is not a right that they can just apply
 
00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
and get
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
it's a privilege offered by the state so
 
00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:56.390 align:start position:0%
it's a privilege offered by the state so
any

00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:50:59.589 --> 00:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
changes in the way that the so-called
 
00:51:01.829 --> 00:51:01.839 align:start position:0%
marijuana industry operates
 
00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
under the full control of the state so
 
00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:05.839 align:start position:0%
when you look at senate bill 38
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
what senate bill 38 says is what we have
 
00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
set up
 
00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
is a structure that does not help
 
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire citizens we did agree and
 
00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:16.720 align:start position:0%
the governor agreed with his meth in his
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
veto message
 
00:51:20.549 --> 00:51:20.559 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis program is good
 
00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:21.680 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire
 
00:51:23.589 --> 00:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
what has happened in the seven years
 
00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
since the passage of the bill
 
00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
is the department of health and human
 
00:51:29.109 --> 00:51:29.119 align:start position:0%
services attract the
 
00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:30.640 align:start position:0%
number of patients i think it's up to
 
00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
ten thousand they've tracked the two
 
00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
issues that they feel are important uh
 
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
the patients complain about two things
 
00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
number one and two number one is price
 
00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
and the price is affected by the fact
 
00:51:45.190 --> 00:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
that as senator evard mentioned
 
00:51:48.549 --> 00:51:48.559 align:start position:0%
atc's as not-for-profit corporations
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
get none of the benefits that a
 
00:51:52.950 --> 00:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
not-for-profit corporation received
 
00:51:56.069 --> 00:51:56.079 align:start position:0%
they cannot qualify as a 501c3 because
 
00:51:58.069 --> 00:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
the internal revenue code and
 
00:51:59.910 --> 00:51:59.920 align:start position:0%
federal law says it's a controlled drug
 
00:52:02.069 --> 00:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
therefore they can't have that
 
00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
as a not-for-profit you can't have an
 
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
equity investor nobody can invest in
 
00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.109 align:start position:0%
equity investor nobody can invest in
not-for-profit

00:52:07.109 --> 00:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
not-for-profit
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
uh not-for-profits have to go for grants
 
00:52:09.359 --> 00:52:10.630 align:start position:0%
uh not-for-profits have to go for grants
contributions

00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
contributions
 
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
and what we're left with is debt
 
00:52:16.549 --> 00:52:16.559 align:start position:0%
the next cut of the federal issue is
 
00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
federal banks federally chartered banks
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
will not loan
 
00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
to companies that are in a business that
 
00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
is where they control federal drug
 
00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
therefore you have to go to
 
00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
non-traditional commercial lenders
 
00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
in order to capitalize the business what
 
00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
senate bill 38 does
 
00:52:36.790 --> 00:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
is it allows the conversion of a
 
00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:38.790 align:start position:0%
is it allows the conversion of a
not-for-profit

00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:38.800 align:start position:0%
not-for-profit
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
to a new hampshire for-profit
 
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
corporation there is
 
00:52:45.589 --> 00:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
no benefit to the state
 
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
or to the patients in the not-for-profit
 
00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:49.670 align:start position:0%
or to the patients in the not-for-profit
um

00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
people will say well we set this up and
 
00:52:57.750 --> 00:52:57.760 align:start position:0%
it should run as it's supposed to run
 
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
as it was formed to run but in the last
 
00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:01.430 align:start position:0%
as it was formed to run but in the last
uh

00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:03.349 --> 00:53:03.359 align:start position:0%
several years we've had 19 bills that
 
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
made changes in the program
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
so changes in the mutation and the
 
00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:10.640 align:start position:0%
maturation of a program
 
00:53:13.349 --> 00:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
is natural and this is looked at as a
 
00:53:13.359 --> 00:53:14.549 align:start position:0%
is natural and this is looked at as a
not-for-profit

00:53:14.549 --> 00:53:14.559 align:start position:0%
not-for-profit
 
00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:16.640 align:start position:0%
uh situation this is something that's
 
00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
not beneficial to new hampshire
 
00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
again as senator avartz said there is no
 
00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:21.990 align:start position:0%
again as senator avartz said there is no
change

00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
to how this will be regulated how it
 
00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
will be tested how it would be
 
00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
advertised advertisement it isn't
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
because senate bill 38
 
00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
senate bill 38 uh is exactly the same as
 
00:53:34.309 --> 00:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
00:53:37.109 --> 00:53:37.119 align:start position:0%
1345 from 2020 which passed the
 
00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
committee and passed the house on voice
 
00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:39.670 align:start position:0%
committee and passed the house on voice
vote

00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:53:41.589 --> 00:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
it went to the senate and died on the
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
table so
 
00:53:45.829 --> 00:53:45.839 align:start position:0%
the history of the bill is not negative
 
00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
the only
 
00:53:49.589 --> 00:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
bump in the road for uh conversion was
 
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
the governor's opinion
 
00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
at that time that somehow
 
00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
industrial commercialization would
 
00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
happen now
 
00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
representative mentioned moments ago or
 
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
somebody mentioned rj reynolds could
 
00:54:05.589 --> 00:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
come in and
 
00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
become an equity partner rj reynolds
 
00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:08.720 align:start position:0%
could lend you
 
00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:10.800 align:start position:0%
10 million dollars today and become a
 
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
controlling partner there
 
00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no real connection
 
00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
between how
 
00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
a conglomerate would show up they
 
00:54:19.270 --> 00:54:19.280 align:start position:0%
certainly could lend you money
 
00:54:23.589 --> 00:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
now the again under uh
 
00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
health and human services rules you
 
00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:26.870 align:start position:0%
health and human services rules you
cannot

00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
cannot
 
00:54:29.589 --> 00:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
transfer the license so any time that
 
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
you get involved in this situation
 
00:54:33.829 --> 00:54:33.839 align:start position:0%
the state controls there's no
 
00:54:33.839 --> 00:54:34.710 align:start position:0%
the state controls there's no
opportunity

00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
for uh rj reynolds or philip morris
 
00:54:41.910 --> 00:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
or canadian mega marijuana to suddenly
 
00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
appear in new hampshire and
 
00:54:45.109 --> 00:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
take over the market we control the
 
00:54:46.630 --> 00:54:46.640 align:start position:0%
market as it is today
 
00:54:48.789 --> 00:54:48.799 align:start position:0%
and what senate bill 38 does is say
 
00:54:50.069 --> 00:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
let's have a market
 
00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
that works as efficiently as possible
 
00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
for the people
 
00:54:58.150 --> 00:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:01.030 --> 00:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
and i'll happily answer any questions if
 
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
i can
 
00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
but yes we've seen this bill several
 
00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
times and it's always passed so i
 
00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
urge you to look beyond the uh
 
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
the the hidden specter of here come the
 
00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
big boys
 
00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
and remember there's ten thousand people
 
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
out there including it's funny i was
 
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
looking the other day
 
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
twenty percent of those people are
 
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
represented by the members of the
 
00:55:21.670 --> 00:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
commerce committee
 
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
so think about those people and think
 
00:55:25.109 --> 00:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
about lowering the prices and a little
 
00:55:26.470 --> 00:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
quick addendum
 
00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
people near the border states mass
 
00:55:30.069 --> 00:55:30.079 align:start position:0%
vermont and maine
 
00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
are going across the border to buy
 
00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
recreational marijuana to
 
00:55:36.309 --> 00:55:36.319 align:start position:0%
satisfy their therapeutic needs which
 
00:55:36.319 --> 00:55:37.589 align:start position:0%
satisfy their therapeutic needs which
undermines

00:55:37.589 --> 00:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
undermines
 
00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
the abilities of the new hampshire atc's
 
00:55:42.069 --> 00:55:42.079 align:start position:0%
to continue servicing our patients
 
00:55:43.589 --> 00:55:43.599 align:start position:0%
and again there was a monopoly issue
 
00:55:45.270 --> 00:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
that somebody mentioned it's funny
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
when i looked at the the way the
 
00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
registrations were handed out
 
00:55:52.069 --> 00:55:52.079 align:start position:0%
they have to set up four distinct uh
 
00:55:54.309 --> 00:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
territories much like utilities if you
 
00:55:56.549 --> 00:55:56.559 align:start position:0%
had a free market therapy
 
00:55:59.750 --> 00:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
therapeutic um cannabis world everybody
 
00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
be down south in manchester or derry i
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
mean derry has
 
00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:05.839 align:start position:0%
230 registered patients in 2019
 
00:56:08.230 --> 00:56:08.240 align:start position:0%
manchester has 518.
 
00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
so what they did is they said we're
 
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
going to allow it to happen but we need
 
00:56:13.349 --> 00:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
to be able to service people in the
 
00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
north country that's why we like playing
 
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
sanctuary is in plymouth and conway
 
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
so it is really uh there's
 
00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
hard to find harm in this bill as i said
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
there's been 20 bills on 19 bills and it
 
00:56:28.309 --> 00:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
made changes in conditions
 
00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:31.280 align:start position:0%
in uh oversight it it's a it's a
 
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
constantly maturing process and we hope
 
00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
that you'll see it that way
 
00:56:39.750 --> 00:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you mr
 
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
mclaughlin for being here to take our
 
00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:43.990 align:start position:0%
mclaughlin for being here to take our
questions

00:56:43.990 --> 00:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
you may not be able to answer this one
 
00:56:46.870 --> 00:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
but it seems that you have an intimate
 
00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
understanding of the bill so i'll try to
 
00:56:50.150 --> 00:56:50.160 align:start position:0%
try to throw it your way
 
00:56:52.230 --> 00:56:52.240 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at section three public
 
00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
health of the bill
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
and parenthetical number four
 
00:56:59.349 --> 00:56:59.359 align:start position:0%
um talks about board of managers as well
 
00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
as board of directors i don't know if
 
00:57:02.789 --> 00:57:02.799 align:start position:0%
that's a structural change
 
00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh to the way things are run i i simply
 
00:57:06.309 --> 00:57:06.319 align:start position:0%
don't understand why that's
 
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
as it is could you clarify that for me
 
00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
please you have a term of
 
00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:12.640 align:start position:0%
art and llc does not have board of
 
00:57:15.030 --> 00:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
directors llc has a managing director
 
00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
and the board of managers
 
00:57:19.030 --> 00:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
so when you see that the some of the
 
00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
much of the language in the bill
 
00:57:22.549 --> 00:57:22.559 align:start position:0%
shows how you would convert to a
 
00:57:23.670 --> 00:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
corporation or
 
00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
how you would convert to an llc so for
 
00:57:28.309 --> 00:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
instance i have an interest in llc
 
00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
i'm a manager if my company was in
 
00:57:33.430 --> 00:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
in quote it was incorporated i'd be on
 
00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
the board of directors so it's just a
 
00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
term of art
 
00:57:39.349 --> 00:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
because the bill shows how you go from a
 
00:57:41.829 --> 00:57:41.839 align:start position:0%
corporation or how you go to an llc
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:47.910 --> 00:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions for mr
 
00:57:51.589 --> 00:57:51.599 align:start position:0%
mclaughlin cnn thank you very much
 
00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
representative edwards i apologize for
 
00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
not calling you before
 
00:57:57.750 --> 00:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
a lobbyist i i missed you and
 
00:57:59.750 --> 00:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
no no sir you didn't you didn't miss me
 
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
i was uh chairing my committee
 
00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
and i just now joined you so i
 
00:58:05.670 --> 00:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate you recognizing me as quickly
 
00:58:06.789 --> 00:58:06.799 align:start position:0%
as you have sir
 
00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:10.480 align:start position:0%
okay perfect okay so uh my two minute
 
00:58:11.829 --> 00:58:11.839 align:start position:0%
testimony on this
 
00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
is that a government does a a few things
 
00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:15.589 align:start position:0%
is that a government does a a few things
well

00:58:15.589 --> 00:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:58:18.069 --> 00:58:18.079 align:start position:0%
it does a lot of things not well one of
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
the things it doesn't do well
 
00:58:23.349 --> 00:58:23.359 align:start position:0%
is it doesn't react to slow
 
00:58:27.109 --> 00:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
environmental change it uh
 
00:58:28.549 --> 00:58:28.559 align:start position:0%
and that is the case with our
 
00:58:30.309 --> 00:58:30.319 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment centers i've been
 
00:58:31.030 --> 00:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
looking at this
 
00:58:34.309 --> 00:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
issue this is now my third term started
 
00:58:36.789 --> 00:58:36.799 align:start position:0%
in hhs where we were hearing policy
 
00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
bills regularly about
 
00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
what kind of therapeutic diagnoses
 
00:58:45.349 --> 00:58:45.359 align:start position:0%
uh were going to be permitted and the
 
00:58:45.359 --> 00:58:46.309 align:start position:0%
uh were going to be permitted and the
like

00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
and one thing that dawned on me pretty
 
00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
quickly is that
 
00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
we are way too involved in their
 
00:58:55.030 --> 00:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
strategic management
 
00:58:58.470 --> 00:58:58.480 align:start position:0%
and and uh and why is that really
 
00:59:00.390 --> 00:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
critical at this juncture well
 
00:59:02.950 --> 00:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
the environment around us as everyone
 
00:59:04.309 --> 00:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
knows changed
 
00:59:07.349 --> 00:59:07.359 align:start position:0%
we have recreational pot in all
 
00:59:07.359 --> 00:59:08.549 align:start position:0%
we have recreational pot in all
directions

00:59:08.549 --> 00:59:08.559 align:start position:0%
directions
 
00:59:12.390 --> 00:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
canada maine massachusetts vermont
 
00:59:15.750 --> 00:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
so there is a new source of legal
 
00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:16.789 align:start position:0%
so there is a new source of legal
regulated

00:59:16.789 --> 00:59:16.799 align:start position:0%
regulated
 
00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
weed that is a competitor to our
 
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment centers
 
00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
and so if we want to
 
00:59:28.309 --> 00:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
allow our alternative treatment centers
 
00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
to survive
 
00:59:33.349 --> 00:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
this new wave of competition uh where
 
00:59:35.670 --> 00:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
people will just go back to
 
00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
the self uh self treatment
 
00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
and uh and forget uh the atc system that
 
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
we've established
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
um then then they they can do that
 
00:59:49.990 --> 00:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
so i would encourage you uh to
 
00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
consider this bill and recognize
 
00:59:55.589 --> 00:59:55.599 align:start position:0%
that a more flexible adaptable
 
00:59:57.430 --> 00:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
management style
 
01:00:00.309 --> 01:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
is essential if these alternative
 
01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
treatments or
 
01:00:02.789 --> 01:00:02.799 align:start position:0%
centers are going to survive if you
 
01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:04.480 align:start position:0%
don't want them to survive don't change
 
01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:05.430 align:start position:0%
don't want them to survive don't change
it

01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
you know if you want them to survive
 
01:00:09.349 --> 01:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
figure out the smart way to give them
 
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
management flexibility that that's what
 
01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
this bill is looking to do and with that
 
01:00:14.950 --> 01:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
surf uh there are questions i'd take
 
01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:16.390 align:start position:0%
surf uh there are questions i'd take
them

01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
great thank you representative herbert
 
01:00:21.589 --> 01:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:29.109 --> 01:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
you're on mute
 
01:00:30.789 --> 01:00:30.799 align:start position:0%
uh i just got finished with all the
 
01:00:33.510 --> 01:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
thank yous but uh
 
01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
the uh um the atc's
 
01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
i i understand your reasoning and i
 
01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:42.640 align:start position:0%
don't disagree with it
 
01:00:46.069 --> 01:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
but what would distinguish after all is
 
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
said and done
 
01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
the atcs from their competitors
 
01:00:53.589 --> 01:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
in other words atc's now exist because
 
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
they have
 
01:00:57.589 --> 01:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
some sort of a quality standard that
 
01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
the recreational suppliers don't have
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
so is it your opinion that
 
01:01:08.470 --> 01:01:08.480 align:start position:0%
the atcs will be able to compete on
 
01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:09.670 align:start position:0%
the atcs will be able to compete on
price

01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
price
 
01:01:13.109 --> 01:01:13.119 align:start position:0%
but still maintain a distinguishing
 
01:01:17.829 --> 01:01:17.839 align:start position:0%
uh advantage in terms of quality
 
01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
so uh representative uh herbert herbert
 
01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
or herbert i
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
i don't know if the age is sorry hey
 
01:01:25.670 --> 01:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
bear herbert i'm fine
 
01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
yeah english up here yeah french and
 
01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
new orleans so so i've not met you and i
 
01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
don't really know your background
 
01:01:35.670 --> 01:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
and so pardon me if the answer is a
 
01:01:37.829 --> 01:01:37.839 align:start position:0%
little longer than it should be because
 
01:01:37.839 --> 01:01:38.069 align:start position:0%
little longer than it should be because
i

01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:01:40.549 --> 01:01:40.559 align:start position:0%
i just don't know where i'm who where
 
01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
i'm coming from on this other than to
 
01:01:42.319 --> 01:01:43.670 align:start position:0%
i'm coming from on this other than to
say

01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
that as a matter of state policy many
 
01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
we made a decision that medical
 
01:01:55.510 --> 01:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis was something that we wanted to
 
01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
make available to new hampshire patients
 
01:02:01.109 --> 01:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
and so we set up a process and a
 
01:02:01.119 --> 01:02:02.309 align:start position:0%
and so we set up a process and a
procedure

01:02:02.309 --> 01:02:02.319 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
where an individual would go to their
 
01:02:09.190 --> 01:02:09.200 align:start position:0%
regular physician and um and then
 
01:02:11.109 --> 01:02:11.119 align:start position:0%
if the physician thought therapeutic
 
01:02:13.589 --> 01:02:13.599 align:start position:0%
cannabis fit within the diagnostic
 
01:02:16.549 --> 01:02:16.559 align:start position:0%
procedures their diagnostic evaluation
 
01:02:16.559 --> 01:02:17.190 align:start position:0%
procedures their diagnostic evaluation
that

01:02:17.190 --> 01:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
of that patient he could or she could
 
01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:20.390 align:start position:0%
of that patient he could or she could
refer

01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
refer
 
01:02:22.470 --> 01:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
over to an alternative treatment center
 
01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
the alternative treatment center
 
01:02:26.789 --> 01:02:26.799 align:start position:0%
would then sit down with that patient
 
01:02:26.799 --> 01:02:27.670 align:start position:0%
would then sit down with that patient
and

01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:31.349 --> 01:02:31.359 align:start position:0%
take a fresh look at the conditions
 
01:02:34.309 --> 01:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
and would counsel that patient on the
 
01:02:34.319 --> 01:02:34.950 align:start position:0%
and would counsel that patient on the
types

01:02:34.950 --> 01:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
types
 
01:02:37.990 --> 01:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
of cannabis that could help them and i
 
01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
think over half of the
 
01:02:42.789 --> 01:02:42.799 align:start position:0%
cannabis medical cannabis prescriptions
 
01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
are not smokable they
 
01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
they they are tinctures and other
 
01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:47.750 align:start position:0%
they they are tinctures and other
edibles

01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
edibles
 
01:02:50.549 --> 01:02:50.559 align:start position:0%
and so uh as you know recreational
 
01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
marijuana maybe you know
 
01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
maybe you don't but recreational
 
01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:55.270 align:start position:0%
maybe you don't but recreational
marijuana

01:02:55.270 --> 01:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
marijuana
 
01:02:58.390 --> 01:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
is really thought of and is dominated by
 
01:02:58.400 --> 01:02:59.750 align:start position:0%
is really thought of and is dominated by
smokables

01:02:59.750 --> 01:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
smokables
 
01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
and so the the the nature of what
 
01:03:05.270 --> 01:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
a patient would consume through an
 
01:03:07.109 --> 01:03:07.119 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment center
 
01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
is likely to be different than if they
 
01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
decided to self-medicate and go to a
 
01:03:13.109 --> 01:03:13.119 align:start position:0%
recreational marijuana
 
01:03:16.309 --> 01:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
store i they may have edibles too they
 
01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
may have
 
01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
tinctures too i i don't know i i haven't
 
01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
been into one of our neighboring
 
01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh uh pot centers but um
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
but so so what we offer
 
01:03:31.589 --> 01:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
with our system is a kind of a medically
 
01:03:35.510 --> 01:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
related patient-centric uh
 
01:03:38.630 --> 01:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh system of care to where
 
01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
they the patients receive palliative
 
01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
treatments suitable for their needs and
 
01:03:47.029 --> 01:03:47.039 align:start position:0%
palliative is distinguished from
 
01:03:50.789 --> 01:03:50.799 align:start position:0%
um something that will solve a treatment
 
01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
it's just palliative just means that
 
01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
it's going to reduce the
 
01:03:56.309 --> 01:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
adver or the symptoms somebody's having
 
01:03:58.230 --> 01:03:58.240 align:start position:0%
of their disease condition
 
01:04:01.510 --> 01:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
so so it's all medically regulated
 
01:04:04.789 --> 01:04:04.799 align:start position:0%
and and and if we if those were to go
 
01:04:04.799 --> 01:04:05.990 align:start position:0%
and and and if we if those were to go
away

01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
away
 
01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
and we and we put people in a situation
 
01:04:11.589 --> 01:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
where they had to self-medicate
 
01:04:14.789 --> 01:04:14.799 align:start position:0%
then they would be less likely to
 
01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
um obtain
 
01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
the the the best cannabis
 
01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
um does insurance play a role here at
 
01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:35.190 align:start position:0%
um does insurance play a role here at
all

01:04:35.190 --> 01:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:04:37.829 --> 01:04:37.839 align:start position:0%
uh in the sense that uh if you're doing
 
01:04:38.789 --> 01:04:38.799 align:start position:0%
uh a medic
 
01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
drug uh that you can
 
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
um have it insured
 
01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
i think that's a great question and i
 
01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:53.200 align:start position:0%
bet you there's actually someone on your
 
01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
committee that would have a better
 
01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:55.510 align:start position:0%
committee that would have a better
answer

01:04:55.510 --> 01:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
answer
 
01:04:57.670 --> 01:04:57.680 align:start position:0%
i looked at it i've been looking at this
 
01:04:58.630 --> 01:04:58.640 align:start position:0%
for years
 
01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
from an hhs policy angle and not an
 
01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
insurance angle
 
01:05:05.829 --> 01:05:05.839 align:start position:0%
but i i i think the answer may be that
 
01:05:05.839 --> 01:05:06.870 align:start position:0%
but i i i think the answer may be that
technically

01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
technically
 
01:05:09.029 --> 01:05:09.039 align:start position:0%
this is not a medical prescription in
 
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
the sense that a
 
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
referring physician has done a
 
01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
prescription and
 
01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
ordered it this is uh
 
01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
made available through medical cannabis
 
01:05:21.270 --> 01:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
counseling and
 
01:05:24.390 --> 01:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe if you had um one of those
 
01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
health care savings accounts maybe
 
01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
it would qualify under that i don't know
 
01:05:30.150 --> 01:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
but i i would defer to the real answer
 
01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:30.549 align:start position:0%
but i i would defer to the real answer
to

01:05:30.549 --> 01:05:30.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:05:37.349 --> 01:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
somebody on your committee thank you
 
01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
you're muted uh chairman mr chairman
 
01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
representative weston
 
01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr chairman and thank you
 
01:05:46.230 --> 01:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
representative edwards for coming here
 
01:05:47.270 --> 01:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
with your um
 
01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
with the information you provided right
 
01:05:51.510 --> 01:05:51.520 align:start position:0%
now we have four of these
 
01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:54.640 align:start position:0%
atc's do you know if all of them are
 
01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
doing enough business that they will be
 
01:05:58.309 --> 01:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
able to continue
 
01:06:01.430 --> 01:06:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh as an as a for-profit
 
01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh facility and do you think that we may
 
01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
actually be seeing
 
01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
more once this change is made
 
01:06:10.069 --> 01:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
those those are great questions and the
 
01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
and the most direct answers
 
01:06:14.950 --> 01:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know uh i i haven't been
 
01:06:19.349 --> 01:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
uh into the uh into the weeds on this
 
01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh but um to an earlier question
 
01:06:25.829 --> 01:06:25.839 align:start position:0%
about you know what would what kind of
 
01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
management changes
 
01:06:30.309 --> 01:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
might take place in a more flexible
 
01:06:30.319 --> 01:06:31.270 align:start position:0%
might take place in a more flexible
model

01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
model
 
01:06:33.270 --> 01:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
well in marketing you know you have the
 
01:06:34.630 --> 01:06:34.640 align:start position:0%
four ps and
 
01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
i'm going to be embarrassed if i can't
 
01:06:38.069 --> 01:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
remember them but they're price
 
01:06:41.829 --> 01:06:41.839 align:start position:0%
packaging product something else but
 
01:06:45.029 --> 01:06:45.039 align:start position:0%
um but so uh we could see
 
01:06:48.150 --> 01:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
the evolution of new service models you
 
01:06:48.789 --> 01:06:48.799 align:start position:0%
know i
 
01:06:51.829 --> 01:06:51.839 align:start position:0%
i've never understood why we
 
01:06:55.029 --> 01:06:55.039 align:start position:0%
wouldn't allow the atcs to have
 
01:06:58.309 --> 01:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
mobile uh dispensaries so that they can
 
01:06:59.589 --> 01:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
go into the northern
 
01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
parts of the country counties that don't
 
01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
have access
 
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
easily and and provide a different level
 
01:07:06.950 --> 01:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
of service
 
01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
and and so that's the kind of thing that
 
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:12.839 align:start position:0%
we could expect to see with more
 
01:07:14.309 --> 01:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
management uh
 
01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
flexibility and i generally believe
 
01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
that that if you allow flexible
 
01:07:21.349 --> 01:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
intelligent management
 
01:07:23.589 --> 01:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
you're going to improve profitability
 
01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
and so i that's not a direct answer to
 
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
your question
 
01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
but but i think this bill would allow us
 
01:07:31.109 --> 01:07:31.119 align:start position:0%
to have a more
 
01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
flexible management style and therefore
 
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
tend to be more profitable and therefore
 
01:07:38.309 --> 01:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
more likely to survive
 
01:07:42.950 --> 01:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you okay uh have no more hands we
 
01:07:43.829 --> 01:07:43.839 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
and we'll let you get back to your
 
01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
committee all right well thank you
 
01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
yes good afternoon chairman and members
 
01:07:58.069 --> 01:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is ted rebholtz
 
01:07:59.589 --> 01:07:59.599 align:start position:0%
i'm the president of the board of
 
01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
directors for tennessee wellness
 
01:08:04.230 --> 01:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
which is one of the alternative
 
01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
treatment centers
 
01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
we currently operate two of the licenses
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire we have a production
 
01:08:12.069 --> 01:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
facility in manchester
 
01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
dispensaries in dover and lebanon and
 
01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
we're happy to say that we'll be
 
01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:20.239 align:start position:0%
soon opening another dispensary in keene
 
01:08:21.829 --> 01:08:21.839 align:start position:0%
we've served new hampshire patients
 
01:08:23.510 --> 01:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
since the beginning having commenced
 
01:08:25.590 --> 01:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
cultivation in manchester in january
 
01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:26.870 align:start position:0%
cultivation in manchester in january
2016

01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
2016
 
01:08:29.110 --> 01:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
and opening our first two dispensaries
 
01:08:31.110 --> 01:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
in may of that year
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
and we not only operate our
 
01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
brick-and-mortar stores we also make
 
01:08:37.269 --> 01:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
all the products that we sell and quite
 
01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
frankly if you look across the economy
 
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
there are not that many companies that
 
01:08:43.269 --> 01:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
are as vertically integrated as we are
 
01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
we are not allowed to ship cannabis
 
01:08:46.950 --> 01:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
products across state lines
 
01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
so as a result we have to replicate our
 
01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
entire supply chain
 
01:08:53.269 --> 01:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
at our manchester facility and those
 
01:08:55.030 --> 01:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
operations are very capital intensive
 
01:08:56.950 --> 01:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
most significantly we invest millions of
 
01:08:59.110 --> 01:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
dollars into growing rooms that are
 
01:09:00.550 --> 01:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
highly sanitary
 
01:09:02.229 --> 01:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
and highly controlled for temperature
 
01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
and humidity to optimize the safety of
 
01:09:07.110 --> 01:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
our products for new hampshire patients
 
01:09:09.189 --> 01:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
all of our products are tested for
 
01:09:11.749 --> 01:09:11.759 align:start position:0%
safety and potency by an independent
 
01:09:14.789 --> 01:09:14.799 align:start position:0%
new hampshire-based lab we support
 
01:09:16.709 --> 01:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
this bill because it will enable us to
 
01:09:18.789 --> 01:09:18.799 align:start position:0%
lower prices and to invest more
 
01:09:21.749 --> 01:09:21.759 align:start position:0%
into education and product development
 
01:09:22.870 --> 01:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
it will not alter
 
01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
any of the regulations that ensure
 
01:09:27.030 --> 01:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
safety for our patients
 
01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:28.799 align:start position:0%
since the original medical cannabis law
 
01:09:31.349 --> 01:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
in 2013 this legislature has on multiple
 
01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
occasions adjusted the program to
 
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
benefit patients
 
01:09:37.189 --> 01:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
and sb 38 presents another opportunity
 
01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
to improve the program
 
01:09:41.349 --> 01:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire patients as mentioned
 
01:09:43.030 --> 01:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
by others today we are required to
 
01:09:44.550 --> 01:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
operate as a nonprofit
 
01:09:46.870 --> 01:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
but we do not get any of the benefits of
 
01:09:48.149 --> 01:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
a non-profit
 
01:09:51.749 --> 01:09:51.759 align:start position:0%
we do not have 501c3 status in fact
 
01:09:53.669 --> 01:09:53.679 align:start position:0%
due to section 280e of the internal
 
01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
revenue code we actually pay a much much
 
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
higher effective income tax rate
 
01:10:01.350 --> 01:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
than other businesses further as also
 
01:10:02.709 --> 01:10:02.719 align:start position:0%
mentioned we are simply not allowed to
 
01:10:04.390 --> 01:10:04.400 align:start position:0%
borrow money from traditional banks
 
01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
our only finance financing option for
 
01:10:08.229 --> 01:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
the past six years
 
01:10:09.590 --> 01:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
has been to borrow from private
 
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
individuals paying upwards of 18 to 20
 
01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
interest that means about a third of our
 
01:10:16.709 --> 01:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
revenue every single month
 
01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
is soaked up by debt service passing
 
01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:10:22.229 --> 01:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
means reducing some of those onerous
 
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
barriers enabling us to lower prices for
 
01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:25.750 align:start position:0%
barriers enabling us to lower prices for
patients

01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
patients
 
01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
and to keep those patients and their
 
01:10:30.070 --> 01:10:30.080 align:start position:0%
money in new hampshire
 
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
currently there's an aggressive and
 
01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
targeted marketing campaign
 
01:10:35.669 --> 01:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
by dispensaries in maine and those
 
01:10:37.189 --> 01:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
caregivers are trying to entice new
 
01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire patients to purchase cannabis
 
01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:39.910 align:start position:0%
hampshire patients to purchase cannabis
there

01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:10:42.229 --> 01:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
instead of from one of the designated
 
01:10:43.590 --> 01:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment centers here in
 
01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
there are regular persistent print and
 
01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
radio advertisements especially in the
 
01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
dover community
 
01:10:52.229 --> 01:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
telling them that maine is the best
 
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
place for them to get affordable
 
01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.030 align:start position:0%
place for them to get affordable
cannabis

01:10:55.030 --> 01:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
01:10:56.709 --> 01:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
boasting that they are merely 20 minutes
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
away from downtown dover
 
01:11:00.709 --> 01:11:00.719 align:start position:0%
and even offering to help them get a
 
01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
card if they don't already have one
 
01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
we've even had new hampshire patients
 
01:11:07.189 --> 01:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
reporting that they received a discount
 
01:11:09.669 --> 01:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
at the time of their purchase in maine
 
01:11:09.679 --> 01:11:10.550 align:start position:0%
at the time of their purchase in maine
because

01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:11:13.590 --> 01:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
they're new hampshire patient so today
 
01:11:15.430 --> 01:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
operators in maine and massachusetts are
 
01:11:17.590 --> 01:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
both able to undercut our pricing
 
01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
primarily due to this difference in
 
01:11:21.030 --> 01:11:21.040 align:start position:0%
structure neither of those other states
 
01:11:23.189 --> 01:11:23.199 align:start position:0%
requires cannabis businesses
 
01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
to be non-profit massachusetts did
 
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
originally but
 
01:11:30.070 --> 01:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
interestingly they have since eliminated
 
01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh that requirement so today we have
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
patients reporting to us daily that
 
01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
they're purchasing product in maine and
 
01:11:37.669 --> 01:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
massachusetts solely
 
01:11:39.590 --> 01:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
due to the lower prices we actually
 
01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
conducted a survey of our patients
 
01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
and one in three reported purchasing
 
01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis out of state
 
01:11:48.149 --> 01:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
and over 50 percent uh report that price
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
is the reason
 
01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
they don't like this patients don't like
 
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
crossing state lines with cannabis
 
01:11:54.470 --> 01:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
product it's actually a violation of
 
01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
01:11:56.550 --> 01:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
they also don't like spending their
 
01:11:58.149 --> 01:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
money out of their home state of new
 
01:11:58.159 --> 01:11:59.669 align:start position:0%
money out of their home state of new
hampshire

01:11:59.669 --> 01:11:59.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
they don't like having to question
 
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
whether the product they purchase in
 
01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
maine has been tested
 
01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
as it is here in new hampshire they also
 
01:12:08.550 --> 01:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
don't like the lack of education
 
01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
of the operators in the other states
 
01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
don't take it seriously but at the end
 
01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
of the day the bottom line is that
 
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
patients in new hampshire
 
01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
are always concerned about affordability
 
01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
and they're going to go
 
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
where they can actually afford it so
 
01:12:22.709 --> 01:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
we're very grateful that the legislature
 
01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
has made multiple improvements to the
 
01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
original 2013 law
 
01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
changing the corporate structure but not
 
01:12:31.030 --> 01:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
changing any of the regulatory
 
01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:32.229 align:start position:0%
changing any of the regulatory
requirements

01:12:32.229 --> 01:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
01:12:34.390 --> 01:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
is just one more of the changes that
 
01:12:35.669 --> 01:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
needs to be made
 
01:12:37.510 --> 01:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
to provide better access and
 
01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:39.030 align:start position:0%
to provide better access and
affordability

01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
affordability
 
01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
we pride ourselves on providing quality
 
01:12:42.550 --> 01:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis for our patients and we
 
01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
encourage you to pass this bill it is a
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
very modest change
 
01:12:48.550 --> 01:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
that will allow us to lower prices for
 
01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
patients again
 
01:12:52.149 --> 01:12:52.159 align:start position:0%
while still maintaining the strict
 
01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
regulations that will continue to ensure
 
01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
patient health and safety
 
01:12:58.950 --> 01:12:58.960 align:start position:0%

01:13:33.669 --> 01:13:33.679 align:start position:0%
medicinal
 
01:13:37.350 --> 01:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
um product uh which i it sounds to me
 
01:13:38.470 --> 01:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
like a prescription
 
01:13:41.590 --> 01:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
uh actually and uh and how that would
 
01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:42.070 align:start position:0%
uh actually and uh and how that would
work

01:13:42.070 --> 01:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:13:45.990 --> 01:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
and and number two uh you have
 
01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
vertically integrated your distribution
 
01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:49.350 align:start position:0%
vertically integrated your distribution
system

01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:49.360 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:13:53.669 --> 01:13:53.679 align:start position:0%
um which is expensive i'm sure
 
01:13:57.270 --> 01:13:57.280 align:start position:0%
uh and uh with your various clinics
 
01:14:00.709 --> 01:14:00.719 align:start position:0%
but it sounds to me as though
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
i who regulates you in terms of uh
 
01:14:07.030 --> 01:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh your product quality i mean
 
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
the liquor commission for example uh
 
01:14:11.350 --> 01:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
enforces liquor laws
 
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
right and and we have our own stores and
 
01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:14.390 align:start position:0%
right and and we have our own stores and
there's

01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
good reason for that but uh
 
01:14:19.830 --> 01:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
if you were going to compete and you get
 
01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
to drop your price
 
01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
which is i think necessary i
 
01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not disagreeing with this this
 
01:14:28.709 --> 01:14:28.719 align:start position:0%
legislation by the way
 
01:14:31.750 --> 01:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh would it be
 
01:14:35.189 --> 01:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
out of the a question that you would uh
 
01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
could distribute through say the liquor
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
stores i mean i'm
 
01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
i'm just throw that out there because
 
01:14:42.630 --> 01:14:42.640 align:start position:0%
there's they're already there
 
01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
and uh if somebody has a a card
 
01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
and a prescription can go in and buy uh
 
01:14:50.310 --> 01:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
your product
 
01:14:52.870 --> 01:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
um and maybe that's not a good idea all
 
01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
right because i'm
 
01:14:57.030 --> 01:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
i mean i i no longer i don't smoke weed
 
01:14:59.189 --> 01:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
anymore i think i started in 67
 
01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
but i quit okay chris let's get to a
 
01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
question my question is
 
01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
two what what role if any does insurance
 
01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:07.189 align:start position:0%
two what what role if any does insurance
play

01:15:07.189 --> 01:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
play
 
01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
and and and the second question is
 
01:15:13.590 --> 01:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
would you think or consider uh
 
01:15:14.709 --> 01:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
distributing through
 
01:15:17.910 --> 01:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
a liquor commission that's not your
 
01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
representative herbert so in the answer
 
01:15:20.310 --> 01:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
the first question
 
01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
no there is no reimbursement
 
01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
by health care insurers and that really
 
01:15:27.910 --> 01:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
accentuates the point here
 
01:15:29.830 --> 01:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
because new hampshire patients new
 
01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire constituents
 
01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
that price differential is that much
 
01:15:35.910 --> 01:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
more acute if they get a bona fide
 
01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:36.950 align:start position:0%
more acute if they get a bona fide
prescription

01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
prescription
 
01:15:39.669 --> 01:15:39.679 align:start position:0%
for lipitor for example their
 
01:15:41.830 --> 01:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
out-of-pocket spend is going to be
 
01:15:43.990 --> 01:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
close to or at zero because of the
 
01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
healthcare reimbursement
 
01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
none of that is applicable here in the
 
01:15:48.790 --> 01:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
case of medical cannabis
 
01:15:51.030 --> 01:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
so not only are the prices to new
 
01:15:52.709 --> 01:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire patients higher than in other
 
01:15:52.719 --> 01:15:53.510 align:start position:0%
hampshire patients higher than in other
states

01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
there's no offsetting amounts from
 
01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
health care insurance providers
 
01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
to your second question um of course we
 
01:16:02.149 --> 01:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
would not do that today because it's not
 
01:16:02.159 --> 01:16:03.910 align:start position:0%
would not do that today because it's not
allowable

01:16:03.910 --> 01:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
allowable
 
01:16:06.390 --> 01:16:06.400 align:start position:0%
but our point of view is we want to
 
01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
maximize access
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
for patients for those that have gone to
 
01:16:11.270 --> 01:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
a provider
 
01:16:13.910 --> 01:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
and in consultation with their provider
 
01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
determined that medical cannabis is a
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
good alternative for them
 
01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
we want to make it as easy as possible
 
01:16:22.390 --> 01:16:22.400 align:start position:0%
for them to access their therapeutic
 
01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:23.430 align:start position:0%
for them to access their therapeutic
cannabis

01:16:23.430 --> 01:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
um but again until there's a change in
 
01:16:27.110 --> 01:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
the law allowing us to
 
01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
sell our products at any locations other
 
01:16:30.550 --> 01:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
than our own atcs
 
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
we will not be doing so
 
01:16:37.830 --> 01:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
okay representative abel
 
01:16:39.830 --> 01:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
yes thank you well thank you very much
 
01:16:41.189 --> 01:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
for for testing
 
01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
testifying um i really have two
 
01:16:45.990 --> 01:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
questions so if i'll need to i may have
 
01:16:48.229 --> 01:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
to ask them twice but
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
the first one deals with
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
what would happen if if this
 
01:16:58.630 --> 01:16:58.640 align:start position:0%
bill did not go forward
 
01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
and that's really the survivability
 
01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:02.630 align:start position:0%
and that's really the survivability
question

01:17:02.630 --> 01:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:17:05.669 --> 01:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
uh with
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
lower price competition across state
 
01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:09.110 align:start position:0%
lower price competition across state
across

01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
across
 
01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
from other states and uh your
 
01:17:16.630 --> 01:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
uh your difficulty in getting financing
 
01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
and so forth
 
01:17:22.630 --> 01:17:22.640 align:start position:0%
is there a possibility that uh
 
01:17:26.070 --> 01:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
some of the providers now would
 
01:17:28.229 --> 01:17:28.239 align:start position:0%
would end up going out of business is
 
01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
that is that possible
 
01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
i think it is unlikely um this is a
 
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
business i mean
 
01:17:39.189 --> 01:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
you have it's it's tough to tell because
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
you have offsetting factors
 
01:17:43.189 --> 01:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
right uh on the plus side in new
 
01:17:43.199 --> 01:17:44.070 align:start position:0%
right uh on the plus side in new
hampshire

01:17:44.070 --> 01:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
you have a growing awareness of
 
01:17:47.910 --> 01:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis
 
01:17:50.950 --> 01:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
as a potential alternative for patients
 
01:17:53.430 --> 01:17:53.440 align:start position:0%
and as we've seen the number of patients
 
01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
registered in the program
 
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
has continued to grow year over year
 
01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:58.470 align:start position:0%
has continued to grow year over year
however

01:17:58.470 --> 01:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
even if you have new patients enrolled
 
01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
in the program
 
01:18:04.709 --> 01:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
it's it's not necessarily the case that
 
01:18:05.990 --> 01:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
all of them are purchasing in new
 
01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.270 align:start position:0%
all of them are purchasing in new
hampshire

01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:18:08.790 --> 01:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
and as is the case with a lot of our
 
01:18:11.189 --> 01:18:11.199 align:start position:0%
patients they purchase in maine
 
01:18:13.510 --> 01:18:13.520 align:start position:0%
but they still come to us so they might
 
01:18:15.110 --> 01:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
buy 90
 
01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
of their product needs in maine at the
 
01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
lower price
 
01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
they still come to us for that other 10
 
01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
percent because they're getting 90
 
01:18:25.110 --> 01:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
of the good education they're getting 90
 
01:18:26.709 --> 01:18:26.719 align:start position:0%
of the good advice
 
01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
from a strictly regulated therapeutic
 
01:18:31.189 --> 01:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
cannabis program that we have here
 
01:18:33.189 --> 01:18:33.199 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire so i think we're going
 
01:18:34.229 --> 01:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
to continue to see
 
01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
the the new hampshire program um
 
01:18:38.470 --> 01:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
basically just trudge along
 
01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
so i'm not concerned about the
 
01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:42.070 align:start position:0%
so i'm not concerned about the
survivability

01:18:42.070 --> 01:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
survivability
 
01:18:45.030 --> 01:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
but i am concerned about our ability to
 
01:18:46.390 --> 01:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
continue to innovate
 
01:18:49.030 --> 01:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
continue to serve patients and to reduce
 
01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:50.149 align:start position:0%
continue to serve patients and to reduce
prices

01:18:50.149 --> 01:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
prices
 
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
right now the prices that we're able to
 
01:18:54.709 --> 01:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
offer are artificially inflated
 
01:18:56.310 --> 01:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
because of this restriction on our
 
01:18:59.590 --> 01:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:03.189 --> 01:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you may i
 
01:19:06.390 --> 01:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
ask one further question i'm sorry okay
 
01:19:08.550 --> 01:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
thank you uh well the the second
 
01:19:09.669 --> 01:19:09.679 align:start position:0%
question was price
 
01:19:12.870 --> 01:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
and i i can certainly see uh the reason
 
01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh the uh rationale for believing
 
01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
that you could lower prices if if your
 
01:19:20.390 --> 01:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
cost of doing business were lower
 
01:19:23.590 --> 01:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
but that also becomes a matter of uh
 
01:19:26.630 --> 01:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
our taking it on faith uh is that are
 
01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:27.430 align:start position:0%
our taking it on faith uh is that are
there

01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
any other states where something
 
01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
comparable to this
 
01:19:34.149 --> 01:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
has happened where non-profit
 
01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
nonprofit providers have been have been
 
01:19:38.550 --> 01:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
able to become
 
01:19:43.030 --> 01:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh for-profits and that there has been a
 
01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
reduction in price or do we just take it
 
01:19:46.470 --> 01:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
on faith
 
01:19:50.229 --> 01:19:50.239 align:start position:0%
that that would happen so
 
01:19:53.350 --> 01:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
massachusetts is is a good example of
 
01:19:54.870 --> 01:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
a state that like new hampshire
 
01:19:56.550 --> 01:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
originally required
 
01:19:59.590 --> 01:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
licensees to be non-profits however they
 
01:20:00.310 --> 01:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
made the machi
 
01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
they made the change so long ago it was
 
01:20:04.709 --> 01:20:04.719 align:start position:0%
so early in the development of their
 
01:20:05.910 --> 01:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
marketplace that i
 
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
i don't really think it's it's
 
01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
comparable um
 
01:20:10.870 --> 01:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
and i don't i'm not aware of anybody
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
that's looked at the potential price
 
01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
impacts uh of that statutory change
 
01:20:19.110 --> 01:20:19.120 align:start position:0%
what i can say from an operator's point
 
01:20:20.310 --> 01:20:20.320 align:start position:0%
of view
 
01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
who wants to be successful in the new
 
01:20:23.280 --> 01:20:23.910 align:start position:0%
who wants to be successful in the new
hampshire

01:20:23.910 --> 01:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program there's a
 
01:20:29.189 --> 01:20:29.199 align:start position:0%
lot of demand for cannabis
 
01:20:31.590 --> 01:20:31.600 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of demand it's growing
 
01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
and awareness is growing
 
01:20:35.350 --> 01:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
but people are going to look for the
 
01:20:36.870 --> 01:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
easiest way
 
01:20:39.750 --> 01:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
to fulfill those needs and increasingly
 
01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
they're recognizing that driving an
 
01:20:44.070 --> 01:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
extra 20 minutes an extra 30 minutes
 
01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
to cross one of the state lines and as
 
01:20:47.430 --> 01:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
we know you know wherever you are in new
 
01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire you're not too far away from a
 
01:20:50.310 --> 01:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
state line
 
01:20:52.790 --> 01:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
you can get over uh and avail yourselves
 
01:20:55.030 --> 01:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
uh of much lower prices
 
01:20:57.350 --> 01:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
so from my point of view it's a business
 
01:20:57.360 --> 01:20:58.229 align:start position:0%
so from my point of view it's a business
imperative

01:20:58.229 --> 01:20:58.239 align:start position:0%
imperative
 
01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
to meet consumers where they are and
 
01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:02.719 align:start position:0%
right now where they are is
 
01:21:04.470 --> 01:21:04.480 align:start position:0%
traveling out of state to avail
 
01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
themselves of lower prices
 
01:21:08.390 --> 01:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
so if i want to compete if i want us to
 
01:21:10.070 --> 01:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
be able to continue to innovate and
 
01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
serve new hampshire patients
 
01:21:13.350 --> 01:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
and hopefully a growing number of new
 
01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire patients i have no option
 
01:21:20.790 --> 01:21:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions
 
01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
um i i have one other question um your
 
01:21:30.149 --> 01:21:30.159 align:start position:0%
the company did your your work work for
 
01:21:32.229 --> 01:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
what is it called
 
01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
tennessee wellness chemist called
 
01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:35.590 align:start position:0%
tennessee wellness chemist called
wellness

01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
wellness
 
01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
are you in other states we are we're in
 
01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:40.639 align:start position:0%
massachusetts as well
 
01:21:43.430 --> 01:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
just just massachusetts uh we were
 
01:21:44.870 --> 01:21:44.880 align:start position:0%
formerly in maryland
 
01:21:47.590 --> 01:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
and we're no longer operating there oh
 
01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:48.550 align:start position:0%
and we're no longer operating there oh
okay

01:21:48.550 --> 01:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:21:52.709 --> 01:21:52.719 align:start position:0%
um and so uh in massachusetts are you
 
01:21:55.750 --> 01:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
operating as a do you sell it to the
 
01:21:57.030 --> 01:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
general public because
 
01:21:59.270 --> 01:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
massachusetts marijuana is legal so are
 
01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:00.719 align:start position:0%
you selling to the general public in
 
01:22:00.719 --> 01:22:01.990 align:start position:0%
you selling to the general public in
massachusetts

01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
01:22:04.390 --> 01:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
yes we serve both medical patients as
 
01:22:06.629 --> 01:22:06.639 align:start position:0%
well as recreational adult use customers
 
01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
right so in that case you don't need a a
 
01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:10.310 align:start position:0%
right so in that case you don't need a a
card

01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
card
 
01:22:13.669 --> 01:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
to get marijuana that's correct you need
 
01:22:15.350 --> 01:22:15.360 align:start position:0%
government issue photo id to prove that
 
01:22:16.149 --> 01:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
you're of
 
01:22:18.149 --> 01:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
of age but you don't need a
 
01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
certification from a health care
 
01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:20.149 align:start position:0%
certification from a health care
provider

01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
provider
 
01:22:24.229 --> 01:22:24.239 align:start position:0%
okay great great thank you very much um

you have to oh sorry about that yep no
 
01:22:54.709 --> 01:22:54.719 align:start position:0%
problem technology is not my friend
 
01:22:54.719 --> 01:22:56.950 align:start position:0%
problem technology is not my friend
sometimes

01:22:56.950 --> 01:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
01:23:00.310 --> 01:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
um my name is heather marie brown and i
 
01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
am a certified cannabis patient
 
01:23:07.830 --> 01:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
within the state of new hampshire
 
01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the work that you guys have
 
01:23:11.189 --> 01:23:11.199 align:start position:0%
put into this
 
01:23:14.229 --> 01:23:14.239 align:start position:0%
but i am speaking in opposition
 
01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
of this bill i do not feel that our
 
01:23:19.510 --> 01:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
dispensaries should be allowed
 
01:23:23.590 --> 01:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
to go from non-profit to profit bearing
 
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
and the reason behind that is and the
 
01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
gentleman that spoke to
 
01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
before he had a lot of wonderful
 
01:23:31.030 --> 01:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
information but it was a little
 
01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:32.830 align:start position:0%
information but it was a little
one-sided

01:23:32.830 --> 01:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
one-sided
 
01:23:36.229 --> 01:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
um i believe that if you do this
 
01:23:39.990 --> 01:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
then you open up the opportunity of
 
01:23:42.629 --> 01:23:42.639 align:start position:0%
what we call in the cannabis world big
 
01:23:42.639 --> 01:23:43.350 align:start position:0%
what we call in the cannabis world big
canna

01:23:43.350 --> 01:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
canna
 
01:23:46.229 --> 01:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
coming into new hampshire and getting
 
01:23:47.189 --> 01:23:47.199 align:start position:0%
their fingers
 
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:54.229 --> 01:23:54.239 align:start position:0%
i have seen in other states
 
01:23:57.750 --> 01:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
where non-profits have
 
01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
started selling in a profit-sharing way
 
01:24:04.470 --> 01:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
because of recreation becoming legal or
 
01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:05.030 align:start position:0%
because of recreation becoming legal or
whatever

01:24:05.030 --> 01:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:24:07.189 --> 01:24:07.199 align:start position:0%
and then watching their medical programs
 
01:24:07.199 --> 01:24:08.149 align:start position:0%
and then watching their medical programs
slowly

01:24:08.149 --> 01:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
slowly
 
01:24:08.159 --> 01:24:11.590 align:start position:0%
slowly
dissolve

01:24:11.590 --> 01:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:14.629 --> 01:24:14.639 align:start position:0%
i don't think that that's what we need
 
01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:24:17.669 --> 01:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
i think that if dispensaries are
 
01:24:17.679 --> 01:24:18.870 align:start position:0%
i think that if dispensaries are
concerned

01:24:18.870 --> 01:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
01:24:22.070 --> 01:24:22.080 align:start position:0%
with being able to lower their pricing
 
01:24:24.629 --> 01:24:24.639 align:start position:0%
for the consumer which by all rights
 
01:24:26.709 --> 01:24:26.719 align:start position:0%
they should be because i can
 
01:24:29.510 --> 01:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
tell you that new hampshire dispensaries
 
01:24:32.390 --> 01:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
are not my first choice of preference
 
01:24:34.709 --> 01:24:34.719 align:start position:0%
when i need to get my meds because of
 
01:24:37.590 --> 01:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
the limited income that i have
 
01:24:40.550 --> 01:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
i think that if dispensaries want to be
 
01:24:42.149 --> 01:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
able to reduce
 
01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
their costs enough to be able to pass
 
01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
that savings on to the consumer
 
01:24:49.669 --> 01:24:49.679 align:start position:0%
then we need to look at the program at
 
01:24:50.709 --> 01:24:50.719 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
level we need to pick apart the program
 
01:24:57.510 --> 01:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
and look at all of the areas and the
 
01:24:57.520 --> 01:24:58.470 align:start position:0%
and look at all of the areas and the
restrictions

01:24:58.470 --> 01:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
restrictions
 
01:25:01.110 --> 01:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
and the requirements that the state has
 
01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
put on
 
01:25:04.709 --> 01:25:04.719 align:start position:0%
the dispensaries as far as operating
 
01:25:04.719 --> 01:25:05.669 align:start position:0%
the dispensaries as far as operating
goes

01:25:05.669 --> 01:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
goes
 
01:25:08.950 --> 01:25:08.960 align:start position:0%
which places a huge increase
 
01:25:11.910 --> 01:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
in the costs and their expenses which
 
01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:12.550 align:start position:0%
in the costs and their expenses which
therefore

01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
01:25:15.669 --> 01:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
they have to pass that cost
 
01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
and that increase on to the consumer
 
01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
even just to be able to break even to
 
01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
continue forward
 
01:25:25.990 --> 01:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
we already do have a problem
 
01:25:29.430 --> 01:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
with our dispensaries as far as growing
 
01:25:30.950 --> 01:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
for quantity
 
01:25:34.070 --> 01:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
versus quality and i don't necessarily
 
01:25:36.149 --> 01:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
mean that in a harsh negative or
 
01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
insulting way
 
01:25:39.590 --> 01:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying that yes there is a
 
01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:40.550 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying that yes there is a
demand

01:25:40.550 --> 01:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
demand
 
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
on our dispensaries in the state i i
 
01:25:46.950 --> 01:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
i'm saying that in order for these
 
01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:48.390 align:start position:0%
i'm saying that in order for these
dispensaries

01:25:48.390 --> 01:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
dispensaries
 
01:25:52.229 --> 01:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
to meet this demand they have to grow
 
01:25:54.790 --> 01:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
more and keep up on their quantity and
 
01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:55.990 align:start position:0%
more and keep up on their quantity and
sometimes

01:25:55.990 --> 01:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
quality can lessen because of it
 
01:26:02.950 --> 01:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
if they want to be able to save money
 
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
then the state needs to take a look at
 
01:26:08.149 --> 01:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
how they are treating these dispensaries
 
01:26:09.430 --> 01:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
and the requirements and the
 
01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
restrictions that they are putting on
 
01:26:12.629 --> 01:26:12.639 align:start position:0%
these dispensaries
 
01:26:15.430 --> 01:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
that's where it needs to start we all
 
01:26:17.350 --> 01:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
know that at some point in time in new
 
01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:18.510 align:start position:0%
know that at some point in time in new
hampshire

01:26:18.510 --> 01:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:26:21.110 --> 01:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
recreational cannabis will be made
 
01:26:22.950 --> 01:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
available to the public
 
01:26:25.350 --> 01:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
it's not a question about when it's
 
01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:25.990 align:start position:0%
it's not a question about when it's
coming

01:26:25.990 --> 01:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
coming
 
01:26:28.709 --> 01:26:28.719 align:start position:0%
it we know it's coming you know it could
 
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
be tomorrow it could be in two years
 
01:26:34.149 --> 01:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
it's still coming if those dispensaries
 
01:26:36.550 --> 01:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
are allowed to go from non-profit to
 
01:26:37.830 --> 01:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
profit bearing
 
01:26:40.709 --> 01:26:40.719 align:start position:0%
then who's to say when legalization
 
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
finally hits
 
01:26:44.149 --> 01:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that they're going to be
 
01:26:45.270 --> 01:26:45.280 align:start position:0%
able to
 
01:26:49.669 --> 01:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
a be able to produce enough cannabis
 
01:26:52.790 --> 01:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
to supply both the medicinal and the
 
01:26:56.070 --> 01:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
recreational market and b keep up with
 
01:26:58.950 --> 01:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
the quality that's in place
 
01:27:02.550 --> 01:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
you know we all want the cannabis to be
 
01:27:04.950 --> 01:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
lowered in new hampshire but
 
01:27:07.189 --> 01:27:07.199 align:start position:0%
the majority of patients will tell you
 
01:27:09.189 --> 01:27:09.199 align:start position:0%
they want the cannabis to
 
01:27:11.669 --> 01:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
they want this to be new hampshire
 
01:27:11.679 --> 01:27:12.229 align:start position:0%
they want this to be new hampshire
cannabis

01:27:12.229 --> 01:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:14.639 align:start position:0%
they do not want out of state interests
 
01:27:15.910 --> 01:27:15.920 align:start position:0%
to be able
 
01:27:18.629 --> 01:27:18.639 align:start position:0%
to come into new hampshire and work with
 
01:27:19.830 --> 01:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
our dispensaries
 
01:27:23.350 --> 01:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
if they change to non and if they change
 
01:27:25.910 --> 01:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
from non-profit to profit status
 
01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
um i think that that's a huge thing
 
01:27:30.950 --> 01:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
we've already seen problems come from
 
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
big pharma
 
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
getting into new hampshire why would we
 
01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
want the same thing to happen with
 
01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:37.030 align:start position:0%
want the same thing to happen with
cannabis

01:27:37.030 --> 01:27:37.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
you know we as a state we have so much
 
01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:42.719 align:start position:0%
pride in being the first in the nation
 
01:27:44.470 --> 01:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
for this and the first in the nation for
 
01:27:46.629 --> 01:27:46.639 align:start position:0%
that well how about we be a first in the
 
01:27:48.629 --> 01:27:48.639 align:start position:0%
nation as far as cannabis goes
 
01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
as well and keep it locked down
 
01:27:55.830 --> 01:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
so that this is a a new hampshire
 
01:27:59.590 --> 01:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
available product controlled by
 
01:28:02.629 --> 01:28:02.639 align:start position:0%
new hampshire interests you know why not
 
01:28:04.470 --> 01:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
take a look at the state level to be
 
01:28:05.590 --> 01:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
able to re
 
01:28:08.390 --> 01:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
reduce the costs the requirements and
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
the restrictions
 
01:28:11.990 --> 01:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
that are put on these dispensaries so
 
01:28:13.590 --> 01:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
that they can take
 
01:28:16.709 --> 01:28:16.719 align:start position:0%
and pass those savings on to the
 
01:28:18.870 --> 01:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
the community to the patients that they
 
01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:20.639 align:start position:0%
serve and represent
 
01:28:23.350 --> 01:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
you know i support my dispa all four of
 
01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
these dispensaries i actually
 
01:28:28.790 --> 01:28:28.800 align:start position:0%
am a um i am the patient representative
 
01:28:31.510 --> 01:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
on the new hampshire therapeutic
 
01:28:33.830 --> 01:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis medical oversight board
 
01:28:36.229 --> 01:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
and this is something i'm constantly
 
01:28:38.229 --> 01:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
saying at our meetings you know
 
01:28:40.149 --> 01:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
if we're going to do something to fix
 
01:28:42.149 --> 01:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
the medical program then we need to take
 
01:28:43.990 --> 01:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
a look at what's going on at the state
 
01:28:45.189 --> 01:28:45.199 align:start position:0%
level first
 
01:28:47.830 --> 01:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
before we continue passing some of these
 
01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:48.310 align:start position:0%
before we continue passing some of these
bills

01:28:48.310 --> 01:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
bills
 
01:28:51.030 --> 01:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
that could potentially put new hampshire
 
01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:52.229 align:start position:0%
that could potentially put new hampshire
cannabis

01:28:52.229 --> 01:28:52.239 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
at threat for the future
 
01:28:56.629 --> 01:28:56.639 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much for your
 
01:28:58.470 --> 01:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
testimony um we do have a couple of
 
01:28:59.830 --> 01:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
questions if you're willing to entertain
 
01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:00.470 align:start position:0%
questions if you're willing to entertain
them

01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:29:02.629 --> 01:29:02.639 align:start position:0%
i most certainly am representative
 
01:29:04.390 --> 01:29:04.400 align:start position:0%
burroughs you may go ahead
 
01:29:06.550 --> 01:29:06.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
01:29:08.070 --> 01:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
which is that there's been a lot of
 
01:29:10.310 --> 01:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
testimony today that
 
01:29:13.270 --> 01:29:13.280 align:start position:0%
stated that um if the if the business if
 
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
this business could be grown
 
01:29:16.790 --> 01:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
and the revenue could be grown that the
 
01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
prices would would go down for consumers
 
01:29:22.070 --> 01:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
so my question is do who do you think
 
01:29:23.110 --> 01:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
would be better
 
01:29:26.310 --> 01:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
um has more ability to
 
01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:28.639 align:start position:0%
to work in the what am i trying to say
 
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
do you think that an
 
01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurial company would be better
 
01:29:34.070 --> 01:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
suited to grow that revenue and to grow
 
01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
the company
 
01:29:37.430 --> 01:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
than would a non-profit that that is not
 
01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:38.229 align:start position:0%
than would a non-profit that that is not
focused

01:29:38.229 --> 01:29:38.239 align:start position:0%
focused
 
01:29:40.229 --> 01:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
is normally not focused on business
 
01:29:40.239 --> 01:29:42.790 align:start position:0%
is normally not focused on business
activities

01:29:42.790 --> 01:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
activities
 
01:29:46.709 --> 01:29:46.719 align:start position:0%
i personally believe that
 
01:29:50.149 --> 01:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
like i said if i i think that the
 
01:29:52.149 --> 01:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
restrictions and requirements at the
 
01:29:53.189 --> 01:29:53.199 align:start position:0%
state level
 
01:29:55.910 --> 01:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
will play a major impact in this
 
01:29:55.920 --> 01:29:57.030 align:start position:0%
will play a major impact in this
regardless

01:29:57.030 --> 01:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
regardless
 
01:30:00.550 --> 01:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
of where or how
 
01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
the company chooses to proceed whether
 
01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:03.750 align:start position:0%
the company chooses to proceed whether
they're

01:30:03.750 --> 01:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:30:05.510 --> 01:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
non-profit they're still going to be
 
01:30:07.430 --> 01:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
held to those restrictions
 
01:30:10.870 --> 01:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
if they turn to a for-profit i mean at
 
01:30:13.750 --> 01:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
that point in time growing revenue is
 
01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:14.550 align:start position:0%
that point in time growing revenue is
important

01:30:14.550 --> 01:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:30:17.430 --> 01:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
yes but the restrictions won't
 
01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:18.550 align:start position:0%
yes but the restrictions won't
necessarily

01:30:18.550 --> 01:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
be put into place that are in place
 
01:30:24.790 --> 01:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
as far as it being a non-profit run
 
01:30:28.310 --> 01:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
organization and therefore i do foresee
 
01:30:30.310 --> 01:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
yes there may be extra revenue and
 
01:30:32.390 --> 01:30:32.400 align:start position:0%
savings that could be passed on
 
01:30:35.510 --> 01:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
but i also foresee a problem
 
01:30:38.550 --> 01:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
continuing on the downhill slide
 
01:30:42.149 --> 01:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
as far as quantity and quality goes
 
01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
which in that case would still continue
 
01:30:45.750 --> 01:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
to push
 
01:30:48.870 --> 01:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents to seek
 
01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
ulterior sources for
 
01:30:55.110 --> 01:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
their cannabis because at the end of the
 
01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:55.590 align:start position:0%
their cannabis because at the end of the
day

01:30:55.590 --> 01:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
day
 
01:30:57.750 --> 01:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
it's the quality of the cannabis that
 
01:30:59.590 --> 01:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
actually lends in
 
01:31:02.709 --> 01:31:02.719 align:start position:0%
to the medicinal treatment that i
 
01:31:05.350 --> 01:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
that myself and the other 9 000 and some
 
01:31:06.709 --> 01:31:06.719 align:start position:0%
odd patients in the state of new
 
01:31:09.110 --> 01:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire are looking for
 
01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
thank you okay representative bartlett
 
01:31:16.709 --> 01:31:16.719 align:start position:0%
thanks very much mr chair um so

thank you for coming before our
 
01:31:23.590 --> 01:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
committee and and giving us your view
 
01:31:26.149 --> 01:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
so you purchase your marijuana out of
 
01:31:26.159 --> 01:31:26.870 align:start position:0%
so you purchase your marijuana out of
state

01:31:26.870 --> 01:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:31:29.350 --> 01:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
you're on the oversight board but you
 
01:31:31.830 --> 01:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
still don't want the free market
 
01:31:35.110 --> 01:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
to control the pricing is that correct
 
01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
i do not want out of state interest to
 
01:31:39.910 --> 01:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
be able to get into new hampshire
 
01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:40.870 align:start position:0%
be able to get into new hampshire
cannabis

01:31:40.870 --> 01:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
01:31:44.870 --> 01:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
i have seen many of these companies
 
01:31:48.470 --> 01:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
go into other states and the cannabis
 
01:31:50.310 --> 01:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
programs have been
 
01:31:53.590 --> 01:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
almost obliviated like currently in
 
01:31:55.590 --> 01:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
massachusetts in order to
 
01:31:58.629 --> 01:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
purchase a eighth of cannabis
 
01:32:01.510 --> 01:32:01.520 align:start position:0%
you're you're looking at approximately
 
01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:02.229 align:start position:0%
you're you're looking at approximately
between

01:32:02.229 --> 01:32:02.239 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
70 and 85 dollars
 
01:32:07.669 --> 01:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
for an eighth of cannabis now up here in
 
01:32:09.189 --> 01:32:09.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire right now
 
01:32:11.350 --> 01:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
it isn't that expensive but it's pretty
 
01:32:12.870 --> 01:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
darn close to it
 
01:32:16.470 --> 01:32:16.480 align:start position:0%
and you know everyone assumed that when
 
01:32:18.149 --> 01:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
legalization came through in
 
01:32:18.159 --> 01:32:19.590 align:start position:0%
legalization came through in
massachusetts

01:32:19.590 --> 01:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
01:32:22.709 --> 01:32:22.719 align:start position:0%
that prices would ultimately go down
 
01:32:25.110 --> 01:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
and that is not the case prices
 
01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
ultimately ended up
 
01:32:29.750 --> 01:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
going up and the quality continued to go
 
01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:30.709 align:start position:0%
going up and the quality continued to go
down

01:32:30.709 --> 01:32:30.719 align:start position:0%
down
 
01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
so in massachusetts they are having a
 
01:32:36.229 --> 01:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
very large issue right now because the
 
01:32:37.110 --> 01:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
black market
 
01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
is alive and thriving and will continue
 
01:32:41.189 --> 01:32:41.199 align:start position:0%
to do so
 
01:32:43.189 --> 01:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
because of the high costs associated
 
01:32:44.229 --> 01:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
with cannabis
 
01:32:47.350 --> 01:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
and those black market agents
 
01:32:49.910 --> 01:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
they are able to produce a more craft
 
01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:50.550 align:start position:0%
they are able to produce a more craft
cannabis

01:32:50.550 --> 01:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
01:32:53.510 --> 01:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
product which contains the quality that
 
01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:53.990 align:start position:0%
product which contains the quality that
medical

01:32:53.990 --> 01:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
medical
 
01:32:57.669 --> 01:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:59.910 --> 01:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
may ask one more question yes okay we're
 
01:33:01.350 --> 01:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
getting a little tight on time here but
 
01:33:03.189 --> 01:33:03.199 align:start position:0%
okay that's okay i'll i'll
 
01:33:06.149 --> 01:33:06.159 align:start position:0%
forgo let anybody anybody else okay uh
 
01:33:06.159 --> 01:33:07.750 align:start position:0%
forgo let anybody anybody else okay uh
representing

01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
representing
 
01:33:10.390 --> 01:33:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you mr chairman um heather
 
01:33:11.430 --> 01:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
you said that
 
01:33:14.550 --> 01:33:14.560 align:start position:0%
uh legalized marijuana in new hampshire
 
01:33:16.629 --> 01:33:16.639 align:start position:0%
is most likely gonna happen we just
 
01:33:17.910 --> 01:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
don't know when
 
01:33:21.590 --> 01:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
if that happened and we declined this
 
01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:22.310 align:start position:0%
if that happened and we declined this
bill

01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:33:27.110 --> 01:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:31.430 --> 01:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
um i don't necessarily um believe that
 
01:33:34.550 --> 01:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
i believe that there
 
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
i believe that this bill could
 
01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:37.990 align:start position:0%
i believe that this bill could
potentially

01:33:37.990 --> 01:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
01:33:40.310 --> 01:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
have some positive impacts but i do
 
01:33:41.430 --> 01:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
believe that changes
 
01:33:43.990 --> 01:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
need to be made to the bill in order to
 
01:33:46.709 --> 01:33:46.719 align:start position:0%
not allow the outside interests
 
01:33:49.030 --> 01:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
to be able to come into new hampshire
 
01:33:49.990 --> 01:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
that's where i believe
 
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
the problems will lie is when you have
 
01:33:53.830 --> 01:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
the outside
 
01:33:56.470 --> 01:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
interest coming into the state because
 
01:33:58.950 --> 01:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
those individuals don't necessarily
 
01:34:02.229 --> 01:34:02.239 align:start position:0%
have the compassion and the devotion
 
01:34:05.110 --> 01:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
to taking care of new hampshire patients
 
01:34:05.910 --> 01:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
has what an
 
01:34:08.629 --> 01:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
individual born and bred and raised in
 
01:34:12.149 --> 01:34:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:15.830 --> 01:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative greeson
 
01:34:17.030 --> 01:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
heather for your uh testimony but uh
 
01:34:21.110 --> 01:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
the question i have you keep mentioning
 
01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:22.070 align:start position:0%
the question i have you keep mentioning
uh

01:34:22.070 --> 01:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:34:24.149 --> 01:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
regulations at the state level that if
 
01:34:26.070 --> 01:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
we could remove those restrictions or
 
01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:26.629 align:start position:0%
we could remove those restrictions or
whatever

01:34:26.629 --> 01:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:34:28.390 --> 01:34:28.400 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea of what those
 
01:34:30.070 --> 01:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
restrictions might be that you'd like to
 
01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:30.550 align:start position:0%
restrictions might be that you'd like to
see

01:34:30.550 --> 01:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
see
 
01:34:33.189 --> 01:34:33.199 align:start position:0%
removed that would produce the results
 
01:34:34.229 --> 01:34:34.239 align:start position:0%
that you're looking for
 
01:34:36.149 --> 01:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
and encourage you yourself to begin
 
01:34:38.629 --> 01:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
purchasing here in the state
 
01:34:43.270 --> 01:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:47.189 --> 01:34:47.199 align:start position:0%
when a dispensary needs to
 
01:34:51.750 --> 01:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
get rid of whether it's their stocks
 
01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
or you know the the leftover
 
01:34:59.510 --> 01:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
the the leftover debris after processing
 
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:07.350 --> 01:35:07.360 align:start position:0%
the state has many restrictions on how
 
01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
that needs to be disposed of
 
01:35:13.510 --> 01:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
involving taking that material
 
01:35:17.189 --> 01:35:17.199 align:start position:0%
mixing it in with i believe at least 50
 
01:35:20.550 --> 01:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
a minimum of 50 percent sawdust which
 
01:35:22.709 --> 01:35:22.719 align:start position:0%
that sawdust needs to be purchased by
 
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
the company
 
01:35:25.990 --> 01:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
then it needs to be double and triple
 
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
bagged then it needs to be
 
01:35:30.870 --> 01:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
put into a special waste disposal unit
 
01:35:32.550 --> 01:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
then it needs then there needs to be a
 
01:35:33.990 --> 01:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
special company
 
01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
that's hired to come and pick up such
 
01:35:37.590 --> 01:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
debris and material
 
01:35:40.790 --> 01:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
all of that adds extra expense when in
 
01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:41.590 align:start position:0%
all of that adds extra expense when in
reality

01:35:41.590 --> 01:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
reality
 
01:35:44.149 --> 01:35:44.159 align:start position:0%
those products that the leftover debris
 
01:35:44.159 --> 01:35:44.709 align:start position:0%
those products that the leftover debris
contain

01:35:44.709 --> 01:35:44.719 align:start position:0%
contain
 
01:35:48.070 --> 01:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely no thc they are of no danger
 
01:35:49.270 --> 01:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
to the public
 
01:35:51.270 --> 01:35:51.280 align:start position:0%
and could be disposed of in a much
 
01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
better manner such as
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
allowing the facility to use it for
 
01:35:55.679 --> 01:35:57.430 align:start position:0%
allowing the facility to use it for
composting

01:35:57.430 --> 01:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
composting
 
01:36:01.430 --> 01:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
or allowing the facility to sell it
 
01:36:04.709 --> 01:36:04.719 align:start position:0%
to a registered composter
 
01:36:06.790 --> 01:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire that could
 
01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
then legally take that material
 
01:36:13.270 --> 01:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
and dispose of it and use it to go into
 
01:36:14.790 --> 01:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
composting materials
 
01:36:17.430 --> 01:36:17.440 align:start position:0%
that in itself would not only cut down
 
01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:18.390 align:start position:0%
that in itself would not only cut down
on

01:36:18.390 --> 01:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:36:21.430 --> 01:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
costs for the dispensary but could also
 
01:36:24.550 --> 01:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
offer a little bit of extra
 
01:36:28.709 --> 01:36:28.719 align:start position:0%
income as well um i also know
 
01:36:32.070 --> 01:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
that in the area of security
 
01:36:35.750 --> 01:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
there are you know obviously security is
 
01:36:37.910 --> 01:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
a necessity we need to have that in
 
01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:38.709 align:start position:0%
a necessity we need to have that in
place

01:36:38.709 --> 01:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:36:41.669 --> 01:36:41.679 align:start position:0%
but i think that to an extent some of
 
01:36:42.390 --> 01:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
the kids
 
01:36:45.189 --> 01:36:45.199 align:start position:0%
the security measures that we and
 
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
requirements that we have for our
 
01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:47.990 align:start position:0%
requirements that we have for our
dispensary

01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
dispensary
 
01:36:51.669 --> 01:36:51.679 align:start position:0%
may be a tiny bit of overkill
 
01:36:55.229 --> 01:36:55.239 align:start position:0%
and there may be in essence creating a
 
01:36:57.430 --> 01:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
redundancy in the system
 
01:37:00.870 --> 01:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
that doesn't necessarily need to occur
 
01:37:02.709 --> 01:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
being able to change that in some
 
01:37:04.390 --> 01:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
fashion would cut down
 
01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
on an expense for the dispensary because
 
01:37:09.270 --> 01:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you've ever looked into
 
01:37:10.709 --> 01:37:10.719 align:start position:0%
any of those um
 
01:37:13.750 --> 01:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
security programs or products but
 
01:37:16.470 --> 01:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
you know we're talking tens and
 
01:37:18.390 --> 01:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars
 
01:37:20.229 --> 01:37:20.239 align:start position:0%
just for a dispensary to be able to
 
01:37:22.310 --> 01:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
utilize and access that
 
01:37:24.790 --> 01:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
um you know if we could change that up a
 
01:37:25.750 --> 01:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
little bit and
 
01:37:27.430 --> 01:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
you know have them put in place a
 
01:37:30.709 --> 01:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
security system that works that covers
 
01:37:31.830 --> 01:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
it from
 
01:37:36.070 --> 01:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
seed to and still gets the job done
 
01:37:39.189 --> 01:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
efficiently and safely then that would
 
01:37:39.199 --> 01:37:39.510 align:start position:0%
efficiently and safely then that would
be

01:37:39.510 --> 01:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:37:41.669 --> 01:37:41.679 align:start position:0%
another way to cut costs down for the
 
01:37:41.679 --> 01:37:43.270 align:start position:0%
another way to cut costs down for the
dispensaries

01:37:43.270 --> 01:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
dispensaries
 
01:37:46.229 --> 01:37:46.239 align:start position:0%
so there are several areas that could be
 
01:37:47.189 --> 01:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
looked at
 
01:37:49.750 --> 01:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
that would cut down costs at the state
 
01:37:51.590 --> 01:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
level for a dispensary
 
01:37:54.390 --> 01:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
and allow a dispensary in some instance
 
01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:54.709 align:start position:0%
and allow a dispensary in some instance
to

01:37:54.709 --> 01:37:54.719 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:37:57.430 --> 01:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
save money or even bring in a little
 
01:37:59.270 --> 01:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
extra money from outside of the
 
01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:00.310 align:start position:0%
extra money from outside of the
dispensary

01:38:00.310 --> 01:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
dispensary
 
01:38:02.550 --> 01:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
that ultimately could be passed on in
 
01:38:06.070 --> 01:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:12.629 --> 01:38:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:14.310 --> 01:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for your
 
01:38:17.510 --> 01:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
testimony taking our questions heather
 
01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
i just have a question about um this
 
01:38:22.950 --> 01:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
situation in massachusetts like
 
01:38:26.070 --> 01:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
we know that our marketplace in our
 
01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:26.790 align:start position:0%
we know that our marketplace in our
state

01:38:26.790 --> 01:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:38:29.510 --> 01:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
is uh determined somewhat by surrounding
 
01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:30.550 align:start position:0%
is uh determined somewhat by surrounding
states

01:38:30.550 --> 01:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
but you had mentioned that i think you
 
01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
said an eighth of cannabis is 70 to 80
 
01:38:37.669 --> 01:38:37.679 align:start position:0%
dollars in massachusetts
 
01:38:39.510 --> 01:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
and you said the black market is alive
 
01:38:41.109 --> 01:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
and thriving
 
01:38:43.590 --> 01:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
because of that high cost and my
 
01:38:45.910 --> 01:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
question is do you know how much
 
01:38:49.669 --> 01:38:49.679 align:start position:0%
uh the state of massachusetts taxes
 
01:38:51.030 --> 01:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
that amount how much of that seventy
 
01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
eight or dollar eighty dollars is
 
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
taxed by the state versus uh you know
 
01:38:57.189 --> 01:38:57.199 align:start position:0%
charged by the
 
01:39:02.070 --> 01:39:02.080 align:start position:0%
producer um i honestly
 
01:39:04.390 --> 01:39:04.400 align:start position:0%
i i would be putting a guesstimate but
 
01:39:05.270 --> 01:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
at the la
 
01:39:08.550 --> 01:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
at my last check i believe
 
01:39:14.229 --> 01:39:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:17.669 --> 01:39:17.679 align:start position:0%
okay it could possibly be more at this
 
01:39:19.910 --> 01:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
point but originally i believe
 
01:39:24.229 --> 01:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
it was about fifteen dollars on the cost
 
01:39:26.870 --> 01:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
and which still does not bring it down
 
01:39:28.149 --> 01:39:28.159 align:start position:0%
in comparison to
 
01:39:29.669 --> 01:39:29.679 align:start position:0%
what you can get it here in new
 
01:39:32.310 --> 01:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire but then again they still have
 
01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:33.350 align:start position:0%
hampshire but then again they still have
restrictions

01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
restrictions
 
01:39:37.189 --> 01:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
in place that you know cause them to
 
01:39:39.990 --> 01:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
still have to put more money out than
 
01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
what they necessarily have to
 
01:39:44.149 --> 01:39:44.159 align:start position:0%
so and obviously that affects the cost
 
01:39:47.030 --> 01:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:50.470 --> 01:39:50.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you okay all set
 
01:39:53.590 --> 01:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
all right um so uh mike
 
01:39:55.910 --> 01:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
i see that you have your hand up um my
 
01:39:56.870 --> 01:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
preference would be
 
01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:00.880 align:start position:0%
that you would send
 
01:40:03.350 --> 01:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh just send an email out to all the
 
01:40:03.360 --> 01:40:04.070 align:start position:0%
uh just send an email out to all the
members

01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:40:08.149 --> 01:40:08.159 align:start position:0%
but um if you're the model of brevity
 
01:40:10.629 --> 01:40:10.639 align:start position:0%
and expenses and i'll let you have the
 
01:40:11.910 --> 01:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
last word
 
01:40:13.669 --> 01:40:13.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'll be very quick
 
01:40:15.109 --> 01:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to point out that one of
 
01:40:15.990 --> 01:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
the things that the
 
01:40:19.910 --> 01:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
three atc's do is provide discounts
 
01:40:22.390 --> 01:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
for uh people on disability income
 
01:40:24.149 --> 01:40:24.159 align:start position:0%
medicaid and for veterans
 
01:40:27.270 --> 01:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
and in our in 2019 century put four
 
01:40:28.870 --> 01:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
hundred and two thousand dollars worth
 
01:40:29.750 --> 01:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
of discounts
 
01:40:32.229 --> 01:40:32.239 align:start position:0%
available to the public uh and one of
 
01:40:34.229 --> 01:40:34.239 align:start position:0%
the things that it's just uh
 
01:40:37.350 --> 01:40:37.360 align:start position:0%
important to remember this bill uh is
 
01:40:39.830 --> 01:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
a short window for conversion conversion
 
01:40:42.430 --> 01:40:42.440 align:start position:0%
would have to happen
 
01:40:48.950 --> 01:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:51.430 --> 01:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
they are participating heavily in trying
 
01:40:56.470 --> 01:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:57.750 --> 01:40:57.760 align:start position:0%
okay sounds like you're getting in your
 
01:40:59.990 --> 01:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
car you're on your way so with that we
 
01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:00.629 align:start position:0%
car you're on your way so with that we
will

01:41:00.629 --> 01:41:00.639 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:41:04.229 --> 01:41:04.239 align:start position:0%
end the public hearing um and
 
01:41:07.430 --> 01:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh let's see i have uh
 
01:41:11.510 --> 01:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
18 in support and
 
01:41:14.790 --> 01:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
uh no one was opposed until until
 
01:41:17.669 --> 01:41:17.679 align:start position:0%
today we had heather and with that i
 
01:41:19.750 --> 01:41:19.760 align:start position:0%

01:41:59.910 --> 01:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
sherman
 
01:42:02.790 --> 01:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
district 24 11 towns on the seacoast i'm
 
01:42:05.669 --> 01:42:05.679 align:start position:0%
introducing senate bill 59
 
01:42:07.430 --> 01:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
which is relative to the collaborative
 
01:42:11.510 --> 01:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
care model service delivery method
 
01:42:13.750 --> 01:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
for full disclosure there will be some
 
01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
experts who will be testifying and
 
01:42:19.189 --> 01:42:19.199 align:start position:0%
able to answer from the psychiatrist's
 
01:42:19.199 --> 01:42:19.830 align:start position:0%
able to answer from the psychiatrist's
standpoint

01:42:19.830 --> 01:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
01:42:22.310 --> 01:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
why this bill is so important but a
 
01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:22.870 align:start position:0%
why this bill is so important but a
brief

01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
brief
 
01:42:26.950 --> 01:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
overview is that as most of us know
 
01:42:28.709 --> 01:42:28.719 align:start position:0%
there is a mental health crisis
 
01:42:30.629 --> 01:42:30.639 align:start position:0%
currently in the state part of that
 
01:42:34.390 --> 01:42:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:38.550 --> 01:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
and what collaborative care
 
01:42:42.149 --> 01:42:42.159 align:start position:0%
does is it allows a patient to go
 
01:42:45.030 --> 01:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
into their primary care provider who
 
01:42:46.629 --> 01:42:46.639 align:start position:0%
then has a collaborative care
 
01:42:49.350 --> 01:42:49.360 align:start position:0%
relationship with a psychiatrist
 
01:42:51.430 --> 01:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
and essentially the primary care
 
01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:52.870 align:start position:0%
and essentially the primary care
provider

01:42:52.870 --> 01:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
provider
 
01:42:55.270 --> 01:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
taps into the expertise and knowledge
 
01:42:56.149 --> 01:42:56.159 align:start position:0%
and experience
 
01:42:59.750 --> 01:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
of the psychiatrist in a formal
 
01:43:03.030 --> 01:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
way it is a
 
01:43:06.229 --> 01:43:06.239 align:start position:0%
basically a consultation
 
01:43:08.790 --> 01:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
the patient does not have to go and see
 
01:43:11.109 --> 01:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
the psychiatrist the primary care or the
 
01:43:13.030 --> 01:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
provider will actually
 
01:43:15.590 --> 01:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
have that interaction and then the
 
01:43:17.830 --> 01:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist will be able to help guide
 
01:43:18.629 --> 01:43:18.639 align:start position:0%
the therapy
 
01:43:22.390 --> 01:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
along with the primary care provider
 
01:43:25.990 --> 01:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
this is super important because we as a
 
01:43:26.000 --> 01:43:26.470 align:start position:0%
this is super important because we as a
state

01:43:26.470 --> 01:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:43:28.229 --> 01:43:28.239 align:start position:0%
have been working towards what's called
 
01:43:29.830 --> 01:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
an integrated delivery
 
01:43:33.109 --> 01:43:33.119 align:start position:0%
network model as many
 
01:43:35.430 --> 01:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
uh in the committee know we have had a
 
01:43:36.390 --> 01:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
federal grant
 
01:43:39.510 --> 01:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
to make this happen across the state
 
01:43:42.070 --> 01:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
and it really is the standard of
 
01:43:44.709 --> 01:43:44.719 align:start position:0%
practice for psychiatry and for
 
01:43:47.590 --> 01:43:47.600 align:start position:0%
behavioral health to be able to provide
 
01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
that point of service delivery we also
 
01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:53.109 align:start position:0%
that point of service delivery we also
know

01:43:53.109 --> 01:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:43:55.430 --> 01:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
when comes back to workforce that there
 
01:43:57.910 --> 01:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
is some limitation on the availability
 
01:43:57.920 --> 01:43:58.310 align:start position:0%
is some limitation on the availability
of

01:43:58.310 --> 01:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:44:01.350 --> 01:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
psychiatrists and what the
 
01:44:04.709 --> 01:44:04.719 align:start position:0%
collaborative care model does is it
 
01:44:07.990 --> 01:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
vastly expands that availability
 
01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh of psychiatry across the state
 
01:44:14.550 --> 01:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
without sacrificing um the quality in
 
01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:14.950 align:start position:0%
without sacrificing um the quality in
fact

01:44:14.950 --> 01:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
fact
 
01:44:19.189 --> 01:44:19.199 align:start position:0%
it in many ways it enhances quality
 
01:44:23.109 --> 01:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
and so from the patient benefit
 
01:44:25.669 --> 01:44:25.679 align:start position:0%
it is essentially one-stop shopping they
 
01:44:27.669 --> 01:44:27.679 align:start position:0%
come into their primary care and they're
 
01:44:30.550 --> 01:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
able within the limits of the primary
 
01:44:31.350 --> 01:44:31.360 align:start position:0%
care model
 
01:44:35.030 --> 01:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
to be able to access their
 
01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
psychiatric services at the same time
 
01:44:42.629 --> 01:44:42.639 align:start position:0%
it is associated in studies with better
 
01:44:45.030 --> 01:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
outcomes better accessibility
 
01:44:47.750 --> 01:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
and it's a better use of resources it's
 
01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:48.070 align:start position:0%
and it's a better use of resources it's
more

01:44:48.070 --> 01:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:44:51.669 --> 01:44:51.679 align:start position:0%
efficient overall
 
01:44:54.390 --> 01:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
one of the benefits for this is overall
 
01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:55.109 align:start position:0%
one of the benefits for this is overall
decreased

01:44:55.109 --> 01:44:55.119 align:start position:0%
decreased
 
01:44:58.950 --> 01:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
cost of services if the psychiatrist
 
01:45:00.870 --> 01:45:00.880 align:start position:0%
feels that the patient does need to be
 
01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:01.830 align:start position:0%
feels that the patient does need to be
seen

01:45:01.830 --> 01:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
seen
 
01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
separately and individually of course
 
01:45:06.070 --> 01:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
that is possible and that can be part of
 
01:45:09.590 --> 01:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:11.350 --> 01:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
this is something that we have worked
 
01:45:12.790 --> 01:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
with the carriers on
 
01:45:14.830 --> 01:45:14.840 align:start position:0%
very closely we worked with the medical
 
01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:15.990 align:start position:0%
very closely we worked with the medical
society

01:45:15.990 --> 01:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
society
 
01:45:19.109 --> 01:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
with the psychiatric society
 
01:45:21.910 --> 01:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
the carriers helped craft the language
 
01:45:22.550 --> 01:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
that you see
 
01:45:26.229 --> 01:45:26.239 align:start position:0%
before you worked closely with paula
 
01:45:30.229 --> 01:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
and anthem as well as harvard pilgrim to
 
01:45:32.709 --> 01:45:32.719 align:start position:0%
to do certain things the original bill
 
01:45:34.709 --> 01:45:34.719 align:start position:0%
as introduced back in 2019
 
01:45:40.070 --> 01:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:42.629 --> 01:45:42.639 align:start position:0%
had actual codes in it we pulled those
 
01:45:44.470 --> 01:45:44.480 align:start position:0%
out and talked about the scope of
 
01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:46.070 align:start position:0%
out and talked about the scope of
service

01:45:46.070 --> 01:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:45:47.910 --> 01:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
rather than putting in specific codes
 
01:45:49.669 --> 01:45:49.679 align:start position:0%
that was at the request of the carriers
 
01:45:51.590 --> 01:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
and then we modified language further
 
01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
with paula's help
 
01:45:55.430 --> 01:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
to what you currently see the department
 
01:45:56.550 --> 01:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
of insurance
 
01:46:00.709 --> 01:46:00.719 align:start position:0%
working with tyler is neutral on this
 
01:46:03.750 --> 01:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
they're not taking a position
 
01:46:06.950 --> 01:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
but this is uh to
 
01:46:10.229 --> 01:46:10.239 align:start position:0%
ensure that that this practice is
 
01:46:14.070 --> 01:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
allowed reimbursed and
 
01:46:17.109 --> 01:46:17.119 align:start position:0%
is and that's across all carriers
 
01:46:20.070 --> 01:46:20.080 align:start position:0%
so with that and with the understanding
 
01:46:20.950 --> 01:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
that there are
 
01:46:25.430 --> 01:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
experts who are available to
 
01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
answer some of the specifics of
 
01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:28.870 align:start position:0%
answer some of the specifics of
psychiatry

01:46:28.870 --> 01:46:28.880 align:start position:0%
psychiatry
 
01:46:31.310 --> 01:46:31.320 align:start position:0%
i would only add that in my practice of
 
01:46:31.320 --> 01:46:32.470 align:start position:0%
i would only add that in my practice of
gastroenterology

01:46:32.470 --> 01:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
gastroenterology
 
01:46:34.229 --> 01:46:34.239 align:start position:0%
we know that this kind of collaborative
 
01:46:35.590 --> 01:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
care model
 
01:46:37.510 --> 01:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
is most effective especially for the
 
01:46:39.590 --> 01:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
more difficult patients with
 
01:46:41.510 --> 01:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
problems like irritable bowel syndrome
 
01:46:42.709 --> 01:46:42.719 align:start position:0%
and those
 
01:46:45.750 --> 01:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
and in my practice
 
01:46:50.310 --> 01:46:50.320 align:start position:0%
having this capacity would have been
 
01:46:52.390 --> 01:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
game changing for those patients what we
 
01:46:55.669 --> 01:46:55.679 align:start position:0%
do currently is we do it informally
 
01:46:57.510 --> 01:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
but that means that we don't have as
 
01:46:59.430 --> 01:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
much support as
 
01:47:02.470 --> 01:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
would be optimal and so this
 
01:47:06.390 --> 01:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
in the field of psychiatry is really
 
01:47:08.229 --> 01:47:08.239 align:start position:0%
the standard of practice and we want to
 
01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
be sure that it is available across the
 
01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:11.270 align:start position:0%
be sure that it is available across the
state

01:47:11.270 --> 01:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:47:12.629 --> 01:47:12.639 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm happy to take any
 
01:47:12.639 --> 01:47:14.870 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm happy to take any
questions

01:47:14.870 --> 01:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:47:18.870 --> 01:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:22.229 --> 01:47:22.239 align:start position:0%
and she's muted
 
01:47:24.390 --> 01:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
sorry about that um thank you for taking
 
01:47:25.910 --> 01:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
my question senator
 
01:47:29.030 --> 01:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
um just from what i see of the
 
01:47:30.790 --> 01:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
healthcare profession
 
01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
primary care providers are not super
 
01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable about nutrition and about
 
01:47:39.830 --> 01:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
um psychiatric disorders or mental
 
01:47:41.030 --> 01:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
health issues so
 
01:47:43.030 --> 01:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
i'm cure just curious and this sounds
 
01:47:45.430 --> 01:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
like a great bill but my question is
 
01:47:48.550 --> 01:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
how will a primary care physician
 
01:47:52.310 --> 01:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
buy the the treatment of a of a patient
 
01:47:54.229 --> 01:47:54.239 align:start position:0%
um in this scenario in the collaborative
 
01:47:55.910 --> 01:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
model i know you mentioned that
 
01:47:57.590 --> 01:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
that they'll will be helped by the
 
01:47:59.350 --> 01:47:59.360 align:start position:0%
psychiatric uh um
 
01:48:01.750 --> 01:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
professional but i'm i'm just a little
 
01:48:03.270 --> 01:48:03.280 align:start position:0%
little confused about how that would
 
01:48:05.350 --> 01:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
actually work in practice
 
01:48:08.790 --> 01:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
yeah actually um i i have not seen the
 
01:48:10.870 --> 01:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
sign up list is dr ho
 
01:48:14.550 --> 01:48:14.560 align:start position:0%
on your signup list yep can i defer
 
01:48:17.109 --> 01:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
to him he is a practicing psychiatrist
 
01:48:17.119 --> 01:48:17.669 align:start position:0%
to him he is a practicing psychiatrist
and

01:48:17.669 --> 01:48:17.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:48:21.430 --> 01:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
he could i can share with you the model
 
01:48:24.870 --> 01:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
that if you walk into our primary care
 
01:48:26.070 --> 01:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
providers at core
 
01:48:29.270 --> 01:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:31.189 --> 01:48:31.199 align:start position:0%
they actually now working through the
 
01:48:32.310 --> 01:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
idea and they have
 
01:48:35.030 --> 01:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
access to psychiatry services what this
 
01:48:36.470 --> 01:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
would allow
 
01:48:38.629 --> 01:48:38.639 align:start position:0%
say dr buchanan or one of our primary
 
01:48:40.790 --> 01:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
care doctors to do would be to call up
 
01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:41.189 align:start position:0%
care doctors to do would be to call up
dr

01:48:41.189 --> 01:48:41.199 align:start position:0%
dr
 
01:48:44.149 --> 01:48:44.159 align:start position:0%
ho and and actually have a formal
 
01:48:45.350 --> 01:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
consultation where
 
01:48:47.990 --> 01:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
she would present the patient to dr ho
 
01:48:51.590 --> 01:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:53.590 --> 01:48:53.600 align:start position:0%
has depression and here are the
 
01:48:55.350 --> 01:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
manifestations of that
 
01:48:57.590 --> 01:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
here's the other medical history they
 
01:48:59.270 --> 01:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
could exchange the history
 
01:49:01.830 --> 01:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
dr ho then creates a chart on that
 
01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:03.030 align:start position:0%
dr ho then creates a chart on that
patient

01:49:03.030 --> 01:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
patient
 
01:49:06.790 --> 01:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
and working together dr ho would give
 
01:49:08.709 --> 01:49:08.719 align:start position:0%
his psychiatric opinion what would be
 
01:49:10.390 --> 01:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
the best medications
 
01:49:12.390 --> 01:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
how to follow up and they would continue
 
01:49:14.470 --> 01:49:14.480 align:start position:0%
to work collaboratively
 
01:49:18.550 --> 01:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
with that patient's care so
 
01:49:21.990 --> 01:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
that is but the patient themselves would
 
01:49:23.750 --> 01:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
not have to go to another office would
 
01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
not have to spend another
 
01:49:29.830 --> 01:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
hour or so with dr ho unless
 
01:49:33.430 --> 01:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
in that review dr ho and dr buchanan
 
01:49:35.830 --> 01:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
feel that they need a separate referral
 
01:49:39.030 --> 01:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
for formal psychiatric consultation
 
01:49:40.830 --> 01:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
does that help answer the for the
 
01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:42.070 align:start position:0%
does that help answer the for the
question

01:49:42.070 --> 01:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:49:43.990 --> 01:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
being clear yeah no that was a great
 
01:49:45.350 --> 01:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
answer thank you so much so
 
01:49:47.910 --> 01:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
it sounds like let's say a patient is
 
01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:48.790 align:start position:0%
it sounds like let's say a patient is
seeking

01:49:48.790 --> 01:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
seeking
 
01:49:50.950 --> 01:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
medication for a psychiatric or mental
 
01:49:51.910 --> 01:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
health disorder
 
01:49:54.390 --> 01:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
that the psychiatrist could recommend a
 
01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:55.350 align:start position:0%
that the psychiatrist could recommend a
specific

01:49:55.350 --> 01:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:49:57.669 --> 01:49:57.679 align:start position:0%
medication which the primary care
 
01:49:59.589 --> 01:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
physician could then um write a script
 
01:49:59.599 --> 01:49:59.910 align:start position:0%
physician could then um write a script
for

01:49:59.910 --> 01:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:50:02.470 --> 01:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
would that be accurate yes that would be
 
01:50:03.589 --> 01:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
accurate and
 
01:50:06.310 --> 01:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
the other part of this i you know i'm
 
01:50:08.550 --> 01:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
sorry i don't know your background but
 
01:50:10.950 --> 01:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
we have had for many years in in my
 
01:50:12.629 --> 01:50:12.639 align:start position:0%
field i'll get a call from a primary
 
01:50:14.229 --> 01:50:14.239 align:start position:0%
care provider with somebody with
 
01:50:16.229 --> 01:50:16.239 align:start position:0%
diarrhea and i will talk about it's
 
01:50:18.070 --> 01:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
called a curbside consult
 
01:50:20.950 --> 01:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
but i don't keep a formal record the
 
01:50:22.070 --> 01:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
beauty of this
 
01:50:25.510 --> 01:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
is that that formal record would be kept
 
01:50:28.629 --> 01:50:28.639 align:start position:0%
by that provider by the psychiatrist
 
01:50:30.790 --> 01:50:30.800 align:start position:0%
it would be something that the patient
 
01:50:32.950 --> 01:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
could access if they need to
 
01:50:35.109 --> 01:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
get a copy of their medical record so
 
01:50:37.589 --> 01:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
this is a formal relationship
 
01:50:40.629 --> 01:50:40.639 align:start position:0%
which is uh all the data shows that that
 
01:50:40.639 --> 01:50:41.270 align:start position:0%
which is uh all the data shows that that
is

01:50:41.270 --> 01:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:50:43.430 --> 01:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
a much more effective relationship in
 
01:50:44.470 --> 01:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
healthcare than
 
01:50:47.030 --> 01:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
than the curbside consult that has been
 
01:50:50.229 --> 01:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:52.310 --> 01:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
so i hope that helps thank you that's
 
01:50:53.589 --> 01:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
really helpful thanks
 
01:50:55.990 --> 01:50:56.000 align:start position:0%

to speak today for the record
 
01:51:13.990 --> 01:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
my name is patrick ho and my testimony
 
01:51:15.669 --> 01:51:15.679 align:start position:0%
today is on behalf of both the new
 
01:51:17.430 --> 01:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire psychiatric society which i
 
01:51:18.790 --> 01:51:18.800 align:start position:0%
serve as the president and the new
 
01:51:20.149 --> 01:51:20.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire medical society
 
01:51:21.990 --> 01:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
of which i am an executive committee
 
01:51:24.470 --> 01:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
member in these capacities
 
01:51:26.709 --> 01:51:26.719 align:start position:0%
we fully support senate bill 59 as a
 
01:51:28.790 --> 01:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
strong effort to improve our ability to
 
01:51:30.390 --> 01:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
deliver mental health care in new
 
01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:31.030 align:start position:0%
deliver mental health care in new
hampshire

01:51:31.030 --> 01:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:51:32.870 --> 01:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
and personally as a psychiatrist then i
 
01:51:34.149 --> 01:51:34.159 align:start position:0%
support this bill because
 
01:51:36.870 --> 01:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
i feel the frustrations of patients who
 
01:51:37.510 --> 01:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
come to
 
01:51:39.750 --> 01:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
an ed or seek inpatient mental health
 
01:51:42.070 --> 01:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
care seeing no other option amidst the
 
01:51:44.149 --> 01:51:44.159 align:start position:0%
severe shortage of psychiatrists and
 
01:51:45.910 --> 01:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
other mental health practitioners in our
 
01:51:45.920 --> 01:51:47.109 align:start position:0%
other mental health practitioners in our
state

01:51:47.109 --> 01:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:51:49.350 --> 01:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
so i i will keep my testimony brief and
 
01:51:51.189 --> 01:51:51.199 align:start position:0%
we'll just briefly provide some
 
01:51:53.430 --> 01:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
additional overall context
 
01:51:55.430 --> 01:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
in addition to what senator sherman had
 
01:51:55.440 --> 01:51:56.709 align:start position:0%
in addition to what senator sherman had
just

01:51:56.709 --> 01:51:56.719 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:51:58.550 --> 01:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
outlined really well for collaborative
 
01:51:59.990 --> 01:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
care model services
 
01:52:02.870 --> 01:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
and of course one of the things to
 
01:52:04.310 --> 01:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
mention is that although new hampshire
 
01:52:05.910 --> 01:52:05.920 align:start position:0%
has the highest proportion of citizens
 
01:52:07.669 --> 01:52:07.679 align:start position:0%
suffering from mental health disorders
 
01:52:08.870 --> 01:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
out of any state
 
01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
nearly a quarter of these citizens do
 
01:52:12.149 --> 01:52:12.159 align:start position:0%
feel that their mental health care needs
 
01:52:12.159 --> 01:52:12.470 align:start position:0%
feel that their mental health care needs
are

01:52:12.470 --> 01:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:52:16.229 --> 01:52:16.239 align:start position:0%
unmet and this is in in part like dr uh
 
01:52:18.470 --> 01:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
like dr sherman had mentioned due to a
 
01:52:20.070 --> 01:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
shortage of psychiatrists
 
01:52:22.629 --> 01:52:22.639 align:start position:0%
and um to provide a little bit more
 
01:52:24.470 --> 01:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
context about collaborative care model
 
01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:25.189 align:start position:0%
context about collaborative care model
services

01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:52:27.910 --> 01:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
then this is definitely a feature that
 
01:52:29.750 --> 01:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
can bridge the gap with better care
 
01:52:31.750 --> 01:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
coordination via integration of mental
 
01:52:31.760 --> 01:52:32.149 align:start position:0%
coordination via integration of mental
health

01:52:32.149 --> 01:52:32.159 align:start position:0%
health
 
01:52:34.550 --> 01:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
and primary care so this is truly
 
01:52:34.560 --> 01:52:35.270 align:start position:0%
and primary care so this is truly
collaborative

01:52:35.270 --> 01:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
collaborative
 
01:52:37.030 --> 01:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
in that there is a team approach
 
01:52:39.109 --> 01:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
consisting of a primary care provider a
 
01:52:40.070 --> 01:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
care manager
 
01:52:42.390 --> 01:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
and a psychiatric consultant which
 
01:52:44.149 --> 01:52:44.159 align:start position:0%
ideally would be an md or do
 
01:52:44.159 --> 01:52:45.589 align:start position:0%
ideally would be an md or do
psychiatrist

01:52:45.589 --> 01:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist
 
01:52:47.589 --> 01:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
the team cares for a defined group of
 
01:52:49.510 --> 01:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
patients within the primary care
 
01:52:51.270 --> 01:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
practice and closely tracks each
 
01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
patient's progress
 
01:52:55.510 --> 01:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
and so in that way then instead of a
 
01:52:56.709 --> 01:52:56.719 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist seeing
 
01:52:58.310 --> 01:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
one patient individually that the
 
01:53:00.470 --> 01:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist is able to
 
01:53:02.870 --> 01:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
help the primary care provider care for
 
01:53:04.629 --> 01:53:04.639 align:start position:0%
an entire panel of patients
 
01:53:06.310 --> 01:53:06.320 align:start position:0%
treatment is adjusted if patients are
 
01:53:08.470 --> 01:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
not improving as expected
 
01:53:10.070 --> 01:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
patients who don't respond to treatment
 
01:53:12.149 --> 01:53:12.159 align:start position:0%
are referred to more intensive mental
 
01:53:13.589 --> 01:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
health specialty care
 
01:53:15.430 --> 01:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
including seeing the psychiatrist
 
01:53:16.790 --> 01:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
instead of psychiatrists seeing all
 
01:53:18.149 --> 01:53:18.159 align:start position:0%
patients one-on-one the
 
01:53:19.750 --> 01:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
the psychiatrist provide caseload
 
01:53:19.760 --> 01:53:21.189 align:start position:0%
the psychiatrist provide caseload
consultation

01:53:21.189 --> 01:53:21.199 align:start position:0%
consultation
 
01:53:23.430 --> 01:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
to a population of patients for the
 
01:53:25.430 --> 01:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
primary care practice providing
 
01:53:27.589 --> 01:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
proactive and effective mental health
 
01:53:29.510 --> 01:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
care this approach of course would
 
01:53:30.390 --> 01:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
improve access
 
01:53:32.709 --> 01:53:32.719 align:start position:0%
health outcomes and reduce provider
 
01:53:33.910 --> 01:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
burnout for both
 
01:53:35.990 --> 01:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
the primary care physicians on the front
 
01:53:37.589 --> 01:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
lines of
 
01:53:39.990 --> 01:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
of illness in our state both physical
 
01:53:41.430 --> 01:53:41.440 align:start position:0%
and mental and of course the the
 
01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:43.350 align:start position:0%
and mental and of course the the
psychiatrist

01:53:43.350 --> 01:53:43.360 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist
 
01:53:45.109 --> 01:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
medicare and federally qualified health
 
01:53:47.109 --> 01:53:47.119 align:start position:0%
centers and rural health clinics already
 
01:53:49.109 --> 01:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
do allow reimbursement for collaborative
 
01:53:51.109 --> 01:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
care model services
 
01:53:53.750 --> 01:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
and this legislation would allow for
 
01:53:55.030 --> 01:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
primary care providers to build
 
01:53:56.790 --> 01:53:56.800 align:start position:0%
commercial insurers for the model which
 
01:53:58.070 --> 01:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
would safely increase
 
01:54:01.030 --> 01:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
access to mental health care so finally
 
01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
with the added
 
01:54:03.990 --> 01:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
stressors of coven 19 the need for
 
01:54:05.669 --> 01:54:05.679 align:start position:0%
mental health care services
 
01:54:07.910 --> 01:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
is higher than ever and this makes the
 
01:54:09.910 --> 01:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
lack of access to these services even
 
01:54:11.189 --> 01:54:11.199 align:start position:0%
more pronounced
 
01:54:13.189 --> 01:54:13.199 align:start position:0%
and strains other healthcare resources
 
01:54:15.189 --> 01:54:15.199 align:start position:0%
like emergency departments
 
01:54:17.109 --> 01:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
we've of course seen in just the last
 
01:54:18.790 --> 01:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
month with so many children
 
01:54:20.470 --> 01:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
and adults waiting for inpatient
 
01:54:22.470 --> 01:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
psychiatric beds that this has become
 
01:54:24.950 --> 01:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
untenable so it is really now more
 
01:54:26.550 --> 01:54:26.560 align:start position:0%
important than ever that we allow for
 
01:54:28.709 --> 01:54:28.719 align:start position:0%
the use of evidence-based practices to
 
01:54:30.629 --> 01:54:30.639 align:start position:0%
increase the availability of mental
 
01:54:30.639 --> 01:54:31.189 align:start position:0%
increase the availability of mental
health

01:54:31.189 --> 01:54:31.199 align:start position:0%
health
 
01:54:33.589 --> 01:54:33.599 align:start position:0%
services in our state so i urge you to
 
01:54:36.070 --> 01:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
vote in favor of senate bill 59 and i'm
 
01:54:38.149 --> 01:54:38.159 align:start position:0%
certainly glad to take any questions
 
01:54:41.189 --> 01:54:41.199 align:start position:0%
thank you great thank you
 
01:54:45.830 --> 01:54:45.840 align:start position:0%

01:54:56.629 --> 01:54:56.639 align:start position:0%
highest percentage of citizens
 
01:54:58.790 --> 01:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
suffering from mental health disorders
 
01:54:59.990 --> 01:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
of any state
 
01:55:01.830 --> 01:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
and i was curious if you had a source
 
01:55:03.430 --> 01:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
for that that's kind of an interesting
 
01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:07.109 align:start position:0%
for that that's kind of an interesting
statistic

01:55:07.109 --> 01:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:09.030 --> 01:55:09.040 align:start position:0%

01:56:07.510 --> 01:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
we're not treatment providers per se but
 
01:56:09.270 --> 01:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
our mission is to improve the lives of
 
01:56:11.270 --> 01:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
all people impacted by mental illness
 
01:56:14.950 --> 01:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
we strongly support senate bill 59
 
01:56:17.109 --> 01:56:17.119 align:start position:0%
and the collaborative care model as
 
01:56:18.390 --> 01:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
you've heard
 
01:56:21.189 --> 01:56:21.199 align:start position:0%
governor sununu has repeatedly stated
 
01:56:21.199 --> 01:56:22.149 align:start position:0%
governor sununu has repeatedly stated
including

01:56:22.149 --> 01:56:22.159 align:start position:0%
including
 
01:56:23.910 --> 01:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
last month that we're in a mental health
 
01:56:26.149 --> 01:56:26.159 align:start position:0%
crisis and one thing is clear about that
 
01:56:27.669 --> 01:56:27.679 align:start position:0%
crisis and that's that
 
01:56:29.589 --> 01:56:29.599 align:start position:0%
we will not be able to resolve this
 
01:56:31.750 --> 01:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
crisis if we continue to do business as
 
01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:32.390 align:start position:0%
crisis if we continue to do business as
usual

01:56:32.390 --> 01:56:32.400 align:start position:0%
usual
 
01:56:35.589 --> 01:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
so we need to come up with um with new
 
01:56:37.350 --> 01:56:37.360 align:start position:0%
and better ways of
 
01:56:40.390 --> 01:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
improving the service delivery model and
 
01:56:42.229 --> 01:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
it's it's well documented that people
 
01:56:43.830 --> 01:56:43.840 align:start position:0%
with mental illness have long faced
 
01:56:46.149 --> 01:56:46.159 align:start position:0%
discriminatory practices relative to
 
01:56:48.310 --> 01:56:48.320 align:start position:0%
health insurance coverage
 
01:56:51.270 --> 01:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
um by comparison to other disease states
 
01:56:52.550 --> 01:56:52.560 align:start position:0%
but this is um
 
01:56:55.750 --> 01:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
a model that um that lack of parity
 
01:56:57.430 --> 01:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
continues today the new hampshire
 
01:56:58.550 --> 01:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
insurance department
 
01:57:00.310 --> 01:57:00.320 align:start position:0%
has a mental health and addiction
 
01:57:02.629 --> 01:57:02.639 align:start position:0%
advisory council that's worked for
 
01:57:04.470 --> 01:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
several years and this is the type of
 
01:57:05.270 --> 01:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
model that
 
01:57:07.109 --> 01:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
um that has come out of some of those
 
01:57:07.119 --> 01:57:08.790 align:start position:0%
um that has come out of some of those
conversations

01:57:08.790 --> 01:57:08.800 align:start position:0%
conversations
 
01:57:10.950 --> 01:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
it's really a hold over from the days of
 
01:57:13.350 --> 01:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
asylums that we treat people with mental
 
01:57:15.270 --> 01:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
illness in a segregated model of
 
01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
care where their mental health
 
01:57:19.030 --> 01:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
conditions are
 
01:57:22.709 --> 01:57:22.719 align:start position:0%
and substance abuse or addiction are
 
01:57:24.629 --> 01:57:24.639 align:start position:0%
treated separately from their overall
 
01:57:25.990 --> 01:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
care as a person
 
01:57:27.510 --> 01:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
and we certainly know that there's a
 
01:57:29.189 --> 01:57:29.199 align:start position:0%
significant amount of research and
 
01:57:29.199 --> 01:57:30.149 align:start position:0%
significant amount of research and
evidence

01:57:30.149 --> 01:57:30.159 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
01:57:32.390 --> 01:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
showing improved outcomes for patients
 
01:57:34.390 --> 01:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
when their care is integrated and that's
 
01:57:36.390 --> 01:57:36.400 align:start position:0%
both for their mental health treatment
 
01:57:38.310 --> 01:57:38.320 align:start position:0%
as well as for serious medical
 
01:57:40.870 --> 01:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
conditions like diabetes cancer
 
01:57:42.790 --> 01:57:42.800 align:start position:0%
and heart disease where there's a
 
01:57:44.629 --> 01:57:44.639 align:start position:0%
frequency of co-occurrence
 
01:57:47.750 --> 01:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
um with mental illness as you've heard
 
01:57:49.350 --> 01:57:49.360 align:start position:0%
there's a significant shortage of
 
01:57:52.149 --> 01:57:52.159 align:start position:0%
psychiatrists nationwide
 
01:57:54.709 --> 01:57:54.719 align:start position:0%
especially child psychiatrists and new
 
01:57:54.719 --> 01:57:55.589 align:start position:0%
especially child psychiatrists and new
hampshire

01:57:55.589 --> 01:57:55.599 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:57:58.070 --> 01:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
certainly experiences that and so
 
01:57:59.109 --> 01:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
towards that end this
 
01:58:01.669 --> 01:58:01.679 align:start position:0%
the psychiatric collaborative care model
 
01:58:03.030 --> 01:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
can be very effective
 
01:58:04.470 --> 01:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i would mention
 
01:58:07.830 --> 01:58:07.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's key in there
 
01:58:10.390 --> 01:58:10.400 align:start position:0%
is in addition to the care directed by
 
01:58:12.229 --> 01:58:12.239 align:start position:0%
the team and the care management is
 
01:58:14.790 --> 01:58:14.800 align:start position:0%
regular assessments of clinical status
 
01:58:16.629 --> 01:58:16.639 align:start position:0%
using validated tools and i would
 
01:58:18.550 --> 01:58:18.560 align:start position:0%
particularly note that
 
01:58:19.910 --> 01:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
one of those tools that we're now
 
01:58:21.990 --> 01:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
starting to see more regularly used by
 
01:58:24.229 --> 01:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
primary care providers is a life-saving
 
01:58:26.709 --> 01:58:26.719 align:start position:0%
tool and that's screening for suicide
 
01:58:28.550 --> 01:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
suicide's the second leading cause of
 
01:58:30.870 --> 01:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
death in new hampshire in our state
 
01:58:33.589 --> 01:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
and and oftentimes primary care
 
01:58:35.669 --> 01:58:35.679 align:start position:0%
providers are
 
01:58:38.390 --> 01:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
have avoided using those screening tools
 
01:58:39.910 --> 01:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
because they really don't know how to
 
01:58:41.510 --> 01:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
respond if the person
 
01:58:43.669 --> 01:58:43.679 align:start position:0%
answers in the infer in the affirmative
 
01:58:45.990 --> 01:58:46.000 align:start position:0%
so having a psychiatric collaborative
 
01:58:48.390 --> 01:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
care model where they can review
 
01:58:50.310 --> 01:58:50.320 align:start position:0%
what's happening with a psychiatrist
 
01:58:51.430 --> 01:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
what the symptoms are
 
01:58:53.189 --> 01:58:53.199 align:start position:0%
what some of the other characteristics
 
01:58:54.709 --> 01:58:54.719 align:start position:0%
of that individual are
 
01:58:57.669 --> 01:58:57.679 align:start position:0%
can be really helpful in helping to
 
01:59:00.310 --> 01:59:00.320 align:start position:0%
reduce the public health
 
01:59:02.390 --> 01:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
issue that we face relative to suicide
 
01:59:02.400 --> 01:59:03.510 align:start position:0%
issue that we face relative to suicide
prevention

01:59:03.510 --> 01:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
prevention
 
01:59:06.070 --> 01:59:06.080 align:start position:0%
um it's pretty clear as well and has
 
01:59:07.510 --> 01:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
been mentioned that the long run
 
01:59:09.589 --> 01:59:09.599 align:start position:0%
improved outcomes will likely
 
01:59:12.070 --> 01:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
result in overall health and care cost
 
01:59:13.589 --> 01:59:13.599 align:start position:0%
savings as well
 
01:59:17.030 --> 01:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
um and so i'd like to thank senator
 
01:59:18.790 --> 01:59:18.800 align:start position:0%
sherman for sponsoring this important
 
01:59:18.800 --> 01:59:19.350 align:start position:0%
sherman for sponsoring this important
bill

01:59:19.350 --> 01:59:19.360 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:59:20.950 --> 01:59:20.960 align:start position:0%
it's clearly the direction that health
 
01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
care needs to move in
 
01:59:25.109 --> 01:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
and on behalf of nami new hampshire i
 
01:59:26.470 --> 01:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
strongly urge you to vote
 
01:59:31.589 --> 01:59:31.599 align:start position:0%

01:59:39.440 --> 01:59:41.350 align:start position:0%
for dr norton uh
[Music]

01:59:41.350 --> 01:59:41.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:59:45.430 --> 01:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
oh there's a hand up
 
01:59:48.310 --> 01:59:48.320 align:start position:0%
okay representative emma thank you mr
 
01:59:50.310 --> 01:59:50.320 align:start position:0%
sharon thank you for your testimony
 
01:59:51.920 --> 01:59:51.930 align:start position:0%
uh you don't have a question about um
 
01:59:51.930 --> 01:59:53.669 align:start position:0%
uh you don't have a question about um
[Music]

01:59:53.669 --> 01:59:53.679 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:59:55.750 --> 01:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
consent by the patient so let's say
 
01:59:56.709 --> 01:59:56.719 align:start position:0%
someone comes in
 
01:59:59.030 --> 01:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
and they seem kind of mopey and
 
01:59:59.040 --> 02:00:00.470 align:start position:0%
and they seem kind of mopey and
depressed

02:00:00.470 --> 02:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
depressed
 
02:00:02.790 --> 02:00:02.800 align:start position:0%
does the patient know that their primary
 
02:00:04.149 --> 02:00:04.159 align:start position:0%
care physician
 
02:00:06.870 --> 02:00:06.880 align:start position:0%
might be contacting a psychiatrist is
 
02:00:08.229 --> 02:00:08.239 align:start position:0%
that done with
 
02:00:10.310 --> 02:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
patient consent or could that be
 
02:00:13.109 --> 02:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
happening without consent
 
02:00:15.750 --> 02:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
um it would be done with patient consent
 
02:00:17.830 --> 02:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
and i i can't answer that specifically
 
02:00:18.790 --> 02:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
because i'm not
 
02:00:21.189 --> 02:00:21.199 align:start position:0%
um we're not treatment providers dr ho
 
02:00:22.390 --> 02:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
might be able to
 
02:00:25.430 --> 02:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
answer that um more effectively but dr
 
02:00:27.510 --> 02:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
sherman mentioned the integrated
 
02:00:29.430 --> 02:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
delivery networks that we've developed
 
02:00:30.229 --> 02:00:30.239 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
02:00:34.390 --> 02:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:36.870 --> 02:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
an agreement between the patient and the
 
02:00:38.470 --> 02:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
and the provider that in certain
 
02:00:39.990 --> 02:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances information
 
02:00:43.189 --> 02:00:43.199 align:start position:0%
would be shared so um but yes that's a
 
02:00:44.709 --> 02:00:44.719 align:start position:0%
great question because it's really
 
02:00:45.910 --> 02:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
important and
 
02:00:48.070 --> 02:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
ethically speaking it would be a
 
02:00:48.080 --> 02:00:49.030 align:start position:0%
ethically speaking it would be a
requirement

02:00:49.030 --> 02:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
02:00:51.910 --> 02:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
for some informed consent from the
 
02:00:55.589 --> 02:00:55.599 align:start position:0%
patient relative to that
 
02:01:01.189 --> 02:01:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:03.030 --> 02:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you take for
 
02:01:04.390 --> 02:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:01:07.430 --> 02:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
um where do you see um or the question
 
02:01:08.310 --> 02:01:08.320 align:start position:0%
would be
 
02:01:11.990 --> 02:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
um could you see a naturopath
 
02:01:15.510 --> 02:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
um being part of this integrated
 
02:01:18.149 --> 02:01:18.159 align:start position:0%
delivery network in the future because i
 
02:01:18.159 --> 02:01:18.709 align:start position:0%
delivery network in the future because i
think

02:01:18.709 --> 02:01:18.719 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:01:23.910 --> 02:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:26.550 --> 02:01:26.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question um i can't
 
02:01:28.229 --> 02:01:28.239 align:start position:0%
speak to that specifically
 
02:01:31.030 --> 02:01:31.040 align:start position:0%
for this bill because it's not to my
 
02:01:32.229 --> 02:01:32.239 align:start position:0%
knowledge part of that
 
02:01:34.709 --> 02:01:34.719 align:start position:0%
the the psychiatric collaborative care
 
02:01:34.719 --> 02:01:35.350 align:start position:0%
the the psychiatric collaborative care
model

02:01:35.350 --> 02:01:35.360 align:start position:0%
model
 
02:01:37.270 --> 02:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
but i would certainly say from nami new
 
02:01:39.270 --> 02:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire's perspective that we believe
 
02:01:40.629 --> 02:01:40.639 align:start position:0%
that there's many
 
02:01:43.189 --> 02:01:43.199 align:start position:0%
paths to successful recovery and
 
02:01:43.199 --> 02:01:43.830 align:start position:0%
paths to successful recovery and
treatment

02:01:43.830 --> 02:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
02:01:47.189 --> 02:01:47.199 align:start position:0%
and and naturopathy would be one of
 
02:01:48.629 --> 02:01:48.639 align:start position:0%
those and we would hope that you know
 
02:01:49.589 --> 02:01:49.599 align:start position:0%
that that's
 
02:01:52.070 --> 02:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
a consideration for people in terms of
 
02:01:54.470 --> 02:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
alternatives to treatment
 
02:01:57.830 --> 02:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
02:02:00.629 --> 02:02:00.639 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much uh chair will
 
02:02:00.639 --> 02:02:01.030 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much uh chair will
now

02:02:01.030 --> 02:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:02:04.390 --> 02:02:04.400 align:start position:0%
call in sabrina dunlap who represents
 
02:02:09.109 --> 02:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
anthem and is neutral on this bill
 
02:02:10.709 --> 02:02:10.719 align:start position:0%
hi thank you representative hunt and
 
02:02:11.990 --> 02:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
02:02:13.510 --> 02:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
sabrina dunlap and i'm director of
 
02:02:15.910 --> 02:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
government relations at anthem
 
02:02:17.589 --> 02:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
as senator sherman said this bill was
 
02:02:19.589 --> 02:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
around last year and my colleague paula
 
02:02:21.030 --> 02:02:21.040 align:start position:0%
rogers was able to work
 
02:02:23.910 --> 02:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
with senator sherman and providers and
 
02:02:25.270 --> 02:02:25.280 align:start position:0%
others to get the amendment to a place
 
02:02:26.629 --> 02:02:26.639 align:start position:0%
we're more comfortable with
 
02:02:29.510 --> 02:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
so anthem does support the amendment um
 
02:02:31.109 --> 02:02:31.119 align:start position:0%
i do just want to point out that anthem
 
02:02:32.149 --> 02:02:32.159 align:start position:0%
already covers
 
02:02:34.470 --> 02:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
the collaborative care model addressed
 
02:02:35.669 --> 02:02:35.679 align:start position:0%
in the bill and
 
02:02:37.830 --> 02:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
we've been ready to reimburse for this
 
02:02:39.109 --> 02:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
for a while
 
02:02:41.430 --> 02:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
uh the issue is utilization and for some
 
02:02:43.510 --> 02:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
reason providers just not
 
02:02:47.030 --> 02:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
using uh this very often um
 
02:02:49.030 --> 02:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
and my understanding from senator
 
02:02:50.229 --> 02:02:50.239 align:start position:0%
sherman is that the hope is the
 
02:02:51.109 --> 02:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
legislation one
 
02:02:54.470 --> 02:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
will encourage more use um by providers
 
02:02:56.070 --> 02:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
of the model but i did just want to flag
 
02:02:58.149 --> 02:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
that that we do already cover this
 
02:03:00.709 --> 02:03:00.719 align:start position:0%
um so anyway uh we want to thank senator
 
02:03:02.070 --> 02:03:02.080 align:start position:0%
sherman and others
 
02:03:04.950 --> 02:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
for working on the amendment and um
 
02:03:06.470 --> 02:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'm happy to take any
 
02:03:06.480 --> 02:03:08.790 align:start position:0%
thank you and i'm happy to take any
questions

02:03:08.790 --> 02:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:03:10.950 --> 02:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
so do you know of of the other companies
 
02:03:12.629 --> 02:03:12.639 align:start position:0%
whether they also offer it or i know
 
02:03:14.149 --> 02:03:14.159 align:start position:0%
this is kind of an awkward question for
 
02:03:14.159 --> 02:03:14.390 align:start position:0%
this is kind of an awkward question for
you

02:03:14.390 --> 02:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:03:18.870 --> 02:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
but does harvard cover this also
 
02:03:21.750 --> 02:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not 100 sure i would be surprised if
 
02:03:23.589 --> 02:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
other carriers did not also cover this
 
02:03:23.599 --> 02:03:24.390 align:start position:0%
other carriers did not also cover this
model

02:03:24.390 --> 02:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
model
 
02:03:26.709 --> 02:03:26.719 align:start position:0%
okay so the issue is the reason we're
 
02:03:27.589 --> 02:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
putting this in
 
02:03:29.830 --> 02:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
is it's just you will say to get more
 
02:03:31.830 --> 02:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
people to try to take advantage of it
 
02:03:34.950 --> 02:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
because it's there in the statute that
 
02:03:36.390 --> 02:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
is my understanding
 
02:03:40.830 --> 02:03:40.840 align:start position:0%
okay representative abramson has a
 
02:03:40.840 --> 02:03:42.070 align:start position:0%
okay representative abramson has a
question

02:03:42.070 --> 02:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:03:43.669 --> 02:03:43.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh are you able to
 
02:03:45.270 --> 02:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
hear me through the mic
 
02:03:48.629 --> 02:03:48.639 align:start position:0%
yes we are okay uh my
 
02:03:50.470 --> 02:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
my question is my reading of the of this
 
02:03:51.830 --> 02:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
bill is is
 
02:03:57.669 --> 02:03:57.679 align:start position:0%
it does look like a state mandate
 
02:04:03.109 --> 02:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:06.790 --> 02:04:06.800 align:start position:0%
okay um sorry is the question whether
 
02:04:07.990 --> 02:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
it's a mandate
 
02:04:10.390 --> 02:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
yeah yes whether it's a mandate under
 
02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:12.310 align:start position:0%
yeah yes whether it's a mandate under
rsa415

02:04:12.310 --> 02:04:12.320 align:start position:0%
rsa415
 
02:04:14.390 --> 02:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
so i'm probably not the best person to
 
02:04:15.990 --> 02:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
answer that i i assume
 
02:04:17.510 --> 02:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
someone from the new hampshire insurance
 
02:04:19.430 --> 02:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
department will be speaking to this um
 
02:04:21.589 --> 02:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
i would yeah i would leave it there and
 
02:04:23.030 --> 02:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
defer to them
 
02:04:26.149 --> 02:04:26.159 align:start position:0%
okay okay uh tyler had
 
02:04:28.069 --> 02:04:28.079 align:start position:0%
tyler did not sign up to speak but i'm
 
02:04:30.550 --> 02:04:30.560 align:start position:0%
sure he could uh help out there
 
02:04:32.709 --> 02:04:32.719 align:start position:0%
uh well there's not a there's not a
 
02:04:35.750 --> 02:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on this and there's not a
 
02:04:37.990 --> 02:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
there's not a business impact in the
 
02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:38.790 align:start position:0%
there's not a business impact in the
bills

02:04:38.790 --> 02:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
bills
 
02:04:40.709 --> 02:04:40.719 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering what the net effect is
 
02:04:42.069 --> 02:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
going to be on
 
02:04:42.079 --> 02:04:45.669 align:start position:0%
going to be on
insurance

02:04:45.669 --> 02:04:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:48.550 --> 02:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
uh we can we can uh we generally we
 
02:04:48.560 --> 02:04:49.109 align:start position:0%
uh we can we can uh we generally we
don't

02:04:49.109 --> 02:04:49.119 align:start position:0%
don't
 
02:04:51.270 --> 02:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
when a a health insurance mandate it's
 
02:04:52.310 --> 02:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
hard to quantify
 
02:04:54.470 --> 02:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
we do have a process in which we can
 
02:04:55.910 --> 02:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
have the department
 
02:04:59.030 --> 02:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
do an economic review and see if what
 
02:04:59.040 --> 02:04:59.589 align:start position:0%
do an economic review and see if what
the

02:04:59.589 --> 02:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:05:03.430 --> 02:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
the impact of a mandate is but
 
02:05:06.310 --> 02:05:06.320 align:start position:0%
we don't it is true it might not show up
 
02:05:07.510 --> 02:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
on anything
 
02:05:09.830 --> 02:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of the bill or certainly in the
 
02:05:12.550 --> 02:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:16.470 --> 02:05:16.480 align:start position:0%
all set okay uh and we have no more
 
02:05:16.480 --> 02:05:17.430 align:start position:0%
all set okay uh and we have no more
questions

02:05:17.430 --> 02:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:05:20.550 --> 02:05:20.560 align:start position:0%

non-partisan nonprofit

we've been working for more than 20
 
02:06:00.390 --> 02:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
years to address behavioral health
 
02:06:00.400 --> 02:06:01.109 align:start position:0%
years to address behavioral health
issues

02:06:01.109 --> 02:06:01.119 align:start position:0%
issues
 
02:06:03.430 --> 02:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
in our state i don't repeat too much of
 
02:06:04.149 --> 02:06:04.159 align:start position:0%
what's been
 
02:06:05.750 --> 02:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
said this morning uh certainly it's been
 
02:06:07.510 --> 02:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
covered well but i do want to emphasize
 
02:06:09.669 --> 02:06:09.679 align:start position:0%
new future strong support for this bill
 
02:06:11.030 --> 02:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
i know i don't need to tell you about
 
02:06:12.390 --> 02:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
the deep toll that new hampshire's
 
02:06:13.830 --> 02:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
ongoing mental health and addiction
 
02:06:15.510 --> 02:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
crises are having on our state and we
 
02:06:15.990 --> 02:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
feel the
 
02:06:18.629 --> 02:06:18.639 align:start position:0%
covenant we fear the token 19 pandemic
 
02:06:20.390 --> 02:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
will only further exacerbate these
 
02:06:20.400 --> 02:06:21.430 align:start position:0%
will only further exacerbate these
issues

02:06:21.430 --> 02:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
issues
 
02:06:23.430 --> 02:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
under coca 19 more than 30 percent of
 
02:06:25.350 --> 02:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
granite staters are reporting symptoms
 
02:06:27.189 --> 02:06:27.199 align:start position:0%
of anxiety and depression and other
 
02:06:29.189 --> 02:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
mental health concerns according to data
 
02:06:31.270 --> 02:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
from the kaiser family foundation
 
02:06:33.270 --> 02:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
and of those nearly 20 percent reported
 
02:06:35.510 --> 02:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
unmet needs for counseling and therapy
 
02:06:37.830 --> 02:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh care coordination has not long been
 
02:06:38.629 --> 02:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
seen as a
 
02:06:40.069 --> 02:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
as critical to helping our state
 
02:06:41.669 --> 02:06:41.679 align:start position:0%
overcome the ongoing behavioral health
 
02:06:41.679 --> 02:06:42.709 align:start position:0%
overcome the ongoing behavioral health
crises

02:06:42.709 --> 02:06:42.719 align:start position:0%
crises
 
02:06:44.149 --> 02:06:44.159 align:start position:0%
by supporting the collaborative care
 
02:06:46.629 --> 02:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
model sb 59 would go far to enhance care
 
02:06:46.639 --> 02:06:47.750 align:start position:0%
model sb 59 would go far to enhance care
coordination

02:06:47.750 --> 02:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
coordination
 
02:06:49.189 --> 02:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
across our state and to extend
 
02:06:50.790 --> 02:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
behavioral health services for those in
 
02:06:50.800 --> 02:06:51.589 align:start position:0%
behavioral health services for those in
need

02:06:51.589 --> 02:06:51.599 align:start position:0%
need
 
02:06:53.750 --> 02:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh as we've discussed today
 
02:06:55.109 --> 02:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
collaborative care has been shown to
 
02:06:56.550 --> 02:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
eliminate barriers to care
 
02:06:58.470 --> 02:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
improve clinical outcomes and reduce
 
02:07:00.069 --> 02:07:00.079 align:start position:0%
treatment costs for many behavioral
 
02:07:01.270 --> 02:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
health conditions
 
02:07:02.950 --> 02:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
this bill will help to maximize these
 
02:07:05.430 --> 02:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
positive impacts and help us to overcome
 
02:07:07.910 --> 02:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
the ongoing behavioral health crisis so
 
02:07:09.669 --> 02:07:09.679 align:start position:0%
with that we ask you to vote out to pass
 
02:07:13.030 --> 02:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to take questions
 
02:07:16.229 --> 02:07:16.239 align:start position:0%
great uh any questions from the
 
02:07:17.270 --> 02:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
02:07:20.149 --> 02:07:20.159 align:start position:0%
uh i do not see any so thank you very
 
02:07:20.159 --> 02:07:20.709 align:start position:0%
uh i do not see any so thank you very
much

02:07:20.709 --> 02:07:20.719 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:07:24.149 --> 02:07:24.159 align:start position:0%
thank you okay uh peter ragnan
 
02:07:26.629 --> 02:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
for representing harvard uh thank you mr
 
02:07:28.069 --> 02:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
chairman i hope you can all hear me
 
02:07:30.550 --> 02:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh i'll bring you into this but that's
 
02:07:31.350 --> 02:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
all right um
 
02:07:32.790 --> 02:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
uh for the record peter bragdon
 
02:07:34.790 --> 02:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
representing harvard pilgrim healthcare
 
02:07:36.790 --> 02:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
and uh like anthem we're we're neutral
 
02:07:38.550 --> 02:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
on the bill uh we're supportive
 
02:07:39.990 --> 02:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
certainly of the collaborative care
 
02:07:42.390 --> 02:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
model and all the benefits that senator
 
02:07:42.400 --> 02:07:43.350 align:start position:0%
model and all the benefits that senator
sherman

02:07:43.350 --> 02:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
sherman
 
02:07:45.990 --> 02:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh mentioned and like anthem these are
 
02:07:47.109 --> 02:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
things that
 
02:07:50.069 --> 02:07:50.079 align:start position:0%
we do and would cover um and i think the
 
02:07:52.229 --> 02:07:52.239 align:start position:0%
the big problem as sabrina said is just
 
02:07:54.149 --> 02:07:54.159 align:start position:0%
the utilization and perhaps because
 
02:07:56.229 --> 02:07:56.239 align:start position:0%
people don't know what's available so
 
02:07:58.069 --> 02:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
uh i wasn't going to testify since we're
 
02:07:59.669 --> 02:07:59.679 align:start position:0%
neutral but uh since the question was
 
02:08:00.950 --> 02:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
asked i thought i would provide an
 
02:08:00.960 --> 02:08:01.589 align:start position:0%
asked i thought i would provide an
answer

02:08:01.589 --> 02:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
answer
 
02:08:04.470 --> 02:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate it very much and i assume
 
02:08:05.510 --> 02:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
that's all
 
02:08:08.470 --> 02:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
it needs from you so thank you very much
 
02:08:08.480 --> 02:08:09.030 align:start position:0%
it needs from you so thank you very much
okay

02:08:09.030 --> 02:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:08:11.669 --> 02:08:11.679 align:start position:0%
so i have one more person signed up
 
02:08:11.679 --> 02:08:12.790 align:start position:0%
so i have one more person signed up

02:08:23.189 --> 02:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
and i'm promoting you up trolls
 
02:08:25.430 --> 02:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
and i see you with hitchcock are you a
 
02:08:26.950 --> 02:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
doctor bracket
 
02:08:29.830 --> 02:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
yes hi i am charles brackett i'm a
 
02:08:31.030 --> 02:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
primary care physician at
 
02:08:32.950 --> 02:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
dartmouth-hitchcock and part of a team
 
02:08:34.069 --> 02:08:34.079 align:start position:0%
that's implemented
 
02:08:35.589 --> 02:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
implementing the collaborative care
 
02:08:38.470 --> 02:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
model of behavioral health integration
 
02:08:41.189 --> 02:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
into the primary care clinics of our
 
02:08:41.199 --> 02:08:41.990 align:start position:0%
into the primary care clinics of our
system

02:08:41.990 --> 02:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
system
 
02:08:44.069 --> 02:08:44.079 align:start position:0%
um so we've heard about the crisis
 
02:08:45.589 --> 02:08:45.599 align:start position:0%
situation and
 
02:08:47.189 --> 02:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
that there aren't enough psychiatrists
 
02:08:49.109 --> 02:08:49.119 align:start position:0%
to go around but in addition to this
 
02:08:52.069 --> 02:08:52.079 align:start position:0%
lack of psychiatrists stigma and
 
02:08:54.149 --> 02:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
negotiating a complex system
 
02:08:56.629 --> 02:08:56.639 align:start position:0%
are also barriers to behavioral health
 
02:08:56.639 --> 02:08:57.350 align:start position:0%
are also barriers to behavioral health
care

02:08:57.350 --> 02:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
care
 
02:08:59.270 --> 02:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
and integrating behavioral health into
 
02:09:00.870 --> 02:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
primary care can help
 
02:09:03.189 --> 02:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
address these barriers by mainstreaming
 
02:09:05.109 --> 02:09:05.119 align:start position:0%
it making it more
 
02:09:08.310 --> 02:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
kind of a usual
 
02:09:11.830 --> 02:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
part of medical practice
 
02:09:14.069 --> 02:09:14.079 align:start position:0%
and i just would clarify that the
 
02:09:16.470 --> 02:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
collaborative care model is a specific
 
02:09:18.870 --> 02:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
model of health behavioral health
 
02:09:21.750 --> 02:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
integration it is not a co-located model
 
02:09:25.270 --> 02:09:25.280 align:start position:0%
the um the care manager we call them the
 
02:09:26.709 --> 02:09:26.719 align:start position:0%
behavioral health clinician
 
02:09:28.229 --> 02:09:28.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't just manage care they actually
 
02:09:30.830 --> 02:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
do counseling that supports the primary
 
02:09:32.950 --> 02:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
cares interventions
 
02:09:35.990 --> 02:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh pharmacologically and otherwise and
 
02:09:38.229 --> 02:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
and then the behavioral health clinician
 
02:09:40.310 --> 02:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
is supervised by the psychiatrist so
 
02:09:41.189 --> 02:09:41.199 align:start position:0%
usually the
 
02:09:45.189 --> 02:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
psychiatric input is kind of indirect um
 
02:09:47.189 --> 02:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
but the psychiatrist is also available
 
02:09:49.030 --> 02:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
for consultations
 
02:09:50.790 --> 02:09:50.800 align:start position:0%
uh so the impact study of the
 
02:09:52.069 --> 02:09:52.079 align:start position:0%
collaborative care model
 
02:09:54.870 --> 02:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh demonstrated that one dollar spent on
 
02:09:56.950 --> 02:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
collaborative care saves six dollars and
 
02:09:57.750 --> 02:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
fifty cents
 
02:09:59.510 --> 02:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
in overall health costs because it
 
02:10:02.229 --> 02:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
reduces costs for physical conditions
 
02:10:06.790 --> 02:10:06.800 align:start position:0%
and reduces admissions and ed visits
 
02:10:08.390 --> 02:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
and in a fee-for-service environment
 
02:10:10.629 --> 02:10:10.639 align:start position:0%
these savings go to insurers while many
 
02:10:12.069 --> 02:10:12.079 align:start position:0%
of the expenses of the collaborative
 
02:10:13.750 --> 02:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
care model are not covered
 
02:10:16.790 --> 02:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
and are worn by the clinic most insurers
 
02:10:18.550 --> 02:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
have actually recognized this
 
02:10:21.750 --> 02:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
and all of the insurers that we looked
 
02:10:22.870 --> 02:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
into in new hampshire
 
02:10:24.629 --> 02:10:24.639 align:start position:0%
are actually already covering these
 
02:10:26.790 --> 02:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
codes but i think it's important to
 
02:10:28.950 --> 02:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
to make it a requirement to prevent uh
 
02:10:28.960 --> 02:10:30.149 align:start position:0%
to make it a requirement to prevent uh
backsliding

02:10:30.149 --> 02:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
backsliding
 
02:10:33.189 --> 02:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
um so medicare added these these codes
 
02:10:36.149 --> 02:10:36.159 align:start position:0%
in january 2017 to cover these expenses
 
02:10:38.470 --> 02:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
but they've not been widely used as was
 
02:10:38.480 --> 02:10:39.270 align:start position:0%
but they've not been widely used as was
mentioned

02:10:39.270 --> 02:10:39.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
02:10:42.470 --> 02:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
because they're very complex to uh
 
02:10:44.709 --> 02:10:44.719 align:start position:0%
to track the time there's time
 
02:10:47.030 --> 02:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
requirements and other documentation
 
02:10:49.109 --> 02:10:49.119 align:start position:0%
that have to happen in a calendar month
 
02:10:50.550 --> 02:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
so we're three months
 
02:10:53.109 --> 02:10:53.119 align:start position:0%
into our implementation and have not yet
 
02:10:55.030 --> 02:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
built for these codes but we're working
 
02:10:56.790 --> 02:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
towards that goal
 
02:10:59.109 --> 02:10:59.119 align:start position:0%
and we're hoping if we can effectively
 
02:11:00.870 --> 02:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
bill for these codes and cover our costs
 
02:11:02.229 --> 02:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
we can expand
 
02:11:04.470 --> 02:11:04.480 align:start position:0%
uh our model and better meet the
 
02:11:05.750 --> 02:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
behavioral health
 
02:11:07.990 --> 02:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
needs of the population so it's not
 
02:11:09.990 --> 02:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
practical or ethical for us to
 
02:11:11.589 --> 02:11:11.599 align:start position:0%
treat patients differently based on
 
02:11:13.750 --> 02:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
their insurance so it's critical that
 
02:11:15.109 --> 02:11:15.119 align:start position:0%
these billing codes
 
02:11:18.390 --> 02:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
are covered by all payers going forward
 
02:11:20.470 --> 02:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
and i urge you to vote in favor of this
 
02:11:24.470 --> 02:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
bill and i'm happy to take questions
 
02:11:28.870 --> 02:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:30.790 --> 02:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
see none we're all thank you thank you
 
02:11:32.870 --> 02:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
dr brackett
 
02:11:35.350 --> 02:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
okay that's all the people i had signed
 
02:11:35.360 --> 02:11:37.270 align:start position:0%
okay that's all the people i had signed
up

02:11:37.270 --> 02:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:11:39.830 --> 02:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
is anybody else would like to speak uh
 
02:11:43.430 --> 02:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:45.830 --> 02:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
okay i don't see any more hands going up
 
02:11:47.350 --> 02:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
so i think we're good
 
02:11:52.069 --> 02:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
um we had a 119 people in support
 
02:11:55.189 --> 02:11:55.199 align:start position:0%
one opposed not sure where that post
 
02:11:55.199 --> 02:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
one opposed not sure where that post
person

02:11:57.000 --> 02:11:57.010 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:11:57.010 --> 02:11:58.390 align:start position:0%
person

[Music]
 
02:12:01.510 --> 02:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
so otherwise uh
 
02:12:03.910 --> 02:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
i will close the public hearing on
 
02:12:07.109 --> 02:12:07.119 align:start position:0%

02:13:17.350 --> 02:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
yes that would be okay one after the
 
02:13:17.360 --> 02:13:18.550 align:start position:0%
yes that would be okay one after the
other

02:13:18.550 --> 02:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:13:20.950 --> 02:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh you're saying because it's because
 
02:13:23.830 --> 02:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
it's two different issues
 
02:13:25.510 --> 02:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
yes we're we're getting we had one
 
02:13:27.030 --> 02:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
yesterday we're getting more used to
 
02:13:28.870 --> 02:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
this is what how the senate does things
 
02:13:28.880 --> 02:13:29.430 align:start position:0%
this is what how the senate does things
okay

02:13:29.430 --> 02:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:13:32.470 --> 02:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
okay so part one of the bill deals with
 
02:13:34.950 --> 02:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
direct primary care providers and will
 
02:13:36.870 --> 02:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
allow direct referral
 
02:13:39.350 --> 02:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
to medical special specialists without
 
02:13:40.870 --> 02:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
having to have the patient
 
02:13:43.510 --> 02:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
go to another primary care physician to
 
02:13:44.149 --> 02:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
get a
 
02:13:47.589 --> 02:13:47.599 align:start position:0%
in-network referral and we have dr kopp
 
02:13:48.629 --> 02:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
on the line who
 
02:13:51.030 --> 02:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
is al is currently a direct primary care
 
02:13:52.310 --> 02:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
provider in the state
 
02:13:54.709 --> 02:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
and if you're not familiar with direct
 
02:13:56.390 --> 02:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
primary care physicians
 
02:13:59.270 --> 02:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
these are medical individuals that are
 
02:14:01.189 --> 02:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
outside of the insurance network and
 
02:14:01.199 --> 02:14:02.069 align:start position:0%
outside of the insurance network and
they

02:14:02.069 --> 02:14:02.079 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:14:05.109 --> 02:14:05.119 align:start position:0%
provide medical services for a fee on a
 
02:14:05.119 --> 02:14:05.830 align:start position:0%
provide medical services for a fee on a
monthly

02:14:05.830 --> 02:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
monthly
 
02:14:08.950 --> 02:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
or weekly or annual basis
 
02:14:12.069 --> 02:14:12.079 align:start position:0%
and this bill relates to their patients
 
02:14:14.149 --> 02:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
who also have insurance coverage so
 
02:14:16.790 --> 02:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
these would be in-network referrals
 
02:14:19.910 --> 02:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
for the patient um and saving time for
 
02:14:20.790 --> 02:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
the patients
 
02:14:22.069 --> 02:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
where they wouldn't have to go to an
 
02:14:25.189 --> 02:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
additional physician and money
 
02:14:27.990 --> 02:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
ideally for the the health the overall
 
02:14:29.430 --> 02:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
health care cost because
 
02:14:30.629 --> 02:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be an additional
 
02:14:32.470 --> 02:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
physician visit
 
02:14:34.629 --> 02:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
there was a compromise amendment made on
 
02:14:36.470 --> 02:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
the senate side for this portion of the
 
02:14:36.480 --> 02:14:37.589 align:start position:0%
the senate side for this portion of the
bill

02:14:37.589 --> 02:14:37.599 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:14:41.270 --> 02:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to take questions on this
 
02:14:43.589 --> 02:14:43.599 align:start position:0%
part but i believe there's more people
 
02:14:45.270 --> 02:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
on the line who would be better able to
 
02:14:47.030 --> 02:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
answer your questions
 
02:14:49.350 --> 02:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead and you know discuss the
 
02:14:50.870 --> 02:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
other part of the bill okay
 
02:14:53.270 --> 02:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
part two deals with in-network retail
 
02:14:53.280 --> 02:14:54.950 align:start position:0%
part two deals with in-network retail
pharmacies

02:14:54.950 --> 02:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
pharmacies
 
02:14:57.030 --> 02:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
and the what we've seen with the
 
02:14:57.040 --> 02:14:57.990 align:start position:0%
and the what we've seen with the
pandemic

02:14:57.990 --> 02:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
02:15:00.229 --> 02:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
has given rise the need for consumers to
 
02:15:02.310 --> 02:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
shop in alternative ways
 
02:15:04.790 --> 02:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
from curbside pickup to delivery to mail
 
02:15:04.800 --> 02:15:05.430 align:start position:0%
from curbside pickup to delivery to mail
order

02:15:05.430 --> 02:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
order
 
02:15:07.430 --> 02:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
this bill would prohibit pharmacy
 
02:15:09.510 --> 02:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
benefit managers from restricting
 
02:15:11.669 --> 02:15:11.679 align:start position:0%
in-network pharmacies from
 
02:15:15.030 --> 02:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
making or from mailing or delivering
 
02:15:15.040 --> 02:15:15.990 align:start position:0%
making or from mailing or delivering
prescriptions

02:15:15.990 --> 02:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
prescriptions
 
02:15:17.830 --> 02:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
and allow patients to access their
 
02:15:19.270 --> 02:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
medicines in ways that they are
 
02:15:19.280 --> 02:15:19.990 align:start position:0%
medicines in ways that they are
comfortable

02:15:19.990 --> 02:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
comfortable
 
02:15:21.830 --> 02:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
that they are comfortable with and we
 
02:15:23.750 --> 02:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
have pharmacists on the line
 
02:15:26.390 --> 02:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
to go into more detail and again i
 
02:15:28.229 --> 02:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
believe there was a
 
02:15:29.830 --> 02:15:29.840 align:start position:0%
compromise in this piece of the
 
02:15:31.270 --> 02:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
legislation also
 
02:15:34.790 --> 02:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:37.030 --> 02:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
okay great uh is there any questions
 
02:15:38.390 --> 02:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
from the committee members for
 
02:15:40.709 --> 02:15:40.719 align:start position:0%
any of these two parts stupid yes
 
02:15:40.719 --> 02:15:43.669 align:start position:0%
any of these two parts stupid yes
representatives

02:15:43.669 --> 02:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:46.629 --> 02:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
yes um thank you senator hennessey for
 
02:15:47.830 --> 02:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:15:50.229 --> 02:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
um on the first part of the bill if you
 
02:15:52.470 --> 02:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
have out-of-network providers
 
02:15:55.270 --> 02:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
who are going to provide services to to
 
02:15:55.280 --> 02:15:55.750 align:start position:0%
who are going to provide services to to
innate

02:15:55.750 --> 02:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
innate
 
02:15:57.990 --> 02:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
network patients how do you ensure that
 
02:15:59.589 --> 02:15:59.599 align:start position:0%
you have the same quality
 
02:16:02.950 --> 02:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
and and cost um structure that you do
 
02:16:04.629 --> 02:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
for people who are in the network so how
 
02:16:06.229 --> 02:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
are you going to maintain that quality
 
02:16:10.069 --> 02:16:10.079 align:start position:0%
and cost well it's um
 
02:16:12.149 --> 02:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
i probably didn't explain it but it's
 
02:16:14.310 --> 02:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
the patience the patient's decision to
 
02:16:16.870 --> 02:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
have a direct primary care physician
 
02:16:18.709 --> 02:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
and they paid the direct primary care
 
02:16:21.030 --> 02:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
physician and they also purchase
 
02:16:23.669 --> 02:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
additional health insurance and the
 
02:16:26.069 --> 02:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
referral process is no different
 
02:16:28.229 --> 02:16:28.239 align:start position:0%
the the scrutiny that the referral
 
02:16:29.910 --> 02:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
process goes through is no different
 
02:16:33.030 --> 02:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
as if an in-network a primary
 
02:16:36.950 --> 02:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:38.870 --> 02:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
so what would be the reimbursement rate
 
02:16:40.790 --> 02:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
would it be based on what the physician
 
02:16:41.509 --> 02:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
bills or
 
02:16:44.469 --> 02:16:44.479 align:start position:0%
what the so the the direct primary care
 
02:16:46.150 --> 02:16:46.160 align:start position:0%
physician does not get reimbursed
 
02:16:49.030 --> 02:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
at all for this it is the um they are
 
02:16:50.629 --> 02:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
making the referral so this
 
02:16:53.190 --> 02:16:53.200 align:start position:0%
this piece of legislation has to do with
 
02:16:54.469 --> 02:16:54.479 align:start position:0%
referral the
 
02:16:56.629 --> 02:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
having the ability for a direct primary
 
02:16:57.750 --> 02:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
care physician
 
02:17:00.950 --> 02:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
to make a referral to a specialist that
 
02:17:04.629 --> 02:17:04.639 align:start position:0%
is in a a patient's
 
02:17:08.389 --> 02:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
insurance does that make sense so they
 
02:17:11.110 --> 02:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
without having to go to another primary
 
02:17:13.030 --> 02:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
care physician that is in the patient's
 
02:17:13.040 --> 02:17:13.990 align:start position:0%
care physician that is in the patient's
insurance

02:17:13.990 --> 02:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
02:17:18.870 --> 02:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:22.150 --> 02:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you've just muted
 
02:17:22.160 --> 02:17:23.910 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you've just muted
yourself

02:17:23.910 --> 02:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
yourself
 
02:17:27.110 --> 02:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
and in sorry um
 
02:17:30.629 --> 02:17:30.639 align:start position:0%
okay so um senator hennessy
 
02:17:33.270 --> 02:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
let me get this straight so if somebody
 
02:17:34.870 --> 02:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
has the money
 
02:17:38.469 --> 02:17:38.479 align:start position:0%
to make a monthly payment to a doctor
 
02:17:40.150 --> 02:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
that they think will give them better
 
02:17:41.589 --> 02:17:41.599 align:start position:0%
service than if they went
 
02:17:44.950 --> 02:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
in a network and
 
02:17:47.990 --> 02:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
but this but and they have no
 
02:17:50.070 --> 02:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
limitations as far as how often they see
 
02:17:51.190 --> 02:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
this physician
 
02:17:53.669 --> 02:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
is that correct i'm not sure what the
 
02:17:55.990 --> 02:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
limitations are i think it would be in
 
02:17:57.429 --> 02:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
that person's contract with that
 
02:17:58.389 --> 02:17:58.399 align:start position:0%
physician okay
 
02:18:01.190 --> 02:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
but the idea is that this doctor's
 
02:18:02.469 --> 02:18:02.479 align:start position:0%
readily available
 
02:18:05.270 --> 02:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
correct so the patient calls up his
 
02:18:06.709 --> 02:18:06.719 align:start position:0%
readily available
 
02:18:09.270 --> 02:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
his or her readily available doctor who
 
02:18:10.150 --> 02:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
they pay
 
02:18:12.870 --> 02:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
a monthly fee to and the doctor says no
 
02:18:12.880 --> 02:18:14.389 align:start position:0%
a monthly fee to and the doctor says no
no

02:18:14.389 --> 02:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:18:16.150 --> 02:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
you don't have to come see me i'll just
 
02:18:18.389 --> 02:18:18.399 align:start position:0%
refer you to somebody in network
 
02:18:22.629 --> 02:18:22.639 align:start position:0%
it saves money for that
 
02:18:27.349 --> 02:18:27.359 align:start position:0%
so we say boutique doctor
 
02:18:29.030 --> 02:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
and so they don't have to see them they
 
02:18:30.950 --> 02:18:30.960 align:start position:0%
just automatically go directly to the
 
02:18:30.960 --> 02:18:31.750 align:start position:0%
just automatically go directly to the
specialist

02:18:31.750 --> 02:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
specialist
 
02:18:35.509 --> 02:18:35.519 align:start position:0%
is that correct um no i
 
02:18:37.669 --> 02:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
well yes and no in that and i and again
 
02:18:39.190 --> 02:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
there's people on the line that can
 
02:18:40.790 --> 02:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
answer these questions better
 
02:18:43.990 --> 02:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
but the there still is the referral
 
02:18:45.589 --> 02:18:45.599 align:start position:0%
process that they would have to go
 
02:18:47.110 --> 02:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
through with the documentation
 
02:18:49.750 --> 02:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
why does this patient need to go see a
 
02:18:49.760 --> 02:18:50.709 align:start position:0%
why does this patient need to go see a
neurologist

02:18:50.709 --> 02:18:50.719 align:start position:0%
neurologist
 
02:18:54.870 --> 02:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
or an ent or what have you so
 
02:18:56.629 --> 02:18:56.639 align:start position:0%
they they would definitely have seen
 
02:18:58.070 --> 02:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
their patient to determine that a
 
02:19:00.870 --> 02:19:00.880 align:start position:0%
referral is necessary
 
02:19:02.469 --> 02:19:02.479 align:start position:0%
another question for the question may
 
02:19:04.830 --> 02:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
inquire thanks very much
 
02:19:08.870 --> 02:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
um oftentimes
 
02:19:10.629 --> 02:19:10.639 align:start position:0%
referrals are done by phone is that
 
02:19:10.639 --> 02:19:14.070 align:start position:0%
referrals are done by phone is that
correct

02:19:14.070 --> 02:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:15.990 --> 02:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer to your question
 
02:19:18.309 --> 02:19:18.319 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
02:19:20.230 --> 02:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
but if they don't have to have an
 
02:19:22.230 --> 02:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
in-office appointment
 
02:19:25.589 --> 02:19:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:28.230 --> 02:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
so i i see where the confusion is okay
 
02:19:29.990 --> 02:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
the direct primary care physician
 
02:19:32.950 --> 02:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
takes care of the patient what what this
 
02:19:32.960 --> 02:19:33.349 align:start position:0%
takes care of the patient what what this
bill

02:19:33.349 --> 02:19:33.359 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:19:36.870 --> 02:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
would do would take out another primary
 
02:19:37.750 --> 02:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
care physician
 
02:19:40.389 --> 02:19:40.399 align:start position:0%
referral so right now direct primary
 
02:19:42.549 --> 02:19:42.559 align:start position:0%
cares cannot refer
 
02:19:45.990 --> 02:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
to a their patient's other insurance
 
02:19:47.030 --> 02:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
program that they have
 
02:19:49.349 --> 02:19:49.359 align:start position:0%
they're they're specialists so if i have
 
02:19:51.030 --> 02:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
insurance but i choose to go to direct
 
02:19:52.150 --> 02:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
primary care
 
02:19:54.309 --> 02:19:54.319 align:start position:0%
i would want my insurance to cover my
 
02:19:54.319 --> 02:19:55.270 align:start position:0%
i would want my insurance to cover my
specialist

02:19:55.270 --> 02:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
specialist
 
02:19:57.670 --> 02:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
the referrals to my specialists without
 
02:19:58.950 --> 02:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
having to go to
 
02:20:01.190 --> 02:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
additional primary care physician that's
 
02:20:03.349 --> 02:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
in my insurance network
 
02:20:05.110 --> 02:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
to then get another referral to the
 
02:20:05.120 --> 02:20:06.389 align:start position:0%
to then get another referral to the
specialist

02:20:06.389 --> 02:20:06.399 align:start position:0%
specialist
 
02:20:09.830 --> 02:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much that helps yes
 
02:20:13.030 --> 02:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
i think i got it okay so
 
02:20:16.150 --> 02:20:16.160 align:start position:0%
um okay you have you you've made
 
02:20:17.590 --> 02:20:17.600 align:start position:0%

i do practice in the direct primary care
 
02:21:11.510 --> 02:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
model i'm also representing
 
02:21:13.349 --> 02:21:13.359 align:start position:0%
the viewpoints of new hampshire medical
 
02:21:15.670 --> 02:21:15.680 align:start position:0%
society today
 
02:21:19.429 --> 02:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
i'd like to speak to the bill in support
 
02:21:22.630 --> 02:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:26.710 --> 02:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
with a few um points and then i'm happy
 
02:21:27.830 --> 02:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
to come back and address some of the
 
02:21:29.349 --> 02:21:29.359 align:start position:0%
questions and answer any additional
 
02:21:31.429 --> 02:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
questions um the medical society
 
02:21:34.309 --> 02:21:34.319 align:start position:0%
supports this bill in general supporting
 
02:21:35.590 --> 02:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
measures that improve
 
02:21:37.750 --> 02:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
quality of patient care and lower costs
 
02:21:39.030 --> 02:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
to an individual as well as the
 
02:21:40.309 --> 02:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
healthcare system and
 
02:21:42.469 --> 02:21:42.479 align:start position:0%
we feel that direct primary care is a
 
02:21:45.190 --> 02:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
model that achieves these aims
 
02:21:49.270 --> 02:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
we're really at a critical point in in
 
02:21:50.950 --> 02:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
the practice of medicine and healthcare
 
02:21:52.230 --> 02:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
and we're really moving in the wrong
 
02:21:53.590 --> 02:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
direction when it comes to a lot of
 
02:21:53.600 --> 02:21:54.469 align:start position:0%
direction when it comes to a lot of
things

02:21:54.469 --> 02:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:21:56.230 --> 02:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
one of our concerns is the ability to
 
02:21:57.910 --> 02:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
effectively recruit and maintain a
 
02:22:00.469 --> 02:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
stable primary care workforce
 
02:22:02.309 --> 02:22:02.319 align:start position:0%
there was actually an article published
 
02:22:03.910 --> 02:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
yesterday in the annals of internal
 
02:22:03.920 --> 02:22:04.870 align:start position:0%
yesterday in the annals of internal
medicine

02:22:04.870 --> 02:22:04.880 align:start position:0%
medicine
 
02:22:07.429 --> 02:22:07.439 align:start position:0%
reporting that patients living in
 
02:22:07.439 --> 02:22:07.990 align:start position:0%
reporting that patients living in
counties

02:22:07.990 --> 02:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
counties
 
02:22:10.710 --> 02:22:10.720 align:start position:0%
in the u.s with inadequate primary care
 
02:22:13.910 --> 02:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
have a mean life expectancy of 310 days
 
02:22:15.590 --> 02:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
shorter than those
 
02:22:17.830 --> 02:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
living in other counties without such a
 
02:22:19.670 --> 02:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
shortage there are a lot of studies in
 
02:22:22.070 --> 02:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
around the world demonstrating
 
02:22:25.110 --> 02:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
higher contact with primary care
 
02:22:29.429 --> 02:22:29.439 align:start position:0%
leads to lower costs and better outcomes
 
02:22:31.750 --> 02:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
and we know physicians and other
 
02:22:31.760 --> 02:22:32.469 align:start position:0%
and we know physicians and other
providers

02:22:32.469 --> 02:22:32.479 align:start position:0%
providers
 
02:22:34.309 --> 02:22:34.319 align:start position:0%
in primary care especially are burning
 
02:22:36.230 --> 02:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
out at really alarming rates
 
02:22:38.230 --> 02:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
many are leaving clinical practice and
 
02:22:40.550 --> 02:22:40.560 align:start position:0%
this just exacerbates the problem
 
02:22:42.950 --> 02:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
um and you know on a more human level
 
02:22:44.230 --> 02:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
physician suicide
 
02:22:46.309 --> 02:22:46.319 align:start position:0%
is the highest rate of any profession
 
02:22:47.990 --> 02:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
almost double the rate of the general
 
02:22:49.270 --> 02:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
population so
 
02:22:50.790 --> 02:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
at the medical society we really have a
 
02:22:52.309 --> 02:22:52.319 align:start position:0%
vested interest in ensuring that
 
02:22:54.469 --> 02:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
physicians are able to find sustainable
 
02:22:54.479 --> 02:22:54.870 align:start position:0%
physicians are able to find sustainable
and

02:22:54.870 --> 02:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:22:57.190 --> 02:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
healthy ways to stay in practice and be
 
02:22:58.790 --> 02:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
able to serve their patients putting
 
02:22:59.910 --> 02:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
their patients
 
02:23:02.070 --> 02:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
as their primary focus and and direct
 
02:23:05.110 --> 02:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
primary care is one model that can do it
 
02:23:09.190 --> 02:23:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:12.150 --> 02:23:12.160 align:start position:0%
um report that i attached in my email is
 
02:23:13.190 --> 02:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
one from the
 
02:23:15.910 --> 02:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
the society of actuaries uh that was
 
02:23:15.920 --> 02:23:16.630 align:start position:0%
the society of actuaries uh that was
completed

02:23:16.630 --> 02:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
completed
 
02:23:19.750 --> 02:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh last year and it demonstrates some of
 
02:23:21.349 --> 02:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
the concerns that have been
 
02:23:24.469 --> 02:23:24.479 align:start position:0%
raised are really not true that direct
 
02:23:26.790 --> 02:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
primary care which
 
02:23:28.389 --> 02:23:28.399 align:start position:0%
i think most of you are familiar but
 
02:23:29.990 --> 02:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
i'll just review it briefly
 
02:23:34.230 --> 02:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:37.270 --> 02:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
a flat periodic fee the national average
 
02:23:37.280 --> 02:23:37.670 align:start position:0%
a flat periodic fee the national average
is

02:23:37.670 --> 02:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:23:41.349 --> 02:23:41.359 align:start position:0%
i think around 80 to 100 per month um
 
02:23:43.270 --> 02:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
in order to provide primary care
 
02:23:44.870 --> 02:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
services for the patient there's a
 
02:23:47.030 --> 02:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
contract that is signed that defines
 
02:23:48.870 --> 02:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
what services are covered
 
02:23:51.270 --> 02:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
it clearly notifies the patient that
 
02:23:52.070 --> 02:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
02:23:56.070 --> 02:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
itself an insurance plan um
 
02:23:59.990 --> 02:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
the rsa 329 the direct
 
02:24:02.309 --> 02:24:02.319 align:start position:0%
primary care laws actually define what
 
02:24:04.309 --> 02:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
has to be part of that so that patients
 
02:24:07.030 --> 02:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
understand what they're getting into
 
02:24:08.950 --> 02:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
when patients understand that and they
 
02:24:10.710 --> 02:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
seek out a model where the
 
02:24:13.750 --> 02:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
the doctor provider you know unburdens
 
02:24:15.349 --> 02:24:15.359 align:start position:0%
themselves from all the insurance
 
02:24:18.389 --> 02:24:18.399 align:start position:0%
uh administrative uh details and
 
02:24:21.910 --> 02:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
um you end up with a a system with
 
02:24:24.710 --> 02:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
better contact with more direct access
 
02:24:25.910 --> 02:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
better availability
 
02:24:28.550 --> 02:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
lower patient panels longer appointment
 
02:24:30.389 --> 02:24:30.399 align:start position:0%
visits all those things that contribute
 
02:24:30.399 --> 02:24:31.030 align:start position:0%
visits all those things that contribute
to

02:24:31.030 --> 02:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:24:32.950 --> 02:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
a better experience and better quality
 
02:24:34.550 --> 02:24:34.560 align:start position:0%
for that patient
 
02:24:37.270 --> 02:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
when patients are able to combine that
 
02:24:37.280 --> 02:24:37.910 align:start position:0%
when patients are able to combine that
direct

02:24:37.910 --> 02:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
direct
 
02:24:40.950 --> 02:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
payment to the physicians with a health
 
02:24:42.469 --> 02:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
insurance product
 
02:24:44.630 --> 02:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
that often has a higher deductible but a
 
02:24:46.630 --> 02:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
lower monthly premium their monthly out
 
02:24:48.870 --> 02:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
of pocket ends up being the same
 
02:24:51.030 --> 02:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
depending how they utilize it their
 
02:24:52.870 --> 02:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
their yearly expenses are often
 
02:24:54.790 --> 02:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
significantly less
 
02:24:57.990 --> 02:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
um it's it may not be intuitive but uh i
 
02:24:59.670 --> 02:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
can go into as much detail
 
02:25:02.389 --> 02:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
um as needed to to demonstrate that um
 
02:25:04.870 --> 02:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
but it really has been demonstrated and
 
02:25:07.270 --> 02:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
and the um and that that report goes
 
02:25:10.230 --> 02:25:10.240 align:start position:0%
into into details
 
02:25:13.349 --> 02:25:13.359 align:start position:0%
there's been no evidence presented that
 
02:25:15.750 --> 02:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
this increases the cost of care costs of
 
02:25:15.760 --> 02:25:17.349 align:start position:0%
this increases the cost of care costs of
premiums

02:25:17.349 --> 02:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
premiums
 
02:25:18.870 --> 02:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
that there are more inappropriate
 
02:25:21.349 --> 02:25:21.359 align:start position:0%
referrals more patient complaints none
 
02:25:22.230 --> 02:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
of that
 
02:25:25.510 --> 02:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
has has been demonstrated um
 
02:25:28.630 --> 02:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
the reason that this bill is important
 
02:25:28.640 --> 02:25:28.950 align:start position:0%
the reason that this bill is important
is

02:25:28.950 --> 02:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:25:32.630 --> 02:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
really to create parity um
 
02:25:34.550 --> 02:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
this direct primary care model already
 
02:25:37.429 --> 02:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
exists these referrals already occur
 
02:25:40.710 --> 02:25:40.720 align:start position:0%
for all medicare patients for medicaid
 
02:25:42.550 --> 02:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
patients direct primary care physicians
 
02:25:44.469 --> 02:25:44.479 align:start position:0%
who are not a network
 
02:25:46.469 --> 02:25:46.479 align:start position:0%
contracted provider can do those
 
02:25:48.630 --> 02:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
referrals and orders in medicaid
 
02:25:52.230 --> 02:25:52.240 align:start position:0%
in ppo plans and epo plans in
 
02:25:54.630 --> 02:25:54.640 align:start position:0%
certain hmo even anthem has hmo plans
 
02:25:56.630 --> 02:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
that don't require referrals so
 
02:25:58.309 --> 02:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
none of these have shown any kind of
 
02:26:00.070 --> 02:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
deleterious effect
 
02:26:02.870 --> 02:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
of the the physician not being a
 
02:26:02.880 --> 02:26:03.750 align:start position:0%
of the the physician not being a
contracted

02:26:03.750 --> 02:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
contracted
 
02:26:06.230 --> 02:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
member we're not asking for any payment
 
02:26:08.150 --> 02:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
from these plans
 
02:26:09.830 --> 02:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
none of that would change all we're
 
02:26:11.429 --> 02:26:11.439 align:start position:0%
asking is that
 
02:26:14.230 --> 02:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
patients who can't afford these higher
 
02:26:16.630 --> 02:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
plans or who don't qualify for medicare
 
02:26:16.640 --> 02:26:17.670 align:start position:0%
plans or who don't qualify for medicare
medicaid

02:26:17.670 --> 02:26:17.680 align:start position:0%
medicaid
 
02:26:19.910 --> 02:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
can still be able to access the benefits
 
02:26:21.429 --> 02:26:21.439 align:start position:0%
of direct primary care
 
02:26:24.389 --> 02:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
that physicians and providers can
 
02:26:27.030 --> 02:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
provide direct primary care
 
02:26:28.950 --> 02:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
and we feel like this is going to
 
02:26:31.270 --> 02:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
reinforce the patient's right to choose
 
02:26:33.349 --> 02:26:33.359 align:start position:0%
it's going to help lower health care
 
02:26:35.349 --> 02:26:35.359 align:start position:0%
costs and and we hope that you will
 
02:26:39.750 --> 02:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh vote this ought to pass one um
 
02:26:41.270 --> 02:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
comment that i just want to make is that
 
02:26:43.110 --> 02:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
that currently there are only a small
 
02:26:43.120 --> 02:26:44.070 align:start position:0%
that currently there are only a small
handful

02:26:44.070 --> 02:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
handful
 
02:26:46.309 --> 02:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
of uh direct primary care providers in
 
02:26:47.270 --> 02:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
the state there
 
02:26:49.990 --> 02:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
i believe six or seven physicians and a
 
02:26:52.150 --> 02:26:52.160 align:start position:0%
couple of nurse practitioners
 
02:26:55.510 --> 02:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
um uh there was an amendment um
 
02:26:59.670 --> 02:26:59.680 align:start position:0%
to limit this uh as a trial
 
02:27:02.950 --> 02:27:02.960 align:start position:0%
uh period um to 10
 
02:27:06.150 --> 02:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
providers and i would ask that there be
 
02:27:07.190 --> 02:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
a consideration
 
02:27:10.230 --> 02:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
made to amend it to a larger number of
 
02:27:11.190 --> 02:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
providers i
 
02:27:14.070 --> 02:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
don't know what the growth will be but
 
02:27:15.590 --> 02:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
um i would hate for
 
02:27:18.870 --> 02:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
for this to be a factor that again
 
02:27:21.429 --> 02:27:21.439 align:start position:0%
limits a physician or provider from
 
02:27:23.429 --> 02:27:23.439 align:start position:0%
being able to
 
02:27:25.670 --> 02:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
continue to practice clinical medicine
 
02:27:26.630 --> 02:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
in a healthy way
 
02:27:30.070 --> 02:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
so i'd be happy to to take any questions
 
02:27:32.230 --> 02:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
at this time we do uh representative
 
02:27:34.950 --> 02:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
abel has a question
 
02:27:37.110 --> 02:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much for your uh for
 
02:27:38.469 --> 02:27:38.479 align:start position:0%
your testimony and
 
02:27:44.309 --> 02:27:44.319 align:start position:0%
for joining us this morning um i'm
 
02:27:44.319 --> 02:27:45.429 align:start position:0%
for joining us this morning um i'm
wondering

02:27:45.429 --> 02:27:45.439 align:start position:0%
wondering
 
02:27:48.630 --> 02:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
why i want your perspective
 
02:27:52.070 --> 02:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
on why you believe
 
02:27:55.670 --> 02:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
insurance companies are not already
 
02:27:59.270 --> 02:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
honoring your um
 
02:28:02.230 --> 02:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
honoring your referrals since you're not
 
02:28:05.030 --> 02:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
asking them for reimbursement yourself
 
02:28:08.710 --> 02:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
you're a qualified physician uh
 
02:28:11.030 --> 02:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
you're not in their network maybe that's
 
02:28:12.070 --> 02:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
the only reason
 
02:28:14.070 --> 02:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
but i mean i'm gonna ask this to the
 
02:28:15.270 --> 02:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
insurance company
 
02:28:18.469 --> 02:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
people as well i don't understand why
 
02:28:22.469 --> 02:28:22.479 align:start position:0%
uh why they won't
 
02:28:26.389 --> 02:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
accept your referral for for
 
02:28:29.910 --> 02:28:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh for reimbursement by it
 
02:28:32.950 --> 02:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
to another doctor um it's it's an
 
02:28:34.230 --> 02:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
excellent question
 
02:28:37.349 --> 02:28:37.359 align:start position:0%
and it's one that you'll have to ask
 
02:28:38.550 --> 02:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
them because i
 
02:28:40.870 --> 02:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know why it doesn't make sense
 
02:28:42.230 --> 02:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
to me and that's why
 
02:28:45.270 --> 02:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
um i think this bill is important um
 
02:28:49.030 --> 02:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
the the um
 
02:28:51.270 --> 02:28:51.280 align:start position:0%
so i i'd like to hear that from them as
 
02:28:51.280 --> 02:28:53.110 align:start position:0%
so i i'd like to hear that from them as
well

02:28:53.110 --> 02:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:28:55.590 --> 02:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative abramson has a
 
02:28:55.600 --> 02:28:56.630 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative abramson has a
question

02:28:56.630 --> 02:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:28:58.230 --> 02:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:29:00.230 --> 02:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you referenced an
 
02:29:01.990 --> 02:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
amendment during your testimony
 
02:29:05.190 --> 02:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
what was the uh age and line number for
 
02:29:07.830 --> 02:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
the uh provision that you
 
02:29:13.110 --> 02:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:17.910 --> 02:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:21.110 --> 02:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
on line 14 of
 
02:29:24.710 --> 02:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh part one section
 
02:29:27.429 --> 02:29:27.439 align:start position:0%
numeral one line fourteen uh certify the
 
02:29:27.439 --> 02:29:27.990 align:start position:0%
numeral one line fourteen uh certify the
first

02:29:27.990 --> 02:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
first
 
02:29:31.750 --> 02:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:31.760 --> 02:29:35.270 align:start position:0%
 
providers

02:29:35.270 --> 02:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:39.510 --> 02:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
and um if i may make a comment as well
 
02:29:42.630 --> 02:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
um the
 
02:29:44.790 --> 02:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
regarding another change to the to the
 
02:29:46.870 --> 02:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
amendment um
 
02:29:50.630 --> 02:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
one of the the key reasons why direct
 
02:29:51.830 --> 02:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
primary care works
 
02:29:54.950 --> 02:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
is to basically distill down the
 
02:29:56.870 --> 02:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
practice of medicine to the physician
 
02:29:58.150 --> 02:29:58.160 align:start position:0%
and the patient
 
02:30:00.950 --> 02:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
um now obviously physicians are licensed
 
02:30:00.960 --> 02:30:01.270 align:start position:0%
um now obviously physicians are licensed
and

02:30:01.270 --> 02:30:01.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:30:04.309 --> 02:30:04.319 align:start position:0%
and compliant with with um you know all
 
02:30:06.389 --> 02:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
the regulations of the practice of
 
02:30:07.910 --> 02:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
medicine and practicing to the standard
 
02:30:08.630 --> 02:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
of care
 
02:30:10.389 --> 02:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
but what direct primary care is able to
 
02:30:12.550 --> 02:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
do is is reduce the administrative
 
02:30:14.870 --> 02:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
burdens by not contracting with
 
02:30:18.469 --> 02:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
providers and we return this
 
02:30:20.230 --> 02:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
to the patients in terms of time and
 
02:30:22.389 --> 02:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
access um
 
02:30:25.910 --> 02:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
the direct primary care law
 
02:30:29.750 --> 02:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
put the guidance the jurisdiction under
 
02:30:31.590 --> 02:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
that of the board of medicine rather
 
02:30:33.670 --> 02:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
than the insurance department by
 
02:30:35.510 --> 02:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
clearly stating this model and the
 
02:30:37.510 --> 02:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
requirements in order to
 
02:30:40.309 --> 02:30:40.319 align:start position:0%
show that this is not insurance it's not
 
02:30:43.349 --> 02:30:43.359 align:start position:0%
boutique or concierge medicine where
 
02:30:45.349 --> 02:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
um if you're not familiar with the
 
02:30:45.359 --> 02:30:46.710 align:start position:0%
um if you're not familiar with the
distinction

02:30:46.710 --> 02:30:46.720 align:start position:0%
distinction
 
02:30:50.070 --> 02:30:50.080 align:start position:0%
a concierge or boutique practice will be
 
02:30:54.070 --> 02:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
a fee for service practice that bills
 
02:30:56.389 --> 02:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
uh usually to insurance but bills for
 
02:30:57.349 --> 02:30:57.359 align:start position:0%
office visits
 
02:30:59.670 --> 02:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
and also charges the patient
 
02:30:59.680 --> 02:31:00.870 align:start position:0%
and also charges the patient
additionally

02:31:00.870 --> 02:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
additionally
 
02:31:02.950 --> 02:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
we don't do that in direct primary care
 
02:31:02.960 --> 02:31:04.309 align:start position:0%
we don't do that in direct primary care
and

02:31:04.309 --> 02:31:04.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:31:07.030 --> 02:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
we would ask consideration that the
 
02:31:08.230 --> 02:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
oversight uh
 
02:31:10.710 --> 02:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
the serv the the certification as it
 
02:31:11.750 --> 02:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
were that was
 
02:31:13.750 --> 02:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
inserted as an amendment uh the
 
02:31:16.230 --> 02:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
consideration be made to
 
02:31:17.830 --> 02:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
rightfully put that under the board of
 
02:31:19.349 --> 02:31:19.359 align:start position:0%
medicine statutes who have the
 
02:31:19.359 --> 02:31:20.150 align:start position:0%
medicine statutes who have the
jurisdiction

02:31:20.150 --> 02:31:20.160 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
02:31:22.309 --> 02:31:22.319 align:start position:0%
for determining compliance with the
 
02:31:23.910 --> 02:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
direct primary care laws
 
02:31:27.190 --> 02:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
uh mr brannon could probably comment on
 
02:31:27.200 --> 02:31:28.550 align:start position:0%
uh mr brannon could probably comment on
that

02:31:28.550 --> 02:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:31:33.830 --> 02:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:46.950 --> 02:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:54.230 --> 02:31:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:56.630 --> 02:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
okay once again i just did my thank yous
 
02:31:56.640 --> 02:31:58.870 align:start position:0%
okay once again i just did my thank yous
um

02:31:58.870 --> 02:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:01.670 --> 02:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
two questions number one is uh in
 
02:32:03.190 --> 02:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
regards to
 
02:32:06.790 --> 02:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
medicare and medicaid is
 
02:32:11.110 --> 02:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh do they allow you to
 
02:32:15.510 --> 02:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
um make a ref reference uh a referral
 
02:32:19.190 --> 02:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh medic i'm sorry was there more to the
 
02:32:19.200 --> 02:32:20.150 align:start position:0%
uh medic i'm sorry was there more to the
question

02:32:20.150 --> 02:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:32:23.270 --> 02:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
yeah we just heard that there was a lack
 
02:32:23.280 --> 02:32:24.150 align:start position:0%
yeah we just heard that there was a lack
of

02:32:24.150 --> 02:32:24.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:32:26.950 --> 02:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
usage and then then we heard that maybe
 
02:32:26.960 --> 02:32:27.670 align:start position:0%
usage and then then we heard that maybe
that's

02:32:27.670 --> 02:32:27.680 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:32:31.670 --> 02:32:31.680 align:start position:0%
from my perspective was that uh
 
02:32:34.230 --> 02:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
you you can't make a referral to an
 
02:32:34.240 --> 02:32:35.030 align:start position:0%
you you can't make a referral to an
in-network

02:32:35.030 --> 02:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
in-network
 
02:32:37.910 --> 02:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
physician does that apply also to
 
02:32:37.920 --> 02:32:39.349 align:start position:0%
physician does that apply also to
medicare

02:32:39.349 --> 02:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
medicare
 
02:32:42.630 --> 02:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
and medicaid no medicare has a provision
 
02:32:45.670 --> 02:32:45.680 align:start position:0%
to um to register with the pico system
 
02:32:47.270 --> 02:32:47.280 align:start position:0%
as an opted out physician so i'm not
 
02:32:48.790 --> 02:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
receiving payments
 
02:32:52.230 --> 02:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
from medicare but with
 
02:32:55.190 --> 02:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
proper licensure and national provider
 
02:32:56.950 --> 02:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
identification and registration
 
02:32:59.349 --> 02:32:59.359 align:start position:0%
they recognize that referrals and
 
02:33:01.270 --> 02:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
ordering is part of the practice of
 
02:33:01.280 --> 02:33:02.230 align:start position:0%
ordering is part of the practice of
medicine

02:33:02.230 --> 02:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
medicine
 
02:33:04.630 --> 02:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
not the business of insurance and so
 
02:33:06.630 --> 02:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
medicare does have that allowance to be
 
02:33:07.750 --> 02:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
able to do that
 
02:33:11.190 --> 02:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
there are some medicaid some of the hmo
 
02:33:12.550 --> 02:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
plans in medicaid
 
02:33:15.990 --> 02:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
um are restrictive and have not
 
02:33:18.070 --> 02:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
permitted referrals from me
 
02:33:21.510 --> 02:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
however medicaid itself permits me to
 
02:33:24.710 --> 02:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
register as an ordering and uh
 
02:33:27.190 --> 02:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
referring provider again that depends a
 
02:33:28.710 --> 02:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
little bit on which
 
02:33:30.550 --> 02:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
plan is being administered to the
 
02:33:32.230 --> 02:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
medicaid recipient
 
02:33:35.349 --> 02:33:35.359 align:start position:0%
um and it even goes so far with
 
02:33:37.830 --> 02:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
with medicaid they won't permit me to do
 
02:33:39.349 --> 02:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
the prior authorization
 
02:33:42.550 --> 02:33:42.560 align:start position:0%
for for an mri that they will permit me
 
02:33:43.270 --> 02:33:43.280 align:start position:0%
to order so
 
02:33:45.030 --> 02:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of there there are we run
 
02:33:47.510 --> 02:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
into these uh at different times
 
02:33:50.150 --> 02:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
um and and it can be a little bit
 
02:33:50.160 --> 02:33:51.190 align:start position:0%
um and and it can be a little bit
unpredictable

02:33:51.190 --> 02:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
unpredictable
 
02:33:53.590 --> 02:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
and and that's part of what what becomes
 
02:33:53.600 --> 02:33:54.550 align:start position:0%
and and that's part of what what becomes
challenging

02:33:54.550 --> 02:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
challenging
 
02:33:57.110 --> 02:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh to patients when they have an
 
02:33:59.670 --> 02:33:59.680 align:start position:0%
insurance plan that is supposed to cover
 
02:34:03.110 --> 02:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
this service at in-network benefits with
 
02:34:05.830 --> 02:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
this specialist and yet they can't
 
02:34:07.110 --> 02:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
access that
 
02:34:10.790 --> 02:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
um so that that's
 
02:34:14.630 --> 02:34:14.640 align:start position:0%
so it's so uh that answer
 
02:34:18.309 --> 02:34:18.319 align:start position:0%
yes further questions so um
 
02:34:20.790 --> 02:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
that answer sounded to me like sometimes
 
02:34:22.630 --> 02:34:22.640 align:start position:0%
yes sometimes no
 
02:34:24.469 --> 02:34:24.479 align:start position:0%
in terms of being able to make a
 
02:34:25.910 --> 02:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
referral the other
 
02:34:28.389 --> 02:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
the other thing uh this my second
 
02:34:29.990 --> 02:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
question was
 
02:34:32.790 --> 02:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
and i i'll just lay it out there because
 
02:34:33.750 --> 02:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
i don't uh
 
02:34:35.429 --> 02:34:35.439 align:start position:0%
i want to know from these insurance
 
02:34:35.439 --> 02:34:36.870 align:start position:0%
i want to know from these insurance
companies

02:34:36.870 --> 02:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
companies
 
02:34:40.230 --> 02:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
uh why well they're they're next so
 
02:34:41.910 --> 02:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
okay that's that's a question for
 
02:34:43.830 --> 02:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
another another expert okay thank you
 
02:34:44.469 --> 02:34:44.479 align:start position:0%
very much
 
02:34:47.670 --> 02:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
all right okay so uh thank you very much

you
 
02:34:55.349 --> 02:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
signed up twice i think that that uh mr
 
02:34:57.110 --> 02:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
padmore from the medical society
 
02:35:00.389 --> 02:35:00.399 align:start position:0%
had signed in for me uh
 
02:35:02.150 --> 02:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
prospect crossed wires there a little
 
02:35:03.670 --> 02:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
bit so i didn't i want to make sure
 
02:35:05.030 --> 02:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
there weren't two doctor crops in new
 
02:35:05.040 --> 02:35:05.670 align:start position:0%
there weren't two doctor crops in new
hampshire

02:35:05.670 --> 02:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:35:08.630 --> 02:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
okay all right uh so uh i'll now invite
 
02:35:09.990 --> 02:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
sabrina dunlap from
 
02:35:13.190 --> 02:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
anthem to um explain
 
02:35:16.790 --> 02:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
why she is in opposition to this bill
 
02:35:20.630 --> 02:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
to this week thank you representative
 
02:35:22.870 --> 02:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
members of the committee i'm sabrina
 
02:35:24.469 --> 02:35:24.479 align:start position:0%
dunlap director of government relations
 
02:35:26.389 --> 02:35:26.399 align:start position:0%
at anthem and yes we do oppose the first
 
02:35:29.110 --> 02:35:29.120 align:start position:0%
part of sb 97 and the amendment
 
02:35:31.670 --> 02:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
um we're unaware of any problems or
 
02:35:33.670 --> 02:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
barriers to care related to referrals
 
02:35:33.680 --> 02:35:34.070 align:start position:0%
barriers to care related to referrals
and

02:35:34.070 --> 02:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:35:36.790 --> 02:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
i mean generally if there's a problem uh
 
02:35:37.349 --> 02:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
with our
 
02:35:39.110 --> 02:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
you know impacting our members that
 
02:35:40.550 --> 02:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
needs legislation we would have at least
 
02:35:41.670 --> 02:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
heard about it
 
02:35:44.630 --> 02:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
um we honor referrals now and it seems
 
02:35:46.309 --> 02:35:46.319 align:start position:0%
like there's a perception that there's a
 
02:35:47.670 --> 02:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
problem without an actual
 
02:35:49.750 --> 02:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
problem uh so we've really questioned
 
02:35:51.750 --> 02:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
the need for this legislation
 
02:35:53.670 --> 02:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
and as for the amendment we're just
 
02:35:55.429 --> 02:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
puzzled by it um
 
02:35:57.349 --> 02:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
our system doesn't really know about
 
02:35:58.790 --> 02:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
referrals as they come in so i'm not
 
02:36:00.150 --> 02:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
sure how we'd collect information on
 
02:36:02.150 --> 02:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
these direct primary care doctors
 
02:36:03.510 --> 02:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
even if we could i'm not sure the
 
02:36:05.750 --> 02:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
information would be timely or helpful
 
02:36:06.790 --> 02:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
and i also don't know how we'd
 
02:36:08.630 --> 02:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
operationalize what the amendment is
 
02:36:10.150 --> 02:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
asking of us so so it's quite
 
02:36:12.389 --> 02:36:12.399 align:start position:0%
problematic on a few levels
 
02:36:14.630 --> 02:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
um and as a more general matter we do
 
02:36:16.230 --> 02:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
have concerns for our members
 
02:36:17.990 --> 02:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
as we see more happening in the direct
 
02:36:19.670 --> 02:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
primary care space and potential for
 
02:36:19.680 --> 02:36:20.389 align:start position:0%
primary care space and potential for
confusion

02:36:20.389 --> 02:36:20.399 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
02:36:23.030 --> 02:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
for patients and as you you heard um
 
02:36:24.790 --> 02:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
direct primary care is outside the scope
 
02:36:26.230 --> 02:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
of the insurance regulations and
 
02:36:27.990 --> 02:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
statutes and outside the scope of the
 
02:36:30.150 --> 02:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire insurance department
 
02:36:31.510 --> 02:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
and really it's only for those who can
 
02:36:33.510 --> 02:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
afford this model of care and i
 
02:36:33.520 --> 02:36:35.670 align:start position:0%
afford this model of care and i
mentioned

02:36:35.670 --> 02:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
02:36:37.429 --> 02:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
this to note that direct primary care
 
02:36:39.190 --> 02:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
you know it functions in its own realm
 
02:36:40.710 --> 02:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure that's always clear to
 
02:36:40.720 --> 02:36:41.670 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure that's always clear to
patients

02:36:41.670 --> 02:36:41.680 align:start position:0%
patients
 
02:36:42.950 --> 02:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
and i know that's sort of a bigger
 
02:36:45.349 --> 02:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
picture issue on direct primary care but
 
02:36:46.870 --> 02:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
um i did want to mention that is
 
02:36:48.710 --> 02:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
something you know that we're very aware
 
02:36:49.990 --> 02:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
of so
 
02:36:51.830 --> 02:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
in closing i'd say this is you know i
 
02:36:53.510 --> 02:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
see this as legislation
 
02:36:55.510 --> 02:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
sort of in search of a problem and and i
 
02:36:56.710 --> 02:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
think the amendment would actually
 
02:36:57.990 --> 02:36:58.000 align:start position:0%
create problems so
 
02:36:59.670 --> 02:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
we certainly hope this bill does not
 
02:37:01.110 --> 02:37:01.120 align:start position:0%
move forward um
 
02:37:03.510 --> 02:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
and thank you and i'm happy to take any
 
02:37:03.520 --> 02:37:05.190 align:start position:0%
and thank you and i'm happy to take any
questions

02:37:05.190 --> 02:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:37:06.389 --> 02:37:06.399 align:start position:0%
okay we do have a question
 
02:37:13.830 --> 02:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:17.590 --> 02:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:20.790 --> 02:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
currently as an insurance pro as an
 
02:37:25.190 --> 02:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:28.309 --> 02:37:28.319 align:start position:0%
do you uh
 
02:37:31.349 --> 02:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
you're saying you do not require
 
02:37:34.550 --> 02:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
the uh the original physic
 
02:37:38.070 --> 02:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
the primary physician making the
 
02:37:42.469 --> 02:37:42.479 align:start position:0%
referral uh be a member of your network
 
02:37:47.110 --> 02:37:47.120 align:start position:0%
in order to ensure the patient
 
02:37:50.230 --> 02:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
with uh with
 
02:37:54.550 --> 02:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
with a specialist that that's um
 
02:37:57.750 --> 02:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
that's a network uh or is the or
 
02:38:01.349 --> 02:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
or is it that you prevent you will not
 
02:38:05.030 --> 02:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
automatically take a referral to someone
 
02:38:07.110 --> 02:38:07.120 align:start position:0%
out of network
 
02:38:10.309 --> 02:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
i hope i asked that asset
 
02:38:13.990 --> 02:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
in in a reasonable way but um
 
02:38:15.990 --> 02:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i'm i'm not
 
02:38:18.389 --> 02:38:18.399 align:start position:0%
sure i understood the second part but
 
02:38:21.830 --> 02:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
um i will say i mean most most
 
02:38:25.030 --> 02:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
plans don't require referrals anyway so
 
02:38:25.590 --> 02:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
we can
 
02:38:26.950 --> 02:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
start with the fact that this is a very
 
02:38:29.349 --> 02:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
small number of plans to begin with
 
02:38:32.870 --> 02:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
um and my understanding of how
 
02:38:36.070 --> 02:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
the process works is that um
 
02:38:38.389 --> 02:38:38.399 align:start position:0%
you know a referral coming from in
 
02:38:40.790 --> 02:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
network or out of network
 
02:38:42.550 --> 02:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
or a direct primary care provider would
 
02:38:44.950 --> 02:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
not be a barrier to someone
 
02:38:47.270 --> 02:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
seeing a specialist who's who is in
 
02:38:47.280 --> 02:38:51.590 align:start position:0%
seeing a specialist who's who is in
network

02:38:51.590 --> 02:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:54.950 --> 02:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
okay a follow-up question yes
 
02:38:59.110 --> 02:38:59.120 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um does this mean that
 
02:39:04.790 --> 02:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:07.830 --> 02:39:07.840 align:start position:0%
later that same individual that the
 
02:39:09.429 --> 02:39:09.439 align:start position:0%
patient will be told
 
02:39:11.270 --> 02:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh we're sorry you went to see the
 
02:39:13.349 --> 02:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
specialist but the specialist wasn't the
 
02:39:13.359 --> 02:39:14.150 align:start position:0%
specialist but the specialist wasn't the
network

02:39:14.150 --> 02:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
network
 
02:39:16.389 --> 02:39:16.399 align:start position:0%
so we're not going to cover you uh
 
02:39:18.150 --> 02:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
that's when the that's when the patient
 
02:39:19.110 --> 02:39:19.120 align:start position:0%
finds out
 
02:39:22.150 --> 02:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
uh are you saying that's that's not not
 
02:39:22.710 --> 02:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
the case
 
02:39:26.150 --> 02:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:27.670 --> 02:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
so i think i just heard you mention
 
02:39:29.270 --> 02:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
specialists who are out of network which
 
02:39:31.270 --> 02:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
is sort of a different
 
02:39:34.550 --> 02:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
issue um i think than what's before us
 
02:39:34.560 --> 02:39:35.590 align:start position:0%
issue um i think than what's before us
but

02:39:35.590 --> 02:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:39:39.190 --> 02:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
all right um i'm happy to i am happy to
 
02:39:41.030 --> 02:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
get down more in the weeds and follow up
 
02:39:43.110 --> 02:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
with an email or or another conversation
 
02:39:44.150 --> 02:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
i'm just not quite sure i'm
 
02:39:44.160 --> 02:39:45.349 align:start position:0%
i'm just not quite sure i'm
understanding

02:39:45.349 --> 02:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
02:39:49.990 --> 02:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:51.590 --> 02:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
he suddenly muted himself oh you took
 
02:39:56.790 --> 02:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:59.270 --> 02:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
good thing i'm not a surgeon put the
 
02:40:03.670 --> 02:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:06.870 --> 02:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
all right so uh
 
02:40:10.550 --> 02:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
a specialist sees uh i mean a patient
 
02:40:11.429 --> 02:40:11.439 align:start position:0%
sees the
 
02:40:15.110 --> 02:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
specialist in network uh
 
02:40:18.710 --> 02:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
and there's there are no cases where
 
02:40:22.469 --> 02:40:22.479 align:start position:0%
uh you then tell them that they can't
 
02:40:27.349 --> 02:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:29.670 --> 02:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
like that that never happens that never
 
02:40:31.269 --> 02:40:31.279 align:start position:0%
happens with anthem
 
02:40:34.469 --> 02:40:34.479 align:start position:0%
well i i would never say
 
02:40:37.030 --> 02:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
never about anything but in general it
 
02:40:39.190 --> 02:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
is my understanding that that's correct
 
02:40:39.200 --> 02:40:39.670 align:start position:0%
is my understanding that that's correct
that

02:40:39.670 --> 02:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:40:42.389 --> 02:40:42.399 align:start position:0%
if you see somebody in network who's a
 
02:40:42.399 --> 02:40:43.429 align:start position:0%
if you see somebody in network who's a
specialist

02:40:43.429 --> 02:40:43.439 align:start position:0%
specialist
 
02:40:45.590 --> 02:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
um there's the distinctions with
 
02:40:47.429 --> 02:40:47.439 align:start position:0%
referrals is not relevant
 
02:40:49.830 --> 02:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of how that specialist is then
 
02:40:51.349 --> 02:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
covered and they they would be covered
 
02:40:54.630 --> 02:40:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:58.070 --> 02:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
okay great um all right
 
02:41:01.510 --> 02:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh so next up
 
02:41:07.990 --> 02:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:09.870 --> 02:41:09.880 align:start position:0%
samuel mccready
 
02:41:09.880 --> 02:41:11.990 align:start position:0%
samuel mccready
[Music]

02:41:11.990 --> 02:41:12.000 align:start position:0%

02:41:28.840 --> 02:41:29.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:41:29.990 --> 02:41:30.000 align:start position:0%

02:41:31.990 --> 02:41:32.000 align:start position:0%
okay can you hear me yes we can thank
 
02:41:33.110 --> 02:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
you hi um
 
02:41:35.269 --> 02:41:35.279 align:start position:0%
samuel mccready um i'm a family
 
02:41:37.750 --> 02:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
physician uh in gorham new hampshire
 
02:41:40.469 --> 02:41:40.479 align:start position:0%
um i actually had some written comments
 
02:41:40.479 --> 02:41:40.870 align:start position:0%
um i actually had some written comments
uh

02:41:40.870 --> 02:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:41:42.550 --> 02:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
that i had submitted and then i had a
 
02:41:43.910 --> 02:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
brief summary of those that i was going
 
02:41:44.630 --> 02:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
to present here
 
02:41:47.590 --> 02:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
honestly i feel like dr crop pretty much
 
02:41:49.110 --> 02:41:49.120 align:start position:0%
covered all of my points and so i don't
 
02:41:50.070 --> 02:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
want to waste
 
02:41:52.550 --> 02:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
the the committee member's time uh by
 
02:41:54.950 --> 02:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
repeating the same stuff over and over
 
02:41:57.429 --> 02:41:57.439 align:start position:0%
i would just reiterate the direct
 
02:41:58.710 --> 02:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
primary care
 
02:42:01.349 --> 02:42:01.359 align:start position:0%
is not the same thing as concierge care
 
02:42:02.790 --> 02:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
it is not about cherry picking
 
02:42:05.110 --> 02:42:05.120 align:start position:0%
wealthy patients or or any of that kind
 
02:42:06.550 --> 02:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
of stuff
 
02:42:07.830 --> 02:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
if that were the case i wouldn't be in
 
02:42:09.990 --> 02:42:10.000 align:start position:0%
gorham new hampshire you know which is
 
02:42:11.830 --> 02:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
probably the most economically depressed
 
02:42:13.590 --> 02:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
area of the state
 
02:42:16.389 --> 02:42:16.399 align:start position:0%
direct primary care really is about as
 
02:42:16.790 --> 02:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
the name
 
02:42:18.630 --> 02:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
implies establishing a direct
 
02:42:21.750 --> 02:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
relationship with the patient
 
02:42:23.349 --> 02:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
for the last i guess three and a half
 
02:42:25.190 --> 02:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
years up until the late summer of last
 
02:42:25.200 --> 02:42:25.670 align:start position:0%
years up until the late summer of last
year

02:42:25.670 --> 02:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:42:28.309 --> 02:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
i was employed in gorham by a federally
 
02:42:29.910 --> 02:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
qualified community health center i was
 
02:42:29.920 --> 02:42:30.150 align:start position:0%
qualified community health center i was
an

02:42:30.150 --> 02:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
an
 
02:42:33.190 --> 02:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
in-network provider eric described a lot
 
02:42:34.630 --> 02:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:42:36.550 --> 02:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
problems in the primary care space with
 
02:42:38.230 --> 02:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
physician burnout and increased
 
02:42:40.389 --> 02:42:40.399 align:start position:0%
suicide risks and all that and frankly
 
02:42:41.590 --> 02:42:41.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's the direction i was
 
02:42:41.600 --> 02:42:42.230 align:start position:0%
that's that's the direction i was
heading

02:42:42.230 --> 02:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
heading
 
02:42:44.469 --> 02:42:44.479 align:start position:0%
um you know i was typical day for me
 
02:42:45.910 --> 02:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
would be to show up at work at eight
 
02:42:46.950 --> 02:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the morning
 
02:42:48.950 --> 02:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
and work through lunch and leave the
 
02:42:49.990 --> 02:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
clinic anywhere from
 
02:42:52.790 --> 02:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
around 9pm until sometimes midnight the
 
02:42:54.230 --> 02:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
majority of that time was not
 
02:42:56.230 --> 02:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
spent seeing patients the vast majority
 
02:42:57.429 --> 02:42:57.439 align:start position:0%
of that time was spent
 
02:42:59.590 --> 02:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
dealing with paperwork and bureaucratic
 
02:42:59.600 --> 02:43:00.550 align:start position:0%
dealing with paperwork and bureaucratic
requirements

02:43:00.550 --> 02:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
02:43:03.030 --> 02:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
that are part of the the fee for service
 
02:43:05.110 --> 02:43:05.120 align:start position:0%
insurance driven system i'm not here to
 
02:43:06.870 --> 02:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
get into the weeds of the insurance
 
02:43:09.030 --> 02:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
driven system i'm not anti-insurance or
 
02:43:10.710 --> 02:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
hate insurance or any of that
 
02:43:12.550 --> 02:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
but just the simple reality is that the
 
02:43:14.150 --> 02:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
system's broken i think everybody can
 
02:43:16.389 --> 02:43:16.399 align:start position:0%
agree that there's some major problems
 
02:43:19.750 --> 02:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
um and and direct primary care and
 
02:43:21.030 --> 02:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
and these are thoughts that i that i
 
02:43:22.550 --> 02:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
hear over and over when i talk to other
 
02:43:24.309 --> 02:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
direct primary care providers around the
 
02:43:24.319 --> 02:43:25.190 align:start position:0%
direct primary care providers around the
country

02:43:25.190 --> 02:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
country
 
02:43:27.429 --> 02:43:27.439 align:start position:0%
it's it's a safety valve it's it's a way
 
02:43:29.110 --> 02:43:29.120 align:start position:0%
to say hey i still want to stay in
 
02:43:30.790 --> 02:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
practice i still want to serve my
 
02:43:33.750 --> 02:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
community and take care of patients
 
02:43:35.750 --> 02:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
but man the current system is getting in
 
02:43:37.990 --> 02:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
the way of that um you know and so
 
02:43:40.389 --> 02:43:40.399 align:start position:0%
i left my job back in the summer a
 
02:43:41.750 --> 02:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
couple of months ago i launched a
 
02:43:43.990 --> 02:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
private direct primary care practice
 
02:43:47.110 --> 02:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
um i i i have not been in the space
 
02:43:48.630 --> 02:43:48.640 align:start position:0%
nearly as long as eric crop
 
02:43:50.950 --> 02:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
you know so i i i'll refer any questions
 
02:43:52.790 --> 02:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
over to him you know as far as
 
02:43:54.710 --> 02:43:54.720 align:start position:0%
actual experience with with problems
 
02:43:56.469 --> 02:43:56.479 align:start position:0%
with hmos because i personally haven't
 
02:43:57.910 --> 02:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
been doing it long enough to really run
 
02:44:00.230 --> 02:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
into any big personal problems
 
02:44:02.469 --> 02:44:02.479 align:start position:0%
i will say that when i was an in-network
 
02:44:04.070 --> 02:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
provider i certainly did there was an
 
02:44:05.349 --> 02:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
awful lot of bureaucratic
 
02:44:07.349 --> 02:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
red tape and you know having to get
 
02:44:09.110 --> 02:44:09.120 align:start position:0%
prior authorizations and
 
02:44:10.389 --> 02:44:10.399 align:start position:0%
you know you have a patient that's been
 
02:44:12.070 --> 02:44:12.080 align:start position:0%
on a medicine for years and suddenly
 
02:44:13.910 --> 02:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
they you know want that medicine changed
 
02:44:15.510 --> 02:44:15.520 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that
 
02:44:17.510 --> 02:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
you know if miss dunlap is saying that
 
02:44:18.790 --> 02:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
anthem you know
 
02:44:20.870 --> 02:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
isn't going to ever you know stop a
 
02:44:22.950 --> 02:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
referral from a non-network primary care
 
02:44:22.960 --> 02:44:23.750 align:start position:0%
referral from a non-network primary care
provider

02:44:23.750 --> 02:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
provider
 
02:44:25.990 --> 02:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
great that's good news to me i would say
 
02:44:27.349 --> 02:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
if that's the case they shouldn't have a
 
02:44:28.710 --> 02:44:28.720 align:start position:0%
problem with this bill you know if
 
02:44:30.150 --> 02:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
that's their their position then they
 
02:44:31.269 --> 02:44:31.279 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have a problem with it being
 
02:44:31.990 --> 02:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
in the law
 
02:44:33.190 --> 02:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
that they're not going to stop that
 
02:44:36.230 --> 02:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
referral and at the end of the day
 
02:44:38.070 --> 02:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
i'm about a mile right now my house is
 
02:44:39.510 --> 02:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
about a mile from the clinic where i
 
02:44:40.550 --> 02:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
used to work
 
02:44:42.790 --> 02:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
in that clinic i supervised mid-level
 
02:44:45.429 --> 02:44:45.439 align:start position:0%
providers nurse practitioners and pas
 
02:44:47.590 --> 02:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
right now if one of my patients comes to
 
02:44:49.030 --> 02:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
me and i say gosh
 
02:44:51.670 --> 02:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
this guy needs to go see a cardiologist
 
02:44:53.269 --> 02:44:53.279 align:start position:0%
and i make the referral
 
02:44:55.030 --> 02:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
if the hmo says it has to be an
 
02:44:57.670 --> 02:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
in-network pcp making that referral
 
02:44:59.030 --> 02:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
my patient now has to go make an
 
02:45:01.190 --> 02:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
appointment and see somebody down the
 
02:45:01.830 --> 02:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
road who
 
02:45:03.110 --> 02:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
a few months ago i was actually the
 
02:45:04.870 --> 02:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
supervising physician for
 
02:45:06.630 --> 02:45:06.640 align:start position:0%
to see if they'll agree with my medical
 
02:45:08.790 --> 02:45:08.800 align:start position:0%
judgment and agree with that referral
 
02:45:11.030 --> 02:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
you know as far as the the questions
 
02:45:12.870 --> 02:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
that came up earlier about quality of
 
02:45:14.469 --> 02:45:14.479 align:start position:0%
out out-of-network providers
 
02:45:16.230 --> 02:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
you know i don't know what to say i'm a
 
02:45:18.230 --> 02:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
board-certified family physician
 
02:45:19.830 --> 02:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
i've been fully vetted by the state of
 
02:45:21.110 --> 02:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and have a full and
 
02:45:23.349 --> 02:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
unrestricted medical license
 
02:45:26.630 --> 02:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
i have a caqh profile which is
 
02:45:28.389 --> 02:45:28.399 align:start position:0%
basically a credentialing profile that's
 
02:45:30.469 --> 02:45:30.479 align:start position:0%
public uh publicly available to any
 
02:45:31.670 --> 02:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
insurance company
 
02:45:32.950 --> 02:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
um you know they can go and they can
 
02:45:34.870 --> 02:45:34.880 align:start position:0%
look at my credentials
 
02:45:36.710 --> 02:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
my credentials haven't changed from you
 
02:45:38.070 --> 02:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
know a few months ago when i was an
 
02:45:39.349 --> 02:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
in-network provider
 
02:45:42.630 --> 02:45:42.640 align:start position:0%
and they haven't changed at all you know
 
02:45:44.950 --> 02:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
ultimately this is about basically
 
02:45:46.389 --> 02:45:46.399 align:start position:0%
removing barriers to care
 
02:45:47.990 --> 02:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
it's about being able to provide
 
02:45:50.230 --> 02:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
patients with good quality care that
 
02:45:51.510 --> 02:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
they can afford
 
02:45:53.990 --> 02:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
again this isn't a concierge practice my
 
02:45:56.630 --> 02:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
prices are on my website gorhamdpc.com
 
02:45:58.230 --> 02:45:58.240 align:start position:0%
they're transparent they're very
 
02:45:58.240 --> 02:45:59.190 align:start position:0%
they're transparent they're very
affordable

02:45:59.190 --> 02:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
affordable
 
02:46:00.870 --> 02:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
and frankly you know i don't have it
 
02:46:02.790 --> 02:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
officially written on the website but
 
02:46:04.630 --> 02:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
i have never turned away a patient due
 
02:46:05.830 --> 02:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
to inability to pay
 
02:46:07.590 --> 02:46:07.600 align:start position:0%
and if someone showed up on my doorstep
 
02:46:09.110 --> 02:46:09.120 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and said i'm homeless and have
 
02:46:10.070 --> 02:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
no money but i
 
02:46:11.670 --> 02:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
i'm you know need somebody to help me
 
02:46:12.870 --> 02:46:12.880 align:start position:0%
with my blood pressure i'm going to help
 
02:46:13.429 --> 02:46:13.439 align:start position:0%
them out
 
02:46:15.110 --> 02:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
you know and and i think the vast
 
02:46:16.870 --> 02:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
majority of family physicians
 
02:46:19.910 --> 02:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
whether they're dpc doctors or not i
 
02:46:21.110 --> 02:46:21.120 align:start position:0%
think the vast majority of family
 
02:46:21.120 --> 02:46:21.750 align:start position:0%
think the vast majority of family
physicians

02:46:21.750 --> 02:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
physicians
 
02:46:23.990 --> 02:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
feel that way you know if obviously we
 
02:46:25.269 --> 02:46:25.279 align:start position:0%
all have bills to pay
 
02:46:27.269 --> 02:46:27.279 align:start position:0%
you know and you know but if i were in
 
02:46:28.469 --> 02:46:28.479 align:start position:0%
for the money i want to be a family
 
02:46:28.479 --> 02:46:29.190 align:start position:0%
for the money i want to be a family
physician

02:46:29.190 --> 02:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
physician
 
02:46:31.349 --> 02:46:31.359 align:start position:0%
there's much more lucrative and less
 
02:46:32.469 --> 02:46:32.479 align:start position:0%
onerous uh
 
02:46:35.590 --> 02:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh specialties to go into um again i
 
02:46:36.469 --> 02:46:36.479 align:start position:0%
feel like dr
 
02:46:38.150 --> 02:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
covered things much better than i am i
 
02:46:39.830 --> 02:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
did submit written testimony which goes
 
02:46:42.070 --> 02:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
into a ridiculous amount of detail
 
02:46:44.070 --> 02:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
um yeah i'm happy to entertain questions
 
02:46:47.429 --> 02:46:47.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:51.110 --> 02:46:51.120 align:start position:0%

heidi

02:47:22.309 --> 02:47:22.319 align:start position:0%

02:47:36.710 --> 02:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
um good morning mr chairman and members
 
02:47:37.510 --> 02:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
02:47:39.830 --> 02:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is heidi kroll i
 
02:47:40.790 --> 02:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
work at um
 
02:47:42.870 --> 02:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
gallagher callahan and gartrell and i'm
 
02:47:44.710 --> 02:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
here today representing america's health
 
02:47:46.469 --> 02:47:46.479 align:start position:0%
insurance plans which is
 
02:47:49.429 --> 02:47:49.439 align:start position:0%
otherwise known as ahip um we ahip
 
02:47:50.950 --> 02:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
appreciates the amendments that were
 
02:47:52.790 --> 02:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
made in the senate to try to improve
 
02:47:56.309 --> 02:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
sb 97 however we do remain
 
02:47:59.030 --> 02:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
opposed to part one of the bill um and
 
02:48:01.750 --> 02:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
we would respectfully request that um
 
02:48:03.590 --> 02:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
you find part one in expedient to
 
02:48:03.600 --> 02:48:05.429 align:start position:0%
you find part one in expedient to
legislate

02:48:05.429 --> 02:48:05.439 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
02:48:06.790 --> 02:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
as you've heard a little bit about this
 
02:48:09.269 --> 02:48:09.279 align:start position:0%
section of the bill deals with
 
02:48:12.630 --> 02:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
so-called direct primary care physicians
 
02:48:14.389 --> 02:48:14.399 align:start position:0%
and so direct primary care physicians
 
02:48:16.230 --> 02:48:16.240 align:start position:0%
are pcps who choose
 
02:48:19.429 --> 02:48:19.439 align:start position:0%
not to be in insurance networks or to be
 
02:48:20.950 --> 02:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
part of insurance networks
 
02:48:23.990 --> 02:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
instead uh direct pcps only serve
 
02:48:25.590 --> 02:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
patients who have entered into
 
02:48:27.830 --> 02:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
a special contract with them where the
 
02:48:30.309 --> 02:48:30.319 align:start position:0%
patient agrees to pay a monthly fee
 
02:48:33.030 --> 02:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
to the out of to this out of network pcp
 
02:48:34.710 --> 02:48:34.720 align:start position:0%
and then the patient also agrees to pay
 
02:48:37.030 --> 02:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
out of pocket for any services
 
02:48:39.590 --> 02:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
that the pcp renders and as you've heard
 
02:48:41.429 --> 02:48:41.439 align:start position:0%
under new hampshire law
 
02:48:44.070 --> 02:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
the direct primary care contract is not
 
02:48:46.070 --> 02:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
health insurance and so the patient
 
02:48:48.070 --> 02:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
typically also has health insurance in
 
02:48:49.349 --> 02:48:49.359 align:start position:0%
addition to the
 
02:48:52.309 --> 02:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
special contract arrangement and so the
 
02:48:53.190 --> 02:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
issue is
 
02:48:55.750 --> 02:48:55.760 align:start position:0%
when an out-of-network direct pcp refers
 
02:48:57.990 --> 02:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
someone to an in-network specialist to
 
02:48:59.910 --> 02:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
what extent is the resulting claim
 
02:48:59.920 --> 02:49:01.110 align:start position:0%
what extent is the resulting claim
covered

02:49:01.110 --> 02:49:01.120 align:start position:0%
covered
 
02:49:04.230 --> 02:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
and so this bill says that the claim um
 
02:49:06.870 --> 02:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
should be should always be covered as if
 
02:49:08.790 --> 02:49:08.800 align:start position:0%
the referral had been made by an
 
02:49:08.800 --> 02:49:09.830 align:start position:0%
the referral had been made by an
in-network

02:49:09.830 --> 02:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
in-network
 
02:49:14.469 --> 02:49:14.479 align:start position:0%
pcp um so it's important to note that
 
02:49:16.790 --> 02:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
in-network pcps are first of all
 
02:49:19.030 --> 02:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
credentialed by the carrier
 
02:49:21.030 --> 02:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
credentialing cert certainly goes above
 
02:49:22.710 --> 02:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
and beyond
 
02:49:25.269 --> 02:49:25.279 align:start position:0%
just being board certified there's
 
02:49:26.870 --> 02:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
actually statutory
 
02:49:29.269 --> 02:49:29.279 align:start position:0%
requirements around the carrier
 
02:49:29.279 --> 02:49:30.870 align:start position:0%
requirements around the carrier
credentialing

02:49:30.870 --> 02:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
credentialing
 
02:49:33.990 --> 02:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
providers that are in network and
 
02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:35.670 align:start position:0%
providers that are in network and
secondly

02:49:35.670 --> 02:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
02:49:39.110 --> 02:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
pcps are often work under a value-based
 
02:49:40.630 --> 02:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
care model which means their
 
02:49:42.710 --> 02:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
reimbursement is tied to the quality of
 
02:49:44.790 --> 02:49:44.800 align:start position:0%
care provided to their patients
 
02:49:47.429 --> 02:49:47.439 align:start position:0%
and rewards both effectiveness of care
 
02:49:49.030 --> 02:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
and efficiency
 
02:49:51.670 --> 02:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
and so out of network direct pcps are
 
02:49:54.389 --> 02:49:54.399 align:start position:0%
not credentialed by the carrier and they
 
02:49:56.150 --> 02:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
are not operating under this type of
 
02:49:57.830 --> 02:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
value-based care model
 
02:50:00.070 --> 02:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
and so ahib's concern is that this bill
 
02:50:01.910 --> 02:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
is trying to give providers who are out
 
02:50:02.630 --> 02:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
of network
 
02:50:05.670 --> 02:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
on the benefits of being in-network by
 
02:50:07.429 --> 02:50:07.439 align:start position:0%
allowing them to make referrals to
 
02:50:07.439 --> 02:50:07.990 align:start position:0%
allowing them to make referrals to
in-network

02:50:07.990 --> 02:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
in-network
 
02:50:09.510 --> 02:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
specialists and then extending the
 
02:50:11.510 --> 02:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
coverage benefits
 
02:50:14.389 --> 02:50:14.399 align:start position:0%
to the resulting claims to the best of
 
02:50:16.309 --> 02:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
our knowledge this type of legislation
 
02:50:18.309 --> 02:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
only exists in one other state in the
 
02:50:20.389 --> 02:50:20.399 align:start position:0%
entire country
 
02:50:22.389 --> 02:50:22.399 align:start position:0%
and as af is concerned about several
 
02:50:24.230 --> 02:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
negative impacts if the bill
 
02:50:26.790 --> 02:50:26.800 align:start position:0%
um were to pass here in new hampshire um
 
02:50:28.230 --> 02:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
first we were concerned that this bill
 
02:50:30.230 --> 02:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
would undermine the carrier's ability to
 
02:50:32.230 --> 02:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
build and maintain networks
 
02:50:34.830 --> 02:50:34.840 align:start position:0%
um especially primary care panels within
 
02:50:34.840 --> 02:50:36.150 align:start position:0%
um especially primary care panels within
networks

02:50:36.150 --> 02:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
networks
 
02:50:38.550 --> 02:50:38.560 align:start position:0%
which will in turn erode the value of
 
02:50:40.630 --> 02:50:40.640 align:start position:0%
networks for new hampshire citizens and
 
02:50:44.710 --> 02:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
employers who pay the insurance premiums
 
02:50:47.030 --> 02:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
as you know providers that join networks
 
02:50:47.040 --> 02:50:47.910 align:start position:0%
as you know providers that join networks
typically

02:50:47.910 --> 02:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
typically
 
02:50:49.990 --> 02:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
agree to price concessions which
 
02:50:51.990 --> 02:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
translate into lower premiums and lower
 
02:50:54.070 --> 02:50:54.080 align:start position:0%
costs for healthcare consumers
 
02:50:55.590 --> 02:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
and in exchange for making price
 
02:50:58.630 --> 02:50:58.640 align:start position:0%
concessions the net the in-network pcps
 
02:51:00.389 --> 02:51:00.399 align:start position:0%
are given the opportunity to care for
 
02:51:01.910 --> 02:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
the carrier's members
 
02:51:03.990 --> 02:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
um including you know referring those
 
02:51:05.750 --> 02:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
members to in-network specialists when
 
02:51:07.990 --> 02:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
necessary and appropriate
 
02:51:11.190 --> 02:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
um if direct pcps are given referral
 
02:51:14.550 --> 02:51:14.560 align:start position:0%
parity uh there would be you know
 
02:51:16.790 --> 02:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
no to at least a lesser benefit or
 
02:51:19.590 --> 02:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
advantage to being an in-network pcp
 
02:51:21.750 --> 02:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
and the concern is that in network pcps
 
02:51:23.269 --> 02:51:23.279 align:start position:0%
would stop agreeing to the price
 
02:51:24.710 --> 02:51:24.720 align:start position:0%
concessions and of course that would put
 
02:51:26.790 --> 02:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
upper pressure on premiums and co-pays
 
02:51:28.150 --> 02:51:28.160 align:start position:0%
and deductibles
 
02:51:30.469 --> 02:51:30.479 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire's residents and
 
02:51:30.479 --> 02:51:31.670 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire's residents and
employers

02:51:31.670 --> 02:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
employers
 
02:51:33.269 --> 02:51:33.279 align:start position:0%
in addition we're concerned that this
 
02:51:35.750 --> 02:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
bill could cause problems with patients
 
02:51:37.830 --> 02:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
care management and lead to fragmented
 
02:51:37.840 --> 02:51:38.230 align:start position:0%
care management and lead to fragmented
care

02:51:38.230 --> 02:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
care
 
02:51:39.830 --> 02:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
because you'll be trying to manage a
 
02:51:42.389 --> 02:51:42.399 align:start position:0%
person's specialty care in-network but
 
02:51:44.389 --> 02:51:44.399 align:start position:0%
the pcpu is ordering the appointments
 
02:51:46.630 --> 02:51:46.640 align:start position:0%
with the specialist is out of network
 
02:51:49.110 --> 02:51:49.120 align:start position:0%
um and you know again fragmented care
 
02:51:50.950 --> 02:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
could also lead to upward pressure on
 
02:51:53.910 --> 02:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
on health care costs i would also add
 
02:51:55.429 --> 02:51:55.439 align:start position:0%
that one of the challenges with direct
 
02:51:56.469 --> 02:51:56.479 align:start position:0%
primary care
 
02:51:58.870 --> 02:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
is that as you've heard it is only a
 
02:52:00.150 --> 02:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
choice for consumers who
 
02:52:02.150 --> 02:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
who can afford to enter into these
 
02:52:04.070 --> 02:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
arrangements and we think it's important
 
02:52:04.469 --> 02:52:04.479 align:start position:0%
to be
 
02:52:07.110 --> 02:52:07.120 align:start position:0%
just be careful that the choice of a
 
02:52:09.269 --> 02:52:09.279 align:start position:0%
relative few number of people does not
 
02:52:11.590 --> 02:52:11.600 align:start position:0%
drive up the cost for everyone else
 
02:52:14.710 --> 02:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
um there's two final points i'd like to
 
02:52:14.720 --> 02:52:15.269 align:start position:0%
um there's two final points i'd like to
make

02:52:15.269 --> 02:52:15.279 align:start position:0%
make
 
02:52:17.110 --> 02:52:17.120 align:start position:0%
one is that whether this is a pilot
 
02:52:18.630 --> 02:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
program or not as you heard the
 
02:52:20.309 --> 02:52:20.319 align:start position:0%
amendment turns this into a pilot
 
02:52:20.319 --> 02:52:21.349 align:start position:0%
amendment turns this into a pilot
program

02:52:21.349 --> 02:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:52:23.990 --> 02:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
um carriers would need to upgrade their
 
02:52:25.429 --> 02:52:25.439 align:start position:0%
systems to somehow
 
02:52:29.030 --> 02:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
flag the direct pcps or put them in a
 
02:52:31.030 --> 02:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
special category
 
02:52:34.070 --> 02:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
separate from in-network pcps and
 
02:52:34.870 --> 02:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
separate from
 
02:52:38.070 --> 02:52:38.080 align:start position:0%
other out-of-network pcps who are not
 
02:52:42.710 --> 02:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
direct pcps so that the claims generated
 
02:52:45.910 --> 02:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
um when direct pcps make referrals
 
02:52:48.469 --> 02:52:48.479 align:start position:0%
network specialists would be treated the
 
02:52:51.030 --> 02:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
same as if the referral had been made
 
02:52:54.469 --> 02:52:54.479 align:start position:0%
by an in-network pcp um and these system
 
02:52:54.479 --> 02:52:55.190 align:start position:0%
by an in-network pcp um and these system
upgrades

02:52:55.190 --> 02:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
upgrades
 
02:52:57.269 --> 02:52:57.279 align:start position:0%
you know would result in additional
 
02:52:58.710 --> 02:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
costs that would also need to be
 
02:53:01.190 --> 02:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
recovered in premiums
 
02:53:03.830 --> 02:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
um and finally you know there's been at
 
02:53:05.190 --> 02:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
least some discussion that this bill
 
02:53:07.110 --> 02:53:07.120 align:start position:0%
could save the insurance carrier's money
 
02:53:08.630 --> 02:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
because patients who are
 
02:53:11.269 --> 02:53:11.279 align:start position:0%
in these contracts with the direct pcp
 
02:53:13.030 --> 02:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
will pay out of pocket for some of their
 
02:53:14.950 --> 02:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
primary care services
 
02:53:17.429 --> 02:53:17.439 align:start position:0%
um however a believes that any such
 
02:53:18.630 --> 02:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
savings will be
 
02:53:21.110 --> 02:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
more than offset by losing the value of
 
02:53:23.110 --> 02:53:23.120 align:start position:0%
credentialed in network providers
 
02:53:24.870 --> 02:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
by losing price concessions from
 
02:53:26.790 --> 02:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
in-network providers
 
02:53:28.790 --> 02:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
by increasing costs associated
 
02:53:30.790 --> 02:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
potentially with fragmented care
 
02:53:32.309 --> 02:53:32.319 align:start position:0%
and then by incurring the cost to
 
02:53:34.389 --> 02:53:34.399 align:start position:0%
upgrade the systems in order to track
 
02:53:35.510 --> 02:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
the claims
 
02:53:37.910 --> 02:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
associated with referrals made by an out
 
02:53:38.790 --> 02:53:38.800 align:start position:0%
of network
 
02:53:41.510 --> 02:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
direct pcp and so for this reason for
 
02:53:42.710 --> 02:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
these reasons
 
02:53:45.750 --> 02:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
as opposed to part one of sb97 and we
 
02:53:47.670 --> 02:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
respectfully request that you find part
 
02:53:49.750 --> 02:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
one in expedient to legislate
 
02:53:52.389 --> 02:53:52.399 align:start position:0%
um i appreciate your time and listening
 
02:53:53.030 --> 02:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
to this
 
02:53:54.630 --> 02:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
testimony and i'd be happy to try to
 
02:53:57.990 --> 02:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:59.670 --> 02:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
okay we do have some questions
 
02:54:01.429 --> 02:54:01.439 align:start position:0%
representative herbert is
 
02:54:05.429 --> 02:54:05.439 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you chairman hunt
 
02:54:08.550 --> 02:54:08.560 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh
 
02:54:11.670 --> 02:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
um mr scroll or miss carl um
 
02:54:11.680 --> 02:54:14.469 align:start position:0%
um mr scroll or miss carl um
[Music]

02:54:14.469 --> 02:54:14.479 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:54:17.750 --> 02:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
it's been said that uh that every this
 
02:54:19.590 --> 02:54:19.600 align:start position:0%
this business is covered in mental
 
02:54:21.269 --> 02:54:21.279 align:start position:0%
health uh care
 
02:54:25.030 --> 02:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
is uh insurable and and is insured
 
02:54:28.309 --> 02:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
um but then at the same time the
 
02:54:31.429 --> 02:54:31.439 align:start position:0%
uh spokesman said spokespeople said
 
02:54:33.830 --> 02:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
we're a little surprised that it isn't
 
02:54:35.190 --> 02:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
being utilized
 
02:54:38.630 --> 02:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
a lot and i'm just curious as to what
 
02:54:39.590 --> 02:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
you might think
 
02:54:43.030 --> 02:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
may be the cause of something not being
 
02:54:44.469 --> 02:54:44.479 align:start position:0%
utilized that is
 
02:54:48.230 --> 02:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
everybody agrees needs to be far
 
02:54:51.990 --> 02:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
better utilized my question is do you
 
02:54:53.590 --> 02:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
have any idea why it's not being
 
02:54:53.600 --> 02:54:55.269 align:start position:0%
have any idea why it's not being
utilized

02:54:55.269 --> 02:54:55.279 align:start position:0%
utilized
 
02:54:58.230 --> 02:54:58.240 align:start position:0%
so representative are you referring to
 
02:54:58.240 --> 02:54:58.630 align:start position:0%
so representative are you referring to
the

02:54:58.630 --> 02:54:58.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:55:01.590 --> 02:55:01.600 align:start position:0%
collaborative care model that was
 
02:55:01.600 --> 02:55:03.110 align:start position:0%
collaborative care model that was
disgusting

02:55:03.110 --> 02:55:03.120 align:start position:0%
disgusting
 
02:55:05.750 --> 02:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
yes i'm referring to this legislation
 
02:55:05.760 --> 02:55:07.429 align:start position:0%
yes i'm referring to this legislation
because

02:55:07.429 --> 02:55:07.439 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:55:09.590 --> 02:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
there's i'm getting two different
 
02:55:11.830 --> 02:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
answers it sounds like to me
 
02:55:14.710 --> 02:55:14.720 align:start position:0%
and that is one from the direct care
 
02:55:14.720 --> 02:55:15.510 align:start position:0%
and that is one from the direct care
physicians

02:55:15.510 --> 02:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
physicians
 
02:55:19.110 --> 02:55:19.120 align:start position:0%
and that is that they cannot
 
02:55:22.309 --> 02:55:22.319 align:start position:0%
make referrals and and then the
 
02:55:24.389 --> 02:55:24.399 align:start position:0%
insurance company is saying
 
02:55:26.230 --> 02:55:26.240 align:start position:0%
well one of the insurance
 
02:55:27.830 --> 02:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
representatives said well no that's not
 
02:55:29.190 --> 02:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
an issue at all
 
02:55:31.990 --> 02:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
and but i'm hearing from you that it
 
02:55:34.070 --> 02:55:34.080 align:start position:0%
most definitely is an issue
 
02:55:35.590 --> 02:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
so i'm trying to get i'm trying to get
 
02:55:36.950 --> 02:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
everything straightened out in my own
 
02:55:36.960 --> 02:55:37.590 align:start position:0%
everything straightened out in my own
mind

02:55:37.590 --> 02:55:37.600 align:start position:0%
mind
 
02:55:39.830 --> 02:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
yeah and i think i you know i think that
 
02:55:41.670 --> 02:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
certain plans are
 
02:55:43.269 --> 02:55:43.279 align:start position:0%
you know there's a variety of plan
 
02:55:45.110 --> 02:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
options and so
 
02:55:47.590 --> 02:55:47.600 align:start position:0%
you know i think as you've heard there
 
02:55:50.230 --> 02:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
are plan options where
 
02:55:53.510 --> 02:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
a patient does not need to worry about
 
02:55:55.750 --> 02:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
where the referral is coming from
 
02:55:57.590 --> 02:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
whether it's coming from an in-network
 
02:55:57.600 --> 02:55:58.710 align:start position:0%
whether it's coming from an in-network
pcp

02:55:58.710 --> 02:55:58.720 align:start position:0%
pcp
 
02:56:01.750 --> 02:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
or an out-of-network pcp and i guess i
 
02:56:03.670 --> 02:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
would say that if you're
 
02:56:06.230 --> 02:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
if you're one of those patients who can
 
02:56:06.240 --> 02:56:07.349 align:start position:0%
if you're one of those patients who can
afford

02:56:07.349 --> 02:56:07.359 align:start position:0%
afford
 
02:56:10.469 --> 02:56:10.479 align:start position:0%
um to engage in
 
02:56:11.990 --> 02:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
in an arrangement like this where you're
 
02:56:13.510 --> 02:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
paying a monthly
 
02:56:15.510 --> 02:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
fee i think we heard earlier somewhere
 
02:56:17.030 --> 02:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
between 80 and 100
 
02:56:19.590 --> 02:56:19.600 align:start position:0%
a month and you're also able to pay out
 
02:56:21.590 --> 02:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
of pocket for
 
02:56:24.550 --> 02:56:24.560 align:start position:0%
any services that are provided to you by
 
02:56:26.150 --> 02:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
that pcp
 
02:56:29.110 --> 02:56:29.120 align:start position:0%
um and then you want to be able to have
 
02:56:29.120 --> 02:56:29.429 align:start position:0%
um and then you want to be able to have
uh

02:56:29.429 --> 02:56:29.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:56:33.190 --> 02:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
kind of referrals coming from that
 
02:56:35.670 --> 02:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
pcp then i think you know you have the
 
02:56:35.680 --> 02:56:36.309 align:start position:0%
pcp then i think you know you have the
option

02:56:36.309 --> 02:56:36.319 align:start position:0%
option
 
02:56:38.710 --> 02:56:38.720 align:start position:0%
i think there are products out there in
 
02:56:40.469 --> 02:56:40.479 align:start position:0%
the market that you could
 
02:56:44.309 --> 02:56:44.319 align:start position:0%
um purchase for insurance products where
 
02:56:44.870 --> 02:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
you would
 
02:56:46.309 --> 02:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
not have to worry about where the
 
02:56:49.110 --> 02:56:49.120 align:start position:0%
referral is coming from
 
02:56:51.429 --> 02:56:51.439 align:start position:0%
i the only answer i get other part of
 
02:56:52.870 --> 02:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
the answer i guess i have for you is
 
02:56:53.590 --> 02:56:53.600 align:start position:0%
that maybe
 
02:56:55.750 --> 02:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
not everybody feels like they can afford
 
02:56:56.790 --> 02:56:56.800 align:start position:0%
that extra
 
02:57:00.150 --> 02:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
100 a month and paying for the the pcp
 
02:57:03.990 --> 02:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:07.670 --> 02:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
thank you okay representative mccleary
 
02:57:09.830 --> 02:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and i may have a
 
02:57:09.840 --> 02:57:10.710 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and i may have a
follow-up

02:57:10.710 --> 02:57:10.720 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:57:14.150 --> 02:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
um um miss kroll do you have any idea
 
02:57:15.670 --> 02:57:15.680 align:start position:0%
how many out of
 
02:57:18.790 --> 02:57:18.800 align:start position:0%
network dpc doctors there
 
02:57:22.469 --> 02:57:22.479 align:start position:0%
are in new hampshire um
 
02:57:25.510 --> 02:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
i have not done that research i'd heard
 
02:57:28.389 --> 02:57:28.399 align:start position:0%
um during the testimony in the senate
 
02:57:29.670 --> 02:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
that there was somewhere in the
 
02:57:30.870 --> 02:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
neighborhood of
 
02:57:34.309 --> 02:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
four to six um so i'm
 
02:57:36.950 --> 02:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
but i don't know that information
 
02:57:38.950 --> 02:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
directly based on my own research that's
 
02:57:40.309 --> 02:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
only what i heard
 
02:57:44.230 --> 02:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:47.030 --> 02:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
in that case would it not be much of an
 
02:57:47.040 --> 02:57:49.190 align:start position:0%
in that case would it not be much of an
impact

02:57:49.190 --> 02:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
impact
 
02:57:50.469 --> 02:57:50.479 align:start position:0%
i mean there's only four to six
 
02:57:53.190 --> 02:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
physicians that would be affected it
 
02:57:55.030 --> 02:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
would seem to me that
 
02:57:58.389 --> 02:57:58.399 align:start position:0%
by uh approving this bill
 
02:58:01.429 --> 02:58:01.439 align:start position:0%
uh it really wouldn't make that big of a
 
02:58:01.439 --> 02:58:01.990 align:start position:0%
uh it really wouldn't make that big of a
deal

02:58:01.990 --> 02:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
deal
 
02:58:04.790 --> 02:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
am i wrong on that well i think i think
 
02:58:06.550 --> 02:58:06.560 align:start position:0%
the issue is that you know again if
 
02:58:06.560 --> 02:58:07.110 align:start position:0%
the issue is that you know again if
you're

02:58:07.110 --> 02:58:07.120 align:start position:0%
you're
 
02:58:10.389 --> 02:58:10.399 align:start position:0%
a patient using these direct primary
 
02:58:11.830 --> 02:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
care physicians
 
02:58:14.790 --> 02:58:14.800 align:start position:0%
um then like i said there are insurance
 
02:58:17.110 --> 02:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
products out there that you could
 
02:58:19.590 --> 02:58:19.600 align:start position:0%
choose that would like like the
 
02:58:21.190 --> 02:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
representative from anthem indicated
 
02:58:21.750 --> 02:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
they have
 
02:58:23.750 --> 02:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
products that it doesn't matter where
 
02:58:25.750 --> 02:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
the referral came from whether it came
 
02:58:27.510 --> 02:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
from an in-network pcp
 
02:58:30.790 --> 02:58:30.800 align:start position:0%
or an out-of-network pcp and so if that
 
02:58:32.389 --> 02:58:32.399 align:start position:0%
if that's important to you then that
 
02:58:34.710 --> 02:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
could be you know then you could
 
02:58:36.550 --> 02:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
those products are out there for you to
 
02:58:38.309 --> 02:58:38.319 align:start position:0%
purchase but i think the issue is that
 
02:58:38.319 --> 02:58:39.269 align:start position:0%
purchase but i think the issue is that
for

02:58:39.269 --> 02:58:39.279 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:58:41.830 --> 02:58:41.840 align:start position:0%
for certain products that are structured
 
02:58:43.510 --> 02:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
so that the referral does
 
02:58:47.269 --> 02:58:47.279 align:start position:0%
matter those networks have been
 
02:58:49.350 --> 02:58:49.360 align:start position:0%
designed with that um
 
02:58:49.360 --> 02:58:50.710 align:start position:0%
designed with that um
[Music]

02:58:50.710 --> 02:58:50.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:58:54.150 --> 02:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
criteria um or characteristic in mind
 
02:58:54.790 --> 02:58:54.800 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:58:56.469 --> 02:58:56.479 align:start position:0%
this gets back to the kind of the value
 
02:58:57.830 --> 02:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
of networks
 
02:59:01.110 --> 02:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
where um you know you've you've
 
02:59:03.910 --> 02:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
um you know that relationship between
 
02:59:05.910 --> 02:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
the carrier and the provider where the
 
02:59:08.309 --> 02:59:08.319 align:start position:0%
provider is making concessions in terms
 
02:59:08.319 --> 02:59:08.630 align:start position:0%
provider is making concessions in terms
of

02:59:08.630 --> 02:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:59:11.590 --> 02:59:11.600 align:start position:0%
pricing and reimbursement in exchange
 
02:59:11.600 --> 02:59:12.830 align:start position:0%
pricing and reimbursement in exchange
for

02:59:12.830 --> 02:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:59:16.309 --> 02:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
um the the privilege i guess
 
02:59:19.110 --> 02:59:19.120 align:start position:0%
to manage the care of the patients that
 
02:59:20.630 --> 02:59:20.640 align:start position:0%
are in that product
 
02:59:22.790 --> 02:59:22.800 align:start position:0%
um and so i i think that's part of the
 
02:59:23.910 --> 02:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
concern and
 
02:59:26.630 --> 02:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
also as i mentioned um at least some
 
02:59:28.389 --> 02:59:28.399 align:start position:0%
pcps are operating
 
02:59:32.550 --> 02:59:32.560 align:start position:0%
under value-based care management models
 
02:59:36.550 --> 02:59:36.560 align:start position:0%
where their reimbursement is tied to
 
02:59:39.510 --> 02:59:39.520 align:start position:0%
how well and how effectively they're
 
02:59:42.309 --> 02:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
managing the care of their patients
 
02:59:45.750 --> 02:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
and that care includes appropriate and
 
02:59:45.760 --> 02:59:47.750 align:start position:0%
and that care includes appropriate and
necessary

02:59:47.750 --> 02:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
02:59:49.910 --> 02:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
referrals to in-network specialists and
 
02:59:49.920 --> 02:59:51.030 align:start position:0%
referrals to in-network specialists and
avoiding

02:59:51.030 --> 02:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
avoiding
 
02:59:53.110 --> 02:59:53.120 align:start position:0%
referrals that are not necessary and not
 
02:59:54.790 --> 02:59:54.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate and so
 
02:59:57.510 --> 02:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
if you all of a sudden interject um an
 
02:59:57.520 --> 02:59:58.870 align:start position:0%
if you all of a sudden interject um an
out-of-network

02:59:58.870 --> 02:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
out-of-network
 
03:00:00.790 --> 03:00:00.800 align:start position:0%
direct primary care physician who all of
 
03:00:03.030 --> 03:00:03.040 align:start position:0%
a sudden starts making referrals
 
03:00:05.590 --> 03:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
um that's gonna have a financial impact
 
03:00:07.750 --> 03:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
on that in-network pcp
 
03:00:10.070 --> 03:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
um and it's something the in-network pcp
 
03:00:11.269 --> 03:00:11.279 align:start position:0%
has no control over
 
03:00:13.910 --> 03:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
so i think it's just trying to respect
 
03:00:15.429 --> 03:00:15.439 align:start position:0%
that um
 
03:00:18.230 --> 03:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
there's a variety of of products out
 
03:00:19.269 --> 03:00:19.279 align:start position:0%
there in the market
 
03:00:23.030 --> 03:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
and um you know as the um sabrina dunlap
 
03:00:25.429 --> 03:00:25.439 align:start position:0%
from from anthem indicated
 
03:00:27.670 --> 03:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
we don't really see that the legislation
 
03:00:30.150 --> 03:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
is necessary
 
03:00:32.309 --> 03:00:32.319 align:start position:0%
thank you great uh representative
 
03:00:32.319 --> 03:00:35.910 align:start position:0%
thank you great uh representative
abramson

03:00:35.910 --> 03:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:37.349 --> 03:00:37.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
03:00:39.110 --> 03:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
my question maybe this is
 
03:00:41.990 --> 03:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh the same question i'm looking at uh
 
03:00:44.630 --> 03:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
page one of the bill part one
 
03:00:47.429 --> 03:00:47.439 align:start position:0%
part two where it says an insurer shall
 
03:00:49.030 --> 03:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
not apply deductible coinsurance or
 
03:00:49.040 --> 03:00:50.469 align:start position:0%
not apply deductible coinsurance or
co-pay

03:00:50.469 --> 03:00:50.479 align:start position:0%
co-pay
 
03:00:52.309 --> 03:00:52.319 align:start position:0%
co-payment greater than the applicable
 
03:00:54.070 --> 03:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
deductible coinsurance or co-payment
 
03:00:55.670 --> 03:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
that would apply the same health care
 
03:00:57.190 --> 03:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
service if
 
03:00:59.510 --> 03:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
the service was referred or ordered by
 
03:01:01.110 --> 03:01:01.120 align:start position:0%
an in-network participating
 
03:01:02.870 --> 03:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
primary care provider so on one hand
 
03:01:04.230 --> 03:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
it's saying
 
03:01:07.030 --> 03:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
you can't charge you can't charge more
 
03:01:08.630 --> 03:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
for the out-of-network provider
 
03:01:10.150 --> 03:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
but isn't that the same as saying that
 
03:01:11.830 --> 03:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
you can't charge less
 
03:01:15.110 --> 03:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
for an in-network provider
 
03:01:17.590 --> 03:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
under the same role are you saying okay
 
03:01:19.110 --> 03:01:19.120 align:start position:0%
we can no longer offer you a discount
 
03:01:22.309 --> 03:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:25.670 --> 03:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
um yeah i mean i think the issue here is
 
03:01:29.030 --> 03:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
um kind of the heart of this bill
 
03:01:33.110 --> 03:01:33.120 align:start position:0%
is that some insurance products may be
 
03:01:37.510 --> 03:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:41.110 --> 03:01:41.120 align:start position:0%
see a specialist and have that service
 
03:01:43.269 --> 03:01:43.279 align:start position:0%
that the specialist provides and the
 
03:01:44.950 --> 03:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
claim that's generated from that in
 
03:01:46.070 --> 03:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
order to have that
 
03:01:49.030 --> 03:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
covered under the benefits of your plan
 
03:01:51.110 --> 03:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
the referral to that specialist needs to
 
03:01:53.910 --> 03:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
come from an in-network pcp
 
03:01:56.950 --> 03:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
and so and if it came from an
 
03:01:59.030 --> 03:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
out-of-network pcp
 
03:02:02.070 --> 03:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
then the services provided by that
 
03:02:04.150 --> 03:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
specialist would not be covered in
 
03:02:05.910 --> 03:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
certain products in certain insurance
 
03:02:07.510 --> 03:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
products and so i think what the bill is
 
03:02:08.710 --> 03:02:08.720 align:start position:0%
trying to do is
 
03:02:12.230 --> 03:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
say toss all of that out the window
 
03:02:15.030 --> 03:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
um the claim will always be covered
 
03:02:16.469 --> 03:02:16.479 align:start position:0%
under the
 
03:02:17.990 --> 03:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
under the benefits of the product no
 
03:02:20.150 --> 03:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
matter where the referral came from
 
03:02:23.750 --> 03:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
um so and that's that's kind of
 
03:02:27.030 --> 03:02:27.040 align:start position:0%
where the rub is very nice
 
03:02:31.349 --> 03:02:31.359 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative
 
03:02:35.030 --> 03:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um just a quick
 
03:02:37.670 --> 03:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh question do you think insurance
 
03:02:37.680 --> 03:02:38.950 align:start position:0%
uh question do you think insurance
companies

03:02:38.950 --> 03:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
companies
 
03:02:42.469 --> 03:02:42.479 align:start position:0%
are managing family physician practices
 
03:02:48.790 --> 03:02:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:48.800 --> 03:02:53.030 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:02:53.030 --> 03:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:56.950 --> 03:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
i guess we're we see them as partners
 
03:02:59.590 --> 03:02:59.600 align:start position:0%
in you know i mean p primary care
 
03:02:59.600 --> 03:03:00.389 align:start position:0%
in you know i mean p primary care
physicians

03:03:00.389 --> 03:03:00.399 align:start position:0%
physicians
 
03:03:03.269 --> 03:03:03.279 align:start position:0%
you know have the ability to join
 
03:03:05.349 --> 03:03:05.359 align:start position:0%
networks or not join networks or
 
03:03:07.830 --> 03:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
join networks with certain health
 
03:03:09.830 --> 03:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers and
 
03:03:13.269 --> 03:03:13.279 align:start position:0%
not join other ones so um if they choose
 
03:03:13.990 --> 03:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
to join
 
03:03:17.910 --> 03:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
um then we i think we see them as
 
03:03:18.790 --> 03:03:18.800 align:start position:0%
partners in
 
03:03:23.429 --> 03:03:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:26.950 --> 03:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you um so uh
 
03:03:29.110 --> 03:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
dr crub i'm gonna have you speak uh at
 
03:03:30.309 --> 03:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
the end here to
 
03:03:31.750 --> 03:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
because you've already spoken but uh
 
03:03:33.990 --> 03:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
i'll let you speak again later but

03:03:43.990 --> 03:03:44.000 align:start position:0%

03:03:47.670 --> 03:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
tyler you just moved on me
 
03:03:51.030 --> 03:03:51.040 align:start position:0%

so tyler brennan from the new hampshire
 
03:03:57.030 --> 03:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:00.469 --> 03:04:00.479 align:start position:0%
good afternoon tyler hello so
 
03:04:02.230 --> 03:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
tyler brennan with the new hampshire
 
03:04:03.830 --> 03:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
insurance department
 
03:04:07.429 --> 03:04:07.439 align:start position:0%
um so i'm going to address just i think
 
03:04:07.990 --> 03:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
than the main
 
03:04:10.870 --> 03:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
points that differ from prior testimony
 
03:04:10.880 --> 03:04:11.990 align:start position:0%
points that differ from prior testimony
and

03:04:11.990 --> 03:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:04:13.670 --> 03:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
just to give you a little background on
 
03:04:15.590 --> 03:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
the direct primary care model
 
03:04:18.389 --> 03:04:18.399 align:start position:0%
um we actually have a law in the books a
 
03:04:21.269 --> 03:04:21.279 align:start position:0%
provider contract standard that says
 
03:04:23.030 --> 03:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
a health care provider can't balance
 
03:04:24.630 --> 03:04:24.640 align:start position:0%
bill a member for anything but
 
03:04:27.269 --> 03:04:27.279 align:start position:0%
regular cost sharing because of this
 
03:04:27.279 --> 03:04:28.309 align:start position:0%
regular cost sharing because of this
provision

03:04:28.309 --> 03:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
provision
 
03:04:30.150 --> 03:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
it makes it almost impossible for a
 
03:04:31.990 --> 03:04:32.000 align:start position:0%
direct primary care provider
 
03:04:34.150 --> 03:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
to be in network so in other words if
 
03:04:36.150 --> 03:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
the direct primary care provider was
 
03:04:37.910 --> 03:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
getting paid fee for service and
 
03:04:39.190 --> 03:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
collecting a membership
 
03:04:41.510 --> 03:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
fee that membership fee could be seen as
 
03:04:43.110 --> 03:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
balance billing the member for something
 
03:04:44.710 --> 03:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
more than regular caution
 
03:04:46.870 --> 03:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
so that's the dynamic that results in
 
03:04:49.110 --> 03:04:49.120 align:start position:0%
these providers being on a network
 
03:04:51.190 --> 03:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
a few years ago there was legislation
 
03:04:52.469 --> 03:04:52.479 align:start position:0%
that came forward
 
03:04:54.550 --> 03:04:54.560 align:start position:0%
to clarify that these arrangements are
 
03:04:55.590 --> 03:04:55.600 align:start position:0%
not insurance
 
03:04:57.510 --> 03:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
because if you're an unsophisticated
 
03:05:00.150 --> 03:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
consumer you might sign up with a direct
 
03:05:01.910 --> 03:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
primary care provider
 
03:05:04.150 --> 03:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
pay a monthly fee and think well great
 
03:05:05.429 --> 03:05:05.439 align:start position:0%
that's a good alternative to health
 
03:05:06.950 --> 03:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
insurance i'm fully covered
 
03:05:08.710 --> 03:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
of course as soon as you need specialty
 
03:05:10.150 --> 03:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
care then
 
03:05:12.550 --> 03:05:12.560 align:start position:0%
you're not covered for those services so
 
03:05:14.550 --> 03:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
the legislation that came forward to
 
03:05:14.560 --> 03:05:14.950 align:start position:0%
the legislation that came forward to
move

03:05:14.950 --> 03:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
move
 
03:05:16.469 --> 03:05:16.479 align:start position:0%
the kind of oversight of the direct
 
03:05:18.230 --> 03:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
primary care practices
 
03:05:19.910 --> 03:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
and put them into the medical licensing
 
03:05:19.920 --> 03:05:21.590 align:start position:0%
and put them into the medical licensing
statute

03:05:21.590 --> 03:05:21.600 align:start position:0%
statute
 
03:05:23.030 --> 03:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
the insurance department had that
 
03:05:24.710 --> 03:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
preference because we're an insurance
 
03:05:26.230 --> 03:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
regulator we're looking at insurance
 
03:05:27.990 --> 03:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
products or making sure they meet
 
03:05:29.590 --> 03:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
standards that are associated with
 
03:05:31.590 --> 03:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
insurance products
 
03:05:33.990 --> 03:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
the board of medicine will at least in
 
03:05:35.830 --> 03:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
the past has said that they are more
 
03:05:36.710 --> 03:05:36.720 align:start position:0%
comfortable in
 
03:05:38.230 --> 03:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
looking at clinical standards than
 
03:05:40.309 --> 03:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
administrative standards nevertheless
 
03:05:41.910 --> 03:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
that's where the requirement is
 
03:05:43.590 --> 03:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
so as long as the the direct primary
 
03:05:45.349 --> 03:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
care practice follows the guidelines
 
03:05:47.190 --> 03:05:47.200 align:start position:0%
which are largely based on consumer
 
03:05:49.349 --> 03:05:49.359 align:start position:0%
notification making sure the consumer
 
03:05:51.110 --> 03:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
knows what they're signing up for then
 
03:05:53.269 --> 03:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
they can proceed and not be pursued by
 
03:05:54.710 --> 03:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
the insurance department for selling
 
03:05:54.720 --> 03:05:57.110 align:start position:0%
the insurance department for selling
insurance

03:05:57.110 --> 03:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
03:05:59.750 --> 03:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
the um i think the department doesn't
 
03:06:01.429 --> 03:06:01.439 align:start position:0%
have a position on the bill we do have
 
03:06:03.269 --> 03:06:03.279 align:start position:0%
some concerns about how things would
 
03:06:04.309 --> 03:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
play out
 
03:06:05.830 --> 03:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
and that's largely because of the way
 
03:06:08.469 --> 03:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
benefit designs have existed for a long
 
03:06:08.479 --> 03:06:09.349 align:start position:0%
benefit designs have existed for a long
time

03:06:09.349 --> 03:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:06:10.950 --> 03:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
um you may remember kind of the
 
03:06:12.790 --> 03:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
reference to the primary care provider
 
03:06:14.150 --> 03:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
is the gatekeeper
 
03:06:16.070 --> 03:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
so the idea was if you went to see the
 
03:06:17.990 --> 03:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
gatekeeper you wouldn't be going to a
 
03:06:20.070 --> 03:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
specialist and receiving specialty care
 
03:06:21.750 --> 03:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
that would be more expensive
 
03:06:23.510 --> 03:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
and that specialist operating within
 
03:06:25.190 --> 03:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
their their realm of comfort
 
03:06:26.830 --> 03:06:26.840 align:start position:0%
offering services that perhaps were
 
03:06:28.870 --> 03:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
unnecessary so you go to the primary
 
03:06:30.870 --> 03:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
care provider you get treated there
 
03:06:32.950 --> 03:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
and if you go directly to a specialist
 
03:06:34.469 --> 03:06:34.479 align:start position:0%
without seeing your primary care
 
03:06:34.479 --> 03:06:35.030 align:start position:0%
without seeing your primary care
provider

03:06:35.030 --> 03:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
provider
 
03:06:36.630 --> 03:06:36.640 align:start position:0%
getting that referral from that
 
03:06:38.790 --> 03:06:38.800 align:start position:0%
in-network primary care provider
 
03:06:40.309 --> 03:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
then you may not actually have any
 
03:06:41.910 --> 03:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
benefits when you go to the specialty
 
03:06:41.920 --> 03:06:42.630 align:start position:0%
benefits when you go to the specialty
care

03:06:42.630 --> 03:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
care
 
03:06:44.230 --> 03:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
so i think to the extent that products
 
03:06:45.750 --> 03:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
are being offered that allow the kind of
 
03:06:45.760 --> 03:06:46.790 align:start position:0%
are being offered that allow the kind of
flexibility

03:06:46.790 --> 03:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
03:06:50.230 --> 03:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
for you to go to directly to specialists
 
03:06:51.990 --> 03:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
that is certainly responding to perhaps
 
03:06:53.590 --> 03:06:53.600 align:start position:0%
consumer demand to be able to have that
 
03:06:54.870 --> 03:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
kind of flexibility
 
03:06:56.389 --> 03:06:56.399 align:start position:0%
but i can't help but wonder if there
 
03:06:58.230 --> 03:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
isn't going to be a cost impact
 
03:06:59.990 --> 03:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
in other words the premium for those
 
03:07:02.150 --> 03:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
products might be a little bit higher
 
03:07:04.550 --> 03:07:04.560 align:start position:0%
so when you have legislation like this i
 
03:07:06.389 --> 03:07:06.399 align:start position:0%
think it's worth recognizing that the
 
03:07:08.710 --> 03:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
benefit designs that require a member to
 
03:07:10.469 --> 03:07:10.479 align:start position:0%
select an in-network primary care
 
03:07:10.479 --> 03:07:11.349 align:start position:0%
select an in-network primary care
provider

03:07:11.349 --> 03:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
provider
 
03:07:13.190 --> 03:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
essentially would be overridden by law
 
03:07:14.710 --> 03:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
so there's certainly some operational
 
03:07:16.070 --> 03:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
and documentation
 
03:07:18.309 --> 03:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
changes um probably substantial ones
 
03:07:19.910 --> 03:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
that would need to take place
 
03:07:21.590 --> 03:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
and the other concept of having an
 
03:07:24.150 --> 03:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
in-network primary care provider
 
03:07:26.710 --> 03:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
that is managing the patient's care the
 
03:07:28.070 --> 03:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
insurance company through that
 
03:07:29.750 --> 03:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
relationship with the primary care
 
03:07:29.760 --> 03:07:30.550 align:start position:0%
relationship with the primary care
provider

03:07:30.550 --> 03:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
provider
 
03:07:32.790 --> 03:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
can influence the primary care provider
 
03:07:32.800 --> 03:07:33.670 align:start position:0%
can influence the primary care provider
so

03:07:33.670 --> 03:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:07:35.670 --> 03:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
obviously keep the referrals in network
 
03:07:37.190 --> 03:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
don't refer to an out of network
 
03:07:37.200 --> 03:07:38.150 align:start position:0%
don't refer to an out of network
specialist

03:07:38.150 --> 03:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
specialist
 
03:07:40.550 --> 03:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
but also perhaps refer to the most cost
 
03:07:42.070 --> 03:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
effective specialist
 
03:07:43.910 --> 03:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
one way they may do that is say well
 
03:07:45.429 --> 03:07:45.439 align:start position:0%
primary care provider
 
03:07:47.670 --> 03:07:47.680 align:start position:0%
if the overall cost of the patient's
 
03:07:48.630 --> 03:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
care on average
 
03:07:50.710 --> 03:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
is less than a particular benchmark you
 
03:07:52.950 --> 03:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
get some kind of financial reward
 
03:07:54.389 --> 03:07:54.399 align:start position:0%
if you've got a direct primary care
 
03:07:56.150 --> 03:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
provider is that a network that
 
03:07:57.670 --> 03:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
relationship with the insurance company
 
03:07:58.870 --> 03:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist
 
03:08:00.950 --> 03:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
the direct primary care provider may not
 
03:08:02.389 --> 03:08:02.399 align:start position:0%
hesitate to send you to the most
 
03:08:03.750 --> 03:08:03.760 align:start position:0%
expensive provider
 
03:08:06.550 --> 03:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
in state having no incentive to kind of
 
03:08:06.560 --> 03:08:07.670 align:start position:0%
in state having no incentive to kind of
maintain

03:08:07.670 --> 03:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
maintain
 
03:08:09.429 --> 03:08:09.439 align:start position:0%
your care within what it could be the
 
03:08:11.590 --> 03:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
most cost-effective providers
 
03:08:14.150 --> 03:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
dr crop did refer to a society of
 
03:08:16.710 --> 03:08:16.720 align:start position:0%
actuaries study that came out last year
 
03:08:17.830 --> 03:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
and i think the findings were
 
03:08:19.349 --> 03:08:19.359 align:start position:0%
interesting in there so they took a
 
03:08:21.190 --> 03:08:21.200 align:start position:0%
large self-funded employer
 
03:08:23.110 --> 03:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
and basically gave those employees the
 
03:08:24.950 --> 03:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
option to select a direct primary care
 
03:08:24.960 --> 03:08:25.830 align:start position:0%
option to select a direct primary care
provider

03:08:25.830 --> 03:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
provider
 
03:08:27.750 --> 03:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
and and have that for that provider
 
03:08:29.030 --> 03:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
managing the care
 
03:08:30.710 --> 03:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
and it did not show the inflationary
 
03:08:32.389 --> 03:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
pressures that might exist
 
03:08:33.830 --> 03:08:33.840 align:start position:0%
a number of the reasons that have been
 
03:08:36.150 --> 03:08:36.160 align:start position:0%
articulated about why physicians go into
 
03:08:37.990 --> 03:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
direct primary care arrangements
 
03:08:39.990 --> 03:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
are probably quite valid the flexibility
 
03:08:41.429 --> 03:08:41.439 align:start position:0%
they have the avoiding the
 
03:08:43.429 --> 03:08:43.439 align:start position:0%
administrative requirements
 
03:08:46.150 --> 03:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
and i think that finding alone would
 
03:08:47.590 --> 03:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
suggest that further research is
 
03:08:47.600 --> 03:08:48.389 align:start position:0%
suggest that further research is
appropriate

03:08:48.389 --> 03:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
03:08:50.469 --> 03:08:50.479 align:start position:0%
but more importantly insurance companies
 
03:08:51.590 --> 03:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
should look at the arrangements they
 
03:08:53.510 --> 03:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
have with primary care providers
 
03:08:55.110 --> 03:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
are they overburdening them is the
 
03:08:56.710 --> 03:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
expectation to see number of patients
 
03:08:57.590 --> 03:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
too high
 
03:09:00.630 --> 03:09:00.640 align:start position:0%
are these these these these management
 
03:09:00.640 --> 03:09:01.590 align:start position:0%
are these these these these management
structures

03:09:01.590 --> 03:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
structures
 
03:09:03.510 --> 03:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
actually creating greater costs for
 
03:09:04.710 --> 03:09:04.720 align:start position:0%
their population
 
03:09:05.750 --> 03:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
i mean you could see this as a
 
03:09:07.590 --> 03:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
competitive area shouldn't the insurance
 
03:09:08.950 --> 03:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
company if it's going to look at their
 
03:09:10.950 --> 03:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
competitive position in the market say
 
03:09:12.710 --> 03:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
well how can we improve what we have
 
03:09:14.389 --> 03:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
with primary care providers lower the
 
03:09:15.990 --> 03:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
cost overall
 
03:09:17.830 --> 03:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
the model with primary care has changed
 
03:09:19.830 --> 03:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
a lot over the years and indeed in the
 
03:09:21.110 --> 03:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
past there have been even
 
03:09:23.670 --> 03:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
primary care capitation arrangements so
 
03:09:25.750 --> 03:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
pay that primary care that in-network
 
03:09:27.110 --> 03:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
primary care provider
 
03:09:29.590 --> 03:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
a monthly fee for managing the patient
 
03:09:29.600 --> 03:09:30.309 align:start position:0%
a monthly fee for managing the patient
care

03:09:30.309 --> 03:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
care
 
03:09:31.990 --> 03:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
so it's worth at least acknowledging
 
03:09:33.990 --> 03:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
that there have been some explorations
 
03:09:35.510 --> 03:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of how to best manage the
 
03:09:36.870 --> 03:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
relationship with the primary care
 
03:09:36.880 --> 03:09:37.510 align:start position:0%
relationship with the primary care
provider

03:09:37.510 --> 03:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
provider
 
03:09:39.590 --> 03:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
but indeed i think we are a long ways
 
03:09:40.950 --> 03:09:40.960 align:start position:0%
from from from any
 
03:09:44.630 --> 03:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
real solution at this point um
 
03:09:46.469 --> 03:09:46.479 align:start position:0%
there is a provision that ended up in
 
03:09:47.910 --> 03:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment about the insurance
 
03:09:47.920 --> 03:09:48.550 align:start position:0%
the amendment about the insurance
department

03:09:48.550 --> 03:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
department
 
03:09:51.429 --> 03:09:51.439 align:start position:0%
reviewing up to 10 of these contracts
 
03:09:52.790 --> 03:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
these are contracts between the
 
03:09:54.309 --> 03:09:54.319 align:start position:0%
primaries the direct primary care
 
03:09:55.830 --> 03:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
provider in the member
 
03:09:58.070 --> 03:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
to ensure that they are compliant with
 
03:09:59.510 --> 03:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
the requirement that is in the physician
 
03:10:00.790 --> 03:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
licensing law
 
03:10:02.469 --> 03:10:02.479 align:start position:0%
this is a strange place for the
 
03:10:03.990 --> 03:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
insurance department to be
 
03:10:06.229 --> 03:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
but i think i know where it came from
 
03:10:08.229 --> 03:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
there was a direct primary care study
 
03:10:08.239 --> 03:10:09.030 align:start position:0%
there was a direct primary care study
committee

03:10:09.030 --> 03:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:10:11.750 --> 03:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
and a big big part of the interest of
 
03:10:12.630 --> 03:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
that committee was
 
03:10:14.630 --> 03:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
keeping track of what was going on with
 
03:10:16.790 --> 03:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
direct primary care practices
 
03:10:18.309 --> 03:10:18.319 align:start position:0%
and the insurance department was asked
 
03:10:20.469 --> 03:10:20.479 align:start position:0%
about some sort of certification
 
03:10:22.389 --> 03:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
and um we said it wasn't our preference
 
03:10:24.550 --> 03:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
at the time we do feel as though the way
 
03:10:25.349 --> 03:10:25.359 align:start position:0%
the bill is
 
03:10:27.269 --> 03:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
is amended we could probably do it
 
03:10:29.269 --> 03:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
within existing resources
 
03:10:30.710 --> 03:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
that being said it's going to be a
 
03:10:32.710 --> 03:10:32.720 align:start position:0%
compliance review not an in-depth
 
03:10:34.950 --> 03:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
legal analysis about whether or not the
 
03:10:37.110 --> 03:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
member's contract meets the standard
 
03:10:39.590 --> 03:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
so just kind of note that that out there
 
03:10:39.600 --> 03:10:40.790 align:start position:0%
so just kind of note that that out there
um

03:10:40.790 --> 03:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:42.229 --> 03:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
i think the the other thing that's in
 
03:10:44.389 --> 03:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
there is that report on the impact of
 
03:10:46.550 --> 03:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
the legislation in 2025
 
03:10:48.710 --> 03:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh similarly we could we could probably
 
03:10:51.670 --> 03:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
do that report within existing resources
 
03:10:53.349 --> 03:10:53.359 align:start position:0%
and it might be an interesting analysis
 
03:10:55.190 --> 03:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
at that point
 
03:10:56.630 --> 03:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
so just to summarize it it does
 
03:10:58.389 --> 03:10:58.399 align:start position:0%
represent some significant changes to
 
03:10:59.510 --> 03:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
the way
 
03:11:02.229 --> 03:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
products and benefits are managed there
 
03:11:04.309 --> 03:11:04.319 align:start position:0%
are some cost concerns because
 
03:11:06.309 --> 03:11:06.319 align:start position:0%
that relationship between a carrier and
 
03:11:07.670 --> 03:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
a primary care provider
 
03:11:09.269 --> 03:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
should lead to the most cost-effective
 
03:11:11.030 --> 03:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
treatment but i think you've heard some
 
03:11:12.950 --> 03:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
or potentially valid concerns about how
 
03:11:14.950 --> 03:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
things have developed over the years
 
03:11:17.510 --> 03:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
i do want to say uh briefly about part
 
03:11:18.550 --> 03:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
two on the bill
 
03:11:20.309 --> 03:11:20.319 align:start position:0%
and i raise these concerns and this is
 
03:11:22.070 --> 03:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
the the pbm requirement
 
03:11:25.030 --> 03:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
i raised these concerns in the senate um
 
03:11:26.550 --> 03:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
the way new hampshire insurance laws are
 
03:11:26.560 --> 03:11:27.429 align:start position:0%
the way new hampshire insurance laws are
structured

03:11:27.429 --> 03:11:27.439 align:start position:0%
structured
 
03:11:29.750 --> 03:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
most of the time pvms are subject to
 
03:11:30.950 --> 03:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
insurance laws
 
03:11:32.469 --> 03:11:32.479 align:start position:0%
as really as a contractor with the
 
03:11:34.150 --> 03:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
insurance company so put in a
 
03:11:35.590 --> 03:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
prescription drug requirement for
 
03:11:35.600 --> 03:11:35.990 align:start position:0%
prescription drug requirement for
insurance

03:11:35.990 --> 03:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
03:11:38.469 --> 03:11:38.479 align:start position:0%
companies the pbm is also bound by that
 
03:11:38.479 --> 03:11:39.590 align:start position:0%
companies the pbm is also bound by that
requirement

03:11:39.590 --> 03:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
03:11:42.710 --> 03:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
a few years ago maybe only two
 
03:11:44.950 --> 03:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
legislation passed creating a pbm
 
03:11:44.960 --> 03:11:45.750 align:start position:0%
legislation passed creating a pbm
specific

03:11:45.750 --> 03:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
specific
 
03:11:48.870 --> 03:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
chapter so the definition of a pbm for
 
03:11:49.990 --> 03:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
that chapter
 
03:11:52.469 --> 03:11:52.479 align:start position:0%
is a pbm that does work for multiple
 
03:11:53.910 --> 03:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
current carriers
 
03:11:56.070 --> 03:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
so you could have a pbm that does work
 
03:11:57.830 --> 03:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
just for one insurance company
 
03:11:59.750 --> 03:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
and they're not included in the pbm
 
03:12:01.269 --> 03:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
chapter requirements
 
03:12:03.030 --> 03:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
today those requirements are basically
 
03:12:05.190 --> 03:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
the same doesn't matter if you're a pbm
 
03:12:07.110 --> 03:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
serving one insurance company or
 
03:12:08.870 --> 03:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
multiple insurance companies
 
03:12:10.630 --> 03:12:10.640 align:start position:0%
but this new provision although
 
03:12:11.910 --> 03:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
relatively minimal
 
03:12:14.309 --> 03:12:14.319 align:start position:0%
would just apply to pbms that are
 
03:12:16.309 --> 03:12:16.319 align:start position:0%
servicing multiple insurance companies
 
03:12:18.070 --> 03:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
unless you also put the exact same
 
03:12:19.510 --> 03:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
requirement insurance
 
03:12:22.389 --> 03:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
chapter so uh for insurance carriers and
 
03:12:24.309 --> 03:12:24.319 align:start position:0%
i have the language um so if you proceed
 
03:12:25.349 --> 03:12:25.359 align:start position:0%
if you want to proceed with the
 
03:12:27.349 --> 03:12:27.359 align:start position:0%
legislation or at least part two
 
03:12:28.630 --> 03:12:28.640 align:start position:0%
and you don't want to create a different
 
03:12:30.870 --> 03:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
standard on that based on that dynamic
 
03:12:32.870 --> 03:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
um you may wish to amendment the bill
 
03:12:34.950 --> 03:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
that way so i'll stop there and i'm
 
03:12:37.990 --> 03:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
03:12:41.590 --> 03:12:41.600 align:start position:0%

03:12:41.600 --> 03:12:43.670 align:start position:0%

i am representing the new hampshire
 
03:13:37.190 --> 03:13:37.200 align:start position:0%

assure you i'll be
 
03:13:41.030 --> 03:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
very brief i would like to speak to part
 
03:13:42.870 --> 03:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
two of the bill
 
03:13:46.389 --> 03:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
that is i believe very simple it simply
 
03:13:46.399 --> 03:13:47.590 align:start position:0%
that is i believe very simple it simply
prohibits

03:13:47.590 --> 03:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
prohibits
 
03:13:51.670 --> 03:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
a pbm or adds to the prohibited
 
03:13:55.349 --> 03:13:55.359 align:start position:0%
acts for pbms they cannot
 
03:13:57.990 --> 03:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
stop retail pharmacies from mailing a
 
03:13:59.349 --> 03:13:59.359 align:start position:0%
prescription to a
 
03:14:02.550 --> 03:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
to a patient we've discovered this to be
 
03:14:03.830 --> 03:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
a problem
 
03:14:05.510 --> 03:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
there are patients that for various
 
03:14:08.389 --> 03:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
reasons want to use a retail pharmacy
 
03:14:10.389 --> 03:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
and may at times not always
 
03:14:13.110 --> 03:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
but may at times need uh the service of
 
03:14:13.120 --> 03:14:14.070 align:start position:0%
but may at times need uh the service of
having

03:14:14.070 --> 03:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
having
 
03:14:17.269 --> 03:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
a uh prescription mailed and they're
 
03:14:19.830 --> 03:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
willing to pay a fee to have it mailed
 
03:14:23.110 --> 03:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
and uh but there are some pbms that then
 
03:14:25.030 --> 03:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
will tell the retail pharmacy
 
03:14:26.630 --> 03:14:26.640 align:start position:0%
they will not get reimbursed for that
 
03:14:28.710 --> 03:14:28.720 align:start position:0%
prescription this um
 
03:14:32.229 --> 03:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
change will uh stop that practice
 
03:14:34.710 --> 03:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
allow the occasional mailing by a retail
 
03:14:34.720 --> 03:14:35.750 align:start position:0%
allow the occasional mailing by a retail
pharmacy

03:14:35.750 --> 03:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
pharmacy
 
03:14:38.950 --> 03:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
to a patient and i would just say that
 
03:14:41.750 --> 03:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
the comments of the insurance department
 
03:14:43.349 --> 03:14:43.359 align:start position:0%
we agree with if they feel it needs to
 
03:14:44.790 --> 03:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
be added to another
 
03:14:46.710 --> 03:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
section duplicate language which often
 
03:14:48.950 --> 03:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
is the case we certainly have no problem
 
03:14:51.190 --> 03:14:51.200 align:start position:0%
with that
 
03:14:53.269 --> 03:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
and i would just uh it appears from
 
03:14:53.279 --> 03:14:54.229 align:start position:0%
and i would just uh it appears from
listening

03:14:54.229 --> 03:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
listening
 
03:14:56.229 --> 03:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
that part one may have some controversy
 
03:14:57.670 --> 03:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
i don't really believe
 
03:14:59.750 --> 03:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
part two does so i would hope the
 
03:14:59.760 --> 03:15:00.870 align:start position:0%
part two does so i would hope the
committee

03:15:00.870 --> 03:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:15:03.750 --> 03:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
would um look favorably on part two and
 
03:15:04.790 --> 03:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
if that means
 
03:15:06.710 --> 03:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
you know finding another home for it
 
03:15:08.950 --> 03:15:08.960 align:start position:0%
should some other action be taken
 
03:15:10.790 --> 03:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
regarding part one we would certainly
 
03:15:13.030 --> 03:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
urge you to do that
 
03:15:14.870 --> 03:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to answer any questions mr
 
03:15:17.030 --> 03:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
chairman uh evidently we do have a
 
03:15:18.830 --> 03:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
question representative abramson has a
 
03:15:18.840 --> 03:15:21.590 align:start position:0%
question representative abramson has a
question

03:15:21.590 --> 03:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:15:23.030 --> 03:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
03:15:24.630 --> 03:15:24.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question just be clear you're
 
03:15:25.910 --> 03:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
speaking in favor of
 
03:15:28.950 --> 03:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
part two and you'd like to keep uh part
 
03:15:30.389 --> 03:15:30.399 align:start position:0%
two in the bill
 
03:15:32.790 --> 03:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
that is correct part two all right thank
 
03:15:35.269 --> 03:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
03:15:38.630 --> 03:15:38.640 align:start position:0%

03:15:41.750 --> 03:15:41.760 align:start position:0%
okay um and
 
03:15:44.389 --> 03:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
former senator hussmer uh you want to
 
03:15:46.309 --> 03:15:46.319 align:start position:0%
weigh in
 
03:15:48.790 --> 03:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
thanks very much uh mr chairman and and
 
03:15:49.750 --> 03:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
i will be brief
 
03:15:52.229 --> 03:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
uh certainly uh good afternoon uh
 
03:15:53.510 --> 03:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of the committee my
 
03:15:54.870 --> 03:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
name is andrew hosmer
 
03:15:56.790 --> 03:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
i represent harvard pilgrim healthcare
 
03:15:58.630 --> 03:15:58.640 align:start position:0%
which is uh as you know the largest
 
03:16:00.630 --> 03:16:00.640 align:start position:0%
nonprofit insurer in new hampshire
 
03:16:03.510 --> 03:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh i am uh testifying on their behalf as
 
03:16:06.630 --> 03:16:06.640 align:start position:0%
opposed to section one of sb97
 
03:16:08.710 --> 03:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
um certainly harvard pilgrim health
 
03:16:10.309 --> 03:16:10.319 align:start position:0%
healthcare is um
 
03:16:12.550 --> 03:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
uh our focus is quality care for all our
 
03:16:13.990 --> 03:16:14.000 align:start position:0%
members and we're certainly willing and
 
03:16:15.429 --> 03:16:15.439 align:start position:0%
anxious to collaborate with all the
 
03:16:15.439 --> 03:16:16.550 align:start position:0%
anxious to collaborate with all the
stakeholders

03:16:16.550 --> 03:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
03:16:20.389 --> 03:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
uh in discussing uh direct primary care
 
03:16:22.070 --> 03:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
just the concerns that we have here and
 
03:16:23.830 --> 03:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
i don't want to be redundant because i
 
03:16:25.510 --> 03:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
think miss kroll and miss dunlap and
 
03:16:27.110 --> 03:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
certainly tyler brandon raised all the
 
03:16:28.389 --> 03:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
relevant points that
 
03:16:31.190 --> 03:16:31.200 align:start position:0%
i had hoped to but our healthcare
 
03:16:32.870 --> 03:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
delivery networks have been created to
 
03:16:32.880 --> 03:16:33.269 align:start position:0%
delivery networks have been created to
ensure

03:16:33.269 --> 03:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
ensure
 
03:16:35.750 --> 03:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
coordination of care and patient safety
 
03:16:38.070 --> 03:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
with the pcp at the center or as a
 
03:16:40.150 --> 03:16:40.160 align:start position:0%
as a gatekeeper as it was testified to
 
03:16:41.990 --> 03:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
earlier what we have found
 
03:16:45.030 --> 03:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
is that this leads to lower costs as
 
03:16:46.870 --> 03:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
members are receiving the right care
 
03:16:49.750 --> 03:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
in the right setting so i i we don't
 
03:16:51.030 --> 03:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
stand here
 
03:16:53.190 --> 03:16:53.200 align:start position:0%
pushing back against innovative ideas
 
03:16:54.630 --> 03:16:54.640 align:start position:0%
when it comes to health care
 
03:16:56.309 --> 03:16:56.319 align:start position:0%
all i'd ask the committee to consider
 
03:16:58.469 --> 03:16:58.479 align:start position:0%
right now is that there are plenty of
 
03:16:59.990 --> 03:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
opportunities for improvement in our
 
03:17:01.750 --> 03:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
healthcare delivery networks
 
03:17:04.550 --> 03:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
um or our healthcare delivery system but
 
03:17:06.870 --> 03:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
i think the networks have been created
 
03:17:09.030 --> 03:17:09.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure there's quality care
 
03:17:10.550 --> 03:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
delivered to members and make sure that
 
03:17:11.750 --> 03:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
there are some cost
 
03:17:14.070 --> 03:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
controls in place and it's a delicate
 
03:17:15.190 --> 03:17:15.200 align:start position:0%
balance to manage
 
03:17:17.429 --> 03:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
so before we go forward and start pilot
 
03:17:19.750 --> 03:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
programs and expand
 
03:17:21.670 --> 03:17:21.680 align:start position:0%
how we're going to treat direct primary
 
03:17:23.990 --> 03:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
care providers and their referrals
 
03:17:25.590 --> 03:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
i think really we should take a step
 
03:17:27.030 --> 03:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
back and slow down and look at the
 
03:17:28.950 --> 03:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
impacts particularly potential cost
 
03:17:31.269 --> 03:17:31.279 align:start position:0%
increase prices that the department of
 
03:17:33.590 --> 03:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
uh insurance has indicated may occur
 
03:17:35.429 --> 03:17:35.439 align:start position:0%
so with that i will conclude my
 
03:17:37.349 --> 03:17:37.359 align:start position:0%
testimony if you have questions i'll do
 
03:17:38.550 --> 03:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
my best to
 
03:17:42.229 --> 03:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:45.110 --> 03:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh i think the committee members are
 
03:17:45.120 --> 03:17:46.309 align:start position:0%
uh i think the committee members are
hungry

03:17:46.309 --> 03:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
hungry
 
03:17:48.870 --> 03:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
so i think we're all set all right thank
 
03:17:49.990 --> 03:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
you very much so
 
03:17:52.790 --> 03:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh dr crop we'll let you have the last
 
03:17:52.800 --> 03:17:53.510 align:start position:0%
uh dr crop we'll let you have the last
word

03:17:53.510 --> 03:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
word
 
03:17:55.030 --> 03:17:55.040 align:start position:0%
thank you i'll be very brief i
 
03:17:56.870 --> 03:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate dr brandon clarifying a lot
 
03:17:58.790 --> 03:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
of the the earlier questions i had
 
03:18:00.950 --> 03:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure that in this
 
03:18:02.389 --> 03:18:02.399 align:start position:0%
discussion that people don't
 
03:18:05.429 --> 03:18:05.439 align:start position:0%
lose sight of the patient in this
 
03:18:05.439 --> 03:18:06.389 align:start position:0%
lose sight of the patient in this
equation

03:18:06.389 --> 03:18:06.399 align:start position:0%
equation
 
03:18:09.429 --> 03:18:09.439 align:start position:0%
uh in any business quality and value are
 
03:18:11.429 --> 03:18:11.439 align:start position:0%
measured from the customer perspective
 
03:18:11.439 --> 03:18:11.910 align:start position:0%
measured from the customer perspective
and

03:18:11.910 --> 03:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:18:14.870 --> 03:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
and that's what the patients are we we
 
03:18:16.790 --> 03:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that that we're taking
 
03:18:17.670 --> 03:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
care of them
 
03:18:19.590 --> 03:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
and you know you talk about things that
 
03:18:20.950 --> 03:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
are confusing
 
03:18:24.150 --> 03:18:24.160 align:start position:0%
uh health insurance reading your
 
03:18:25.830 --> 03:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
benefits from health insurance can be
 
03:18:28.870 --> 03:18:28.880 align:start position:0%
can be pretty confusing and it i think
 
03:18:31.030 --> 03:18:31.040 align:start position:0%
it's a little disingenuous to say that
 
03:18:34.070 --> 03:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
dpc is not affordable when my patients
 
03:18:34.630 --> 03:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
are paying
 
03:18:37.750 --> 03:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
14 000 a year as a healthy
 
03:18:41.190 --> 03:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
60 year old woman for her insurance
 
03:18:44.150 --> 03:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
and having a 10 000 deductible that's
 
03:18:45.830 --> 03:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
that's pretty unaffordable
 
03:18:49.349 --> 03:18:49.359 align:start position:0%
and and what we're trying to do in this
 
03:18:51.830 --> 03:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
is is look outside the box get out of
 
03:18:51.840 --> 03:18:52.710 align:start position:0%
is is look outside the box get out of
that

03:18:52.710 --> 03:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:18:56.429 --> 03:18:56.439 align:start position:0%
that belief that the large healthcare
 
03:18:56.439 --> 03:18:57.590 align:start position:0%
that belief that the large healthcare
organizations

03:18:57.590 --> 03:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
03:19:00.150 --> 03:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
and the insurance companies and
 
03:19:02.150 --> 03:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
everybody knows how to do this and how
 
03:19:03.990 --> 03:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
to make this work for patients well
 
03:19:05.590 --> 03:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
you start by asking the patients and
 
03:19:07.510 --> 03:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
when my patients sign a contract
 
03:19:08.790 --> 03:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
directly with me
 
03:19:10.150 --> 03:19:10.160 align:start position:0%
and i say this is what i'm going to
 
03:19:11.750 --> 03:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
provide for you and they continue to be
 
03:19:13.030 --> 03:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
my patient
 
03:19:15.269 --> 03:19:15.279 align:start position:0%
that's their indication that this is a
 
03:19:16.710 --> 03:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
good quality care
 
03:19:19.110 --> 03:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
um and so i hope that people you know
 
03:19:20.309 --> 03:19:20.319 align:start position:0%
just keep in mind
 
03:19:22.950 --> 03:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
hey how do we how do we make patients uh
 
03:19:24.229 --> 03:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
how do we help them get
 
03:19:27.510 --> 03:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
better quality care um
 
03:19:29.990 --> 03:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
and and simplify things and and not
 
03:19:31.349 --> 03:19:31.359 align:start position:0%
drive them away not
 
03:19:35.269 --> 03:19:35.279 align:start position:0%
not treat them like numbers uh reduce
 
03:19:37.510 --> 03:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
that problem that we have in this
 
03:19:39.750 --> 03:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
country of using specialty care instead
 
03:19:41.110 --> 03:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
of primary care
 
03:19:43.269 --> 03:19:43.279 align:start position:0%
all those very expensive parts of this
 
03:19:45.429 --> 03:19:45.439 align:start position:0%
primary care doctors are paid the least
 
03:19:48.550 --> 03:19:48.560 align:start position:0%
our our expenses and our costs in health
 
03:19:50.309 --> 03:19:50.319 align:start position:0%
care are the least of any other
 
03:19:53.190 --> 03:19:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh segment and and you know i think that
 
03:19:53.200 --> 03:19:53.910 align:start position:0%
uh segment and and you know i think that
this

03:19:53.910 --> 03:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:19:55.429 --> 03:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
this really could help kind of shift
 
03:19:58.070 --> 03:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
that whether it's for five doctors in
 
03:19:59.030 --> 03:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
this state or
 
03:20:01.429 --> 03:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
500 patients or whatever the case may be
 
03:20:02.469 --> 03:20:02.479 align:start position:0%
i think this is
 
03:20:04.950 --> 03:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
this is important for those individuals
 
03:20:05.750 --> 03:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:20:07.190 --> 03:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
i really appreciate your time and i
 
03:20:09.590 --> 03:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate the the opportunity to to
 
03:20:11.030 --> 03:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
speak one more time thank you very much
 
03:20:12.950 --> 03:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
representative hunt
 
03:20:16.309 --> 03:20:16.319 align:start position:0%
yeah all right um seeing
 
03:20:19.990 --> 03:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
no more hands up and
 
03:20:23.349 --> 03:20:23.359 align:start position:0%
i think we're all set um so
 
03:20:26.469 --> 03:20:26.479 align:start position:0%
this bill had 20 people in support two
 
03:20:27.750 --> 03:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
opposed and to
 
03:20:31.429 --> 03:20:31.439 align:start position:0%
neutral and i will close the public
 
03:20:31.439 --> 03:20:32.550 align:start position:0%
neutral and i will close the public
hearing

03:20:32.550 --> 03:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:20:35.990 --> 03:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
