this morning is House Bill
 
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
266 relative to structural changes to
 
00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 align:start position:0%
the Department of energy and I'll call
 
00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
on the Bill's Prime sponsor
 
00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington to introduce
 
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:51.310 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington to introduce
this

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 align:start position:0%
legislation good morning um thank you
 
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 align:start position:0%
for allowing me to present this bill Mr
 
00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
chairman uh HB 266 is as it says
 
00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 align:start position:0%
relatives a structural change es in the
 
00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 align:start position:0%
department of energy this is part of the
 
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
ongoing transition that started with the
 
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
last budget Bill uh where we spun off a
 
00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:09.759 align:start position:0%
new Department of energy and took some
 
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
of the responsibilities that were under
 
00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 align:start position:0%
the Pu and put them with that department
 
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 align:start position:0%
uh this bill was submitted uh by myself
 
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
at the request of the Department of
 
00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
energy and there seems to be some um
 
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 align:start position:0%
problems that are being uh discussed
 
00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
between both the Pu and the department
 
00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 align:start position:0%
of energy and rather than going into the
 
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
specifics myself I think it would be
 
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
best if they explain their own positions
 
00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039 align:start position:0%
and then we might decide where we want
 
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
ah head with this bill so unless there
 
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
are questions I think you should
 
00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
probably hold them for the uh people
 
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
from the Department of energy and the
 
00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:43.759 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities
 
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
Commission I'll take okay thank you for
 
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 align:start position:0%
that bill introduction seeing no
 
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
questions for representative Harrington
 
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
we'll call next on the department of
 
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 align:start position:0%
energy since they requested this bill
 
00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
and asked Chris Elms and David shulock
 
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
bill good morning and welcome back good
 
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chairman and members of the
 
00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:13.759 align:start position:0%
committee for the record Chris Elms and
 
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:18.400 align:start position:0%
David shulock from the Department of
 
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 align:start position:0%
energy sorry about
 
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
that so uh the dep Department of energy
 
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
requested House Bill 266 which we say uh
 
00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
see as a natural continuation of the
 
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
creation of the Department of energy
 
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
from back in 2021 and one that we see as
 
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
removing some of the guard rails related
 
00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
to the restructuring that we think at
 
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
this point are no longer necessary and
 
00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
are are more likely to be harmful than
 
00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:47.080 align:start position:0%
helpful uh I do want to be clear upfront
 
00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
I intend to talk about open pu
 
00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:51.319 align:start position:0%
proceedings and it's very possible that
 
00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:52.919 align:start position:0%
the discussion will touch on information
 
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
that is not in the record in those
 
00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
proceedings my discussion of these
 
00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
issues is important for me to discuss
 
00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
this legislation before you
 
00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:04.479 align:start position:0%
today so as many of you know I was
 
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:06.360 align:start position:0%
around and very involved in the state
 
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
budget in 2021 that created the
 
00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:09.639 align:start position:0%
department of energy and that
 
00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
restructured the
 
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
Pu the intent of the restructuring
 
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
included two important goals we wanted
 
00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:19.720 align:start position:0%
to separate the regulatory advocacy and
 
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
energy policymaking role from the role
 
00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:24.280 align:start position:0%
of adjudicating compliance with utility
 
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
regulation and we wanted to finally give
 
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
elected officials the governor the
 
00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
executive Council and the legislature
 
00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:32.919 align:start position:0%
control over energy policy by having an
 
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
agency that is accountable to them
 
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
consistent with this attent the
 
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:39.120 align:start position:0%
legislature gave the department the
 
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:41.240 align:start position:0%
regulatory advocacy and policy-making
 
00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
role and the Pu the adjudicative role
 
00:07:47.189 --> 00:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it seems clear from our
 
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
experience our observation and our
 
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
discussions that the Pu wants a
 
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
relationship between itself and the
 
00:07:54.589 --> 00:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
department that is contrary to the
 
00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:56.589 align:start position:0%
department that is contrary to the
legislative

00:07:56.589 --> 00:07:56.599 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
intent uh it seems apparent that the Pu
 
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
wants to control the way the department
 
00:08:03.309 --> 00:08:03.319 align:start position:0%
does its job including what proceedings
 
00:08:05.749 --> 00:08:05.759 align:start position:0%
the department devotes its resources to
 
00:08:07.309 --> 00:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
how the department conducts its review
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
of utility filings and proceedings and
 
00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
what information or evidence it provides
 
00:08:13.629 --> 00:08:13.639 align:start position:0%
the Commission in those proceedings I
 
00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:15.479 align:start position:0%
know we want to keep this you know uh
 
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
short so I will say that we have met
 
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
with the Pu to try and see if we could
 
00:08:22.309 --> 00:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
resolve some of the uh the differences
 
00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:23.639 align:start position:0%
that we have and come to an agreement
 
00:08:26.309 --> 00:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
prior to this uh public hearing what
 
00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
we've seen sections 3 four and five seem
 
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
to be non-controversial and more or less
 
00:08:33.389 --> 00:08:33.399 align:start position:0%
reflect the status quo as it is today uh
 
00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:37.240 align:start position:0%
section two of the bill uh appeared to
 
00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
be the primary area of concern
 
00:08:43.709 --> 00:08:43.719 align:start position:0%
specifically the Striking of online 8 uh
 
00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
be a party to all
 
00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
proceedings uh the intent there that
 
00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:50.360 align:start position:0%
that would clarify that the department
 
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
has the ability to decide which cases we
 
00:08:55.389 --> 00:08:55.399 align:start position:0%
will participate in uh the commission
 
00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
expressed their view that that legally
 
00:08:58.870 --> 00:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
they need a counterparty in all
 
00:09:01.949 --> 00:09:01.959 align:start position:0%
proceedings no matter how small or
 
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
straightforward and uh if the doe
 
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't participate they would have to
 
00:09:08.030 --> 00:09:08.040 align:start position:0%
either staff up or transfer some
 
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to some entity like the
 
00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
doj and look we obviously disagree we
 
00:09:14.829 --> 00:09:14.839 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have put it in otherwise uh I
 
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:16.120 align:start position:0%
do think it's kind of a red herring
 
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
argument um it is possible that they're
 
00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:20.519 align:start position:0%
right uh we really don't think they are
 
00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:22.120 align:start position:0%
I think there are examples to show that
 
00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
I think there are n numerous statutory
 
00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
instances where hearings are not
 
00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:28.160 align:start position:0%
required for the Pu and I think even the
 
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
site evaluation committee is one example
 
00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:32.240 align:start position:0%
where we see that the state is
 
00:09:34.829 --> 00:09:34.839 align:start position:0%
authorized but not required to act as a
 
00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:37.519 align:start position:0%
counterparty in adjudication through the
 
00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
council uh for the public at the
 
00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.150 align:start position:0%
council uh for the public at the
doj

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:43.160 align:start position:0%
doj
 
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
um so I have reached a point in my
 
00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:47.240 align:start position:0%
testimony where I wanted to explain why
 
00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:49.240 align:start position:0%
we think this provision was uh important
 
00:09:51.509 --> 00:09:51.519 align:start position:0%
and I wanted to give you some examples
 
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
from pending dockets um I'm looking back
 
00:09:57.509 --> 00:09:57.519 align:start position:0%
I see that the Pu is still here and I I
 
00:09:58.910 --> 00:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
have to say I think that that is
 
00:09:58.920 --> 00:09:59.949 align:start position:0%
have to say I think that that is
relative

00:09:59.949 --> 00:09:59.959 align:start position:0%
relative
 
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:01.880 align:start position:0%
uh Reckless after the disclaimer that I
 
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
gave uh that I would be talking about
 
00:10:05.389 --> 00:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
pending dockets with information not on
 
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
the record um I have to think of it as
 
00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
an attempt to stop me from discussing uh
 
00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:12.680 align:start position:0%
the issues that I think you need to hear
 
00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:14.920 align:start position:0%
I know the risk to rap payers uh if the
 
00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:17.480 align:start position:0%
Pu is forced to recuse themselves uh
 
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
from from the dockets I want to talk
 
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
about or if their decision is overturned
 
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
on appeal because they sat here uh among
 
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:25.480 align:start position:0%
other cases I wanted to discuss the
 
00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
eversource and Liberty electric rate
 
00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
cases and between us the consumer advoc
 
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:30.760 align:start position:0%
vate and the companies we've probably
 
00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:33.320 align:start position:0%
spent $3 million just to put on the
 
00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:36.079 align:start position:0%
cases um and and rars will probably have
 
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
to pay most of that so you know I think
 
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:39.720 align:start position:0%
in the past I've seen most pu
 
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
Commissioners would leave the room when
 
00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:43.880 align:start position:0%
a potential discussion on pending
 
00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
dockets uh with information not on the
 
00:10:49.509 --> 00:10:49.519 align:start position:0%
record uh would be coming up um I think
 
00:10:51.069 --> 00:10:51.079 align:start position:0%
it shows that they they think it's more
 
00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
important to hear what Chris Elms has to
 
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
say than for you to hear what I have to
 
00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:58.360 align:start position:0%
say um but but if you want give me a
 
00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.990 align:start position:0%
say um but but if you want give me a
call

00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
call
 
00:11:03.790 --> 00:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
um I I I just I really can't risk uh you
 
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:05.320 align:start position:0%
know these these cases getting thrown
 
00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:08.920 align:start position:0%
out so let's be clear uh this this
 
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
disregard of the legislature is exactly
 
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
what this bill is trying to address uh
 
00:11:15.069 --> 00:11:15.079 align:start position:0%
and if they if they had fiscal concerns
 
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
related to the section that were real uh
 
00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be risking more than my
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
agency's entire regulatory Support
 
00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
Division annual budget uh by sitting
 
00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:26.320 align:start position:0%
here but look that being said since
 
00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:29.120 align:start position:0%
section two uh is what the Pu objected
 
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
to we offered to concede on that point
 
00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
we were and are totally willing to
 
00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:35.320 align:start position:0%
accept an amendment that would get rid
 
00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
of the strike through on line 8 and the
 
00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:39.800 align:start position:0%
addition on line 10 we can provide
 
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
language uh for that Amendment and so
 
00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:44.120 align:start position:0%
just the addition on line 10 so you know
 
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
what I'm referring to is the sentence in
 
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
which the department files a notice of
 
00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:50.440 align:start position:0%
participation you'd probably have to add
 
00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
an and after proceedings on line 8 um
 
00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:57.560 align:start position:0%
but that should address the
 
00:12:00.069 --> 00:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
concerns uh related to section two
 
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
however the Pu told us they didn't like
 
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
that proposal uh and that rejection to
 
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
me has made it abundantly clear that the
 
00:12:08.670 --> 00:12:08.680 align:start position:0%
pu's real issue goes all the way back to
 
00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
2021 um because they are unwilling to
 
00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
accept the five little words on line
 
00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:17.560 align:start position:0%
five quote as determined by the
 
00:12:19.949 --> 00:12:19.959 align:start position:0%
department and that and that section
 
00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
would make it clear that it is the
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
Department of energy who who determines
 
00:12:26.949 --> 00:12:26.959 align:start position:0%
what we put into the record of evidence
 
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:31.720 align:start position:0%
before the Pu you know uh it does feel
 
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
like rejecting that means that the Pu
 
00:12:35.269 --> 00:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
sees themselves as controlling
 
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
everything uh related to energy they
 
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
insist that they get to determine what
 
00:12:41.629 --> 00:12:41.639 align:start position:0%
we submit to them as evidence not just
 
00:12:43.629 --> 00:12:43.639 align:start position:0%
to decide the cases that are based on
 
00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:45.720 align:start position:0%
the evidence that has been put before
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
them uh you know I I I understand sort
 
00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
of the Pu wanting to cling to the old
 
00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:53.560 align:start position:0%
ways they had a lot of power prior to
 
00:12:56.189 --> 00:12:56.199 align:start position:0%
2021 Independence they got to dictate
 
00:12:59.430 --> 00:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
everything and I know how hard it is uh
 
00:13:01.069 --> 00:13:01.079 align:start position:0%
when you have that power to give it up
 
00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:02.600 align:start position:0%
and and you know obviously the chairman
 
00:13:05.189 --> 00:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
came in under the old old system
 
00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:06.959 align:start position:0%
commissioner chatapati was there for a
 
00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:09.320 align:start position:0%
long time as an analyst and we've heard
 
00:13:11.030 --> 00:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
that that commissioner Delano grew up
 
00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:13.240 align:start position:0%
immersed in the practices and framework
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
of the old pu in their presentation
 
00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:17.480 align:start position:0%
we've talked about how things have been
 
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
for the last 100 years but four years
 
00:13:22.350 --> 00:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
ago things changed and the legislature
 
00:13:24.269 --> 00:13:24.279 align:start position:0%
said that they didn't want unelected and
 
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
unaccountable bureaucrats to control
 
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
everything related to energy policy I
 
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
think concerns about resources related
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
to this section are a red herring this
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
bill does not have a fiscal impact and I
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
think it is fair to ask whether the Pu
 
00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
feels underresourced because they are
 
00:13:40.509 --> 00:13:40.519 align:start position:0%
trying to do the job they wish they had
 
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
rather than the job they were intended
 
00:13:44.509 --> 00:13:44.519 align:start position:0%
to have by the legislature the change on
 
00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
line five is vital to the independent
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
functioning of the department and
 
00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
fulfills the most important goals of the
 
00:13:52.629 --> 00:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
legislature when it restructured the
 
00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:55.160 align:start position:0%
commission and created the department we
 
00:13:56.269 --> 00:13:56.279 align:start position:0%
must preserve the Department's
 
00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:57.759 align:start position:0%
accountability to elected officials and
 
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
to the Pu or not not and not to the Pu
 
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
let me be clear uh if if there are
 
00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
further discussions a subcommittee or
 
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:07.240 align:start position:0%
something that has to happen uh we're
 
00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
happy to participate in continue
 
00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
discussions but with our suggested
 
00:14:12.269 --> 00:14:12.279 align:start position:0%
Amendment we think the bill is ready to
 
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
Department representative McGee thank
 
00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:25.959 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you Mr Elms
 
00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:28.920 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um so in looking
 
00:14:31.389 --> 00:14:31.399 align:start position:0%
at at the language uh that you refer to
 
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
the highlighted language I had uh two
 
00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:37.519 align:start position:0%
questions first you said um that you
 
00:14:39.269 --> 00:14:39.279 align:start position:0%
thought on line five that there was an
 
00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
opposition and I'm sure they can speak
 
00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
to it when they come up to line fives as
 
00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
determined by the department is that um
 
00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:49.399 align:start position:0%
a shift
 
00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:52.040 align:start position:0%
in uh how policies are currently
 
00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:54.279 align:start position:0%
executed can somebody answer that for me
 
00:14:56.949 --> 00:14:56.959 align:start position:0%
so I mean the entire uh statement is the
 
00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
department shall have the authority to
 
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
investigate any matter related
 
00:15:03.949 --> 00:15:03.959 align:start position:0%
to uh the statutes that it administers
 
00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
which is new or that may come before the
 
00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission and to
 
00:15:10.269 --> 00:15:10.279 align:start position:0%
appear before the commission to advocate
 
00:15:12.509 --> 00:15:12.519 align:start position:0%
for the Department's position and for
 
00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
the purposes of providing a record for
 
00:15:17.629 --> 00:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
consideration by the commission as
 
00:15:19.749 --> 00:15:19.759 align:start position:0%
determined by the department so is that
 
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
really a shift in who's doing that work
 
00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
I I don't think we see that as a shift
 
00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
as much as a clarification of the way
 
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
things should be operating and we just
 
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
that should be absolutely crystal clear
 
00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:32.120 align:start position:0%
that the department determines what the
 
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
department provides as
 
00:15:36.389 --> 00:15:36.399 align:start position:0%
evidence okay that's a good
 
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
clarification that makes sense thank you
 
00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
and can I have a followup followup so my
 
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
other question was related to line 18
 
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
where you refer to RSA 21g 10 um Mr
 
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:49.680 align:start position:0%
shulock can you answer for us what that
 
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
RSA is is that a that's a definitional
 
00:15:58.470 --> 00:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
uh portion of the statute 21 G10 um
 
00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.470 align:start position:0%
uh portion of the statute 21 G10 um
describ

00:15:59.470 --> 00:15:59.480 align:start position:0%
describ
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
the responsibilities that a department
 
00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
has towards any um attached agency and
 
00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
it you know it's basically back office
 
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
support so that you're not
 
00:16:13.069 --> 00:16:13.079 align:start position:0%
duplicating and can I have a follow up
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
on that question to Mr shulock yes go
 
00:16:17.389 --> 00:16:17.399 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you just following my line
 
00:16:20.189 --> 00:16:20.199 align:start position:0%
of questioning so uh I guess my question
 
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
would be then I know that there's been a
 
00:16:25.629 --> 00:16:25.639 align:start position:0%
a real uh shift in resources from how
 
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
things were configured prior to 2021 and
 
00:16:30.069 --> 00:16:30.079 align:start position:0%
creating the DOE and so the question
 
00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:32.360 align:start position:0%
would be around
 
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
um uh that allocation of resources and
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
whether there's any difference between
 
00:16:41.509 --> 00:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
an agency that's attached to the
 
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
Department of energy and a regulatory
 
00:16:46.670 --> 00:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
body because I I know we talked a lot in
 
00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:49.720 align:start position:0%
2021 about the bright red line and I
 
00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
think having the resources sort of
 
00:16:54.829 --> 00:16:54.839 align:start position:0%
switched over and now you know allocated
 
00:16:58.189 --> 00:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
to it it kind of blurs the line of of
 
00:16:59.910 --> 00:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
how that work happening so if you could
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
speak to that that would be great so the
 
00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:03.800 align:start position:0%
the bright red line had to do with
 
00:17:06.270 --> 00:17:06.280 align:start position:0%
Communications between the Departments
 
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
and you know part of the goal of that
 
00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
initial legislation was to find
 
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
efficiencies right and um if the the way
 
00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
that that line was interpreted was that
 
00:17:20.309 --> 00:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
we could not even speak on
 
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
administrative matters anytime we wanted
 
00:17:26.429 --> 00:17:26.439 align:start position:0%
to say can our staff use the downstairs
 
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
bathroom we had to go to the Department
 
00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
of Justice the Department of Justice had
 
00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:32.600 align:start position:0%
to talk about it they would talk to the
 
00:17:35.029 --> 00:17:35.039 align:start position:0%
Pu the Pu would talk to the Department
 
00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
of Justice and then they would talk to
 
00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
us over those simple administrative
 
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
things and so uh that bright red line
 
00:17:44.549 --> 00:17:44.559 align:start position:0%
was adjusted so that the only time that
 
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
we're not not really permitted to talk
 
00:17:49.789 --> 00:17:49.799 align:start position:0%
to each other uh is when there is a
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
contested case uh being adjudicated
 
00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:54.440 align:start position:0%
before the Public Utilities Commission
 
00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
and we're a party um and we're always a
 
00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
party under the current statute
 
00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
um and so we couldn't have behind the
 
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
scenes talks with the Commissioners
 
00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
about that docket and and that is now
 
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
the bright red line it's not as broad as
 
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
all administrative
 
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
matters but I I will say that this
 
00:18:15.669 --> 00:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
section section three is really designed
 
00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
to clarify what's sort of been happening
 
00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
in practice especially uh as the as the
 
00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
restructuring has become settled it's
 
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
important to remember that the that
 
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
there was not a reduction in staff
 
00:18:28.149 --> 00:18:28.159 align:start position:0%
related to regulatory support when the
 
00:18:29.789 --> 00:18:29.799 align:start position:0%
department was
 
00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
uh there there were uh six senior
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
advisor positions provided to the Pu
 
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
very high level positions um and and
 
00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:39.320 align:start position:0%
some of those folks could be attorneys
 
00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
some of those folks could be analysts uh
 
00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
providing that advisory staff to the
 
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
commission Vice chair Thomas has a
 
00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:49.000 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
for taking my question just for my own
 
00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:52.149 align:start position:0%
for taking my question just for my own
uh

00:18:52.149 --> 00:18:52.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
clarification involving line five those
 
00:18:56.230 --> 00:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
those words as determined by the
 
00:18:59.230 --> 00:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
department could you explain how the
 
00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
department determines that in is it
 
00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
unilateral is it is it is it a committee
 
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
of of um people uh is the Pu involved uh
 
00:19:10.909 --> 00:19:10.919 align:start position:0%
how's they determined yeah absolutely so
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
I will say the buck stops with the
 
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh as far as the department
 
00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
goes and obviously we're an executive
 
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
branch agency and we you know report to
 
00:19:21.669 --> 00:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
the governor um but you know in terms of
 
00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:23.480 align:start position:0%
our process and developing these things
 
00:19:24.789 --> 00:19:24.799 align:start position:0%
there is there's an collaborative
 
00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:27.520 align:start position:0%
approach we have uh you know staff who
 
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
will Who will talk things out we'd like
 
00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:31.880 align:start position:0%
to encourage and Foster debate between
 
00:19:34.110 --> 00:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
folks uh and generally we are able to
 
00:19:36.190 --> 00:19:36.200 align:start position:0%
find positions that work for everybody
 
00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:37.960 align:start position:0%
and work for the Department obviously if
 
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
there are disputes the as I said the
 
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner additional
 
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
questions representative rolds has
 
00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:54.280 align:start position:0%
one thank you Mr chairman um thank you
 
00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:57.640 align:start position:0%
for being here uh again circling back to
 
00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:01.640 align:start position:0%
that section four between line lines two
 
00:20:02.789 --> 00:20:02.799 align:start position:0%
and line
 
00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:06.200 align:start position:0%
five have there been
 
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
instances and could you cite a could you
 
00:20:13.549 --> 00:20:13.559 align:start position:0%
give us some examples to to better
 
00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
understand uh what this is aiming at
 
00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.430 align:start position:0%
understand uh what this is aiming at
resolving

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
resolving
 
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
where the department has appeared before
 
00:20:25.029 --> 00:20:25.039 align:start position:0%
the commission and advocated and
 
00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
presented you know information anal is
 
00:20:33.149 --> 00:20:33.159 align:start position:0%
and yet and and then it seems like
 
00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:35.960 align:start position:0%
you've been told by the
 
00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.590 align:start position:0%
you've been told by the
commission

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:37.600 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:41.240 align:start position:0%
um that's not enough we'd like
 
00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.710 align:start position:0%
um that's not enough we'd like
more

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:43.720 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:46.200 align:start position:0%
um is that what's going on between the
 
00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:49.110 align:start position:0%
um is that what's going on between the
two

00:20:49.110 --> 00:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
bodies I'm going to let uh my general
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
counsel talk I do want to be clear that
 
00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not I I I I really don't want to
 
00:20:56.029 --> 00:20:56.039 align:start position:0%
talk about pending dockets all the
 
00:20:57.789 --> 00:20:57.799 align:start position:0%
commission's here so I'm gonna let let
 
00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:00.559 align:start position:0%
David try to you want that
 
00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
okay but uh yes that's generally what
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
this is getting at so these these
 
00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:09.400 align:start position:0%
Provisions act sort of like a new bright
 
00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
over so when the commission when the
 
00:21:24.549 --> 00:21:24.559 align:start position:0%
staff moved to the department part of
 
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
the reason for that was the executive
 
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
didn't want the commission controlling
 
00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
that staff and what the staff presented
 
00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
right and that line has been blurred by
 
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
the commission by the way that they've
 
00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:43.400 align:start position:0%
interpreted uh and applied these
 
00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
Provisions by trying to essentially tell
 
00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
the department what the department
 
00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
should present and in some cases
 
00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
ordering them to present information to
 
00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:55.720 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:21:59.549 --> 00:21:59.559 align:start position:0%
commission right um and they
 
00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:01.480 align:start position:0%
they no longer have the control over
 
00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
that staff they have their own staff
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
that they can send to to do you know
 
00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
certain tasks right so
 
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
this sort of draws that line the the
 
00:22:13.909 --> 00:22:13.919 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of energy
 
00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
controls his staff they control theirs
 
00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:19.720 align:start position:0%
and we decide what we present to them
 
00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
they decide what they do with it right
 
00:22:27.990 --> 00:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
so okay thank you are questions for the
 
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.269 align:start position:0%
so okay thank you are questions for the
Department

00:22:29.269 --> 00:22:29.279 align:start position:0%
Department
 
00:22:29.279 --> 00:22:30.590 align:start position:0%
Department
representative

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
Corman thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm I'm trying to
 
00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:37.720 align:start position:0%
figure out a a succinct way to
 
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
characterize what you see as the duties
 
00:22:42.710 --> 00:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
of the puc versus the duties of the
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
department and I think commissioner Elms
 
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
or Deputy Commissioner Elms uh said that
 
00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:49.480 align:start position:0%
at the beginning but I didn't quite
 
00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
catch the actual uh characterization so
 
00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:56.360 align:start position:0%
I I believe that the PC is adjudicative
 
00:22:59.310 --> 00:22:59.320 align:start position:0%
is there more to it and then uh what is
 
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
what is how would you describe the Doe's
 
00:23:04.669 --> 00:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
purview in a small number of words sure
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
um you know I think for the role of the
 
00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
puc I believe that the reorganized pu
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
was uh intended to objectively decide
 
00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
matters that come before it uh we
 
00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:15.240 align:start position:0%
believe that the Pu is intended to make
 
00:23:17.909 --> 00:23:17.919 align:start position:0%
decisions either uh either upon an
 
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:20.760 align:start position:0%
application made by a regulated utility
 
00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh with its supporting information or on
 
00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
a record established by the parties
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
before it uh in a contested case uh it's
 
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
up to the Department of energy to you
 
00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
know uh advocate for the public interest
 
00:23:34.190 --> 00:23:34.200 align:start position:0%
and to provide the record uh that that
 
00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
we see fit that the record of evidence
 
00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
in those
 
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
cases follow
 
00:23:43.510 --> 00:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
up thank
 
00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
you in terms of enforcement
 
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
issues is that solely in the doe or does
 
00:23:54.909 --> 00:23:54.919 align:start position:0%
the Pu have any responsibility for
 
00:23:59.230 --> 00:23:59.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement um the Pu would be the body
 
00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
to um order fines actually be paid so
 
00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
the the department may see a violation
 
00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
of ruler statute uh we would work with
 
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh utility to end that violation and in
 
00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
cases where it was necessary uh we would
 
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh petition the commission to
 
00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
fine right or to you know maybe issue
 
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:37.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
Thomas you weren't finished I'm I'm
 
00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:43.240 align:start position:0%
sorry again in that case they would be
 
00:24:45.029 --> 00:24:45.039 align:start position:0%
adjudicating what whether the fine
 
00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
should take place that's their basic
 
00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.870 align:start position:0%
should take place that's their basic
function

00:24:48.870 --> 00:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
function
 
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Thomas um thank you
 
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
um so in reading this bill it says that
 
00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:57.919 align:start position:0%
you have the authority to investigate
 
00:24:59.389 --> 00:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
any matter matters related to the
 
00:25:02.269 --> 00:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
statutes it administers um as determined
 
00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
by the department the uh full party
 
00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:07.240 align:start position:0%
status and right to appeal these sound
 
00:25:11.549 --> 00:25:11.559 align:start position:0%
like new um responsibilities for the doe
 
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
and in your testimony you did say that
 
00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
you would need to staff up and yet you
 
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
also said there was no fiscal impact can
 
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
you please explain that sure and and
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
thank you I'll take the first the the
 
00:25:23.909 --> 00:25:23.919 align:start position:0%
last part first uh and I I apologize if
 
00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:25.720 align:start position:0%
I misspoke what I I wanted to make clear
 
00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
is that we we don't think anybody would
 
00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
have to staff up as associated with this
 
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
bill that we don't see there being any
 
00:25:34.269 --> 00:25:34.279 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact uh in section four the the
 
00:25:35.789 --> 00:25:35.799 align:start position:0%
line provide documents and other
 
00:25:40.029 --> 00:25:40.039 align:start position:0%
materials to um you know you know that
 
00:25:42.269 --> 00:25:42.279 align:start position:0%
that part of of that just wants to make
 
00:25:44.350 --> 00:25:44.360 align:start position:0%
clear that the authorities that we have
 
00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh related to companies before pu
 
00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
proceedings also applies to our
 
00:25:51.389 --> 00:25:51.399 align:start position:0%
statutory jurisdictions where the Pu
 
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
isn't involved one example would be like
 
00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
our Dig Safe program where we want to
 
00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
make sure we just have the the those
 
00:25:59.389 --> 00:25:59.399 align:start position:0%
same authorities with with utilities
 
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
even if it's not a proceeding going for
 
00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
the PC and and David's going to correct
 
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
what I what I said there no that's
 
00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:07.640 align:start position:0%
exactly right but I would give SEC
 
00:26:09.789 --> 00:26:09.799 align:start position:0%
enforcements uh as another example
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
because that's not technically the Pu
 
00:26:14.549 --> 00:26:14.559 align:start position:0%
that goes before the P the the SEC even
 
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
though all three Commissioners are on
 
00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
the SEC and it's administratively
 
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
attached so we just need to make sure
 
00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:23.240 align:start position:0%
that we have the authorities that we
 
00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
need and the the SEC enforcement uh
 
00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
Provisions were added after the
 
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
reorganization so that is new right okay
 
00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.070 align:start position:0%
reorganization so that is new right okay
thank

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:38.269 --> 00:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
you further
 
00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:40.360 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none we'll get the
 
00:26:43.029 --> 00:26:43.039 align:start position:0%
other side of the story now and invite
 
00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission to come
 
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:56.789 --> 00:26:56.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:59.590 --> 00:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
goldner good morning chairman Vose and
 
00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:02.080 align:start position:0%

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
fellow Commissioners prip
 
00:27:10.149 --> 00:27:10.159 align:start position:0%

Sarah
 
00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:16.120 align:start position:0%
Fuller the uh the puc is not opposed to
 
00:27:18.669 --> 00:27:18.679 align:start position:0%
the de's proposal woven through
 
00:27:21.029 --> 00:27:21.039 align:start position:0%
different sections of the bill to make
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
the de uh the D's analytical support
 
00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:26.360 align:start position:0%
available to the Pu on a contingent
 
00:27:29.549 --> 00:27:29.559 align:start position:0%
basis at the election of the doe though
 
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:31.480 align:start position:0%
to our knowledge this would be a unique
 
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
approach in US utility
 
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
regulation to support this model the
 
00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:39.640 align:start position:0%
commission would need to enhance our own
 
00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
analytical Staffing If This eventuality
 
00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:43.480 align:start position:0%
Were to come to
 
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
pass as there would be no certainty that
 
00:27:49.389 --> 00:27:49.399 align:start position:0%
truly independent non- Monopoly
 
00:27:52.350 --> 00:27:52.360 align:start position:0%
analytical advice and positions would be
 
00:27:55.509 --> 00:27:55.519 align:start position:0%
available to use in our
 
00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
proceedings while we don't yet know this
 
00:28:00.909 --> 00:28:00.919 align:start position:0%
scope of doe participation given the
 
00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
current analytical resourcing three in
 
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
the Pu and 13 in the doe with additional
 
00:28:09.669 --> 00:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
staff attorneys to support the
 
00:28:11.909 --> 00:28:11.919 align:start position:0%
analysis this change would involve
 
00:28:14.549 --> 00:28:14.559 align:start position:0%
significant additional resources and
 
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
require an expenditure of additional
 
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
funds over budget estimates and GNC
 
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
approval the commission also does not
 
00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
object to the Doe's proposal that the
 
00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
administrative support to be provided to
 
00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
the commission under our a 12p be paired
 
00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:33.919 align:start position:0%
back to the basic package offered by RSA
 
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
21 G10 which is was mentioned earlier is
 
00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:39.480 align:start position:0%
basically budgeting and back office
 
00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:43.240 align:start position:0%
functions like billing and ordering of
 
00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:45.200 align:start position:0%
supplies the commission would further
 
00:28:47.509 --> 00:28:47.519 align:start position:0%
recommend that this change presented in
 
00:28:50.549 --> 00:28:50.559 align:start position:0%
section three of the bill be modified so
 
00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:51.880 align:start position:0%
the commission would no longer be
 
00:28:54.669 --> 00:28:54.679 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to the doe as
 
00:28:56.789 --> 00:28:56.799 align:start position:0%
we can handle these simple
 
00:28:59.070 --> 00:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
Affairs the commission stands ready to
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
work with Das to launch contingency
 
00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:02.360 align:start position:0%
planning for the severance of the
 
00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
administrative support relationship with
 
00:29:06.509 --> 00:29:06.519 align:start position:0%
the de and we recommend that section
 
00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
three of the bill be amended to delete
 
00:29:12.509 --> 00:29:12.519 align:start position:0%
references to the PC in Romans 6 and 7
 
00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:16.120 align:start position:0%
of RSA 12 P5 and there would also by the
 
00:29:18.029 --> 00:29:18.039 align:start position:0%
way be changes required at
 
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
363 and 365 to address assessments and
 
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
Staffing thank you for your time this
 
00:29:25.789 --> 00:29:25.799 align:start position:0%
concludes my remarks and we're available
 
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
for questions
 
00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
Pu representative McGee thank you Mr
 
00:29:39.269 --> 00:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
chairman good morning morning thanks for
 
00:29:42.549 --> 00:29:42.559 align:start position:0%
being here um okay so thank you for your
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
testimony um and as far as section three
 
00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:48.200 align:start position:0%
goes did I understand you to say that
 
00:29:51.509 --> 00:29:51.519 align:start position:0%
you would like to see that the um that
 
00:29:56.029 --> 00:29:56.039 align:start position:0%
section stricken for um the attachment
 
00:29:58.149 --> 00:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
of the Public Utilities Commission to to
 
00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
being within the doe as it is currently
 
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
structured or as they're proposing it to
 
00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
be structured yes and the basic answer
 
00:30:07.789 --> 00:30:07.799 align:start position:0%
to that is that under RSA 21 G10 those
 
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
functions that are remaining the pie
 
00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:10.919 align:start position:0%
they're very straightforward functions
 
00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
and we can handle that easily within our
 
00:30:16.350 --> 00:30:16.360 align:start position:0%
current administrative Staffing and
 
00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
followup followup okay so um so you you
 
00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:25.880 align:start position:0%
also said though that because there are
 
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
13 people who can do invest instigations
 
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
in doe but three in the Pu that you
 
00:30:33.909 --> 00:30:33.919 align:start position:0%
might need to hire additional people so
 
00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to reconcile in my mind if
 
00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
you ended up no longer being attached um
 
00:30:42.669 --> 00:30:42.679 align:start position:0%
administratively uh how would that
 
00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
affect your budget in terms of the other
 
00:30:47.269 --> 00:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
uh you said objective research because
 
00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:49.080 align:start position:0%
you didn't want to rely on the Monopoly
 
00:30:51.269 --> 00:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
research so I guess I'm what I'm trying
 
00:30:55.549 --> 00:30:55.559 align:start position:0%
to figure out is do you see your role as
 
00:30:59.269 --> 00:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
um seeking more information beyond what
 
00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders bring to you in an
 
00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:02.190 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders bring to you in an
adjudicative

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:02.200 align:start position:0%
adjudicative
 
00:31:04.629 --> 00:31:04.639 align:start position:0%
proceeding um because it sounds like you
 
00:31:06.509 --> 00:31:06.519 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily trust the information
 
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
you're getting
 
00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:11.320 align:start position:0%
from the utilities or who the the
 
00:31:12.389 --> 00:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
professionals that are trying to bring
 
00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
you information okay I think that was a
 
00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:16.120 align:start position:0%
multi-part question let me they always
 
00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:18.559 align:start position:0%
are with me I'm sorry let me try to
 
00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:20.360 align:start position:0%
address it first things first so first
 
00:31:22.669 --> 00:31:22.679 align:start position:0%
in section three which talks about
 
00:31:25.389 --> 00:31:25.399 align:start position:0%
administrative support that's very
 
00:31:27.629 --> 00:31:27.639 align:start position:0%
straightforward and and we can handle
 
00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:29.919 align:start position:0%
that with with current Staffing uh
 
00:31:32.909 --> 00:31:32.919 align:start position:0%
sections one and two um are uh
 
00:31:35.549 --> 00:31:35.559 align:start position:0%
substantive they're analysts uh lawyers
 
00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:38.120 align:start position:0%
attached to the analysts to to bring
 
00:31:42.789 --> 00:31:42.799 align:start position:0%
forward um information and in uh in
 
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
those cases we would need additional
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
resources so one and two more resources
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
three no more
 
00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
resources and I think you might have was
 
00:31:55.990 --> 00:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
there more that I should answer on
 
00:31:59.350 --> 00:31:59.360 align:start position:0%
that um I'm not sure representative
 
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
McGee was there something else you
 
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to know well I I I think I
 
00:32:05.029 --> 00:32:05.039 align:start position:0%
understand that one and two are
 
00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:07.240 align:start position:0%
different but so one and two maintain
 
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
the relationship right where
 
00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
you're kind of um reliant on the
 
00:32:17.629 --> 00:32:17.639 align:start position:0%
department of Energy's resources is that
 
00:32:19.629 --> 00:32:19.639 align:start position:0%
right yeah let me thank you for
 
00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
reminding me on that so what happens
 
00:32:25.870 --> 00:32:25.880 align:start position:0%
before the puc if you can uh picture uh
 
00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
this so the three PU Commissioners are
 
00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:30.559 align:start position:0%
are sitting at a
 
00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:33.919 align:start position:0%
table and then the uh Department today
 
00:32:36.310 --> 00:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
is always before us as an automatic
 
00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
party per the current legislation the um
 
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
the Monopoly the utility is is is almost
 
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
always there as the movement because
 
00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:49.000 align:start position:0%
they want to change their rates the OCA
 
00:32:51.389 --> 00:32:51.399 align:start position:0%
very often participates in our dockets
 
00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:54.200 align:start position:0%
as well and then there are also um other
 
00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
parties interveners uh special interests
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
that also often participate in the
 
00:33:04.509 --> 00:33:04.519 align:start position:0%
dockets um so the case before us if we
 
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
only have as a mandatory or automatic
 
00:33:11.149 --> 00:33:11.159 align:start position:0%
party the Monopoly the regulated utility
 
00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
then we as chairman voice just
 
00:33:15.389 --> 00:33:15.399 align:start position:0%
highlighted in this particular issue we
 
00:33:18.149 --> 00:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
only have one side of the story we we
 
00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
the commission does not have access to
 
00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
Discovery um so we are very limited in
 
00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
what we can get if the state uh does not
 
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
is not represented
 
00:33:29.789 --> 00:33:29.799 align:start position:0%
in our Doc and and let me just quickly
 
00:33:32.029 --> 00:33:32.039 align:start position:0%
add one more thing in the SEC which was
 
00:33:34.909 --> 00:33:34.919 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier there is an automatic
 
00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:36.760 align:start position:0%
party today the council for the public
 
00:33:39.509 --> 00:33:39.519 align:start position:0%
from the doj is an automatic party and a
 
00:33:43.269 --> 00:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
mandatory party to all SEC proceedings
 
00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
and so that is uh that's how the SEC is
 
00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:47.629 align:start position:0%
and so that is uh that's how the SEC is
set

00:33:47.629 --> 00:33:47.639 align:start position:0%
set
 
00:33:50.269 --> 00:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
up okay follow up I do have a follow up
 
00:33:52.669 --> 00:33:52.679 align:start position:0%
on that okay so now that's thank you for
 
00:33:54.029 --> 00:33:54.039 align:start position:0%
um outlining that I'm sure that's
 
00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
helpful for a lot of people that haven't
 
00:33:58.870 --> 00:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
had experience at the Pu but it sounds
 
00:34:02.430 --> 00:34:02.440 align:start position:0%
like in the proceedings you do have uh
 
00:34:05.029 --> 00:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
intervenor stakeholders who also present
 
00:34:07.869 --> 00:34:07.879 align:start position:0%
additional evidence and perspective
 
00:34:09.990 --> 00:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
correct that that's correct but not in
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
all cases I would say that um I didn't
 
00:34:16.030 --> 00:34:16.040 align:start position:0%
uh I couldn't give you a percentage off
 
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
hand but I would say
 
00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
interveners and um inter interveners or
 
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
maybe participate in this is off the top
 
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
of my head maybe 20% of the dockhead
 
00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
something like that it's usually there
 
00:34:30.430 --> 00:34:30.440 align:start position:0%
aren't interveners in the
 
00:34:33.990 --> 00:34:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
you further questions representative
 
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
Harrington uh thank you and thank you
 
00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I think just to I
 
00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
get this down into a nutshell then is
 
00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:45.320 align:start position:0%
the main dis aren't you the prime
 
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
sponsor that's right I am not supposed
 
00:34:48.990 --> 00:34:49.000 align:start position:0%
to ask questions sorry about that yes
 
00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
he's the prime sponsor he can't answer
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
qu ask questions representative
 
00:34:55.149 --> 00:34:55.159 align:start position:0%
Summers thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:34:57.750 --> 00:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um would this if
 
00:35:00.109 --> 00:35:00.119 align:start position:0%
this bill was to pass would it us
 
00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
overall speed up the process the docket
 
00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
flow in the p in the Pu or help aid
 
00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
that yeah I think it would slow it down
 
00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:13.160 align:start position:0%
um we would somehow have to get the
 
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
information that we're seeking in order
 
00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:17.000 align:start position:0%
to you know we're the Arbiter between
 
00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:19.640 align:start position:0%
the customer and the regulated utility
 
00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
so if just the regulated utility is is
 
00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
on that balance scale then we somehow
 
00:35:26.829 --> 00:35:26.839 align:start position:0%
have to get the other perspective so it
 
00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
would slow down we would either have to
 
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
um find the resources elsewhere whether
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
I don't know exactly how we would do it
 
00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
that depends on the outcome of the
 
00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:37.880 align:start position:0%
legislation but we would somehow have to
 
00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:39.560 align:start position:0%
reflect the interest of the customer on
 
00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:43.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
scale representative bernardy has a
 
00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman so so why
 
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
is it that you don't think the doe is
 
00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
bringing the contrary opinion if there
 
00:35:58.630 --> 00:35:58.640 align:start position:0%
is one that's appropriate
 
00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:01.160 align:start position:0%
I I think today they're an automatic and
 
00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:03.640 align:start position:0%
mandatory party and they participate in
 
00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
in all the dockets and they do they do
 
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:08.680 align:start position:0%
bring the information forward that is
 
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
extremely helpful and helps the
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
commission balance the interests of the
 
00:36:14.390 --> 00:36:14.400 align:start position:0%
customer and the regulated utility this
 
00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
legislation would change that
 
00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:20.440 align:start position:0%
relationship and make it um optional for
 
00:36:22.309 --> 00:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
the Department to
 
00:36:26.950 --> 00:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
participate followup follow up so if the
 
00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
department of energy is uh making the
 
00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:35.400 align:start position:0%
assessment that the that the uh issues
 
00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
in the docket really don't require uh
 
00:36:44.309 --> 00:36:44.319 align:start position:0%
you know additional um contrary or
 
00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:47.560 align:start position:0%
substantive uh information to be
 
00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:51.560 align:start position:0%
provided why why are you distrusting
 
00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:53.430 align:start position:0%
provided why why are you distrusting
that

00:36:53.430 --> 00:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:36:55.870 --> 00:36:55.880 align:start position:0%
decision good morning I'm Sarah Fuller
 
00:36:58.910 --> 00:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
um for the Pu so so the commission
 
00:37:01.109 --> 00:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't submit evidence we don't submit
 
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
evidence or to our hearings as everybody
 
00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
has said we are the Arbiter we are the
 
00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
we are the fact finders so in
 
00:37:12.550 --> 00:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
order we can't read into the
 
00:37:14.589 --> 00:37:14.599 align:start position:0%
non-participation that they have done
 
00:37:17.069 --> 00:37:17.079 align:start position:0%
something that would be a determination
 
00:37:19.430 --> 00:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
on something that's not in front of us
 
00:37:23.069 --> 00:37:23.079 align:start position:0%
so just to go take your point a little
 
00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:25.880 align:start position:0%
further if we are to assume which I
 
00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
think the department of energy um has
 
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
asked us to do if they're not
 
00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:31.960 align:start position:0%
participating that they have reviewed
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
everything and it all looks kosher that
 
00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
is taking some that is taking a fact
 
00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:39.760 align:start position:0%
that is not evidence uh into the matter
 
00:37:41.430 --> 00:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
and making that
 
00:37:44.349 --> 00:37:44.359 align:start position:0%
determination so you can't you you can't
 
00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:47.800 align:start position:0%
read in to the record what their
 
00:37:51.069 --> 00:37:51.079 align:start position:0%
non-participation could mean because as
 
00:37:53.829 --> 00:37:53.839 align:start position:0%
um Deputy Commissioner Elm said those
 
00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:55.720 align:start position:0%
decisions are made on a on a number of
 
00:37:58.109 --> 00:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
factors you know commissioner coin makes
 
00:37:59.790 --> 00:37:59.800 align:start position:0%
those determinations with his staff what
 
00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
they are and are not going to
 
00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
participate in so we can't read into
 
00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:05.960 align:start position:0%
non-appearance anything other than the
 
00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
fact that we have one side at one table
 
00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
and there's nobody on the other side and
 
00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:14.680 align:start position:0%
we do not have the ability to submit our
 
00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
own evidence we are not a party the the
 
00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
bright red line took the party status
 
00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
away and so the only parties in those
 
00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:25.960 align:start position:0%
case would be the public the utility
 
00:38:29.150 --> 00:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
were regulating and in those
 
00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
circumstances yes we have um just gone
 
00:38:34.030 --> 00:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
through rul making and we have added
 
00:38:36.589 --> 00:38:36.599 align:start position:0%
some uh commission information requests
 
00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
but if you read through our rules even
 
00:38:40.870 --> 00:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
commission information requests are not
 
00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
evidence until those questions are asked
 
00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:47.480 align:start position:0%
at hearing and um it comes on the record
 
00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:49.480 align:start position:0%
so there are some tools that the
 
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
commission can ask questions um but it's
 
00:38:54.589 --> 00:38:54.599 align:start position:0%
not a party status and there's no
 
00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
Discovery and we don't uh we don't
 
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
get our own evidence so I think
 
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:09.720 align:start position:0%
question yes okay repres representative
 
00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:12.280 align:start position:0%
Swanson has a
 
00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:14.440 align:start position:0%
question I'm sorry I withdraw my
 
00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
question Mr chair representative Corman
 
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
has a question thank you Mr chairman
 
00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:21.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh
 
00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner Elms suggested that
 
00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
he'd be okay with uh removing the
 
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
changes in line so that the be a party
 
00:39:31.589 --> 00:39:31.599 align:start position:0%
to all proceedings would remain in
 
00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
statute and removing the bolded text in
 
00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:35.950 align:start position:0%
statute and removing the bolded text in
line

00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:35.960 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
10 uh so I gather that actually conforms
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
with your view am I correct so I I'll
 
00:39:45.829 --> 00:39:45.839 align:start position:0%
take it I'll take the first stab at this
 
00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:48.680 align:start position:0%
and then I'll go to the chair so we had
 
00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:52.640 align:start position:0%
very um we had discussions with the um
 
00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
Department beforehand and we sat and we
 
00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
talked and this was in the issue is that
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
with line five as determined by the
 
00:40:04.870 --> 00:40:04.880 align:start position:0%
department I think that means that
 
00:40:07.430 --> 00:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
although the you know the department if
 
00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:10.480 align:start position:0%
if we take out the changes in two but
 
00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:15.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:18.069 --> 00:40:18.079 align:start position:0%
department there's no the department can
 
00:40:22.069 --> 00:40:22.079 align:start position:0%
come and and just say uh we chose to not
 
00:40:25.829 --> 00:40:25.839 align:start position:0%
do X Y and Z in this matter and have no
 
00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:27.880 align:start position:0%
questions for any of the witnesses
 
00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
and so to us it seemed like a
 
00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:32.640 align:start position:0%
disingenuous offer um to take out two
 
00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
but to leave in the line five if you're
 
00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:35.920 align:start position:0%
going to if you're going to participate
 
00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
you participate and even if you don't
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
take a
 
00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
position you know there's generally some
 
00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
level of Discovery and I think that when
 
00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:48.200 align:start position:0%
you read when you read line five it
 
00:40:50.109 --> 00:40:50.119 align:start position:0%
could just mean that they're literally
 
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
sitting at the table um and and to us it
 
00:40:57.550 --> 00:40:57.560 align:start position:0%
seemed or to me it seems uh like
 
00:40:59.790 --> 00:40:59.800 align:start position:0%
slightly a disingenuous offer to to take
 
00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
five follow up thank you so I I just
 
00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
want to be really clear here um so
 
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting uh removing the bolded
 
00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:15.800 align:start position:0%
text don't don't do the change that's in
 
00:41:17.829 --> 00:41:17.839 align:start position:0%
bolded text in line
 
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
five but also don't do the changes in
 
00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:25.160 align:start position:0%
line eight the the striketh through
 
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
don't do the strike through and don't
 
00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:29.480 align:start position:0%
through the bolded text in line 10 is
 
00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
that correct I I think what we're
 
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
suggesting is if you accept all of the
 
00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:37.480 align:start position:0%
changes then it's going to lead to a
 
00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:44.200 align:start position:0%
higher uh Staffing at the Pu if you uh
 
00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:47.160 align:start position:0%
if you take out the changes in section
 
00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
two then you have to take out the Bold
 
00:41:51.670 --> 00:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
in section
 
00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
one I think I think that I I think that
 
00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
Department seeing that you you have
 
00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:10.109 align:start position:0%
Department seeing that you you have
another

00:42:10.109 --> 00:42:10.119 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
one okay representative McGee I can't
 
00:42:16.309 --> 00:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
think that best okay um So based on what
 
00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:18.160 align:start position:0%
you were saying it sounds almost as
 
00:42:20.549 --> 00:42:20.559 align:start position:0%
though you uh are lamenting the fact
 
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
that you're not a party in the
 
00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
proceedings because you you said we we
 
00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
are not able to
 
00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:31.480 align:start position:0%
uh you know uh uh we're not a party so
 
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
we can't secure the evidence uh in in
 
00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
the adjudicative proceeding but isn't
 
00:42:39.309 --> 00:42:39.319 align:start position:0%
that a clear distinction in the role of
 
00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission which is
 
00:42:43.349 --> 00:42:43.359 align:start position:0%
that you're supposed to be adjudicating
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
based on the evidence presented to you
 
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
and not necessarily generating evidence
 
00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
to sway a case one way or the other uh
 
00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely correct and I we're
 
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
definitely not lamenting the part that
 
00:42:56.069 --> 00:42:56.079 align:start position:0%
we are not a party at this point what
 
00:42:58.829 --> 00:42:58.839 align:start position:0%
I'm saying is is if you take out if you
 
00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
take out two which is how this was set
 
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
up that the uh state would participate
 
00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
by the department of energy and uh help
 
00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:12.680 align:start position:0%
with uh you know as their role as also
 
00:43:14.990 --> 00:43:15.000 align:start position:0%
the state's policy driver and the
 
00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:17.839 align:start position:0%
regulator and the enforcer if you take
 
00:43:20.230 --> 00:43:20.240 align:start position:0%
that out of the situation then you have
 
00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:22.640 align:start position:0%
to also understand we are not a party
 
00:43:24.549 --> 00:43:24.559 align:start position:0%
and we can't do those things in that
 
00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
situation so currently now there's no
 
00:43:28.549 --> 00:43:28.559 align:start position:0%
issue because there you have the
 
00:43:31.069 --> 00:43:31.079 align:start position:0%
department of energy and you have the
 
00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
you have the utility and then we're the
 
00:43:36.069 --> 00:43:36.079 align:start position:0%
Arbiter but if there's no Department of
 
00:43:38.829 --> 00:43:38.839 align:start position:0%
energy and you just have the regulated
 
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
utility I just I it needs to be clear um
 
00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:45.839 align:start position:0%
to everybody then there there is no
 
00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
there is no other party if this
 
00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:48.760 align:start position:0%
legislation was just to go into effect
 
00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
today as is there are proceedings at the
 
00:43:54.549 --> 00:43:54.559 align:start position:0%
discretion of the Department of energy
 
00:43:56.670 --> 00:43:56.680 align:start position:0%
where there would be nobody on the other
 
00:43:58.430 --> 00:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
side of the table and in those
 
00:44:00.829 --> 00:44:00.839 align:start position:0%
situations we currently with the
 
00:44:04.829 --> 00:44:04.839 align:start position:0%
legislation that we have cannot uh
 
00:44:08.349 --> 00:44:08.359 align:start position:0%
participate the way
 
00:44:11.829 --> 00:44:11.839 align:start position:0%
um the department of energy
 
00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
would yes so the please speak yeah let
 
00:44:18.549 --> 00:44:18.559 align:start position:0%
chairman goldner speak and then you can
 
00:44:21.549 --> 00:44:21.559 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you um I was just going
 
00:44:25.069 --> 00:44:25.079 align:start position:0%
to add to that that um we our role is
 
00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:27.400 align:start position:0%
really as rate maker adjudication is a
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
part of our role but really our role is
 
00:44:31.030 --> 00:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
ratemaking and so that's what we're
 
00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
trying to do is we're trying to balance
 
00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
the interest of the customer and the
 
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
regulated utility to make those rates
 
00:44:38.670 --> 00:44:38.680 align:start position:0%
and adjudication is a piece of that but
 
00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
not everything that we do I just wanted
 
00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
to add that component thank you okay now
 
00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
followup please thank you so much so uh
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm hearing you again describe a
 
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
process where there isn't
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
anybody um that will be representing or
 
00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:55.480 align:start position:0%
advocating for the rate payer if the doe
 
00:44:57.069 --> 00:44:57.079 align:start position:0%
is not involved but we have a consumer
 
00:44:59.349 --> 00:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
Advocate who actually does play that
 
00:45:03.390 --> 00:45:03.400 align:start position:0%
role often and well I think so I guess
 
00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
the question is there there are still
 
00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
other participants in the proceedings
 
00:45:11.309 --> 00:45:11.319 align:start position:0%
right that can provide information uh on
 
00:45:13.549 --> 00:45:13.559 align:start position:0%
behalf of the rap pair there there are
 
00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
there interveners participate at times
 
00:45:19.309 --> 00:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
the OCA also has a small operation and
 
00:45:21.349 --> 00:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't uh can't always participate in
 
00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
the docket the OCA participates when the
 
00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
OCA can and I'll add to that that the
 
00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:29.000 align:start position:0%
OCA only represents the residential
 
00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
rapair class and not the uh not the
 
00:45:35.670 --> 00:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
commercial and Industrial
 
00:45:39.589 --> 00:45:39.599 align:start position:0%
classes representative bernardy has a
 
00:45:43.069 --> 00:45:43.079 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair so I guess I
 
00:45:48.829 --> 00:45:48.839 align:start position:0%
am uh in perplexed by your comment that
 
00:45:54.349 --> 00:45:54.359 align:start position:0%
if uh section two is not adopted that
 
00:45:57.710 --> 00:45:57.720 align:start position:0%
the line five is necessary because
 
00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
if uh it is there you believe the
 
00:46:04.549 --> 00:46:04.559 align:start position:0%
department of energy is going to be
 
00:46:07.829 --> 00:46:07.839 align:start position:0%
disingenuous in their participation I I
 
00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
I I I have to challenge that why are you
 
00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
saying that that would be the case I I
 
00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question and I would just
 
00:46:19.150 --> 00:46:19.160 align:start position:0%
say I think
 
00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
you the your question might have said
 
00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:26.720 align:start position:0%
that we uh would want the line five um I
 
00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
don't don't know it to be the case I
 
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
know from conversations that that was a
 
00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
conversation and there wasn't you know
 
00:46:35.950 --> 00:46:35.960 align:start position:0%
and and and that was that was the
 
00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
statement that that the conversation we
 
00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:42.640 align:start position:0%
had beforehand was you know so if you
 
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
take out two but you leave line five
 
00:46:49.750 --> 00:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
does that mean that you could come you
 
00:46:52.109 --> 00:46:52.119 align:start position:0%
you're a mandatory party you could come
 
00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
and do nothing and I mean that's what it
 
00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
says I I don't have um
 
00:46:59.309 --> 00:46:59.319 align:start position:0%
I don't have reason to believe that I
 
00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
don't have reason to think that the
 
00:47:03.790 --> 00:47:03.800 align:start position:0%
department of energy has done anything
 
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
in our dockets other than
 
00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:08.390 align:start position:0%
in our dockets other than
represent

00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:47:10.589 --> 00:47:10.599 align:start position:0%
uh the interest of the state in the
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
policymaking um you know I think that
 
00:47:15.069 --> 00:47:15.079 align:start position:0%
the department of energy works really
 
00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
hard at their jobs so um and if I shared
 
00:47:21.069 --> 00:47:21.079 align:start position:0%
a disregard for that I apologize because
 
00:47:22.230 --> 00:47:22.240 align:start position:0%
I really do think the department of
 
00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
energy works really hard at their jobs
 
00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
may I add to representative ber bernardy
 
00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:29.160 align:start position:0%
that that um there are different ways to
 
00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
skin this cat um the department has
 
00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
recommended one way and we're trying to
 
00:47:36.349 --> 00:47:36.359 align:start position:0%
be responsive to the proposal that the
 
00:47:39.549 --> 00:47:39.559 align:start position:0%
department put forward um the resources
 
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
could be in the Attorney General's
 
00:47:43.109 --> 00:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
office uh the resources could be in the
 
00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
Pu uh perhaps the doe is asking for
 
00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:49.640 align:start position:0%
additional resources I don't um there's
 
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
different ways to solve the problem so
 
00:47:53.190 --> 00:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
we're just trying to be responsive to
 
00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:54.640 align:start position:0%
this Committee in terms of the
 
00:47:56.670 --> 00:47:56.680 align:start position:0%
department put forward a proposal here's
 
00:47:58.470 --> 00:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
what what we the PC believe we would
 
00:48:01.109 --> 00:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
need to do to execute that proposal um
 
00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
but there are many different ways to
 
00:48:05.990 --> 00:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
problem follow up yes so
 
00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
uh then I just want to get this clear
 
00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:20.680 align:start position:0%
if do you believe there are additional
 
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
resources necessary
 
00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:27.640 align:start position:0%
if section two is struck
 
00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:32.200 align:start position:0%
line five has maintained does the doe or
 
00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
need more resources in order to be
 
00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
responsive to the
 
00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
pu's uh actions I I won't uh I won't
 
00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
answer a question on behalf of the due
 
00:48:46.109 --> 00:48:46.119 align:start position:0%
but what I can say is that given the um
 
00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
given I won't repeat back what you just
 
00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
said but given that description
 
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
additional resources would be required
 
00:48:53.549 --> 00:48:53.559 align:start position:0%
somewhere the Attorney General's office
 
00:48:56.829 --> 00:48:56.839 align:start position:0%
the puc somewhere because there would be
 
00:48:59.109 --> 00:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
no no counterparty to the
 
00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:01.400 align:start position:0%
Monopoly in those
 
00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:04.040 align:start position:0%
instances I
 
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
think go ahead I I think if section two
 
00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
is struck there is
 
00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry Mr bernardy please
 
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi please uh please
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
again one more time I I I might have
 
00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
misunderstood your question so I believe
 
00:49:37.950 --> 00:49:37.960 align:start position:0%
if section two is
 
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
struck then the doe is going to be there
 
00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
100% of the time and uh and line if line
 
00:49:47.710 --> 00:49:47.720 align:start position:0%
five is
 
00:49:52.270 --> 00:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
maintained uh then the only issue it
 
00:49:54.670 --> 00:49:54.680 align:start position:0%
would be if their participation is
 
00:49:57.870 --> 00:49:57.880 align:start position:0%
disingenuous but the real question is if
 
00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
line five is maintained section two is
 
00:50:03.109 --> 00:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
struck do you see a need for additional
 
00:50:06.349 --> 00:50:06.359 align:start position:0%
resources from someplace because they're
 
00:50:11.789 --> 00:50:11.799 align:start position:0%
not going to be there when needed yes
 
00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:16.760 align:start position:0%
and and where what so the so the the
 
00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
resources could be in different places
 
00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
if the department is not participating
 
00:50:22.309 --> 00:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
they've I the way I understood your
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
question was in in line five if it says
 
00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
as determined by the department so the
 
00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
department determines that they're not
 
00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh they um they're not going to
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
participate in that case they're they're
 
00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
they're they're not providing anything
 
00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
on the record then the commission will
 
00:50:45.549 --> 00:50:45.559 align:start position:0%
likely have questions that um that would
 
00:50:48.589 --> 00:50:48.599 align:start position:0%
not be uh that where we we would need a
 
00:50:50.069 --> 00:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
counterbalance so maybe the Attorney
 
00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
General's office could help us maybe uh
 
00:50:54.829 --> 00:50:54.839 align:start position:0%
but we can't we don't have access to
 
00:50:57.549 --> 00:50:57.559 align:start position:0%
Discovery um and so we we need to get
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
the information
 
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
somehow attorney Fuller would you have
 
00:51:02.829 --> 00:51:02.839 align:start position:0%
any further
 
00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
comment yeah I just would say we don't
 
00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
know um I think much to chair goldner's
 
00:51:15.109 --> 00:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
uh analysis it if if the department CA
 
00:51:17.309 --> 00:51:17.319 align:start position:0%
if their a mandatory party and came and
 
00:51:23.030 --> 00:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
said you know we we chose to um to have
 
00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:25.280 align:start position:0%
limited uh review of this matter because
 
00:51:27.670 --> 00:51:27.680 align:start position:0%
on our analysis it looked fine and that
 
00:51:29.549 --> 00:51:29.559 align:start position:0%
was the only thing they put before us
 
00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
it's possible that we would uh need to
 
00:51:37.589 --> 00:51:37.599 align:start position:0%
have additional resources to assess the
 
00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:41.720 align:start position:0%
pleadings um I but again if if it's you
 
00:51:44.349 --> 00:51:44.359 align:start position:0%
know if the just the change to line five
 
00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
is simply
 
00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
semantics for it's what for what the
 
00:51:50.109 --> 00:51:50.119 align:start position:0%
department says they think they need to
 
00:51:52.230 --> 00:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
be independent they want this in there
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
then it's not going to change anything
 
00:51:56.789 --> 00:51:56.799 align:start position:0%
then it might not I think to answer
 
00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
question if you took out two um would
 
00:52:04.349 --> 00:52:04.359 align:start position:0%
would the Pu need additional resources
 
00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:06.760 align:start position:0%
um we're not quite
 
00:52:10.349 --> 00:52:10.359 align:start position:0%
sure followup one one further followup
 
00:52:10.359 --> 00:52:11.589 align:start position:0%
sure followup one one further followup
so

00:52:11.589 --> 00:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:17.430 --> 00:52:17.440 align:start position:0%
so in in that in that case if the doe
 
00:52:20.030 --> 00:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
comes to the table as now would be
 
00:52:22.750 --> 00:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
required section two is removed and said
 
00:52:25.710 --> 00:52:25.720 align:start position:0%
we reviewed this and we only have
 
00:52:28.349 --> 00:52:28.359 align:start position:0%
concerns about this one issue do you not
 
00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
have the capability of asking the doe
 
00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
what about X Y and Z and get a response
 
00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:37.990 align:start position:0%
what about X Y and Z and get a response
from

00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:40.230 --> 00:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
them I mean we
 
00:52:43.150 --> 00:52:43.160 align:start position:0%
can I mean they could come to the table
 
00:52:44.349 --> 00:52:44.359 align:start position:0%
with nothing it's not like we have
 
00:52:46.270 --> 00:52:46.280 align:start position:0%
concerns about this one issue but they
 
00:52:49.829 --> 00:52:49.839 align:start position:0%
could come to the table with nothing and
 
00:52:52.510 --> 00:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
if they don't I mean I think we're
 
00:52:54.069 --> 00:52:54.079 align:start position:0%
getting out of
 
00:52:57.230 --> 00:52:57.240 align:start position:0%
the going back to what um
 
00:52:59.510 --> 00:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
attorney shulock and Deputy Commissioner
 
00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
ens were talking about and we would
 
00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:04.640 align:start position:0%
disagree we don't tell the department of
 
00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
energy how to allocate their resources
 
00:53:10.789 --> 00:53:10.799 align:start position:0%
when we're on the bench so so can we ask
 
00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:13.400 align:start position:0%
questions yes but if we don't know if we
 
00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
don't have any information before us to
 
00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
base the question on it becomes a very
 
00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:19.670 align:start position:0%
base the question on it becomes a very
difficult

00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
00:53:21.630 --> 00:53:21.640 align:start position:0%
situation thank
 
00:53:24.549 --> 00:53:24.559 align:start position:0%
you okay additional questions
 
00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
representative rolds
 
00:53:31.309 --> 00:53:31.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I guess I'm
 
00:53:36.349 --> 00:53:36.359 align:start position:0%
also skeptical of your seems like you're
 
00:53:39.829 --> 00:53:39.839 align:start position:0%
contending that in some cases if the
 
00:53:43.789 --> 00:53:43.799 align:start position:0%
department of energy declines to get
 
00:53:47.069 --> 00:53:47.079 align:start position:0%
involved and there is a
 
00:53:49.109 --> 00:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
significant can I interrupt to you you
 
00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:51.720 align:start position:0%
said you were skeptical which indicates
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
you may be interested in a debate
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
remember we're here to ask questions
 
00:53:57.829 --> 00:53:57.839 align:start position:0%
okay yeah my
 
00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
um have there been instances then where
 
00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
I mean the let's say we mentioned the
 
00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
the consumer Advocate participates on
 
00:54:13.309 --> 00:54:13.319 align:start position:0%
behalf of consumers but you mentioned
 
00:54:16.309 --> 00:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner goldner uh Industrial and
 
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:18.880 align:start position:0%
Commercial there's no you know advocate
 
00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
for them but ratemaking for those class
 
00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
of customers involves significant
 
00:54:25.349 --> 00:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
amounts of
 
00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:27.640 align:start position:0%
money are you say are you telling us
 
00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:31.200 align:start position:0%
that there have been cases where the Bia
 
00:54:33.630 --> 00:54:33.640 align:start position:0%
or somehow industry commercial industry
 
00:54:37.430 --> 00:54:37.440 align:start position:0%
just don't uh get involved they don't uh
 
00:54:41.069 --> 00:54:41.079 align:start position:0%
become a um what's it called become a an
 
00:54:43.069 --> 00:54:43.079 align:start position:0%
intervenor they just don't intervene on
 
00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
behalf of and a case and and you are
 
00:54:48.069 --> 00:54:48.079 align:start position:0%
left with nothing to counterbalance the
 
00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
utilities um
 
00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
proposals does that happen the short
 
00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
answer is yes um I think that in my
 
00:54:59.789 --> 00:54:59.799 align:start position:0%
tenure uh on the on the commission so I
 
00:55:03.109 --> 00:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
came in April of 21 so I think there was
 
00:55:05.230 --> 00:55:05.240 align:start position:0%
the idea before that I had come under
 
00:55:07.109 --> 00:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
the old commission that was only for
 
00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
eight or 10 weeks so I wasn't here for
 
00:55:10.670 --> 00:55:10.680 align:start position:0%
very long but under the old
 
00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
commission but in my ten Year's chair
 
00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:16.559 align:start position:0%
which began in November of 21 um the
 
00:55:18.190 --> 00:55:18.200 align:start position:0%
commercial and Industrial interests are
 
00:55:20.069 --> 00:55:20.079 align:start position:0%
not represented very often I would say
 
00:55:23.549 --> 00:55:23.559 align:start position:0%
the the OCA represents the residential
 
00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
interests much more frequently than the
 
00:55:27.309 --> 00:55:27.319 align:start position:0%
commercial commercial interests are
 
00:55:29.349 --> 00:55:29.359 align:start position:0%
represented today and then in part
 
00:55:31.069 --> 00:55:31.079 align:start position:0%
that's because it's a state agency
 
00:55:32.589 --> 00:55:32.599 align:start position:0%
there's a state agency representing the
 
00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
interest of residential repairs and
 
00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
there's no state agency representing the
 
00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
commercial and
 
00:55:42.630 --> 00:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
Industrial interests and um and so they
 
00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:44.200 align:start position:0%
uh the commercial industrial interests
 
00:55:45.950 --> 00:55:45.960 align:start position:0%
generally show up for the really large
 
00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:48.760 align:start position:0%
cases uh a large rate case for example
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
you would see commercial and Industrial
 
00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
interest but for the vast majority of
 
00:55:56.549 --> 00:55:56.559 align:start position:0%
cases we don't see them
 
00:55:59.109 --> 00:55:59.119 align:start position:0%
followup well is the reason of course we
 
00:56:00.910 --> 00:56:00.920 align:start position:0%
don't have a state agency representing
 
00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
the commercial and Industrial is because
 
00:56:04.710 --> 00:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
it's presumed that they
 
00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
are large and have the resources to you
 
00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:13.000 align:start position:0%
know employ uh someone or some a law
 
00:56:16.510 --> 00:56:16.520 align:start position:0%
firm perhaps or economic analyst
 
00:56:19.829 --> 00:56:19.839 align:start position:0%
to represent them in cases where it
 
00:56:19.839 --> 00:56:22.589 align:start position:0%
to represent them in cases where it
matters

00:56:22.589 --> 00:56:22.599 align:start position:0%
matters
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
um you know allocation of resources is a
 
00:56:28.309 --> 00:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
determinant in our society of like
 
00:56:31.470 --> 00:56:31.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:36.829 --> 00:56:36.839 align:start position:0%
so I'm just again um I'm feeling like
 
00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
you're making a an issue out of
 
00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:39.910 align:start position:0%
you're making a an issue out of
something

00:56:39.910 --> 00:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:56:46.430 --> 00:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:50.950 --> 00:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
then okay all right seeing no further
 
00:56:53.549 --> 00:56:53.559 align:start position:0%
questions I want to thank the uh
 
00:56:56.349 --> 00:56:56.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner for coming before us today
 
00:57:01.950 --> 00:57:01.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and now we'll talk to the
 
00:57:05.589 --> 00:57:05.599 align:start position:0%
man who is responsible for the uh
 
00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:07.720 align:start position:0%
representing the interests of the
 
00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
residential rate payers that's Don Cree
 
00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:12.640 align:start position:0%
of the Office of Consumer Advocate good
 
00:57:14.789 --> 00:57:14.799 align:start position:0%
morning Mr Greece uh good morning
 
00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
chairman Vose
 
00:57:19.870 --> 00:57:19.880 align:start position:0%
um as you just mentioned my name is
 
00:57:23.309 --> 00:57:23.319 align:start position:0%
Donald Cree I am the consumer Advocate I
 
00:57:25.069 --> 00:57:25.079 align:start position:0%
represent the interests of residential
 
00:57:28.029 --> 00:57:28.039 align:start position:0%
rate payers pursuant to RSA
 
00:57:30.910 --> 00:57:30.920 align:start position:0%
36328 I have to confess to you that I
 
00:57:33.589 --> 00:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
have never approached this witness table
 
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
to talk about a bill with more
 
00:57:39.109 --> 00:57:39.119 align:start position:0%
reluctance uh I'm very very very
 
00:57:41.870 --> 00:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
concerned about what I have heard today
 
00:57:44.910 --> 00:57:44.920 align:start position:0%
my job as the state's consumer Advocate
 
00:57:48.349 --> 00:57:48.359 align:start position:0%
is to uh uh win favor with the Public
 
00:57:50.309 --> 00:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission on behalf of the
 
00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
constituency that I represent and my
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
testimony today is in support
 
00:57:58.630 --> 00:57:58.640 align:start position:0%
of the bill that is before you House
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
Bill 266 and again I state that uh very
 
00:58:04.309 --> 00:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
reluctantly and I would also like you to
 
00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
know that I have not in any way
 
00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
coordinated my testimony with that of
 
00:58:11.470 --> 00:58:11.480 align:start position:0%
the Department of energy I listened
 
00:58:13.470 --> 00:58:13.480 align:start position:0%
carefully to what Deputy Commissioner
 
00:58:16.190 --> 00:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
Elms and general counsel shulock said
 
00:58:18.589 --> 00:58:18.599 align:start position:0%
and I have to say that I agree with
 
00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:21.400 align:start position:0%
every word that they spoke here today uh
 
00:58:23.549 --> 00:58:23.559 align:start position:0%
from my perspective the bill you are
 
00:58:27.309 --> 00:58:27.319 align:start position:0%
considering today is uh uh properly
 
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
considered or accurately considered as
 
00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
part of a triumverate of bills that is
 
00:58:34.589 --> 00:58:34.599 align:start position:0%
pending before the legislature in
 
00:58:37.829 --> 00:58:37.839 align:start position:0%
addition today to today's Bill there is
 
00:58:39.029 --> 00:58:39.039 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
535 which uh representative Corman was
 
00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:44.520 align:start position:0%
gracious enough to introduce at my
 
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
request that bill which you have already
 
00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:49.160 align:start position:0%
heard uh addresses many of the same
 
00:58:52.349 --> 00:58:52.359 align:start position:0%
issues it goes at the issue that this
 
00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
bill is Raising from a slightly
 
00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
different perspective uh trying to
 
00:58:59.390 --> 00:58:59.400 align:start position:0%
adjust or optimize or improve or just
 
00:59:02.670 --> 00:59:02.680 align:start position:0%
change the pu's enabling statute this
 
00:59:05.589 --> 00:59:05.599 align:start position:0%
bill representative Harrington's Bill
 
00:59:07.230 --> 00:59:07.240 align:start position:0%
tries to do some of the same things I
 
00:59:10.670 --> 00:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
think by adjusting the pu's enabling
 
00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
statute but the uh the problem is that
 
00:59:18.670 --> 00:59:18.680 align:start position:0%
utility regulation in New Hampshire is
 
00:59:21.390 --> 00:59:21.400 align:start position:0%
not working now I mentioned at trium the
 
00:59:23.710 --> 00:59:23.720 align:start position:0%
third bill is House Bill
 
00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
610 and you will have to for for me but
 
00:59:29.589 --> 00:59:29.599 align:start position:0%
everything I do right now and certainly
 
00:59:32.109 --> 00:59:32.119 align:start position:0%
everything I say today is something I
 
00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
view through the through the lens of
 
00:59:36.829 --> 00:59:36.839 align:start position:0%
House Bill 610 which I hope most of you
 
00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
know or all of you know is a bill that
 
00:59:42.069 --> 00:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
would abolish my office outright my
 
00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:44.520 align:start position:0%
testimony here today is that utility
 
00:59:47.309 --> 00:59:47.319 align:start position:0%
regulation in this state is broken there
 
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
are three agencies that do it and the
 
00:59:51.870 --> 00:59:51.880 align:start position:0%
one they're talking about abolishing is
 
00:59:56.390 --> 00:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
mine my office the OCA is not the office
 
00:59:58.990 --> 00:59:59.000 align:start position:0%
that is broken what is broken is the
 
01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:00.799 align:start position:0%
working relationship between the
 
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
department of energy and the Public
 
01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission I I would like to
 
01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
take this opportunity to answer a
 
01:00:10.029 --> 01:00:10.039 align:start position:0%
question that I thought uh was extremely
 
01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
perceptive posed by representative
 
01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
Corman he asked the department to
 
01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
summarize succinctly what the job of the
 
01:00:19.230 --> 01:00:19.240 align:start position:0%
department is and what the job of the
 
01:00:22.270 --> 01:00:22.280 align:start position:0%
puc is I have an answer to that question
 
01:00:25.549 --> 01:00:25.559 align:start position:0%
the job of the department is to make
 
01:00:28.309 --> 01:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
energy policy on behalf of the executive
 
01:00:30.510 --> 01:00:30.520 align:start position:0%
branch of state government to decide
 
01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
amongst a variety of options what's good
 
01:00:37.230 --> 01:00:37.240 align:start position:0%
and bad uh so that the state moves
 
01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:39.160 align:start position:0%
forward on the pressing questions
 
01:00:42.270 --> 01:00:42.280 align:start position:0%
related to energy and utilities the job
 
01:00:44.069 --> 01:00:44.079 align:start position:0%
of the Public Utilities Commission and
 
01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:47.720 align:start position:0%
frankly I disagree with what I heard
 
01:00:49.470 --> 01:00:49.480 align:start position:0%
chairman goldner say about the role of
 
01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
the Public Utilities Commission the job
 
01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:53.720 align:start position:0%
of the Public Utilities Commission is to
 
01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
act like a court and decide cases to
 
01:00:58.630 --> 01:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
listen to the evidence presented in
 
01:01:01.789 --> 01:01:01.799 align:start position:0%
front of it by Advocates including me
 
01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
including the department of energy and
 
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
then to resolve cases not to make energy
 
01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:09.549 align:start position:0%
then to resolve cases not to make energy
policy

01:01:09.549 --> 01:01:09.559 align:start position:0%
policy
 
01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
so the uh Department said that it was
 
01:01:15.870 --> 01:01:15.880 align:start position:0%
reluctant to talk about pending cases uh
 
01:01:18.029 --> 01:01:18.039 align:start position:0%
I'm not reluctant to talk about pending
 
01:01:22.190 --> 01:01:22.200 align:start position:0%
cases uh there is no statute or legal
 
01:01:25.150 --> 01:01:25.160 align:start position:0%
principle or ethical obligation that I
 
01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:26.680 align:start position:0%
have as an attorney attorney that
 
01:01:28.829 --> 01:01:28.839 align:start position:0%
forbids me from coming here before this
 
01:01:31.470 --> 01:01:31.480 align:start position:0%
body and talking about cases pending
 
01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
before the public use uh Public
 
01:01:35.029 --> 01:01:35.039 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission the Public
 
01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission has a statutory
 
01:01:39.549 --> 01:01:39.559 align:start position:0%
code of ethics RSA
 
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
36312 and among the things that that
 
01:01:45.029 --> 01:01:45.039 align:start position:0%
statute says is that the commission must
 
01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
avoid exp parte contact meaning
 
01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
discussing its cases outside of the Pu
 
01:01:52.510 --> 01:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
hearing room where everybody has a
 
01:01:54.670 --> 01:01:54.680 align:start position:0%
notice and opportunity to be heard and
 
01:01:58.390 --> 01:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
the Pu has an obligation to avoid making
 
01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:00.200 align:start position:0%
public statements that would tend to
 
01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
cast doubt upon its impartiality I am
 
01:02:06.750 --> 01:02:06.760 align:start position:0%
extremely concerned about that I am so
 
01:02:09.230 --> 01:02:09.240 align:start position:0%
concerned about that that later today I
 
01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
will be filing a motion to disqualify
 
01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
the three Commissioners and one of its
 
01:02:17.710 --> 01:02:17.720 align:start position:0%
hearings examiners based on testimony
 
01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
that was presented before this very
 
01:02:23.109 --> 01:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
committee about default Energy Service
 
01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:25.960 align:start position:0%
uh about two weeks ago while I was on
 
01:02:28.829 --> 01:02:28.839 align:start position:0%
vacation I watched the recording of that
 
01:02:31.789 --> 01:02:31.799 align:start position:0%
hearing and I was floored the Pu should
 
01:02:34.829 --> 01:02:34.839 align:start position:0%
not be here discussing pending cases at
 
01:02:36.789 --> 01:02:36.799 align:start position:0%
that time they came in front of you and
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
talked about I believe the count is four
 
01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:42.640 align:start position:0%
open cases that are presently pending
 
01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
before the Public Utilities Commission
 
01:02:46.750 --> 01:02:46.760 align:start position:0%
that is not the way RSA
 
01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:49.720 align:start position:0%
36312 or the administrative procedure
 
01:02:53.269 --> 01:02:53.279 align:start position:0%
act or the pu's enabling statutes are
 
01:02:55.349 --> 01:02:55.359 align:start position:0%
supposed to work as far as pending
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
dockets are are concerned I would urge
 
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
all of you to take a look at the pending
 
01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
eversource rate case that is docket
 
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
number de
 
01:03:09.230 --> 01:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
2470 and I'm about to tell you something
 
01:03:11.990 --> 01:03:12.000 align:start position:0%
about that case it is a pending case and
 
01:03:14.589 --> 01:03:14.599 align:start position:0%
I'm going to talk about it because again
 
01:03:17.470 --> 01:03:17.480 align:start position:0%
no principle forbids me from talking
 
01:03:19.870 --> 01:03:19.880 align:start position:0%
about it here those principles those
 
01:03:22.269 --> 01:03:22.279 align:start position:0%
legal obligations may call on others to
 
01:03:24.029 --> 01:03:24.039 align:start position:0%
stand up and walk out of the room right
 
01:03:26.109 --> 01:03:26.119 align:start position:0%
now whether they do that or not is
 
01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
entirely up to
 
01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
them that case is turning into a fiasco
 
01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
and the reason it is turning into a
 
01:03:35.589 --> 01:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
fiasco is that there is a massive
 
01:03:38.269 --> 01:03:38.279 align:start position:0%
squabble that has been going on between
 
01:03:40.269 --> 01:03:40.279 align:start position:0%
the department of energy and the Public
 
01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission most recently the
 
01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:45.720 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission entered an
 
01:03:49.510 --> 01:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
order complaining about why the
 
01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
department and the other parties and the
 
01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
utility hadn't entered into a settlement
 
01:03:56.430 --> 01:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
agreement by the deadline for such an
 
01:03:59.150 --> 01:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
agreement here's the reason the Pu has
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
made it impossible impossible for
 
01:04:04.910 --> 01:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
parties like me to enter into settlement
 
01:04:07.549 --> 01:04:07.559 align:start position:0%
agreements why is that because the Pu
 
01:04:10.390 --> 01:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
shows no difference and no respect for
 
01:04:12.630 --> 01:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
settlement agreements that parties like
 
01:04:14.549 --> 01:04:14.559 align:start position:0%
us the department of energy and
 
01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
utilities sign well when there's no
 
01:04:18.829 --> 01:04:18.839 align:start position:0%
difference and no respect there's no
 
01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
longer any incentive to settle and so we
 
01:04:24.029 --> 01:04:24.039 align:start position:0%
are on the brink of presenting the first
 
01:04:26.990 --> 01:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
fully contested rid case to uh to the
 
01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission really in
 
01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
the years that I've been doing this and
 
01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:33.400 align:start position:0%
the Pu has allocated 5 days of hearing
 
01:04:35.470 --> 01:04:35.480 align:start position:0%
time that's going to take 20 days of
 
01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
hearing time and it is a mess it's a
 
01:04:41.390 --> 01:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
mess there are other cases like that I
 
01:04:42.990 --> 01:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
could talk about there are default
 
01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
Energy Service cases there are two
 
01:04:47.269 --> 01:04:47.279 align:start position:0%
Liberty Utilities rate cases there's the
 
01:04:49.710 --> 01:04:49.720 align:start position:0%
NIT metering dogget there's Energy
 
01:04:52.309 --> 01:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
Efficiency any number of these things uh
 
01:04:55.029 --> 01:04:55.039 align:start position:0%
not too long ago The Joint Committee on
 
01:04:55.039 --> 01:04:56.630 align:start position:0%
not too long ago The Joint Committee on
legislative

01:04:56.630 --> 01:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
01:04:58.549 --> 01:04:58.559 align:start position:0%
uh or administrative
 
01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
rules uh approved new procedural rules
 
01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
for the Pu and there was a lot of
 
01:05:07.109 --> 01:05:07.119 align:start position:0%
concern uh at the Jal car about the
 
01:05:09.589 --> 01:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
relationship between the Pu and the
 
01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
department of energy so much so that
 
01:05:14.269 --> 01:05:14.279 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn who I think all of
 
01:05:16.349 --> 01:05:16.359 align:start position:0%
you know he's the former Chief Justice
 
01:05:18.390 --> 01:05:18.400 align:start position:0%
of this state and he knows a lot about
 
01:05:20.269 --> 01:05:20.279 align:start position:0%
the law and about how state government
 
01:05:22.950 --> 01:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
is supposed to work and he was concerned
 
01:05:24.589 --> 01:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
about what he characterized as
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
squabbling between two executive branch
 
01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:30.440 align:start position:0%
agencies I share that concern and I
 
01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
think all of you should share that
 
01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
concern as
 
01:05:37.789 --> 01:05:37.799 align:start position:0%
well uh I was uh a bit astonished
 
01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
frankly to hear the Pu suggest to you
 
01:05:42.349 --> 01:05:42.359 align:start position:0%
that it should no longer be
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to the
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
Department of energy pursuant to RSC 21
 
01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
G10 we and the Pu are both
 
01:05:53.829 --> 01:05:53.839 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to the
 
01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:55.640 align:start position:0%
Department of energy under that state
 
01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
statute what does that mean it means
 
01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:00.599 align:start position:0%
simply that we use their business office
 
01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
to keep our finances and our back office
 
01:06:06.789 --> 01:06:06.799 align:start position:0%
functions straight it is terribly
 
01:06:09.230 --> 01:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
compelling that these three agencies be
 
01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
administratively attached that way why
 
01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
two reasons one the the department of
 
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
energy has an excellent business office
 
01:06:19.510 --> 01:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
run by Lenny Rdio who is an extremely
 
01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
competent financial analyst who used to
 
01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
work for the Department of
 
01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
administrative Services I can't imagine
 
01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
not continuing to work with Mr Rdio I'm
 
01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely floored that the Pu thinks
 
01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't need him anymore there's
 
01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
an even better practical reason why
 
01:06:38.269 --> 01:06:38.279 align:start position:0%
these three agencies should remain
 
01:06:40.950 --> 01:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
administratively attached we are all
 
01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:44.640 align:start position:0%
funded the same way VIA utility
 
01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
assessment the department sends out
 
01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
bills to the state's utilities that
 
01:06:53.789 --> 01:06:53.799 align:start position:0%
ultimately pay for our three agencies
 
01:06:56.549 --> 01:06:56.559 align:start position:0%
that is the efficient approp rate and
 
01:06:59.510 --> 01:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable way to do this if the Pu
 
01:07:01.230 --> 01:07:01.240 align:start position:0%
peels itself off and becomes
 
01:07:03.309 --> 01:07:03.319 align:start position:0%
administratively attached to something
 
01:07:05.829 --> 01:07:05.839 align:start position:0%
else we will lose that efficiency that
 
01:07:09.430 --> 01:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
will exert upward budgetary pressure on
 
01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
my office and the department of energy
 
01:07:15.109 --> 01:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
and make all of this stuff work even
 
01:07:18.789 --> 01:07:18.799 align:start position:0%
less well than it is already working
 
01:07:26.630 --> 01:07:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
this is costing
 
01:07:30.510 --> 01:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
money the thing that I care about it
 
01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
most as the state's rate payer Advocate
 
01:07:35.069 --> 01:07:35.079 align:start position:0%
as the state's advocate for residential
 
01:07:37.150 --> 01:07:37.160 align:start position:0%
rate payers and by the way as to the
 
01:07:39.269 --> 01:07:39.279 align:start position:0%
question about the scope of our work my
 
01:07:41.230 --> 01:07:41.240 align:start position:0%
counterpart in main the public Advocate
 
01:07:43.870 --> 01:07:43.880 align:start position:0%
her job is to represent all rate payers
 
01:07:45.430 --> 01:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
if the problem is that commercial and
 
01:07:47.069 --> 01:07:47.079 align:start position:0%
Industrial customers are going
 
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
unrepresented well then you can Tinker
 
01:07:51.789 --> 01:07:51.799 align:start position:0%
with or improve the enabling statute of
 
01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
my office and tell me and my staff that
 
01:07:57.109 --> 01:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
we should represent all rate payers most
 
01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
of the time there isn't any conflict but
 
01:08:02.990 --> 01:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
my point here is that this is costing
 
01:08:05.829 --> 01:08:05.839 align:start position:0%
all rate payers money efforts are being
 
01:08:08.990 --> 01:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
duplicated efforts are being wasted it's
 
01:08:11.910 --> 01:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
costing rate payers money Governor aot
 
01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
has convened a commission on
 
01:08:16.349 --> 01:08:16.359 align:start position:0%
governmental efficiency this is a
 
01:08:19.590 --> 01:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
textbook example of a subject that that
 
01:08:21.749 --> 01:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
body should take up and it should also
 
01:08:24.349 --> 01:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
be very troubling and worrisome to all
 
01:08:26.990 --> 01:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
of you because again utility regulation
 
01:08:32.590 --> 01:08:32.600 align:start position:0%
in this state is not working please help
 
01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
say thank you for your compelling
 
01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
testimony we have questions I see from a
 
01:08:49.390 --> 01:08:49.400 align:start position:0%
variety of people representative Summers
 
01:08:51.590 --> 01:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
has the first one thank you Mr chairman
 
01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr Cree for taking my
 
01:08:56.070 --> 01:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
question um as co-sponsor this bill I
 
01:08:57.630 --> 01:08:57.640 align:start position:0%
was looking at as fact is what you
 
01:09:00.030 --> 01:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
pointed out basically taking a stab at
 
01:09:03.789 --> 01:09:03.799 align:start position:0%
trying to improve efficiency um is there
 
01:09:05.829 --> 01:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
anything you see that's lacking within
 
01:09:08.070 --> 01:09:08.080 align:start position:0%
this bill or would it need another do
 
01:09:10.749 --> 01:09:10.759 align:start position:0%
you have another bill or um things we
 
01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:14.080 align:start position:0%
can add or changes we can make to to
 
01:09:16.829 --> 01:09:16.839 align:start position:0%
resolve the
 
01:09:18.910 --> 01:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
inefficiency I I apologize
 
01:09:20.309 --> 01:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
representative summar because this
 
01:09:22.149 --> 01:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
answer is going to sound a little glib
 
01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
but I think you should look with favor
 
01:09:25.990 --> 01:09:26.000 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 535 because again IT
 
01:09:28.309 --> 01:09:28.319 align:start position:0%
addresses or attempts to address some of
 
01:09:31.349 --> 01:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
the same problems and and to be candid I
 
01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
I think this is a fruitful subject for
 
01:09:34.990 --> 01:09:35.000 align:start position:0%
some sort of work session I was in
 
01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
Earnest when I said the commission on
 
01:09:38.149 --> 01:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
governmental efficiency should look at
 
01:09:41.149 --> 01:09:41.159 align:start position:0%
this I gave my best shot at figuring out
 
01:09:42.990 --> 01:09:43.000 align:start position:0%
how I thought we could address some of
 
01:09:45.470 --> 01:09:45.480 align:start position:0%
these issues that is what you see in
 
01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
House Bill uh 535 and uh representative
 
01:09:51.070 --> 01:09:51.080 align:start position:0%
Harrington has given his best shot at
 
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
this in collaboration with the
 
01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
Department of energy I think those bills
 
01:09:56.470 --> 01:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
can be combined and I think this problem
 
01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
can be uh grappled with successfully um
 
01:10:02.510 --> 01:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
in a way I mean you
 
01:10:05.950 --> 01:10:05.960 align:start position:0%
know when the department of energy was
 
01:10:09.070 --> 01:10:09.080 align:start position:0%
created four years ago via the Budget
 
01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
Trailer bill it was understood quite
 
01:10:14.070 --> 01:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
explicitly at the time that it wasn't
 
01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
perfect right it was going to be
 
01:10:18.390 --> 01:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
iterative we put the department of
 
01:10:20.830 --> 01:10:20.840 align:start position:0%
energy into place we changed the role of
 
01:10:22.750 --> 01:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
the Pu and said all right we're going to
 
01:10:24.149 --> 01:10:24.159 align:start position:0%
have to try to figure out how to get
 
01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
this right here's our first attempt
 
01:10:28.229 --> 01:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
we've had four years of experience it
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
isn't working right it needs to be
 
01:10:33.390 --> 01:10:33.400 align:start position:0%
fixed hope that was helpful
 
01:10:35.830 --> 01:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
representative parall has a question
 
01:10:37.630 --> 01:10:37.640 align:start position:0%
thank you chair Rose and thank you for
 
01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
uh preparing before us
 
01:10:44.149 --> 01:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
toight you were speaking about how these
 
01:10:47.189 --> 01:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
two departments are administratively
 
01:10:50.030 --> 01:10:50.040 align:start position:0%
attached uh one being serving more the
 
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
role of a judicial branch and the others
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
being serving more of an executive
 
01:10:59.950 --> 01:10:59.960 align:start position:0%
branch um do you see this bill before us
 
01:11:01.990 --> 01:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
as blurring the lines
 
01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
between uh those two areas being either
 
01:11:08.830 --> 01:11:08.840 align:start position:0%
judicial or executive well uh I I guess
 
01:11:10.550 --> 01:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
I'm sort of a victim of my law school
 
01:11:12.430 --> 01:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
training and so I I feel like I need to
 
01:11:15.070 --> 01:11:15.080 align:start position:0%
clarify which is the Public Utilities
 
01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
Commission is not part of the judicial
 
01:11:19.270 --> 01:11:19.280 align:start position:0%
branch it is part of the executive
 
01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
branch as is the Department of energy as
 
01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
technically I am so we're all working
 
01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
essentially under the egis of Governor
 
01:11:30.189 --> 01:11:30.199 align:start position:0%
aot trying to do the jobs that you the
 
01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
legislature have assigned to us and the
 
01:11:35.950 --> 01:11:35.960 align:start position:0%
job that you assigned to the Pu in my
 
01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
opinion is to adjudicate things under
 
01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
the pu's enabling statute and the
 
01:11:44.470 --> 01:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
administrative procedure act now now you
 
01:11:45.830 --> 01:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
know there are lots of other
 
01:11:47.950 --> 01:11:47.960 align:start position:0%
conversations to be had some of them are
 
01:11:50.070 --> 01:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
playing out in Washington about the role
 
01:11:52.750 --> 01:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
of administrative agencies but as in the
 
01:11:54.430 --> 01:11:54.440 align:start position:0%
federal government here we're talking
 
01:11:58.070 --> 01:11:58.080 align:start position:0%
about EX executive branch
 
01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
agencies no followup uh representative
 
01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
Kaplan has a question thank you Mr chair
 
01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr cre for coming in this
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
is a a further clarification question uh
 
01:12:12.590 --> 01:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
just for my benefit uh it sounds like
 
01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
there's a sort of a turf war going on
 
01:12:18.030 --> 01:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
and uh due to the restructuring you know
 
01:12:20.470 --> 01:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
as you as you mentioned being worked out
 
01:12:23.070 --> 01:12:23.080 align:start position:0%
in real time so to speak um and you
 
01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned squabbling between the the two
 
01:12:29.470 --> 01:12:29.480 align:start position:0%
U agencies that the um puc and and the
 
01:12:32.430 --> 01:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
department how how does this bill
 
01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
address the squabbling specifically and
 
01:12:38.189 --> 01:12:38.199 align:start position:0%
you know specifically the lines about uh
 
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
as determined by the department in line
 
01:12:43.510 --> 01:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
five and uh section two I mean could you
 
01:12:46.629 --> 01:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
be more specific and and and and just
 
01:12:49.870 --> 01:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
detail for me how this bill resolves the
 
01:12:50.950 --> 01:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
issues that you
 
01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
see well in my humble opinion I I I also
 
01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
think you as I said before to take a
 
01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
serious look at House Bill 535 because
 
01:13:04.229 --> 01:13:04.239 align:start position:0%
it clarifies what the job of the p is as
 
01:13:06.990 --> 01:13:07.000 align:start position:0%
I read House Bill 266 which I had no
 
01:13:09.550 --> 01:13:09.560 align:start position:0%
role in drafting I think what it does is
 
01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:10.430 align:start position:0%
role in drafting I think what it does is
it

01:13:10.430 --> 01:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:13:13.629 --> 01:13:13.639 align:start position:0%
clarifies what the department of energy
 
01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
is allowed to do and what the Pu can
 
01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
tell it to do the department of energy
 
01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
shouldn't report to the Pu in any way
 
01:13:24.629 --> 01:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
and I think fundamentally that's what
 
01:13:26.629 --> 01:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
this build tries to get at and I think
 
01:13:26.639 --> 01:13:28.629 align:start position:0%
this build tries to get at and I think
it's

01:13:28.629 --> 01:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:13:28.639 --> 01:13:32.750 align:start position:0%
it's
appropriate

01:13:32.750 --> 01:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:36.229 --> 01:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
followup microphone sorry uh followup
 
01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
question is H how would you address the
 
01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
issue then of uh the lack of ability on
 
01:13:44.310 --> 01:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
the part of the Pu to require evidence
 
01:13:48.310 --> 01:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
to to come before them well the puc is
 
01:13:51.470 --> 01:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
an adjudicative body and I I uh so I've
 
01:13:53.110 --> 01:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
been involved in utility regulation
 
01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:54.030 align:start position:0%
been involved in utility regulation
since

01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
since
 
01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
1999 when I came to New Hampshire as a
 
01:13:58.910 --> 01:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
fledgling staff attorney at the Public
 
01:14:00.990 --> 01:14:01.000 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission but before that I
 
01:14:03.709 --> 01:14:03.719 align:start position:0%
spent 5 years working for two State
 
01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
Supreme Courts and one federal district
 
01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
court and I can tell you especially
 
01:14:09.950 --> 01:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
having worked at a federal trial court
 
01:14:13.950 --> 01:14:13.960 align:start position:0%
that judges complain all the time about
 
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
being stuck with the record and the
 
01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:21.080 align:start position:0%
advocacy that gets presented to the
 
01:14:24.390 --> 01:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
court by parties that is a frustration
 
01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
of dis iders who are because of the EXP
 
01:14:30.910 --> 01:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
parte rules walled off from freewheeling
 
01:14:33.390 --> 01:14:33.400 align:start position:0%
contact uh and just have to depend on
 
01:14:37.030 --> 01:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
The Advocates to do a good job but pu
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
Commissioners like judges can ask
 
01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
questions at hearing they can manage
 
01:14:43.709 --> 01:14:43.719 align:start position:0%
their cases they can make clear to the
 
01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
parties what the court needs in order to
 
01:14:50.350 --> 01:14:50.360 align:start position:0%
uh decide the cases properly my job is
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
to go in front of the Pu and win that's
 
01:14:54.990 --> 01:14:55.000 align:start position:0%
what I want to do on behalf of the cons
 
01:14:57.550 --> 01:14:57.560 align:start position:0%
constituency I represent so if I go in
 
01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
front of the Pu and chairman goldner uh
 
01:15:02.430 --> 01:15:02.440 align:start position:0%
or the other Commissioners tell me what
 
01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:04.760 align:start position:0%
they think they need me to produce by
 
01:15:07.350 --> 01:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
way of evidence so that I can win am I
 
01:15:09.910 --> 01:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
going to listen to them and meet their
 
01:15:15.030 --> 01:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:18.030 --> 01:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
me representative Thomas has a question
 
01:15:21.390 --> 01:15:21.400 align:start position:0%
uh Wendy Thomas thank you uh Mr chair um
 
01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
other states have pu's and Departments
 
01:15:25.870 --> 01:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
of energy and they seem to play nice
 
01:15:28.669 --> 01:15:28.679 align:start position:0%
with each other what are they doing that
 
01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
we're not doing is go ahead uh my
 
01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
favorite example is actually uh and I
 
01:15:40.149 --> 01:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
say this with some reluctance Vermont uh
 
01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:42.880 align:start position:0%
and it's because I worked briefly at the
 
01:15:46.030 --> 01:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
Vermont pu so I've had a front row seat
 
01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
to watch how this works Vermont has a
 
01:15:49.590 --> 01:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Public Service and a
 
01:15:53.070 --> 01:15:53.080 align:start position:0%
Public Utility Commission uh and I I
 
01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
think the difference between Vermont and
 
01:15:55.830 --> 01:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is that Vermont's been
 
01:15:58.189 --> 01:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
doing it for longer the Department of
 
01:16:00.149 --> 01:16:00.159 align:start position:0%
Public Service in Vermont was created
 
01:16:02.189 --> 01:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
many many decades ago and they've had a
 
01:16:04.470 --> 01:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
longer time to kind of work out the
 
01:16:08.189 --> 01:16:08.199 align:start position:0%
respective relationships between the two
 
01:16:10.110 --> 01:16:10.120 align:start position:0%
organizations and you know there are
 
01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
tensions that are similar are the ones
 
01:16:13.790 --> 01:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here that arise over
 
01:16:16.189 --> 01:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
there but it's very clear in Vermont
 
01:16:20.189 --> 01:16:20.199 align:start position:0%
that the Pu is the adjudicator and the
 
01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Public Service is the
 
01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
policy shop that I think is what the
 
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
legisl intended our department of energy
 
01:16:30.669 --> 01:16:30.679 align:start position:0%
to be when it created the department in
 
01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh in 20 uh 21 you know I would ask you
 
01:16:37.350 --> 01:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
to go back and look at the testimony the
 
01:16:39.990 --> 01:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
Pu offered to you about the default
 
01:16:42.669 --> 01:16:42.679 align:start position:0%
Energy Service Bill and you know I heard
 
01:16:45.750 --> 01:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
Mr spidell talk to you all about this
 
01:16:47.790 --> 01:16:47.800 align:start position:0%
body of evidence that the Pu had
 
01:16:49.910 --> 01:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
developed internally that it hasn't
 
01:16:52.950 --> 01:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
revealed to anybody that is exactly what
 
01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
is not supposed to be
 
01:17:00.709 --> 01:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
happening followup followup so is it
 
01:17:04.390 --> 01:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
fair to um for you to characterize this
 
01:17:06.830 --> 01:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
as Growing
 
01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
Pains uh that would be the sort of
 
01:17:12.790 --> 01:17:12.800 align:start position:0%
modest and restrained
 
01:17:14.910 --> 01:17:14.920 align:start position:0%
characterization my that my mother would
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
probably urge upon me thank
 
01:17:19.990 --> 01:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
you additional
 
01:17:22.910 --> 01:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
questions representative McGee thank you
 
01:17:25.110 --> 01:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you Mr Cree for taking
 
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
my question so to get back to the bill
 
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
and the changes in the bill it appears
 
01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
that the department of energy is asking
 
01:17:33.310 --> 01:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
for some clarifications and statutory
 
01:17:36.669 --> 01:17:36.679 align:start position:0%
language that make it clear uh that
 
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
they're in charge of um
 
01:17:44.110 --> 01:17:44.120 align:start position:0%
of which cases they're working in front
 
01:17:45.790 --> 01:17:45.800 align:start position:0%
you know that they have some latitude
 
01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
right they're not being required to be
 
01:17:50.229 --> 01:17:50.239 align:start position:0%
involved in every case in cases where it
 
01:17:53.229 --> 01:17:53.239 align:start position:0%
might not be appropriate um so do you
 
01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
see you mentioned both both bills I went
 
01:17:57.870 --> 01:17:57.880 align:start position:0%
and looked back at 535 and I see what
 
01:18:00.030 --> 01:18:00.040 align:start position:0%
you're saying about that bill because
 
01:18:02.990 --> 01:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
that bill it sounds to me like would
 
01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
help with the fact that some cases are
 
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
being slow walked or slow rolled over
 
01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
time where they could be settled and
 
01:18:14.709 --> 01:18:14.719 align:start position:0%
they're not being so it seems like this
 
01:18:19.350 --> 01:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
bill is more asking us to change
 
01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
language so that there's a clarification
 
01:18:23.550 --> 01:18:23.560 align:start position:0%
between the two departments of how their
 
01:18:26.110 --> 01:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
roles are going to operate is that an
 
01:18:29.990 --> 01:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
accurate assessment yes I would say so
 
01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
and do you think that the changes that
 
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
are bolded in this uh in all the
 
01:18:36.910 --> 01:18:36.920 align:start position:0%
sections that we've discussed and the
 
01:18:39.270 --> 01:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
repeal um section
 
01:18:43.189 --> 01:18:43.199 align:start position:0%
under on line 26 uh section five that
 
01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:46.440 align:start position:0%
all of that is is um appropriate because
 
01:18:47.470 --> 01:18:47.480 align:start position:0%
you said you didn't have any hand in
 
01:18:50.070 --> 01:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
this bill but you've read it yes I I
 
01:18:51.990 --> 01:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
support the bill and I think all of the
 
01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
changes contained in the bill would be
 
01:18:56.950 --> 01:18:56.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate and constructive thank
 
01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:01.480 align:start position:0%
you so I heard you say a little a few
 
01:19:04.030 --> 01:19:04.040 align:start position:0%
minutes ago that the puc has developed a
 
01:19:05.229 --> 01:19:05.239 align:start position:0%
body of
 
01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:08.800 align:start position:0%
evidence on its own that it hasn't
 
01:19:13.030 --> 01:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
revealed what is that in regard to uh I
 
01:19:15.709 --> 01:19:15.719 align:start position:0%
simply I was on vacation when you heard
 
01:19:17.870 --> 01:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
the default Energy Service bill which I
 
01:19:21.550 --> 01:19:21.560 align:start position:0%
believe is House Bill 760 and when I
 
01:19:24.030 --> 01:19:24.040 align:start position:0%
came home from vacation I watched uh
 
01:19:26.950 --> 01:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
hearings EX examiner spidell's testimony
 
01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
and what he was talking to you about and
 
01:19:31.550 --> 01:19:31.560 align:start position:0%
you all were here I was not but what he
 
01:19:34.189 --> 01:19:34.199 align:start position:0%
was talking to you about was analysis
 
01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
that the Pu had conducted internally
 
01:19:40.430 --> 01:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
that demonstrated that when you rely
 
01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
either significantly or exclusively on
 
01:19:46.590 --> 01:19:46.600 align:start position:0%
the iso New England spot Market uh for
 
01:19:49.629 --> 01:19:49.639 align:start position:0%
default Energy Service Supply uh there
 
01:19:52.390 --> 01:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
will be I think he said in 99 out of 100
 
01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:55.199 align:start position:0%
cases an over
 
01:19:57.350 --> 01:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
recovery so that there wouldn't be a
 
01:20:00.430 --> 01:20:00.440 align:start position:0%
default Energy Service shortfall I don't
 
01:20:03.310 --> 01:20:03.320 align:start position:0%
I would love to see where they get that
 
01:20:07.709 --> 01:20:07.719 align:start position:0%
from but they have not revealed it and
 
01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh I'm just relying on what I heard Mr
 
01:20:11.950 --> 01:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
spidel say to
 
01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
you so as far as you know that's not
 
01:20:16.669 --> 01:20:16.679 align:start position:0%
evidence that's been submitted to them
 
01:20:20.229 --> 01:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
by someone else uh I believe he said it
 
01:20:23.149 --> 01:20:23.159 align:start position:0%
was evidence that they had developed
 
01:20:25.870 --> 01:20:25.880 align:start position:0%
internally meaning potentially I I know
 
01:20:28.070 --> 01:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
that pu hires outside Consultants from
 
01:20:31.430 --> 01:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
time to time that work with them so uh
 
01:20:34.390 --> 01:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
so so and again this is exactly the kind
 
01:20:36.629 --> 01:20:36.639 align:start position:0%
of thing that creating the department of
 
01:20:38.590 --> 01:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
energy was supposed to prevent from
 
01:20:40.750 --> 01:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
happening right like basically the
 
01:20:43.149 --> 01:20:43.159 align:start position:0%
evidence that the Pu considers is
 
01:20:45.629 --> 01:20:45.639 align:start position:0%
supposed to be vetted at contested
 
01:20:47.390 --> 01:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
hearings so that people have
 
01:20:50.590 --> 01:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
opportunities to cross examine the
 
01:20:54.830 --> 01:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
witnesses and develop uh a full and fair
 
01:20:57.110 --> 01:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
body of evidence in the case of default
 
01:21:00.510 --> 01:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
Energy Service the Pu has settled upon a
 
01:21:02.510 --> 01:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
policy approach there are lots of
 
01:21:04.830 --> 01:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
different ways of doing default service
 
01:21:07.790 --> 01:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
the puc favors a particular method they
 
01:21:10.229 --> 01:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
would like to rely exclusively on the
 
01:21:12.270 --> 01:21:12.280 align:start position:0%
spot market and they would like to take
 
01:21:14.709 --> 01:21:14.719 align:start position:0%
any shortfalls any under recoveries or
 
01:21:17.149 --> 01:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
over recoveries and socialize those
 
01:21:19.830 --> 01:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
responsibilities among all customers
 
01:21:21.550 --> 01:21:21.560 align:start position:0%
regardless of what class they're in or
 
01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
whether they're relying on default
 
01:21:25.229 --> 01:21:25.239 align:start position:0%
service now I don't agree with any of
 
01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
that but those are policy choices and I
 
01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the constituency I
 
01:21:33.470 --> 01:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
represent have a right under the
 
01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
administrative procedure Act and the
 
01:21:38.629 --> 01:21:38.639 align:start position:0%
pu's enabling statute to subject that
 
01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
evidence to skeptical scrutiny and
 
01:21:43.750 --> 01:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
that's exactly what's not
 
01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
happening thank you for clarifying that
 
01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:48.669 align:start position:0%
happening thank you for clarifying that
representative

01:21:48.669 --> 01:21:48.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:21:51.950 --> 01:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
Kaplan thank you Mr chair and uh Mr GRE
 
01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
thank you again uh I I just playing the
 
01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
devil's advocate here I believe what
 
01:21:59.709 --> 01:21:59.719 align:start position:0%
you're saying is that the Pu is is is uh
 
01:22:01.550 --> 01:22:01.560 align:start position:0%
counting on its internal resources
 
01:22:03.990 --> 01:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
inappropriately but what this pu told us
 
01:22:05.189 --> 01:22:05.199 align:start position:0%
in relation to this bill is that they
 
01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
would be forced to do that even more
 
01:22:09.669 --> 01:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
because they won't have the resources of
 
01:22:12.550 --> 01:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
the state at their disposal so would
 
01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
that be an unintended consequence I do
 
01:22:17.870 --> 01:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
not think so I with all respect to my
 
01:22:20.590 --> 01:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
friends at the p and again you know I I
 
01:22:23.310 --> 01:22:23.320 align:start position:0%
gained nothing particularly this week by
 
01:22:24.790 --> 01:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
coming before you and saying saying
 
01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:28.120 align:start position:0%
things that will antagonize the Pu I I
 
01:22:30.189 --> 01:22:30.199 align:start position:0%
know almost everybody who works at the
 
01:22:32.229 --> 01:22:32.239 align:start position:0%
puc I know they're all good
 
01:22:34.149 --> 01:22:34.159 align:start position:0%
well-intentioned people who come to work
 
01:22:36.229 --> 01:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
every day hoping to do the right thing
 
01:22:39.310 --> 01:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
for the uh cons for the state and all of
 
01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
its people uh but they have attorneys
 
01:22:45.470 --> 01:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
they have experts they have at least as
 
01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
many resources as a court would have if
 
01:22:50.390 --> 01:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
you presented all these cases to uh say
 
01:22:52.030 --> 01:22:52.040 align:start position:0%
the superior court or the federal
 
01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
district court I'm confident in their
 
01:22:56.669 --> 01:22:56.679 align:start position:0%
ability to decide cases based on the
 
01:22:58.950 --> 01:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
evidence that is presented to them by
 
01:23:01.070 --> 01:23:01.080 align:start position:0%
Advocates but instead what you have is
 
01:23:03.629 --> 01:23:03.639 align:start position:0%
the Pu because again it's pursuing
 
01:23:06.149 --> 01:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
policy uh migrating towards what I would
 
01:23:08.990 --> 01:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
call an inquisitorial model where they
 
01:23:10.110 --> 01:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
basically come in and they've already
 
01:23:13.149 --> 01:23:13.159 align:start position:0%
decided what they want to do and they
 
01:23:15.110 --> 01:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
haul people before them and ask them
 
01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
questions that are designed to build the
 
01:23:19.550 --> 01:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
record to get to the answer that they
 
01:23:22.270 --> 01:23:22.280 align:start position:0%
want that is a legitimate way of doing
 
01:23:25.030 --> 01:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
things it happens not to be the way way
 
01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
you have told them you want the Pu to do
 
01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
things representative Corman thank you
 
01:23:34.910 --> 01:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you Mr Cree for taking
 
01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:35.830 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you Mr Cree for taking
my

01:23:35.830 --> 01:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:23:40.830 --> 01:23:40.840 align:start position:0%
question if the Pu needs the information
 
01:23:45.990 --> 01:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.950 align:start position:0%
 
adjudication

01:23:47.950 --> 01:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
adjudication
 
01:23:50.110 --> 01:23:50.120 align:start position:0%
and trying to figure out the best way to
 
01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
say this shouldn't the
 
01:23:57.430 --> 01:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
doe be part of every case I mean that's
 
01:24:00.669 --> 01:24:00.679 align:start position:0%
where information comes from um so I
 
01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
mean the bill would would um would say
 
01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
that the doe does not have to be part of
 
01:24:08.149 --> 01:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
every case I I don't think it's
 
01:24:09.990 --> 01:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate to compel the department of
 
01:24:13.070 --> 01:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
energy to appear in every case in every
 
01:24:16.990 --> 01:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
case that is presented to a tribunal
 
01:24:20.669 --> 01:24:20.679 align:start position:0%
somebody has the burden of proof meaning
 
01:24:23.510 --> 01:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
if they want X to happen they have to
 
01:24:25.990 --> 01:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
demonstrate by a preponderance of the
 
01:24:29.070 --> 01:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
evidence and based on the law that that
 
01:24:32.149 --> 01:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
outcome is appropriate so if that party
 
01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't come before the puc and meet its
 
01:24:37.870 --> 01:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
burden of proof then the Pu is obliged
 
01:24:39.709 --> 01:24:39.719 align:start position:0%
to say
 
01:24:42.870 --> 01:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
no that's how this should work again I'm
 
01:24:45.030 --> 01:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
I'm a victim of my legal training that's
 
01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
what I learned in law
 
01:24:49.709 --> 01:24:49.719 align:start position:0%
school representative Summers has a
 
01:24:51.709 --> 01:24:51.719 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
you again Mr C quick question for you
 
01:24:55.830 --> 01:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
earlier that you probably heard I think
 
01:24:57.070 --> 01:24:57.080 align:start position:0%
you were sitting here when I asked the
 
01:25:01.149 --> 01:25:01.159 align:start position:0%
Pu earlier about if we pass this bill if
 
01:25:03.350 --> 01:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
it would slow down the process the
 
01:25:05.669 --> 01:25:05.679 align:start position:0%
dockets even making it more defined of
 
01:25:08.550 --> 01:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
the responsibilities of doe and pu and
 
01:25:10.870 --> 01:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
he and they stated that it would slow
 
01:25:13.709 --> 01:25:13.719 align:start position:0%
down the process of docket fixture do
 
01:25:16.229 --> 01:25:16.239 align:start position:0%
you agree with that statement and um
 
01:25:18.990 --> 01:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
what's your opinion of that well I guess
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
I have two answers I mean one the Pu
 
01:25:23.830 --> 01:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
controls the pace of its docket process
 
01:25:26.950 --> 01:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
to some degree my answer is a
 
01:25:28.669 --> 01:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
recapitulation of the answer I just gave
 
01:25:30.830 --> 01:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
representative Corman which is you know
 
01:25:33.030 --> 01:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
the Pu can efficiently decide cases
 
01:25:35.229 --> 01:25:35.239 align:start position:0%
based on who has the burden of proof and
 
01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
whether that burden has been met so I
 
01:25:39.470 --> 01:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
don't accept the premise that
 
01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
automatically moving forward with a bill
 
01:25:43.950 --> 01:25:43.960 align:start position:0%
like this or moving forward with House
 
01:25:47.430 --> 01:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
Bill 535 would slow down the process but
 
01:25:51.870 --> 01:25:51.880 align:start position:0%
how efficiently this works is really the
 
01:25:54.910 --> 01:25:54.920 align:start position:0%
uh that that's a decision for the pu to
 
01:25:57.030 --> 01:25:57.040 align:start position:0%
make when I was General Counsel of the
 
01:25:59.830 --> 01:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
Pu what I said to my colleagues in the
 
01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
agency including the Commissioners all
 
01:26:05.229 --> 01:26:05.239 align:start position:0%
the time is we are a decision Factory
 
01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
our product is our def our decisions our
 
01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
job is to get it to the people who need
 
01:26:12.870 --> 01:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
it as quickly efficiently and
 
01:26:15.510 --> 01:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
expeditiously as possible so that people
 
01:26:17.470 --> 01:26:17.480 align:start position:0%
can either live with our decision or
 
01:26:20.070 --> 01:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
file an appeal to challenge our decision
 
01:26:21.669 --> 01:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
I still think that's the way the Pu
 
01:26:25.149 --> 01:26:25.159 align:start position:0%
should conceive of its Mission not as an
 
01:26:28.149 --> 01:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
avatar of enlightened energy
 
01:26:30.790 --> 01:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
policy that's the Department's job to be
 
01:26:33.950 --> 01:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
the Avatar of enlightened energy policy
 
01:26:36.590 --> 01:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
representative bernardy has a
 
01:26:40.470 --> 01:26:40.480 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair so uh
 
01:26:42.830 --> 01:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
recapitulate what I think you're you're
 
01:26:48.070 --> 01:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
saying is is uh if a case is in front of
 
01:26:50.910 --> 01:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
the Pu uh and they need additional
 
01:26:52.910 --> 01:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
evidence from those that are there
 
01:26:55.990 --> 01:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
making their case they can ask for that
 
01:26:58.350 --> 01:26:58.360 align:start position:0%
and if they don't get it then they make
 
01:27:00.669 --> 01:27:00.679 align:start position:0%
the decision based on the information
 
01:27:03.390 --> 01:27:03.400 align:start position:0%
they've received and chips fall where
 
01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
they may is that true that is a correct
 
01:27:11.910 --> 01:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:14.750 --> 01:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
you okay see no further questions I want
 
01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
to thank you for your testimony and
 
01:27:20.270 --> 01:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
since I have no more pink cards we will
 
01:27:22.910 --> 01:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on House Bill
 
01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:24.590 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on House Bill
266

01:27:24.590 --> 01:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
266
 
01:27:27.669 --> 01:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
and move quickly to a public hearing on
 
01:27:30.990 --> 01:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
house resolution 15 and I will call on
 
01:27:33.229 --> 01:27:33.239 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of that resolution
 
01:27:35.550 --> 01:27:35.560 align:start position:0%
representative Michael Harrington to
 
01:27:58.550 --> 01:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:00.790 --> 01:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
good morning again uh hopefully this
 
01:28:02.910 --> 01:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
bill will be a little less controversial
 
01:28:06.430 --> 01:28:06.440 align:start position:0%
than the last one um what this bill does
 
01:28:10.510 --> 01:28:10.520 align:start position:0%
is it it's a it's a house resolution
 
01:28:12.910 --> 01:28:12.920 align:start position:0%
to it resolved that the general court
 
01:28:14.550 --> 01:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
urges our elected members of the United
 
01:28:16.109 --> 01:28:16.119 align:start position:0%
States Congress to take whatever actions
 
01:28:18.510 --> 01:28:18.520 align:start position:0%
are possible to change FK policy so only
 
01:28:20.550 --> 01:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
costs associated with new upgraded
 
01:28:22.070 --> 01:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
electrical transmission projects that
 
01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
are found to be just and reasonable can
 
01:28:25.109 --> 01:28:25.119 align:start position:0%
be collect collected from The Raid
 
01:28:28.149 --> 01:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
payers the easiest way to explain this
 
01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
is with an example if a a utility
 
01:28:33.270 --> 01:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
electric water with this case would be
 
01:28:35.790 --> 01:28:35.800 align:start position:0%
electric utility uh goes out and works
 
01:28:37.910 --> 01:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
on a distribution project and a
 
01:28:40.270 --> 01:28:40.280 align:start position:0%
substation and they spend let's say $4
 
01:28:42.910 --> 01:28:42.920 align:start position:0%
million on that they have to file that
 
01:28:45.270 --> 01:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
with the Pu and they have the burden of
 
01:28:47.070 --> 01:28:47.080 align:start position:0%
proof to show that the cost are just in
 
01:28:50.149 --> 01:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
reasonable imprudent and therefore they
 
01:28:52.030 --> 01:28:52.040 align:start position:0%
that's how they get their compensation
 
01:28:54.229 --> 01:28:54.239 align:start position:0%
if F the costs are not found just
 
01:28:56.070 --> 01:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable then they don't get paid for
 
01:28:58.070 --> 01:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
that portion of their project simple as
 
01:29:00.510 --> 01:29:00.520 align:start position:0%
that uh for example when I was a
 
01:29:02.990 --> 01:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh back when the utilities
 
01:29:05.350 --> 01:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
own generation there was a case at one
 
01:29:06.870 --> 01:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
of the generation facilities where there
 
01:29:09.390 --> 01:29:09.400 align:start position:0%
was a water hammer problem W go into the
 
01:29:11.310 --> 01:29:11.320 align:start position:0%
details about water hammer but it causes
 
01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:14.639 align:start position:0%
a lot of damage in steam power plants
 
01:29:16.709 --> 01:29:16.719 align:start position:0%
and they presented that and they wanted
 
01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
to collect the money to repair it as
 
01:29:21.070 --> 01:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
well as for buying replacement power I
 
01:29:23.310 --> 01:29:23.320 align:start position:0%
asked one question I said water hammers
 
01:29:25.390 --> 01:29:25.400 align:start position:0%
are caus you the by operator error or by
 
01:29:28.030 --> 01:29:28.040 align:start position:0%
equipment failure which was this they
 
01:29:30.109 --> 01:29:30.119 align:start position:0%
didn't have the answer to the best of my
 
01:29:32.149 --> 01:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
knowledge they never responded and they
 
01:29:34.310 --> 01:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
never collected that money because
 
01:29:36.870 --> 01:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
apparently it must have been uh operator
 
01:29:39.830 --> 01:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
error so that's the way it works when
 
01:29:43.550 --> 01:29:43.560 align:start position:0%
it's a distribution or substation that's
 
01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
controlled under the state rules now
 
01:29:49.229 --> 01:29:49.239 align:start position:0%
flash ahead they're doing a $400 million
 
01:29:52.350 --> 01:29:52.360 align:start position:0%
project on a transmission line and they
 
01:29:55.229 --> 01:29:55.239 align:start position:0%
file all their costs with FK and FK
 
01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639 align:start position:0%
looks at it and says and you got to
 
01:29:58.070 --> 01:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
remember these filings when they were
 
01:30:00.790 --> 01:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
paper would be like measured in feet
 
01:30:03.669 --> 01:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
okay that's how how W they are FK just
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
takes the big pile and sticks them over
 
01:30:08.229 --> 01:30:08.239 align:start position:0%
here and goes we presume everything is
 
01:30:09.790 --> 01:30:09.800 align:start position:0%
prudent it's called presumption of
 
01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
prudency it was introduced some Years
 
01:30:14.189 --> 01:30:14.199 align:start position:0%
Ago by the furk and recently talked to a
 
01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
FK former FK commissioner who said it
 
01:30:18.310 --> 01:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
was the worst decision he ever made when
 
01:30:20.070 --> 01:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
he did that but that presumption of
 
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
prudency means unless someone comes down
 
01:30:25.470 --> 01:30:25.480 align:start position:0%
in in shows this particular cost is not
 
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
just and reasonable they automatically
 
01:30:30.070 --> 01:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
get put it in the rates there's no check
 
01:30:31.430 --> 01:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
on it and let's face it there isn't
 
01:30:32.709 --> 01:30:32.719 align:start position:0%
anybody out there there's no
 
01:30:35.950 --> 01:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
organization or agency whose task with
 
01:30:38.470 --> 01:30:38.480 align:start position:0%
saying I'm going to go through 5,000
 
01:30:41.310 --> 01:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
10,000 pages of submitt by a
 
01:30:43.350 --> 01:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
transmission utility and see if
 
01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
everything on there is just and
 
01:30:46.830 --> 01:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
reasonable they don't have the power to
 
01:30:48.990 --> 01:30:49.000 align:start position:0%
you know have access to their records to
 
01:30:50.669 --> 01:30:50.679 align:start position:0%
question people and this isn't the
 
01:30:52.990 --> 01:30:53.000 align:start position:0%
entity FK could do that if they chose to
 
01:30:55.109 --> 01:30:55.119 align:start position:0%
but they chose not to so this just
 
01:30:57.189 --> 01:30:57.199 align:start position:0%
simply says we're urging our
 
01:30:58.910 --> 01:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
Congressional representatives to do
 
01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
something about that and to make FK do
 
01:31:03.950 --> 01:31:03.960 align:start position:0%
their job just like is done by the Pu
 
01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
and I think every state in the country
 
01:31:07.870 --> 01:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
where you have to show the cost adjust
 
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
and reasonable before you get or you
 
01:31:11.790 --> 01:31:11.800 align:start position:0%
don't get paid not that we presume
 
01:31:13.270 --> 01:31:13.280 align:start position:0%
everything is dust and reasonable and
 
01:31:16.310 --> 01:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
let's proven otherwise and I'll take any
 
01:31:20.149 --> 01:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
questions questions for representative
 
01:31:24.030 --> 01:31:24.040 align:start position:0%
Harrington representative McGee
 
01:31:26.310 --> 01:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
jumped in front of you uh thank you
 
01:31:27.870 --> 01:31:27.880 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington for taking my
 
01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
question you know I think this is
 
01:31:32.709 --> 01:31:32.719 align:start position:0%
probably a a good thing to do um but I
 
01:31:35.390 --> 01:31:35.400 align:start position:0%
wondered whether you might consider
 
01:31:37.669 --> 01:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
adding a findings
 
01:31:40.350 --> 01:31:40.360 align:start position:0%
section up front so that maybe our
 
01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
Congressional folks would understand uh
 
01:31:46.070 --> 01:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
the reasoning for it because they may
 
01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
not understand how or why they should
 
01:31:51.229 --> 01:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
get involved to try and Advocate if they
 
01:31:53.149 --> 01:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
don't have maybe a little of what you
 
01:31:55.470 --> 01:31:55.480 align:start position:0%
gave us and terms of a synopsis around
 
01:31:57.030 --> 01:31:57.040 align:start position:0%
make this easy I have no problem with
 
01:31:58.109 --> 01:31:58.119 align:start position:0%
that if you especially if you want to
 
01:32:01.229 --> 01:32:01.239 align:start position:0%
write it up thanks so much appreciate
 
01:32:03.310 --> 01:32:03.320 align:start position:0%
that just what I
 
01:32:06.470 --> 01:32:06.480 align:start position:0%
need okay so representative McGee
 
01:32:09.310 --> 01:32:09.320 align:start position:0%
volunteers to write findings
 
01:32:12.189 --> 01:32:12.199 align:start position:0%
representative Thomas uh Wendy Thomas
 
01:32:15.550 --> 01:32:15.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um just if this is
 
01:32:18.270 --> 01:32:18.280 align:start position:0%
going to go to Congress on line two you
 
01:32:20.950 --> 01:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
use the word Justified and reasonable
 
01:32:24.070 --> 01:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
that goes to line three and on lines 11
 
01:32:26.590 --> 01:32:26.600 align:start position:0%
and 12 you is just and reasonable they
 
01:32:29.109 --> 01:32:29.119 align:start position:0%
should be similar yeah they should be
 
01:32:30.590 --> 01:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
just and reasonable thanks for catching
 
01:32:32.470 --> 01:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
that and one of the thing I should
 
01:32:35.709 --> 01:32:35.719 align:start position:0%
mention also is that this uh effort is
 
01:32:39.229 --> 01:32:39.239 align:start position:0%
not uh limited to just New Hampshire
 
01:32:40.870 --> 01:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
there's efforts by other states
 
01:32:43.149 --> 01:32:43.159 align:start position:0%
especially in New England uh we just had
 
01:32:44.990 --> 01:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
the consumer Advocate leave the consumer
 
01:32:46.430 --> 01:32:46.440 align:start position:0%
Advocate groups of New England have been
 
01:32:49.030 --> 01:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
looking at this as well uh and so we're
 
01:32:51.990 --> 01:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
trying to get uh you know a bigger push
 
01:32:53.870 --> 01:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
because it's it's nothing radical it's
 
01:32:56.189 --> 01:32:56.199 align:start position:0%
just simply says that you have to have
 
01:32:59.830 --> 01:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
to hold the same standard to repair or
 
01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
build a transmission line that you do
 
01:33:04.910 --> 01:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
when you repair or build a distribution
 
01:33:07.870 --> 01:33:07.880 align:start position:0%
system that that's it's not crazy and
 
01:33:11.109 --> 01:33:11.119 align:start position:0%
there is a uh a lot of projects it's
 
01:33:13.030 --> 01:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
called asset conditioning that's the
 
01:33:15.310 --> 01:33:15.320 align:start position:0%
that's the jingle term for upgrading
 
01:33:17.109 --> 01:33:17.119 align:start position:0%
these transmission lines a lot of it's
 
01:33:19.590 --> 01:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
replacing old wooden poles with steel
 
01:33:21.430 --> 01:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
poles I'm not saying these aren't
 
01:33:24.270 --> 01:33:24.280 align:start position:0%
necessary aren't needed but the burden
 
01:33:26.229 --> 01:33:26.239 align:start position:0%
of showing just and reasonable should be
 
01:33:28.629 --> 01:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
on the transmission company and not
 
01:33:30.990 --> 01:33:31.000 align:start position:0%
assume that everything is prudent so
 
01:33:32.550 --> 01:33:32.560 align:start position:0%
like I said other states are looking at
 
01:33:35.229 --> 01:33:35.239 align:start position:0%
this as well and you have to understand
 
01:33:38.950 --> 01:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
if they spend $500 million in a project
 
01:33:42.109 --> 01:33:42.119 align:start position:0%
in Conneticut 10% of that charge
 
01:33:43.669 --> 01:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
basically goes to New Hampshire rid
 
01:33:45.350 --> 01:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
payers so it's not just the pro
 
01:33:46.709 --> 01:33:46.719 align:start position:0%
transmission projects built in New
 
01:33:50.510 --> 01:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's any place in New England
 
01:33:53.870 --> 01:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
so representative parel has a question
 
01:33:55.030 --> 01:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and thank you for
 
01:33:58.390 --> 01:33:58.400 align:start position:0%
interesting this bill um I don't know if
 
01:34:00.109 --> 01:34:00.119 align:start position:0%
it's uh I can ask this question right
 
01:34:02.270 --> 01:34:02.280 align:start position:0%
now but have you taken any consideration
 
01:34:03.910 --> 01:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
about the body on the other side of the
 
01:34:06.510 --> 01:34:06.520 align:start position:0%
wall and getting this I think it's great
 
01:34:08.270 --> 01:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
I I would love to see get past them and
 
01:34:10.790 --> 01:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
get to the governor's desk I figured it
 
01:34:12.390 --> 01:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
one step at a time getting through this
 
01:34:14.030 --> 01:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
committee and then getting through the
 
01:34:16.070 --> 01:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
house and then I'll deal with the Senate
 
01:34:17.750 --> 01:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
that's thank
 
01:34:19.950 --> 01:34:19.960 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:34:22.229 --> 01:34:22.239 align:start position:0%
Reynolds thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:34:24.550 --> 01:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
you uh representative Harrington for for
 
01:34:26.669 --> 01:34:26.679 align:start position:0%
taking the lead on this you alluded to
 
01:34:30.790 --> 01:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
it in your your last um reply but I was
 
01:34:34.030 --> 01:34:34.040 align:start position:0%
going to ask kind of specifically um has
 
01:34:37.790 --> 01:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
there been you know any resolutions or
 
01:34:42.270 --> 01:34:42.280 align:start position:0%
advocacy on by bodies like uh naruk the
 
01:34:44.350 --> 01:34:44.360 align:start position:0%
the National Association of regulatory
 
01:34:46.270 --> 01:34:46.280 align:start position:0%
Commissioners or the New England you
 
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
know on this topic
 
01:34:51.550 --> 01:34:51.560 align:start position:0%
this are we yeah I don't know about
 
01:34:53.149 --> 01:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
don't don't know necessarily National I
 
01:34:54.430 --> 01:34:54.440 align:start position:0%
know I've Ted with the people at the
 
01:34:56.510 --> 01:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
department of energy and it is a big
 
01:34:58.709 --> 01:34:58.719 align:start position:0%
issue I've talked to Nesco people I me
 
01:35:00.830 --> 01:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
New England New England states committee
 
01:35:02.830 --> 01:35:02.840 align:start position:0%
on electricity I guess so that's the
 
01:35:04.270 --> 01:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
that's the organization that was formed
 
01:35:07.590 --> 01:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
some years ago to give the states a
 
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
small um independent agency to represent
 
01:35:13.870 --> 01:35:13.880 align:start position:0%
them at the uh Nee poool and ISO New
 
01:35:16.030 --> 01:35:16.040 align:start position:0%
England meetings they're they've brought
 
01:35:17.910 --> 01:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
this issue up they've concerned with the
 
01:35:20.270 --> 01:35:20.280 align:start position:0%
and I probably got the term wrong but
 
01:35:22.629 --> 01:35:22.639 align:start position:0%
it's the equivalent of the New England
 
01:35:22.639 --> 01:35:24.229 align:start position:0%
it's the equivalent of the New England
um

01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:26.310 --> 01:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
group or organization of consumer
 
01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:28.400 align:start position:0%
Advocates has also had meetings on this
 
01:35:29.910 --> 01:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
and they've been looking at it as well
 
01:35:31.470 --> 01:35:31.480 align:start position:0%
my Dawn could probably give you more
 
01:35:33.750 --> 01:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
information on that okay thank
 
01:35:36.590 --> 01:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
you so you mentioned in your
 
01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:38.310 align:start position:0%
you so you mentioned in your
introduction

01:35:38.310 --> 01:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
introduction
 
01:35:41.830 --> 01:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
that Burke currently has a
 
01:35:44.709 --> 01:35:44.719 align:start position:0%
prudency um assumption that they make
 
01:35:46.790 --> 01:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
about presumption of prudency that's
 
01:35:48.510 --> 01:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
what it's called presumption of prudency
 
01:35:51.629 --> 01:35:51.639 align:start position:0%
but the question I have is this
 
01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
resolution never mentions that
 
01:35:56.870 --> 01:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
um Assumption of
 
01:36:00.669 --> 01:36:00.679 align:start position:0%
prudency so can we assume that the
 
01:36:02.590 --> 01:36:02.600 align:start position:0%
Congress people who get this resolution
 
01:36:05.310 --> 01:36:05.320 align:start position:0%
will understand that that's what this is
 
01:36:07.430 --> 01:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
all about well maybe that's something
 
01:36:09.390 --> 01:36:09.400 align:start position:0%
that would be a a change that would
 
01:36:11.590 --> 01:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
improve it yeah I mean they probably
 
01:36:14.109 --> 01:36:14.119 align:start position:0%
they probably won't know that so I
 
01:36:16.430 --> 01:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
should say that you know FK operates
 
01:36:17.910 --> 01:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
under presumption in prudency which
 
01:36:20.830 --> 01:36:20.840 align:start position:0%
means that the transmission costs are
 
01:36:22.350 --> 01:36:22.360 align:start position:0%
considered just unreasonable unless
 
01:36:23.790 --> 01:36:23.800 align:start position:0%
proven otherwise we could there's going
 
01:36:25.470 --> 01:36:25.480 align:start position:0%
to be an amendment anyways because of
 
01:36:28.109 --> 01:36:28.119 align:start position:0%
what representative Thomas caught so we
 
01:36:29.550 --> 01:36:29.560 align:start position:0%
certainly change that and put some more
 
01:36:30.910 --> 01:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
information and we have representative
 
01:36:34.629 --> 01:36:34.639 align:start position:0%
McGee fine words coming as well so okay
 
01:36:34.639 --> 01:36:37.030 align:start position:0%
McGee fine words coming as well so okay
further

01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:36:39.629 --> 01:36:39.639 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:36:42.430 --> 01:36:42.440 align:start position:0%
Corman thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:36:44.830 --> 01:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
you representative Harrington this is
 
01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:46.350 align:start position:0%
you representative Harrington this is
really

01:36:46.350 --> 01:36:46.360 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:36:48.109 --> 01:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
interesting I don't know what the
 
01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
workload of FK is like but it seems like
 
01:36:53.030 --> 01:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
this would then generate additional work
 
01:36:56.149 --> 01:36:56.159 align:start position:0%
for them to actually verify the just and
 
01:36:56.159 --> 01:36:57.870 align:start position:0%
for them to actually verify the just and
reasonable

01:36:57.870 --> 01:36:57.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:01.360 align:start position:0%
costs um do you have any idea is is FK
 
01:37:03.510 --> 01:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
already overburdened and would this
 
01:37:06.550 --> 01:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
actually increase any
 
01:37:08.870 --> 01:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
backlog I assume it would create more
 
01:37:10.870 --> 01:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
work for f obviously if they unless
 
01:37:12.229 --> 01:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
they're just going to rub a stamp it a
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
different way that uh they would have to
 
01:37:16.550 --> 01:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
have some type of hearing on this or
 
01:37:18.310 --> 01:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
some type of adjudicative process it
 
01:37:19.790 --> 01:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
will create it definitely will create
 
01:37:22.189 --> 01:37:22.199 align:start position:0%
more cost but remember when we're not
 
01:37:24.669 --> 01:37:24.679 align:start position:0%
talking Mill millions of dollars here
 
01:37:26.990 --> 01:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking hundreds of billions of
 
01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
dollars Nationwide on these transmission
 
01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
projects and it's not limited to New
 
01:37:32.709 --> 01:37:32.719 align:start position:0%
England it's over the whole country
 
01:37:34.629 --> 01:37:34.639 align:start position:0%
we're also talking about you know the
 
01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
need to upgrade transmission because of
 
01:37:40.229 --> 01:37:40.239 align:start position:0%
data centers because of more distributed
 
01:37:43.390 --> 01:37:43.400 align:start position:0%
generation because of intermittent uh
 
01:37:45.790 --> 01:37:45.800 align:start position:0%
resources and battery storage all those
 
01:37:47.550 --> 01:37:47.560 align:start position:0%
are looking at new transmission with
 
01:37:48.950 --> 01:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
we're talking it maybe even in the
 
01:37:50.910 --> 01:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
trillions of dollars it's so much so I
 
01:37:53.550 --> 01:37:53.560 align:start position:0%
think that spending something just like
 
01:37:55.470 --> 01:37:55.480 align:start position:0%
like we do in new New Hampshire we could
 
01:37:57.390 --> 01:37:57.400 align:start position:0%
turn around and take the same policy
 
01:38:00.189 --> 01:38:00.199 align:start position:0%
here and just tell the utilities you
 
01:38:01.470 --> 01:38:01.480 align:start position:0%
know whatever you think is just in
 
01:38:03.510 --> 01:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
reasonable we'll put into rates for you
 
01:38:05.310 --> 01:38:05.320 align:start position:0%
but we don't do that this is on a larger
 
01:38:06.870 --> 01:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
scale but I think it's even more
 
01:38:08.669 --> 01:38:08.679 align:start position:0%
important been done you know as a friend
 
01:38:10.149 --> 01:38:10.159 align:start position:0%
of mine former commissioner from Rhode
 
01:38:13.109 --> 01:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
Island says that the uh transmission
 
01:38:15.070 --> 01:38:15.080 align:start position:0%
companies are the largest unregulated
 
01:38:17.950 --> 01:38:17.960 align:start position:0%
Monopoly in the United States because of
 
01:38:21.629 --> 01:38:21.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:24.830 --> 01:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
goes thank you no further questions and
 
01:38:28.390 --> 01:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
having no additional pink cards uh we
 
01:38:32.070 --> 01:38:32.080 align:start position:0%
will close the public hearing on house
 
01:38:34.149 --> 01:38:34.159 align:start position:0%
or resolution
 
01:38:37.390 --> 01:38:37.400 align:start position:0%
15 one quick clarification on that this
 
01:38:39.990 --> 01:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
is a house resolution which means it
 
01:38:42.990 --> 01:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
goes no further than the house there is
 
01:38:46.430 --> 01:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
another kind of resolution called an HCR
 
01:38:48.910 --> 01:38:48.920 align:start position:0%
which stands for house continuing
 
01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
resolution or concurrent resolution and
 
01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
that does go to the Senate this one
 
01:38:56.950 --> 01:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
however would not go to the
 
01:39:01.430 --> 01:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
Senate okay so with that we'll now turn
 
01:39:03.589 --> 01:39:03.599 align:start position:0%
to our
 
01:39:07.629 --> 01:39:07.639 align:start position:0%
next uh public hearing which is on House
 
01:39:11.870 --> 01:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
Bill 599 so I will open a public hearing
 
01:39:14.629 --> 01:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 599 establishing a
 
01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
committee to examine weatherization
 
01:39:19.709 --> 01:39:19.719 align:start position:0%
initiatives for homes in New Hampshire I
 
01:39:22.830 --> 01:39:22.840 align:start position:0%
will call on representative Heath Howard
 
01:39:37.030 --> 01:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:39.870 --> 01:39:39.880 align:start position:0%
legislation good morning representative
 
01:39:43.350 --> 01:39:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:45.910 --> 01:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
tardiness you were here earlier so I I
 
01:39:47.510 --> 01:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
knew you were just out in the
 
01:39:50.550 --> 01:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
hall well thank you I appreciate it uh
 
01:39:52.790 --> 01:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
am I am I all set to get started here
 
01:39:54.149 --> 01:39:54.159 align:start position:0%
all right wonderful
 
01:39:55.270 --> 01:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh hello everyone my name is
 
01:39:56.830 --> 01:39:56.840 align:start position:0%
representative Heath Howard I represent
 
01:39:58.149 --> 01:39:58.159 align:start position:0%
the towns of straford and barington in
 
01:40:00.270 --> 01:40:00.280 align:start position:0%
straford District 4 uh thank you
 
01:40:02.070 --> 01:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
honorable Mr chair and committee members
 
01:40:03.310 --> 01:40:03.320 align:start position:0%
for being here
 
01:40:05.870 --> 01:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
today I want you all to imagine a family
 
01:40:07.550 --> 01:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
shivering through another harsh winter
 
01:40:08.870 --> 01:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
despite working
 
01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
tirelessly uh they have to face
 
01:40:13.790 --> 01:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
impossible choices heating their homes
 
01:40:15.709 --> 01:40:15.719 align:start position:0%
buying groceries or paying for medical
 
01:40:18.430 --> 01:40:18.440 align:start position:0%
bills this isn't just a story this is
 
01:40:20.229 --> 01:40:20.239 align:start position:0%
the reality for thousands of granite
 
01:40:22.390 --> 01:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
Staters and today I encourage you to
 
01:40:23.950 --> 01:40:23.960 align:start position:0%
support forming AUD study committee to
 
01:40:25.510 --> 01:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
look at the weatherization of homes in
 
01:40:28.669 --> 01:40:28.679 align:start position:0%
our state New Hampshire Winters are cold
 
01:40:30.589 --> 01:40:30.599 align:start position:0%
and you can see it in our energy bills
 
01:40:32.470 --> 01:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
with 60% of our homes being built before
 
01:40:35.550 --> 01:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
1980 many lack modern Energy Efficiency
 
01:40:38.109 --> 01:40:38.119 align:start position:0%
upgrades the result families spend up to
 
01:40:41.430 --> 01:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
30% more on their income on heating far
 
01:40:43.390 --> 01:40:43.400 align:start position:0%
above the national average
 
01:40:45.669 --> 01:40:45.679 align:start position:0%
weatherization can cut these costs by
 
01:40:49.870 --> 01:40:49.880 align:start position:0%
25% saving households hundreds
 
01:40:52.550 --> 01:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
annually residential energy use accounts
 
01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
for 20% of our state's carbon emissions
 
01:40:56.830 --> 01:40:56.840 align:start position:0%
and weatherization could reduce our our
 
01:40:59.270 --> 01:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
state footprint by decreasing
 
01:41:01.790 --> 01:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
demand imagine the impact if just half
 
01:41:04.510 --> 01:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
of our homes were weatherized we'd cut
 
01:41:07.109 --> 01:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
emissions equivalent to taking 50,000
 
01:41:09.589 --> 01:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
cars off the road and this committee
 
01:41:11.390 --> 01:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
would help us align with New Hampshire's
 
01:41:12.990 --> 01:41:13.000 align:start position:0%
climate action plan ensuring that we
 
01:41:16.470 --> 01:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
meet our 2030 sustainability goals cold
 
01:41:18.270 --> 01:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
homes aren't just uncomfortable they're
 
01:41:20.910 --> 01:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
also dangerous poor insulation leads to
 
01:41:23.990 --> 01:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
dampness mold and respiratory illnesses
 
01:41:26.790 --> 01:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
for our elderly risks like hypothermia
 
01:41:29.629 --> 01:41:29.639 align:start position:0%
Skyrocket a study in Manchester found
 
01:41:32.830 --> 01:41:32.840 align:start position:0%
weatherized homes had 30% fewer en uh
 
01:41:34.109 --> 01:41:34.119 align:start position:0%
emergency room
 
01:41:36.870 --> 01:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
visits uh and by addressing these
 
01:41:38.910 --> 01:41:38.920 align:start position:0%
hazards we could protect our most
 
01:41:40.870 --> 01:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
vulnerable and reduce public healthc
 
01:41:40.880 --> 01:41:41.750 align:start position:0%
vulnerable and reduce public healthc
care

01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:41:44.470 --> 01:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
burdens low-income and Rural households
 
01:41:46.790 --> 01:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
suffer the most because they often live
 
01:41:50.270 --> 01:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
in older homes lack up fun funds for
 
01:41:53.229 --> 01:41:53.239 align:start position:0%
upgrades and face energy insecurity a
 
01:41:55.149 --> 01:41:55.159 align:start position:0%
committee will ensure targeted Solutions
 
01:41:57.390 --> 01:41:57.400 align:start position:0%
like expanding the NH weatherization
 
01:41:59.310 --> 01:41:59.320 align:start position:0%
assistance program to help bridge this
 
01:42:02.229 --> 01:42:02.239 align:start position:0%
Gap some may argue why a new committee
 
01:42:04.310 --> 01:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
existing efforts are commendable but
 
01:42:06.589 --> 01:42:06.599 align:start position:0%
they're fragmented a centralized body
 
01:42:08.669 --> 01:42:08.679 align:start position:0%
will unify stakeholders help leverage
 
01:42:11.470 --> 01:42:11.480 align:start position:0%
federal funds and prioritize data div
 
01:42:15.070 --> 01:42:15.080 align:start position:0%
strategies um while also the fact that
 
01:42:19.510 --> 01:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
this would help uh us put a plan in
 
01:42:23.470 --> 01:42:23.480 align:start position:0%
place so that every dollar that we spend
 
01:42:27.589 --> 01:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
would return $2.50 in societal benefits
 
01:42:30.510 --> 01:42:30.520 align:start position:0%
the payoffs are clear and we should be a
 
01:42:32.589 --> 01:42:32.599 align:start position:0%
state that turns challenges into
 
01:42:34.350 --> 01:42:34.360 align:start position:0%
opportunities let's form a study
 
01:42:36.950 --> 01:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
committee to strategize and act for the
 
01:42:38.990 --> 01:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
families struggling for our environment
 
01:42:40.950 --> 01:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
and for New Hampshire's Legacy let's
 
01:42:42.990 --> 01:42:43.000 align:start position:0%
build a future where no one must choose
 
01:42:46.270 --> 01:42:46.280 align:start position:0%
between warmth and survival thank
 
01:42:49.310 --> 01:42:49.320 align:start position:0%
you thank you for introducing this
 
01:42:52.310 --> 01:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
legislation questions for representative
 
01:42:55.910 --> 01:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
Howard representative Kaplan thank you
 
01:42:57.510 --> 01:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you m
 
01:42:58.830 --> 01:42:58.840 align:start position:0%
representative Howard for bringing this
 
01:43:01.870 --> 01:43:01.880 align:start position:0%
fine bill I I support it wholeheartedly
 
01:43:04.589 --> 01:43:04.599 align:start position:0%
um I you know agree with your assessment
 
01:43:07.870 --> 01:43:07.880 align:start position:0%
that it would uh help with solving our
 
01:43:11.229 --> 01:43:11.239 align:start position:0%
carbon footprint and it's an imperative
 
01:43:13.830 --> 01:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
to make quality of life better for our
 
01:43:16.550 --> 01:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
residents um would you also agree that
 
01:43:18.149 --> 01:43:18.159 align:start position:0%
given the housing shortage and
 
01:43:20.790 --> 01:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
especially the the affordability crisis
 
01:43:23.550 --> 01:43:23.560 align:start position:0%
in our housing stock that this would be
 
01:43:25.990 --> 01:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
a a key element in solving the housing
 
01:43:28.709 --> 01:43:28.719 align:start position:0%
crisis in our state yeah I I I do think
 
01:43:31.589 --> 01:43:31.599 align:start position:0%
that it would uh I think that in terms
 
01:43:34.910 --> 01:43:34.920 align:start position:0%
of uh the solutions for our our housing
 
01:43:36.589 --> 01:43:36.599 align:start position:0%
strategy that we need to put forward we
 
01:43:38.589 --> 01:43:38.599 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that we aren't just
 
01:43:40.669 --> 01:43:40.679 align:start position:0%
building as many homes as possible but
 
01:43:42.589 --> 01:43:42.599 align:start position:0%
we have to build quality homes that
 
01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:51.390 --> 01:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh I have a question for you
 
01:43:54.550 --> 01:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
so then in Hampshire Department of energ
 
01:43:58.109 --> 01:43:58.119 align:start position:0%
manages several weatherization programs
 
01:44:00.550 --> 01:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire saves program which is
 
01:44:04.510 --> 01:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
administ and administered by the state's
 
01:44:06.990 --> 01:44:07.000 align:start position:0%
utilities has an extensive
 
01:44:09.270 --> 01:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
weatherization program why do you think
 
01:44:12.510 --> 01:44:12.520 align:start position:0%
we need to study weatherization more
 
01:44:18.030 --> 01:44:18.040 align:start position:0%
than what these entities already know
 
01:44:19.870 --> 01:44:19.880 align:start position:0%
about weatherization and what they
 
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
already do about it uh well thank you
 
01:44:24.510 --> 01:44:24.520 align:start position:0%
for the question Mr and part of it is
 
01:44:27.510 --> 01:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
like I said it comes down to creating a
 
01:44:30.229 --> 01:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
centralized uh voice to actually be able
 
01:44:32.870 --> 01:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
to combine a lot of these pre-existing
 
01:44:35.830 --> 01:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
efforts we know uh that there are a lot
 
01:44:38.109 --> 01:44:38.119 align:start position:0%
of these programs but it's making sure
 
01:44:39.629 --> 01:44:39.639 align:start position:0%
that we can come together and actually
 
01:44:42.470 --> 01:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
have a place where people can look at
 
01:44:44.189 --> 01:44:44.199 align:start position:0%
one location rather than trying to
 
01:44:45.950 --> 01:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
search through many different uh piles
 
01:44:48.109 --> 01:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
of loc uh piles of information to find
 
01:44:49.910 --> 01:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
what they
 
01:44:52.030 --> 01:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
need okay additional questions
 
01:44:54.229 --> 01:44:54.239 align:start position:0%
representative Corman
 
01:44:56.310 --> 01:44:56.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman you actually uh
 
01:44:59.669 --> 01:44:59.679 align:start position:0%
touched on what I was going to ask which
 
01:45:02.149 --> 01:45:02.159 align:start position:0%
is would it
 
01:45:05.270 --> 01:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
be effective to just put more money into
 
01:45:08.550 --> 01:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
NH saves so that NH saves could serve
 
01:45:11.189 --> 01:45:11.199 align:start position:0%
more people I mean that's a
 
01:45:11.199 --> 01:45:12.750 align:start position:0%
more people I mean that's a
well-known

01:45:12.750 --> 01:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
well-known
 
01:45:15.589 --> 01:45:15.599 align:start position:0%
program and seems like the the central
 
01:45:17.589 --> 01:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
place that people would go
 
01:45:19.830 --> 01:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
anyway yeah I mean that that is a
 
01:45:22.790 --> 01:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
possibility I mean I I do think that
 
01:45:28.550 --> 01:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:31.070 --> 01:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
study additional questions
 
01:45:33.830 --> 01:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
representative Wendy Thomas thank you Mr
 
01:45:36.709 --> 01:45:36.719 align:start position:0%
chair um and thank you for being here uh
 
01:45:40.229 --> 01:45:40.239 align:start position:0%
representative Howard uh do you envision
 
01:45:41.910 --> 01:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
this committee also looking at the New
 
01:45:44.510 --> 01:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire energy codes as part of this
 
01:45:47.070 --> 01:45:47.080 align:start position:0%
initiative I could uh very easily see
 
01:45:59.709 --> 01:45:59.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:59.719 --> 01:46:00.910 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:46:00.910 --> 01:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:46:03.709 --> 01:46:03.719 align:start position:0%
Kaplan thank you Mr Vice chair uh
 
01:46:05.910 --> 01:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
followup question for you representative
 
01:46:08.790 --> 01:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
Howard um we've heard New Hampshire
 
01:46:10.790 --> 01:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
saves is a fine organization they do
 
01:46:13.270 --> 01:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
great work in the state do they have a a
 
01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
knowledge or is it part of their mission
 
01:46:19.830 --> 01:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
to to assess the the the the state of
 
01:46:22.030 --> 01:46:22.040 align:start position:0%
our housing stock across the entire
 
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
state do they do they look at the
 
01:46:25.750 --> 01:46:25.760 align:start position:0%
housing stock themselves and say oh
 
01:46:27.669 --> 01:46:27.679 align:start position:0%
here's where we we can use uh you know
 
01:46:30.070 --> 01:46:30.080 align:start position:0%
some huge weatherization projects in
 
01:46:32.070 --> 01:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
Nashville or manest princi or do they
 
01:46:34.270 --> 01:46:34.280 align:start position:0%
wait for people to come to
 
01:46:36.830 --> 01:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
them I'm not 100% certain on that that
 
01:46:39.830 --> 01:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
might be a better question for somebody
 
01:46:42.390 --> 01:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
else additional questions representative
 
01:46:44.790 --> 01:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:46:47.030 --> 01:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
you representative uh Howard for being
 
01:46:50.149 --> 01:46:50.159 align:start position:0%
here today um I'm I'm really interested
 
01:46:52.229 --> 01:46:52.239 align:start position:0%
in this because I uh was on the easy
 
01:46:55.310 --> 01:46:55.320 align:start position:0%
board for a while while and I heard from
 
01:46:59.510 --> 01:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh Matt cisa who's with GDs and recently
 
01:47:01.950 --> 01:47:01.960 align:start position:0%
about this bill um he knew it was coming
 
01:47:03.870 --> 01:47:03.880 align:start position:0%
to the committee and he gave me he
 
01:47:07.669 --> 01:47:07.679 align:start position:0%
reached out to me because he mentioned
 
01:47:10.830 --> 01:47:10.840 align:start position:0%
that uh there is still uh a stakeholder
 
01:47:12.870 --> 01:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
group of small
 
01:47:16.189 --> 01:47:16.199 align:start position:0%
weatherization providers uh and other
 
01:47:18.470 --> 01:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
stakeholders trying to do that very work
 
01:47:19.629 --> 01:47:19.639 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about trying to
 
01:47:21.709 --> 01:47:21.719 align:start position:0%
figure out how do we make New
 
01:47:24.030 --> 01:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's housing stock
 
01:47:27.510 --> 01:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
more um efficient and uh you know
 
01:47:29.390 --> 01:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
basically lowering the de on the the
 
01:47:33.229 --> 01:47:33.239 align:start position:0%
demand side for um external fossil fuels
 
01:47:35.910 --> 01:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
being imported into the state so I was
 
01:47:38.310 --> 01:47:38.320 align:start position:0%
just wondering whether in anyone had
 
01:47:41.350 --> 01:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
reached out to you in terms of um
 
01:47:43.589 --> 01:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
participation on any type of committee
 
01:47:43.599 --> 01:47:44.310 align:start position:0%
participation on any type of committee
or

01:47:44.310 --> 01:47:44.320 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:47:46.629 --> 01:47:46.639 align:start position:0%
commission uh from the state because
 
01:47:48.109 --> 01:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
there are people that are you know they
 
01:47:49.790 --> 01:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
want to do that work but there isn't
 
01:47:53.550 --> 01:47:53.560 align:start position:0%
really uh any state initiative that's
 
01:47:55.030 --> 01:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
promoting it at this point which I'm
 
01:47:56.750 --> 01:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
assuming you're going to want to have a
 
01:47:58.310 --> 01:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
report come out of this commission right
 
01:48:00.510 --> 01:48:00.520 align:start position:0%
for what we should do and why we should
 
01:48:04.310 --> 01:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
do it is that right yeah I I I do want a
 
01:48:06.510 --> 01:48:06.520 align:start position:0%
report to come out of this if possible
 
01:48:09.390 --> 01:48:09.400 align:start position:0%
uh but I have not been contacted by
 
01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
anybody from the state specifically I
 
01:48:14.030 --> 01:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
have had a few other individuals reach
 
01:48:16.310 --> 01:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
out uh saying that they would be very
 
01:48:19.109 --> 01:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
interested in coming to uh the study
 
01:48:23.310 --> 01:48:23.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:25.189 --> 01:48:25.199 align:start position:0%
representative Vice chair Thomas has a
 
01:48:26.750 --> 01:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:48:31.030 --> 01:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question just uh an
 
01:48:34.950 --> 01:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
idea instead of a committee uh at this
 
01:48:40.430 --> 01:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
bill has would it not be perhaps as um
 
01:48:42.870 --> 01:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
effective to perhaps uh just turn this
 
01:48:44.589 --> 01:48:44.599 align:start position:0%
into a request to the Department of
 
01:48:48.470 --> 01:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
energy to perform a report and a study
 
01:48:49.870 --> 01:48:49.880 align:start position:0%
involving the subject I think they have
 
01:48:52.830 --> 01:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of data on their hands as it is
 
01:48:56.910 --> 01:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
but would that not be uh perhaps more
 
01:48:58.910 --> 01:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
effective I mean I think that that would
 
01:49:02.589 --> 01:49:02.599 align:start position:0%
be uh a a fine way of doing it I I mean
 
01:49:05.350 --> 01:49:05.360 align:start position:0%
but as you know uh being legislators
 
01:49:07.910 --> 01:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
here uh having uh a little bit more of
 
01:49:11.030 --> 01:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to have in-depth uh
 
01:49:14.189 --> 01:49:14.199 align:start position:0%
knowledge and a chance to participate in
 
01:49:19.430 --> 01:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:22.310 --> 01:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
good okay seeing no further questions
 
01:49:25.390 --> 01:49:25.400 align:start position:0%
oops there is one representative F sorry
 
01:49:27.830 --> 01:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
my habit of holding off to the end thank
 
01:49:33.109 --> 01:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
you and thank you representative Howards
 
01:49:35.510 --> 01:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
um the question
 
01:49:38.910 --> 01:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
is did you reach out to any or did any
 
01:49:41.350 --> 01:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
reach out to you from the construction
 
01:49:43.550 --> 01:49:43.560 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:49.830 --> 01:49:49.840 align:start position:0%
businesses I've I've had a few
 
01:49:53.390 --> 01:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
individuals reach out um I'm not on %
 
01:49:56.910 --> 01:49:56.920 align:start position:0%
sure if uh they're business owners or
 
01:49:58.950 --> 01:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
not I know that one of them has been
 
01:50:01.310 --> 01:50:01.320 align:start position:0%
very involved with a lot of the energy
 
01:50:05.229 --> 01:50:05.239 align:start position:0%
code bills uh and has
 
01:50:07.790 --> 01:50:07.800 align:start position:0%
uh quite a bit of knowledge on that I
 
01:50:10.709 --> 01:50:10.719 align:start position:0%
think that they are an inspector of some
 
01:50:14.149 --> 01:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
sort um if that kind of answers your
 
01:50:18.350 --> 01:50:18.360 align:start position:0%
question follow up thank you chair um my
 
01:50:20.390 --> 01:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
followup is I might be living in a
 
01:50:24.310 --> 01:50:24.320 align:start position:0%
bubble do you see a need
 
01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:25.430 align:start position:0%
bubble do you see a need
to

01:50:25.430 --> 01:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:50:28.669 --> 01:50:28.679 align:start position:0%
counter that my bubble
 
01:50:33.550 --> 01:50:33.560 align:start position:0%
was when I was looking for rehabbing a
 
01:50:39.390 --> 01:50:39.400 align:start position:0%
place for Pacific issue I was upsal on
 
01:50:44.030 --> 01:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
all of many um weatherization which I
 
01:50:46.669 --> 01:50:46.679 align:start position:0%
plan to do myself but everyone I I wish
 
01:50:48.310 --> 01:50:48.320 align:start position:0%
I had the
 
01:50:52.030 --> 01:50:52.040 align:start position:0%
numbers volunteered how to do it better
 
01:50:54.510 --> 01:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
do you see that that lacking that needs
 
01:50:56.910 --> 01:50:56.920 align:start position:0%
to be looked
 
01:51:00.149 --> 01:51:00.159 align:start position:0%
into I mean I think that there are a lot
 
01:51:02.709 --> 01:51:02.719 align:start position:0%
of opportunities for for business people
 
01:51:05.830 --> 01:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
uh especially if we uh try and uh
 
01:51:08.750 --> 01:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
provide weatherization options this is
 
01:51:11.069 --> 01:51:11.079 align:start position:0%
not necessarily trying to impose any new
 
01:51:13.189 --> 01:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
requirements like certain energy codes
 
01:51:15.510 --> 01:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
but like you said when we do have the
 
01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity for people who are
 
01:51:18.510 --> 01:51:18.520 align:start position:0%
experienced and have the business
 
01:51:20.709 --> 01:51:20.719 align:start position:0%
knowledge as to what can be done to
 
01:51:23.149 --> 01:51:23.159 align:start position:0%
improve uh the weatherization and the
 
01:51:24.709 --> 01:51:24.719 align:start position:0%
insulation in your home so that you can
 
01:51:27.229 --> 01:51:27.239 align:start position:0%
save energy I think that there are a lot
 
01:51:28.870 --> 01:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
of people who are doing a lot of good on
 
01:51:31.790 --> 01:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
that front but uh it's the fact that
 
01:51:34.390 --> 01:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
right now uh if we can help provide some
 
01:51:36.430 --> 01:51:36.440 align:start position:0%
additional opportunities for some of
 
01:51:38.430 --> 01:51:38.440 align:start position:0%
these business owners to get some of
 
01:51:41.189 --> 01:51:41.199 align:start position:0%
these resources from the state to figure
 
01:51:44.149 --> 01:51:44.159 align:start position:0%
out what is the best way to go about uh
 
01:51:46.350 --> 01:51:46.360 align:start position:0%
providing these so that not only are the
 
01:51:48.189 --> 01:51:48.199 align:start position:0%
business owners is benefiting but also
 
01:51:50.870 --> 01:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
the consumer as
 
01:51:53.550 --> 01:51:53.560 align:start position:0%
well representative scheller has a
 
01:51:55.910 --> 01:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
question thank you chairman Vos and
 
01:51:57.270 --> 01:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Howard for
 
01:52:00.550 --> 01:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
being here uh my my question maybe
 
01:52:03.709 --> 01:52:03.719 align:start position:0%
touching upon that uh last comment would
 
01:52:06.709 --> 01:52:06.719 align:start position:0%
this not be better handled by businesses
 
01:52:08.790 --> 01:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
I mean this is essentially as I
 
01:52:11.510 --> 01:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
understand it a sales and marketing it's
 
01:52:13.830 --> 01:52:13.840 align:start position:0%
it's developing a product then sales and
 
01:52:16.109 --> 01:52:16.119 align:start position:0%
marketing and then taking that product
 
01:52:19.030 --> 01:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
out to Consumers that actually need the
 
01:52:20.790 --> 01:52:20.800 align:start position:0%
product if that
 
01:52:24.109 --> 01:52:24.119 align:start position:0%
exists yeah I I mean that is true but
 
01:52:25.709 --> 01:52:25.719 align:start position:0%
when we're looking at a number of
 
01:52:27.950 --> 01:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
different things like reducing our total
 
01:52:30.629 --> 01:52:30.639 align:start position:0%
energy out usage that's going to when
 
01:52:32.629 --> 01:52:32.639 align:start position:0%
we're looking at supply and demand and
 
01:52:34.790 --> 01:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
the total amount that energy costs are
 
01:52:37.149 --> 01:52:37.159 align:start position:0%
going to be when we have additional
 
01:52:39.589 --> 01:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
costs to heat people's homes that means
 
01:52:40.589 --> 01:52:40.599 align:start position:0%
that we're going to have additional
 
01:52:42.350 --> 01:52:42.360 align:start position:0%
demand meaning that prices are going to
 
01:52:46.030 --> 01:52:46.040 align:start position:0%
be higher so this is trying to not just
 
01:52:48.589 --> 01:52:48.599 align:start position:0%
uh make it cheaper for the individual
 
01:52:50.950 --> 01:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
looking at these weatherization options
 
01:52:52.910 --> 01:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
so that they lower their own house
 
01:52:55.109 --> 01:52:55.119 align:start position:0%
energy bills but looking at a state to
 
01:52:58.189 --> 01:52:58.199 align:start position:0%
try and lower our overall rates as a
 
01:53:02.430 --> 01:53:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:05.229 --> 01:53:05.239 align:start position:0%
you representative Wendy Thomas thank
 
01:53:08.149 --> 01:53:08.159 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um and thank you for taking
 
01:53:11.589 --> 01:53:11.599 align:start position:0%
my question again um I am a BPI building
 
01:53:15.149 --> 01:53:15.159 align:start position:0%
analyst um and since taking that course
 
01:53:17.550 --> 01:53:17.560 align:start position:0%
I cannot drive by a house without
 
01:53:19.669 --> 01:53:19.679 align:start position:0%
looking at the house at the roof during
 
01:53:23.310 --> 01:53:23.320 align:start position:0%
the winter time and you can tell where
 
01:53:26.069 --> 01:53:26.079 align:start position:0%
where the insulation is lacking with
 
01:53:27.629 --> 01:53:27.639 align:start position:0%
because of ice dams and because of
 
01:53:29.629 --> 01:53:29.639 align:start position:0%
heating from the house it's it's really
 
01:53:31.629 --> 01:53:31.639 align:start position:0%
remarkable once you've once you've had
 
01:53:35.109 --> 01:53:35.119 align:start position:0%
that sort of exposure I would think that
 
01:53:38.910 --> 01:53:38.920 align:start position:0%
a big part of this would be education
 
01:53:42.310 --> 01:53:42.320 align:start position:0%
for current not not just business but
 
01:53:45.790 --> 01:53:45.800 align:start position:0%
current home owners because there are
 
01:53:48.830 --> 01:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
estimates 30% of our heating bill is
 
01:53:51.229 --> 01:53:51.239 align:start position:0%
literally going through the roof it's
 
01:53:53.149 --> 01:53:53.159 align:start position:0%
being wasted in New hampsh sure New
 
01:53:56.229 --> 01:53:56.239 align:start position:0%
England in general is horrible is there
 
01:53:58.990 --> 01:53:59.000 align:start position:0%
a question here the the question is do
 
01:54:01.189 --> 01:54:01.199 align:start position:0%
you also agree that education is a big
 
01:54:04.229 --> 01:54:04.239 align:start position:0%
part of this yes yes it is and making
 
01:54:07.149 --> 01:54:07.159 align:start position:0%
sure that all consumers especially
 
01:54:10.430 --> 01:54:10.440 align:start position:0%
people uh who may not necessarily be as
 
01:54:14.229 --> 01:54:14.239 align:start position:0%
involved uh with uh looking at their
 
01:54:16.149 --> 01:54:16.159 align:start position:0%
homes themselves and trying to figure
 
01:54:17.709 --> 01:54:17.719 align:start position:0%
out when they're going to need some of
 
01:54:21.109 --> 01:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
these upgrades uh but yes I do think
 
01:54:26.990 --> 01:54:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:30.470 --> 01:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
this okay representative Swanson has a
 
01:54:33.229 --> 01:54:33.239 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:54:36.270 --> 01:54:36.280 align:start position:0%
you representative Howard I just uh I
 
01:54:39.229 --> 01:54:39.239 align:start position:0%
don't know uh I'm may have had
 
01:54:41.950 --> 01:54:41.960 align:start position:0%
incomplete notes here but you
 
01:54:44.990 --> 01:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
referenced turning $1 into
 
01:54:47.950 --> 01:54:47.960 align:start position:0%
$2.50 or $2 I imagine there's a little
 
01:54:50.310 --> 01:54:50.320 align:start position:0%
bit that's kind of rough approximation
 
01:54:52.870 --> 01:54:52.880 align:start position:0%
but you can can you elaborate uh where
 
01:54:57.189 --> 01:54:57.199 align:start position:0%
that $1 comes from and how it becomes
 
01:55:01.189 --> 01:55:01.199 align:start position:0%
250 yeah so uh when we're looking at
 
01:55:02.950 --> 01:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
every dollar that we're spending on
 
01:55:05.270 --> 01:55:05.280 align:start position:0%
weatherization we can kind of expect
 
01:55:09.069 --> 01:55:09.079 align:start position:0%
$2.50 back in return uh so that's going
 
01:55:12.589 --> 01:55:12.599 align:start position:0%
to be $1 on additional insulation or
 
01:55:14.430 --> 01:55:14.440 align:start position:0%
energy saving
 
01:55:18.069 --> 01:55:18.079 align:start position:0%
uh services that uh would allow people
 
01:55:21.790 --> 01:55:21.800 align:start position:0%
to uh save money on their energy bills
 
01:55:25.069 --> 01:55:25.079 align:start position:0%
uh the $2.50 that benefit comes back
 
01:55:27.030 --> 01:55:27.040 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at your energy bill
 
01:55:29.790 --> 01:55:29.800 align:start position:0%
and by every dollar that you spent extra
 
01:55:31.870 --> 01:55:31.880 align:start position:0%
on those extra insulation products for
 
01:55:34.990 --> 01:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
instance you would get $2.50 back in
 
01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:36.669 align:start position:0%
instance you would get $2.50 back in
return

01:55:36.669 --> 01:55:36.679 align:start position:0%
return
 
01:55:39.310 --> 01:55:39.320 align:start position:0%
followup followup so so then you're
 
01:55:42.149 --> 01:55:42.159 align:start position:0%
you're saying that uh this is this is
 
01:55:45.149 --> 01:55:45.159 align:start position:0%
the the homeowner or the business
 
01:55:48.790 --> 01:55:48.800 align:start position:0%
owner's dollar that this is just educ
 
01:55:51.990 --> 01:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
educating them how they can turn you
 
01:55:55.629 --> 01:55:55.639 align:start position:0%
know better invest to get that return on
 
01:55:59.910 --> 01:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
investment yes correct thank
 
01:56:02.950 --> 01:56:02.960 align:start position:0%
you okay seeing no further questions
 
01:56:05.350 --> 01:56:05.360 align:start position:0%
we'll call on Meg Stone from the
 
01:56:07.149 --> 01:56:07.159 align:start position:0%
Department of energy thank you for
 
01:56:11.589 --> 01:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:15.229 --> 01:56:15.239 align:start position:0%
you and this is the final pink card I
 
01:56:22.709 --> 01:56:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:24.390 --> 01:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair and members of the
 
01:56:25.830 --> 01:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
committee I'm sorry for the way I sound
 
01:56:28.270 --> 01:56:28.280 align:start position:0%
today my allergies are um making my life
 
01:56:30.870 --> 01:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
very difficult recently um so the
 
01:56:34.229 --> 01:56:34.239 align:start position:0%
department is neutral on House Bill 599
 
01:56:36.470 --> 01:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
and if the committee decides to move
 
01:56:38.589 --> 01:56:38.599 align:start position:0%
forward with this uh study committee
 
01:56:39.910 --> 01:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
prescribed in the bill the department
 
01:56:41.229 --> 01:56:41.239 align:start position:0%
would be happy to
 
01:56:45.470 --> 01:56:45.480 align:start position:0%
participate um so five House Bill 599
 
01:56:47.910 --> 01:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
establishes a committee to St uh with
 
01:56:49.950 --> 01:56:49.960 align:start position:0%
several duties including identifying the
 
01:56:52.510 --> 01:56:52.520 align:start position:0%
current state of weatherization programs
 
01:56:54.270 --> 01:56:54.280 align:start position:0%
analyzing existing programs and
 
01:56:56.270 --> 01:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
developing a set of proposals to promote
 
01:56:58.149 --> 01:56:58.159 align:start position:0%
and incentivize weatherization in the
 
01:57:00.830 --> 01:57:00.840 align:start position:0%
state um so the department man manages
 
01:57:03.550 --> 01:57:03.560 align:start position:0%
the weatherization assistance program or
 
01:57:06.709 --> 01:57:06.719 align:start position:0%
U WAP from the US Department of energy
 
01:57:08.629 --> 01:57:08.639 align:start position:0%
uh we contract with the state's five
 
01:57:11.149 --> 01:57:11.159 align:start position:0%
Community Action agencies that operate
 
01:57:13.950 --> 01:57:13.960 align:start position:0%
and deliver weatherization Services um
 
01:57:16.350 --> 01:57:16.360 align:start position:0%
and this is means tested and limited to
 
01:57:19.750 --> 01:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
those making 60% or less of State median
 
01:57:22.470 --> 01:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
income um once eligible and energ
 
01:57:25.030 --> 01:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
auditor will perform a a home energy
 
01:57:27.189 --> 01:57:27.199 align:start position:0%
audit and this can include anything from
 
01:57:30.069 --> 01:57:30.079 align:start position:0%
air sealing to attic insulation um an
 
01:57:33.910 --> 01:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
insulating crawl spaces or attics um the
 
01:57:35.589 --> 01:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
Caps are very knowledgeable about the
 
01:57:37.709 --> 01:57:37.719 align:start position:0%
program the offerings um and other
 
01:57:39.830 --> 01:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
programs such as New Hampshire saves
 
01:57:42.430 --> 01:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
that are dedicated to um also stretching
 
01:57:44.030 --> 01:57:44.040 align:start position:0%
some of our web funding as far as
 
01:57:45.629 --> 01:57:45.639 align:start position:0%
possible including
 
01:57:48.790 --> 01:57:48.800 align:start position:0%
supplementing um in order to cover more
 
01:57:52.310 --> 01:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
eligible more eligible households um for
 
01:57:54.470 --> 01:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
funding New Hampshire receives about $2
 
01:57:56.870 --> 01:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
million uh each year subject to
 
01:57:59.430 --> 01:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
Congressional approval um New Hampshire
 
01:58:01.870 --> 01:58:01.880 align:start position:0%
also received a one-time appropriation
 
01:58:04.510 --> 01:58:04.520 align:start position:0%
of18 million for weatherization through
 
01:58:06.950 --> 01:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure investment and jobs
 
01:58:09.069 --> 01:58:09.079 align:start position:0%
act um and I think we've received about
 
01:58:13.109 --> 01:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
50% of that um through the WAP program
 
01:58:15.149 --> 01:58:15.159 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire saves supplementing
 
01:58:17.109 --> 01:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
through the um home energy assistance
 
01:58:20.470 --> 01:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
program we've served roughly 2500
 
01:58:22.790 --> 01:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
households um and I will just just note
 
01:58:25.109 --> 01:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
that uh we' like to identify just two
 
01:58:27.189 --> 01:58:27.199 align:start position:0%
areas outlined in the duties of the bill
 
01:58:29.350 --> 01:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
to just bring to your attention um so in
 
01:58:32.669 --> 01:58:32.679 align:start position:0%
lines 12 and 13 um it states identifying
 
01:58:34.270 --> 01:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
the current state of weatherization in
 
01:58:36.310 --> 01:58:36.320 align:start position:0%
our state including the number of homes
 
01:58:37.950 --> 01:58:37.960 align:start position:0%
that are properly weatherized and those
 
01:58:40.030 --> 01:58:40.040 align:start position:0%
that are not um the department does not
 
01:58:42.830 --> 01:58:42.840 align:start position:0%
maintain a database of um homes that
 
01:58:46.069 --> 01:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
have or have not been weatherized uh nor
 
01:58:48.229 --> 01:58:48.239 align:start position:0%
do we nor does the tra the department
 
01:58:51.790 --> 01:58:51.800 align:start position:0%
track um which homeowners May install
 
01:58:54.430 --> 01:58:54.440 align:start position:0%
and Energy Efficiency measures such as
 
01:58:56.310 --> 01:58:56.320 align:start position:0%
insulation or updating heating systems
 
01:58:58.709 --> 01:58:58.719 align:start position:0%
or anything like that um and then in
 
01:59:02.069 --> 01:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
line 16 or 17 um analyzing existing
 
01:59:03.910 --> 01:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
weatherization programs and policies at
 
01:59:05.629 --> 01:59:05.639 align:start position:0%
the local state and federal levels to
 
01:59:07.709 --> 01:59:07.719 align:start position:0%
identify strengths weaknesses and areas
 
01:59:09.990 --> 01:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
of improvement um I will just note that
 
01:59:12.350 --> 01:59:12.360 align:start position:0%
states um are limited in
 
01:59:15.870 --> 01:59:15.880 align:start position:0%
modifying um or changing the federal WAP
 
01:59:17.629 --> 01:59:17.639 align:start position:0%
um states are required to compel with
 
01:59:19.629 --> 01:59:19.639 align:start position:0%
the federal terms and conditions for
 
01:59:21.870 --> 01:59:21.880 align:start position:0%
their WAP Awards and operating outside
 
01:59:23.830 --> 01:59:23.840 align:start position:0%
of those requirements could put that
 
01:59:25.430 --> 01:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
funding at risk so I just wanted to make
 
01:59:27.510 --> 01:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
sure that I noted that and um I'm happy
 
01:59:28.990 --> 01:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
to take any
 
01:59:31.069 --> 01:59:31.079 align:start position:0%
questions well thank you I have a quick
 
01:59:32.550 --> 01:59:32.560 align:start position:0%
question for you it was mentioned
 
01:59:34.870 --> 01:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
earlier that education should be a part
 
01:59:37.270 --> 01:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
of uh this
 
01:59:39.709 --> 01:59:39.719 align:start position:0%
study can you talk a little bit about
 
01:59:43.310 --> 01:59:43.320 align:start position:0%
how the department spends the
 
01:59:47.069 --> 01:59:47.079 align:start position:0%
$400,000 that uh it gets from New
 
01:59:50.470 --> 01:59:50.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saves each year to educate the
 
01:59:53.950 --> 01:59:53.960 align:start position:0%
public about whether a um as far as the
 
01:59:55.350 --> 01:59:55.360 align:start position:0%
the specific amount and what we do with
 
01:59:56.669 --> 01:59:56.679 align:start position:0%
that I'll have to just get back to you
 
01:59:59.750 --> 01:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
I'll email the committee with with that
 
02:00:02.030 --> 02:00:02.040 align:start position:0%
information can you tell us in general
 
02:00:04.510 --> 02:00:04.520 align:start position:0%
terms what the committee's doing uh
 
02:00:05.950 --> 02:00:05.960 align:start position:0%
spending that money
 
02:00:08.189 --> 02:00:08.199 align:start position:0%
on I I would I just don't want to
 
02:00:10.390 --> 02:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
misspeak so I will make sure I get you a
 
02:00:12.229 --> 02:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
comprehensive answer and send that to
 
02:00:14.830 --> 02:00:14.840 align:start position:0%
the committee Vice chair Thomas has a
 
02:00:16.669 --> 02:00:16.679 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair thank you
 
02:00:19.870 --> 02:00:19.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so if this bill
 
02:00:22.390 --> 02:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
were to pass I'm trying to figure out
 
02:00:25.189 --> 02:00:25.199 align:start position:0%
the study committee to on the two line
 
02:00:27.950 --> 02:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
items that you had mentioned um I'm
 
02:00:30.149 --> 02:00:30.159 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how they would get
 
02:00:34.950 --> 02:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
that data uh would this be a voluntary
 
02:00:36.990 --> 02:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
where people come to your door in your
 
02:00:39.990 --> 02:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
house to do inspection to find out how
 
02:00:42.189 --> 02:00:42.199 align:start position:0%
many houses are properly weatherized or
 
02:00:44.229 --> 02:00:44.239 align:start position:0%
or not how do you think that would work
 
02:00:47.310 --> 02:00:47.320 align:start position:0%
uh uh in terms of how effective the the
 
02:00:49.390 --> 02:00:49.400 align:start position:0%
committee could get some of that
 
02:00:52.669 --> 02:00:52.679 align:start position:0%
data um I'm I'm not sure how how that
 
02:00:55.310 --> 02:00:55.320 align:start position:0%
could work um other than that being a
 
02:00:57.870 --> 02:00:57.880 align:start position:0%
voluntary thing that people may just
 
02:00:59.589 --> 02:00:59.599 align:start position:0%
report on their own um we don't have
 
02:01:01.709 --> 02:01:01.719 align:start position:0%
somebody that goes out we have a lot of
 
02:01:03.030 --> 02:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
old homes in the state so we don't have
 
02:01:04.830 --> 02:01:04.840 align:start position:0%
anyone that goes out to all the homes
 
02:01:07.950 --> 02:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
asking if they've been weatherized or or
 
02:01:11.709 --> 02:01:11.719 align:start position:0%
not follow up thanks for the followup so
 
02:01:13.750 --> 02:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
um it's my understanding though that at
 
02:01:16.750 --> 02:01:16.760 align:start position:0%
least in terms of eversource um people
 
02:01:20.470 --> 02:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
can request an energy audit uh on their
 
02:01:22.790 --> 02:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
house uh free of charge is is that is
 
02:01:25.149 --> 02:01:25.159 align:start position:0%
that not correct and is it not stated on
 
02:01:28.629 --> 02:01:28.639 align:start position:0%
their on their bills um yes it's my
 
02:01:30.030 --> 02:01:30.040 align:start position:0%
understanding that yes they can they can
 
02:01:32.830 --> 02:01:32.840 align:start position:0%
request a home energy
 
02:01:35.629 --> 02:01:35.639 align:start position:0%
audit additional questions
 
02:01:38.550 --> 02:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington has one than
 
02:01:40.830 --> 02:01:40.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you for taking my question you
 
02:01:43.229 --> 02:01:43.239 align:start position:0%
you went kind of fast over the uh
 
02:01:45.310 --> 02:01:45.320 align:start position:0%
numbers there you'd mentioned something
 
02:01:47.109 --> 02:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
million here and something million there
 
02:01:48.790 --> 02:01:48.800 align:start position:0%
something cuz you What's the total that
 
02:01:51.229 --> 02:01:51.239 align:start position:0%
was spending on uh weatherization
 
02:01:53.430 --> 02:01:53.440 align:start position:0%
programs um through the thank you for
 
02:01:55.830 --> 02:01:55.840 align:start position:0%
the question through um the federal WAP
 
02:01:58.709 --> 02:01:58.719 align:start position:0%
funding we receive um about 2 million
 
02:02:01.030 --> 02:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
each year and that changes a little bit
 
02:02:02.950 --> 02:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
each year depending on Congressional
 
02:02:06.189 --> 02:02:06.199 align:start position:0%
approval and then through the
 
02:02:09.149 --> 02:02:09.159 align:start position:0%
um uh through the infrastructure
 
02:02:12.430 --> 02:02:12.440 align:start position:0%
investment jobs act uh we've received 18
 
02:02:14.910 --> 02:02:14.920 align:start position:0%
million um and I believe the state has
 
02:02:17.589 --> 02:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
received about 50% of that um and I
 
02:02:19.950 --> 02:02:19.960 align:start position:0%
believe the other 50% has been obligated
 
02:02:22.310 --> 02:02:22.320 align:start position:0%
we just haven't received it yet and just
 
02:02:24.709 --> 02:02:24.719 align:start position:0%
a followup followup and what about New
 
02:02:26.310 --> 02:02:26.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire saves how much does that spend
 
02:02:29.550 --> 02:02:29.560 align:start position:0%
a year um I don't I don't have that with
 
02:02:31.870 --> 02:02:31.880 align:start position:0%
me right now um but I can get you that
 
02:02:33.629 --> 02:02:33.639 align:start position:0%
information thank
 
02:02:36.750 --> 02:02:36.760 align:start position:0%
you representative McGee has a question
 
02:02:38.870 --> 02:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Miss stone
 
02:02:42.470 --> 02:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um are you aware
 
02:02:44.870 --> 02:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
of the Statewide weatherization
 
02:02:47.750 --> 02:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
collaborative that GDs Associates is
 
02:02:50.229 --> 02:02:50.239 align:start position:0%
running because I I have a note here
 
02:02:52.390 --> 02:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
that says that
 
02:02:54.390 --> 02:02:54.400 align:start position:0%
uh that group is meeting monthly to
 
02:02:56.189 --> 02:02:56.199 align:start position:0%
discuss issues of weatherization in the
 
02:02:57.910 --> 02:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
state and Workforce and that sort of
 
02:02:59.950 --> 02:02:59.960 align:start position:0%
thing and they say that they have um
 
02:03:03.310 --> 02:03:03.320 align:start position:0%
contractors utilities state agencies and
 
02:03:05.629 --> 02:03:05.639 align:start position:0%
Workforce aligned groups that are
 
02:03:07.109 --> 02:03:07.119 align:start position:0%
attending those meetings on a regular
 
02:03:08.870 --> 02:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
basis and bringing in speakers and that
 
02:03:10.589 --> 02:03:10.599 align:start position:0%
sort of thing in order to discuss all
 
02:03:12.310 --> 02:03:12.320 align:start position:0%
the issues around
 
02:03:14.589 --> 02:03:14.599 align:start position:0%
weatherization um I I don't work on
 
02:03:17.270 --> 02:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
weatherization uh frequently so I I we
 
02:03:19.990 --> 02:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
do have people who do so I could I I'm I
 
02:03:21.510 --> 02:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
believe that they're aware of that so I
 
02:03:23.229 --> 02:03:23.239 align:start position:0%
will just double check with them that
 
02:03:25.109 --> 02:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
they attend those it's it sounds like
 
02:03:26.629 --> 02:03:26.639 align:start position:0%
someone's attending so if you could just
 
02:03:28.270 --> 02:03:28.280 align:start position:0%
let me know what you think of that
 
02:03:29.589 --> 02:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
because they were very interested in
 
02:03:31.950 --> 02:03:31.960 align:start position:0%
this bill okay oh I'm sorry what was
 
02:03:34.229 --> 02:03:34.239 align:start position:0%
that group um they're I guess they're
 
02:03:36.270 --> 02:03:36.280 align:start position:0%
called the Statewide weatherization
 
02:03:36.280 --> 02:03:39.229 align:start position:0%
called the Statewide weatherization
collaborative

02:03:39.229 --> 02:03:39.239 align:start position:0%
collaborative
 
02:03:42.069 --> 02:03:42.079 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
02:03:44.510 --> 02:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
Thomas uh Wendy Thomas thank you Mr
 
02:03:46.589 --> 02:03:46.599 align:start position:0%
chair um you mentioned that New
 
02:03:49.870 --> 02:03:49.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has received approximately 9
 
02:03:52.589 --> 02:03:52.599 align:start position:0%
million of the 18 million um can you
 
02:03:54.069 --> 02:03:54.079 align:start position:0%
tell me how much of that has been
 
02:03:56.030 --> 02:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
allocated already to New Hampshire
 
02:03:59.149 --> 02:03:59.159 align:start position:0%
residents um I believe we have spent uh
 
02:04:01.709 --> 02:04:01.719 align:start position:0%
50% of that that we that we' have had so
 
02:04:04.669 --> 02:04:04.679 align:start position:0%
far and um so the way we received it was
 
02:04:08.030 --> 02:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
uh 15% came in when we applied for it
 
02:04:12.069 --> 02:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
and then I think it was 35 came in um
 
02:04:15.470 --> 02:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
after uh after approval and then we've
 
02:04:16.950 --> 02:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
we've gone through half of that that
 
02:04:18.669 --> 02:04:18.679 align:start position:0%
we've received so
 
02:04:18.679 --> 02:04:20.390 align:start position:0%
we've received so
far

02:04:20.390 --> 02:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
far
 
02:04:23.189 --> 02:04:23.199 align:start position:0%
clarification follow follow up so half
 
02:04:28.910 --> 02:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:32.510 --> 02:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
you okay seeing no further questions
 
02:04:35.750 --> 02:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
whoops representative Kaplan last minute
 
02:04:37.470 --> 02:04:37.480 align:start position:0%
he was chair I um actually have two
 
02:04:40.270 --> 02:04:40.280 align:start position:0%
questions um first one regarding the 18
 
02:04:42.189 --> 02:04:42.199 align:start position:0%
million that that we received from the
 
02:04:45.669 --> 02:04:45.679 align:start position:0%
infrastructure act um do you have any
 
02:04:47.589 --> 02:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
word or do you expect that we're going
 
02:04:49.990 --> 02:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
to get the other 50% that's one question
 
02:04:51.870 --> 02:04:51.880 align:start position:0%
and the second question is uh in terms
 
02:04:53.790 --> 02:04:53.800 align:start position:0%
of identifying the current state of
 
02:04:55.589 --> 02:04:55.599 align:start position:0%
weatherization uh including the number
 
02:04:57.310 --> 02:04:57.320 align:start position:0%
of homes that are properly weatherized
 
02:04:58.910 --> 02:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
those that are
 
02:05:02.030 --> 02:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
not um how would the department of
 
02:05:05.549 --> 02:05:05.559 align:start position:0%
energy facilitate that seeing that you
 
02:05:08.030 --> 02:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
don't have a database would there be uh
 
02:05:10.510 --> 02:05:10.520 align:start position:0%
the resources in the department or would
 
02:05:12.589 --> 02:05:12.599 align:start position:0%
you have to go to the Caps around around
 
02:05:15.549 --> 02:05:15.559 align:start position:0%
the state to to to determine that those
 
02:05:18.990 --> 02:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
figures sure um I'm I'm sure that the
 
02:05:22.189 --> 02:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
Caps do have information on who has
 
02:05:23.549 --> 02:05:23.559 align:start position:0%
received all of that weatherization the
 
02:05:26.030 --> 02:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
department is um we are working on
 
02:05:27.910 --> 02:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
hopefully within the next year having um
 
02:05:30.270 --> 02:05:30.280 align:start position:0%
a data management system that will be
 
02:05:32.510 --> 02:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
able to pull reports um similar to that
 
02:05:34.470 --> 02:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
but as far as homes that you have either
 
02:05:35.830 --> 02:05:35.840 align:start position:0%
not taken advantage of one of our
 
02:05:37.149 --> 02:05:37.159 align:start position:0%
programs or something that have done
 
02:05:38.990 --> 02:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
weatherization on their own um that's
 
02:05:40.750 --> 02:05:40.760 align:start position:0%
not something we could we would have
 
02:05:43.310 --> 02:05:43.320 align:start position:0%
access to um and I'm sorry what was your
 
02:05:45.870 --> 02:05:45.880 align:start position:0%
first question the infrastructure act
 
02:05:48.549 --> 02:05:48.559 align:start position:0%
are we expecting the other 50% yes so
 
02:05:51.390 --> 02:05:51.400 align:start position:0%
the other 50% um we I I believe the
 
02:05:52.350 --> 02:05:52.360 align:start position:0%
department department has to meet
 
02:05:54.709 --> 02:05:54.719 align:start position:0%
certain benchmarks and I believe that we
 
02:05:57.069 --> 02:05:57.079 align:start position:0%
um we are at the point where we have met
 
02:05:59.910 --> 02:05:59.920 align:start position:0%
those benchmarks and we're sending that
 
02:06:03.149 --> 02:06:03.159 align:start position:0%
back to us doe in order to get the the
 
02:06:07.990 --> 02:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:09.910 --> 02:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
obligated okay seeing no further
 
02:06:11.470 --> 02:06:11.480 align:start position:0%
questions want to thank you for your
 
02:06:13.430 --> 02:06:13.440 align:start position:0%

activity this afternoon we're going to
 
04:06:10.229 --> 04:06:10.239 align:start position:0%
exec four
 
04:06:14.070 --> 04:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
bills House Bill 219 FN
 
04:06:17.389 --> 04:06:17.399 align:start position:0%
relative to phasing out of the Min minim
 
04:06:20.590 --> 04:06:20.600 align:start position:0%
minimum electric renewable portfolio
 
04:06:24.790 --> 04:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
standard HB 567 FN relative to the
 
04:06:27.030 --> 04:06:27.040 align:start position:0%
elimination of useful thermal energy
 
04:06:29.389 --> 04:06:29.399 align:start position:0%
from renewable energy
 
04:06:34.389 --> 04:06:34.399 align:start position:0%
classes HB 696 FN exempting electricity
 
04:06:36.670 --> 04:06:36.680 align:start position:0%
generators from the utility property tax
 
04:06:39.030 --> 04:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
and including them under the Statewide
 
04:06:41.750 --> 04:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
education property tax and relative to

Communication Service tax
 
04:06:48.630 --> 04:06:48.640 align:start position:0%
revenues and finally HB 764 FN
 
04:06:51.070 --> 04:06:51.080 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the intentional release of
 
04:06:53.750 --> 04:06:53.760 align:start position:0%

04:06:56.389 --> 04:06:56.399 align:start position:0%
seeding weather modification excessive
 
04:06:59.070 --> 04:06:59.080 align:start position:0%
electromagnetic radio frequency and
 
04:07:02.269 --> 04:07:02.279 align:start position:0%
microwave radiation and making penalties
 
04:07:06.149 --> 04:07:06.159 align:start position:0%
for violation of such
 
04:07:08.510 --> 04:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
provision now we will not be taking
 
04:07:11.750 --> 04:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
these in the order that I just read them
 
04:07:14.670 --> 04:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
because two of these bills have
 
04:07:18.189 --> 04:07:18.199 align:start position:0%
amendments that are currently still at
 
04:07:22.229 --> 04:07:22.239 align:start position:0%
OS and will be here shortly so we will
 
04:07:26.830 --> 04:07:26.840 align:start position:0%
take up those bills when the Amendments
 
04:07:28.750 --> 04:07:28.760 align:start position:0%
arrive so
 
04:07:32.910 --> 04:07:32.920 align:start position:0%
first I will open an executive session
 
04:07:34.790 --> 04:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
on House Bill
 
04:07:40.149 --> 04:07:40.159 align:start position:0%
587 567 sorry FN and I'll recognize
 
04:07:40.159 --> 04:07:41.349 align:start position:0%
587 567 sorry FN and I'll recognize
representative

04:07:41.349 --> 04:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:07:44.349 --> 04:07:44.359 align:start position:0%
Harrington I need get one move to itl
 
04:07:44.359 --> 04:07:46.950 align:start position:0%
Harrington I need get one move to itl
the

04:07:46.950 --> 04:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:49.229 --> 04:07:49.239 align:start position:0%
bill I'm sorry representative could you
 
04:07:49.239 --> 04:07:50.269 align:start position:0%
bill I'm sorry representative could you
repeat

04:07:50.269 --> 04:07:50.279 align:start position:0%
repeat
 
04:07:53.990 --> 04:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
that itl this bill chair recognizes
 
04:07:56.590 --> 04:07:56.600 align:start position:0%
representative Summers I second that
 
04:07:59.870 --> 04:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
motion moved and seconded that we adopt
 
04:08:04.389 --> 04:08:04.399 align:start position:0%
the motion of itl for House Bill 567 FN
 
04:08:06.469 --> 04:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington you want to
 
04:08:10.070 --> 04:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
explain your motion yeah the U the I
 
04:08:12.910 --> 04:08:12.920 align:start position:0%
still think that the U the wood heat
 
04:08:15.070 --> 04:08:15.080 align:start position:0%
standard is in error and the fact that
 
04:08:17.070 --> 04:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
um electric rate payers should not be
 
04:08:19.349 --> 04:08:19.359 align:start position:0%
paying higher rates to subsidize people
 
04:08:22.469 --> 04:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
burning wood for heat uh but the bill is
 
04:08:23.990 --> 04:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
probably not going to go anywhere and we
 
04:08:27.229 --> 04:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
have adjusted some of that in HB 219 and
 
04:08:29.229 --> 04:08:29.239 align:start position:0%
so I'll just no sense in wasting
 
04:08:31.309 --> 04:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
everybody's time on this bill let's just
 
04:08:33.670 --> 04:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
itl it and concentrate on
 
04:08:36.590 --> 04:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
219 so the clerk just informed me that
 
04:08:39.269 --> 04:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
he did not get the forms he
 
04:08:42.229 --> 04:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
needed which I didn't know until just a
 
04:08:45.229 --> 04:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
second ago so we'll have to delay a vote
 
04:08:48.269 --> 04:08:48.279 align:start position:0%
on this bill until he gets back with the
 
04:08:52.189 --> 04:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
proper forms any further discussion on
 
04:08:57.269 --> 04:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
House Bill 567 representative Thomas um
 
04:09:00.309 --> 04:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas thank you Mr chair um just
 
04:09:03.349 --> 04:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
piping in to say that I concur with the
 
04:09:07.229 --> 04:09:07.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:09.710 --> 04:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
discussion representative McGee yeah
 
04:09:13.830 --> 04:09:13.840 align:start position:0%
I'll just uh pile on I guess um I think
 
04:09:16.750 --> 04:09:16.760 align:start position:0%
the hearings um were very compelling in
 
04:09:18.309 --> 04:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
that people from around the state made
 
04:09:19.910 --> 04:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
time to come in here and speak to us
 
04:09:22.070 --> 04:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
about uh
 
04:09:27.070 --> 04:09:27.080 align:start position:0%
how uh the current uh thermal program is
 
04:09:29.469 --> 04:09:29.479 align:start position:0%
assisting them whether it was uh new
 
04:09:32.469 --> 04:09:32.479 align:start position:0%
builds or folks who are uh invested like
 
04:09:35.910 --> 04:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
my town is in uh in boiler
 
04:09:38.870 --> 04:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
systems um so I just want to say I think
 
04:09:42.469 --> 04:09:42.479 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a it's great that we're
 
04:09:44.309 --> 04:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
planning to it because I I think it
 
04:09:46.590 --> 04:09:46.600 align:start position:0%
would be very disruptive to people who
 
04:09:50.389 --> 04:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
have already made the efforts to do um
 
04:09:51.870 --> 04:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
the kind of Investments that we sort of
 
04:09:55.030 --> 04:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
encourage them to do um and that the it
 
04:09:57.229 --> 04:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't disrupt that part of the wreck
 
04:10:00.429 --> 04:10:00.439 align:start position:0%
program that they are uh reliant on as
 
04:10:02.630 --> 04:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
many of them testified to make the
 
04:10:06.030 --> 04:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:08.710 --> 04:10:08.720 align:start position:0%
plants further discussion representative
 
04:10:10.790 --> 04:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
Corman if you need me to kill a little
 
04:10:13.469 --> 04:10:13.479 align:start position:0%
more time before the forms arrive yes I
 
04:10:15.990 --> 04:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
agree uh we really did hear that a lot
 
04:10:18.309 --> 04:10:18.319 align:start position:0%
of people are relying on thermal uh
 
04:10:22.469 --> 04:10:22.479 align:start position:0%
energy and also um newer technology is
 
04:10:25.790 --> 04:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:29.630 --> 04:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
efficient so Vice chair Thomas thank you
 
04:10:31.349 --> 04:10:31.359 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman in an effort to balance the
 
04:10:33.990 --> 04:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
table I should say I am am also in favor
 
04:10:34.000 --> 04:10:36.630 align:start position:0%
table I should say I am am also in favor
of

04:10:36.630 --> 04:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:40.710 --> 04:10:40.720 align:start position:0%
itl Representative rolds well I'll uh
 
04:10:43.670 --> 04:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
push back then and say uh you know we
 
04:10:45.910 --> 04:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of compelling testimony here
 
04:10:49.750 --> 04:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
not just about the substance of the the
 
04:10:53.309 --> 04:10:53.319 align:start position:0%
actual um functioning of the RPS but the
 
04:10:55.269 --> 04:10:55.279 align:start position:0%
role that it played in the in the wood
 
04:10:57.550 --> 04:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
industry and the importance of that so
 
04:10:59.950 --> 04:10:59.960 align:start position:0%
you know I think that testimony was was
 
04:11:03.790 --> 04:11:03.800 align:start position:0%
uh overwhelming um but in addition you
 
04:11:06.349 --> 04:11:06.359 align:start position:0%
know again in my in my past life I work
 
04:11:09.630 --> 04:11:09.640 align:start position:0%
directly with several school districts
 
04:11:12.910 --> 04:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
and the county the county in which we
 
04:11:15.710 --> 04:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
current sit uh that made huge
 
04:11:19.830 --> 04:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
investments in thermal uh wood pellet or
 
04:11:23.750 --> 04:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
wood chip heating technology and uh I
 
04:11:27.469 --> 04:11:27.479 align:start position:0%
think many of us uh
 
04:11:31.710 --> 04:11:31.720 align:start position:0%
have schools districts schools or uh uh
 
04:11:33.670 --> 04:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities that have the same kind
 
04:11:35.710 --> 04:11:35.720 align:start position:0%
of technology and and pulling the rug
 
04:11:37.550 --> 04:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
out from under that would just be uh
 
04:11:40.590 --> 04:11:40.600 align:start position:0%
really a bad idea so I'm in agreement
 
04:11:44.349 --> 04:11:44.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:45.790 --> 04:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
I'll just say that I think
 
04:11:47.670 --> 04:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
representative Harrington makes a good
 
04:11:49.510 --> 04:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
point that paying
 
04:11:53.710 --> 04:11:53.720 align:start position:0%
for uh thermal energy
 
04:11:56.990 --> 04:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
under with a search charge on
 
04:11:58.870 --> 04:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
electricity rates doesn't seem like the
 
04:12:01.349 --> 04:12:01.359 align:start position:0%
right thing to do so he and I have been
 
04:12:01.359 --> 04:12:02.349 align:start position:0%
right thing to do so he and I have been
talking

04:12:02.349 --> 04:12:02.359 align:start position:0%
talking
 
04:12:05.870 --> 04:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
about working over the summer to next
 
04:12:09.750 --> 04:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
fall uh introduce an LSR to create a
 
04:12:11.550 --> 04:12:11.560 align:start position:0%
wood heat
 
04:12:14.950 --> 04:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
standard that would be funded by
 
04:12:19.630 --> 04:12:19.640 align:start position:0%
revenues from other sources not a tax on
 
04:12:22.790 --> 04:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
electricity so we will be attempting to
 
04:12:24.950 --> 04:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
put something like that together and
 
04:12:27.830 --> 04:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
would certainly welcome suggestions from
 
04:12:30.510 --> 04:12:30.520 align:start position:0%
anybody uh about how to put that
 
04:12:33.389 --> 04:12:33.399 align:start position:0%
together representative McGee yeah
 
04:12:36.070 --> 04:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
thanks um it I that is really the Crux
 
04:12:37.750 --> 04:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
of the matter that I know representative
 
04:12:40.070 --> 04:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
Harrington brings up all the time and I
 
04:12:41.550 --> 04:12:41.560 align:start position:0%
understand why that might be something
 
04:12:45.630 --> 04:12:45.640 align:start position:0%
to be stuck on but I think there are you
 
04:12:48.870 --> 04:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
know people are evolving on energy and
 
04:12:50.510 --> 04:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
there are countries now that look at
 
04:12:53.030 --> 04:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
BTUs and kilowatt hours they have a way
 
04:12:54.750 --> 04:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
of converting energy that energy is
 
04:12:56.790 --> 04:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
energy right and so it may come from
 
04:12:58.990 --> 04:12:59.000 align:start position:0%
different sources but the I think the
 
04:13:02.109 --> 04:13:02.119 align:start position:0%
point of the RPS was to help us to uh
 
04:13:04.469 --> 04:13:04.479 align:start position:0%
transition to cleaner forms of energy
 
04:13:08.189 --> 04:13:08.199 align:start position:0%
and uh diversify the mix of our energy
 
04:13:10.149 --> 04:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
and to find ways to lower costs by
 
04:13:13.389 --> 04:13:13.399 align:start position:0%
leveraging local sustainable sources so
 
04:13:15.309 --> 04:13:15.319 align:start position:0%
there were a number of objectives that
 
04:13:19.710 --> 04:13:19.720 align:start position:0%
the RPS was designed to support and
 
04:13:23.670 --> 04:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
so the idea of parsing all the aspects
 
04:13:26.389 --> 04:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
of energy as though they aren't all uh
 
04:13:28.070 --> 04:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
contributing to the costs that we're
 
04:13:31.070 --> 04:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
paying out as a state is I think in some
 
04:13:34.950 --> 04:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
ways it's um it's missing the forest for
 
04:13:37.269 --> 04:13:37.279 align:start position:0%
the trees I guess would be the analogy
 
04:13:39.030 --> 04:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
that that the idea is that we want
 
04:13:41.349 --> 04:13:41.359 align:start position:0%
people to be investing in forms of
 
04:13:44.910 --> 04:13:44.920 align:start position:0%
energy that don't cost us the most and
 
04:13:47.590 --> 04:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
and make us the most Reliant you know so
 
04:13:49.189 --> 04:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
um that I think that's how thermal got
 
04:13:51.870 --> 04:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
added in the first
 
04:13:54.269 --> 04:13:54.279 align:start position:0%
place okay any further

and recognize representative schneller
 
04:15:48.630 --> 04:15:48.640 align:start position:0%
second the motion moved and seconded
 
04:15:49.950 --> 04:15:49.960 align:start position:0%
that we
 
04:15:52.830 --> 04:15:52.840 align:start position:0%
judge House Bill 696 to be worthy of an
 
04:15:57.070 --> 04:15:57.080 align:start position:0%
aut toass vote I will say to begin the
 
04:15:57.080 --> 04:15:59.109 align:start position:0%
aut toass vote I will say to begin the
discussion

04:15:59.109 --> 04:15:59.119 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
04:16:04.030 --> 04:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
that this bill results directly from a
 
04:16:07.030 --> 04:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
three-year study commission a study
 
04:16:08.630 --> 04:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
commission that was actually
 
04:16:11.229 --> 04:16:11.239 align:start position:0%
reconstituted three times over three
 
04:16:13.750 --> 04:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
consecutive years
 
04:16:16.510 --> 04:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
that studied this issue thoroughly and
 
04:16:20.189 --> 04:16:20.199 align:start position:0%
while House Bill 696 doesn't capture all
 
04:16:23.670 --> 04:16:23.680 align:start position:0%
of the concerns that members of the
 
04:16:27.389 --> 04:16:27.399 align:start position:0%
study commission expressed during our 18
 
04:16:31.189 --> 04:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
or 16 to 18 hours of meetings uh over
 
04:16:31.199 --> 04:16:32.269 align:start position:0%
or 16 to 18 hours of meetings uh over
last

04:16:32.269 --> 04:16:32.279 align:start position:0%
last
 
04:16:36.469 --> 04:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
fall it does take a giant step forward
 
04:16:39.870 --> 04:16:39.880 align:start position:0%
in Breaking the litigation Log Jam that
 
04:16:42.990 --> 04:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
cost both rate payers and taxpayers a
 
04:16:44.670 --> 04:16:44.680 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
04:16:47.950 --> 04:16:47.960 align:start position:0%
money that results from the fact that
 
04:16:49.870 --> 04:16:49.880 align:start position:0%
under the current
 
04:16:53.070 --> 04:16:53.080 align:start position:0%
system generators who are basically just
 
04:16:55.229 --> 04:16:55.239 align:start position:0%
manufacturers they manufacture
 
04:16:58.389 --> 04:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
electricity they are not utilities but
 
04:16:59.630 --> 04:16:59.640 align:start position:0%
they're being
 
04:17:04.389 --> 04:17:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:07.389 --> 04:17:07.399 align:start position:0%
tax and the assessment for that tax is
 
04:17:09.309 --> 04:17:09.319 align:start position:0%
done by the Department of Revenue
 
04:17:11.149 --> 04:17:11.159 align:start position:0%
Administration they come up with an
 
04:17:14.429 --> 04:17:14.439 align:start position:0%
assessment for a piece of generation
 
04:17:17.590 --> 04:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
property meanwhile municipalities come
 
04:17:21.910 --> 04:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
up with an assessment of that same
 
04:17:26.109 --> 04:17:26.119 align:start position:0%
property for the purposes of Municipal
 
04:17:29.790 --> 04:17:29.800 align:start position:0%
Taxation and frequently the difference
 
04:17:33.389 --> 04:17:33.399 align:start position:0%
between those two assessments is huge
 
04:17:36.870 --> 04:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
and that's what leads to litigation when
 
04:17:40.870 --> 04:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
a generator sees that the Dr says my
 
04:17:43.550 --> 04:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
facility is worth X
 
04:17:45.790 --> 04:17:45.800 align:start position:0%
but the municipality says
 
04:17:48.790 --> 04:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
my facility is worth
 
04:17:51.229 --> 04:17:51.239 align:start position:0%
10x then I'm probably going to go to
 
04:17:55.189 --> 04:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
court to find out what the real assessed
 
04:17:58.229 --> 04:17:58.239 align:start position:0%
value of my property
 
04:18:01.950 --> 04:18:01.960 align:start position:0%
is so by exempting generators
 
04:18:04.550 --> 04:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
manufacturers of electricity from the
 
04:18:07.149 --> 04:18:07.159 align:start position:0%
utility property
 
04:18:10.269 --> 04:18:10.279 align:start position:0%
tax and making them subject instead to
 
04:18:14.710 --> 04:18:14.720 align:start position:0%
the Statewide education property tax
 
04:18:16.910 --> 04:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
we can
 
04:18:19.790 --> 04:18:19.800 align:start position:0%
eliminate most if not all of that
 
04:18:21.309 --> 04:18:21.319 align:start position:0%
litigation there will still be some
 
04:18:25.030 --> 04:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
litigation probably that survives that
 
04:18:29.269 --> 04:18:29.279 align:start position:0%
um this transfer or this exemption but
 
04:18:32.469 --> 04:18:32.479 align:start position:0%
most of it will be taken care of by this
 
04:18:34.229 --> 04:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
exemption this
 
04:18:37.070 --> 04:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
exemption preserves pilot agreements for
 
04:18:38.830 --> 04:18:38.840 align:start position:0%
generators if they currently are in
 
04:18:42.269 --> 04:18:42.279 align:start position:0%
place it preserves them out to 2032 I
 
04:18:44.149 --> 04:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
believe it is
 
04:18:47.750 --> 04:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
and um it also
 
04:18:51.349 --> 04:18:51.359 align:start position:0%
recognizes that generators are just
 
04:18:55.229 --> 04:18:55.239 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and tries to treat them uh
 
04:18:57.349 --> 04:18:57.359 align:start position:0%
as the category of business that they
 
04:18:59.750 --> 04:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
are so I hope you'll join me in
 
04:19:03.070 --> 04:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
supporting the aop pass motion on this
 
04:19:09.590 --> 04:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:12.830 --> 04:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Thomas uh
 
04:19:15.469 --> 04:19:15.479 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas thank you Mr chair um there
 
04:19:18.550 --> 04:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
was um two concerns that you as the
 
04:19:21.550 --> 04:19:21.560 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor I would like to address um
 
04:19:23.469 --> 04:19:23.479 align:start position:0%
the the first one is that there's less
 
04:19:25.830 --> 04:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
revenue for public education so I want
 
04:19:29.670 --> 04:19:29.680 align:start position:0%
to um hear about the the direct impact
 
04:19:32.510 --> 04:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
of that and then it was raised that that
 
04:19:35.550 --> 04:19:35.560 align:start position:0%
there's a lack of reporting
 
04:19:38.710 --> 04:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
requirements um from the assessors and
 
04:19:41.229 --> 04:19:41.239 align:start position:0%
that was from the municipality so if you
 
04:19:42.830 --> 04:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
could address both of those please
 
04:19:44.309 --> 04:19:44.319 align:start position:0%
that'd be
 
04:19:47.750 --> 04:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
helpful so I passed out or I made sure
 
04:19:49.590 --> 04:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
that every member of this committee got
 
04:19:51.030 --> 04:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
a copy of
 
04:19:54.030 --> 04:19:54.040 align:start position:0%
the commission report that we generated
 
04:19:54.040 --> 04:19:54.870 align:start position:0%
the commission report that we generated
last

04:19:54.870 --> 04:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
last
 
04:19:57.670 --> 04:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
fall it was a significant Report with
 
04:20:01.070 --> 04:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
over 40 different findings and several
 
04:20:01.080 --> 04:20:02.550 align:start position:0%
over 40 different findings and several
different

04:20:02.550 --> 04:20:02.560 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:20:05.550 --> 04:20:05.560 align:start position:0%
recommendations and the findings in that
 
04:20:08.830 --> 04:20:08.840 align:start position:0%
report indicate that there will be a
 
04:20:12.710 --> 04:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
reduction in education trust fund Monies
 
04:20:15.189 --> 04:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
from the exemption of these generators
 
04:20:18.710 --> 04:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
from the utility property tax by about
 
04:20:18.720 --> 04:20:20.469 align:start position:0%
from the utility property tax by about
$6

04:20:20.469 --> 04:20:20.479 align:start position:0%
$6
 
04:20:24.189 --> 04:20:24.199 align:start position:0%
million but moving them to the
 
04:20:28.950 --> 04:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
swept will actually uh recover most of
 
04:20:28.960 --> 04:20:30.349 align:start position:0%
swept will actually uh recover most of
that

04:20:30.349 --> 04:20:30.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:20:33.229 --> 04:20:33.239 align:start position:0%
money in addition the report revealed
 
04:20:35.389 --> 04:20:35.399 align:start position:0%
that there was currently a
 
04:20:38.510 --> 04:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
110 million doll Surplus in the
 
04:20:40.349 --> 04:20:40.359 align:start position:0%
education trust
 
04:20:43.870 --> 04:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
fund so this led legislation will have
 
04:20:47.750 --> 04:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
no impact on the funding of Education
 
04:20:51.830 --> 04:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
short or long
 
04:20:55.389 --> 04:20:55.399 align:start position:0%
term the other question you raised
 
04:20:59.269 --> 04:20:59.279 align:start position:0%
was uh uh it was actually raised by
 
04:21:01.149 --> 04:21:01.159 align:start position:0%
municipalities the reporting
 
04:21:04.030 --> 04:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
requirements exactly right the reporting
 
04:21:06.870 --> 04:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
requirement so this
 
04:21:09.910 --> 04:21:09.920 align:start position:0%
legislation treats electricity
 
04:21:12.670 --> 04:21:12.680 align:start position:0%
generators as manufacturers
 
04:21:15.030 --> 04:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
and no other manufacturers in the state
 
04:21:18.550 --> 04:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
are required to do the kind of reporting
 
04:21:20.109 --> 04:21:20.119 align:start position:0%
that the
 
04:21:23.429 --> 04:21:23.439 align:start position:0%
municipalities would like to see so we
 
04:21:27.710 --> 04:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
didn't think it was necessary to force
 
04:21:30.269 --> 04:21:30.279 align:start position:0%
these new this new class of
 
04:21:32.630 --> 04:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
manufacturer to be different from all
 
04:21:35.790 --> 04:21:35.800 align:start position:0%
the other manufacturers in the state so
 
04:21:38.830 --> 04:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
we didn't require a reporting
 
04:21:41.670 --> 04:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
requirement as the commission report
 
04:21:45.550 --> 04:21:45.560 align:start position:0%
made above L clear the amount of public
 
04:21:48.870 --> 04:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
information about electricity generation
 
04:21:51.030 --> 04:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
facilities is
 
04:21:55.070 --> 04:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
voluminous and assessors have access to
 
04:21:56.229 --> 04:21:56.239 align:start position:0%
all that
 
04:21:58.590 --> 04:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
information as they go about their work
 
04:22:01.469 --> 04:22:01.479 align:start position:0%
of assessing these
 
04:22:03.750 --> 04:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
facilities further
 
04:22:06.030 --> 04:22:06.040 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
04:22:09.269 --> 04:22:09.279 align:start position:0%
Corman thank you Mr chairman I'm still
 
04:22:12.990 --> 04:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
confused about the effect on educ ation
 
04:22:15.990 --> 04:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
funding uh as I read the fiscal note it
 
04:22:20.710 --> 04:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
says that in fact um uh the ETF Revenue
 
04:22:24.790 --> 04:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
will decrease by 5.36 million in FY 28
 
04:22:41.429 --> 04:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:43.710 --> 04:22:43.720 align:start position:0%
12.72-ounce money won't be going into
 
04:22:47.550 --> 04:22:47.560 align:start position:0%
the ETF so I'm I'm I'm I'm concerned
 
04:22:50.229 --> 04:22:50.239 align:start position:0%
that in fact education funding will
 
04:22:52.830 --> 04:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
decrease even though swept isn't going
 
04:22:55.109 --> 04:22:55.119 align:start position:0%
to change and I also understand that
 
04:22:57.109 --> 04:22:57.119 align:start position:0%
we're we'd be moving these into the
 
04:22:59.510 --> 04:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
denominator of how swept is calculated
 
04:23:02.229 --> 04:23:02.239 align:start position:0%
so that in fact the rate for everybody
 
04:23:04.670 --> 04:23:04.680 align:start position:0%
would go down but just the total amount
 
04:23:06.990 --> 04:23:07.000 align:start position:0%
going into education it seems to me is
 
04:23:10.269 --> 04:23:10.279 align:start position:0%
going to go down am I
 
04:23:12.149 --> 04:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding yes the commission
 
04:23:15.670 --> 04:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
discovered that in some towns swept will
 
04:23:17.630 --> 04:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
recover more money with the addition of
 
04:23:20.070 --> 04:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
these generators and in other towns it
 
04:23:23.710 --> 04:23:23.720 align:start position:0%
might go down a little bit but um the
 
04:23:27.309 --> 04:23:27.319 align:start position:0%
amount of money collected for
 
04:23:31.030 --> 04:23:31.040 align:start position:0%
Education will go up overall as a result
 
04:23:33.590 --> 04:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
of these generators being moved into
 
04:23:37.269 --> 04:23:37.279 align:start position:0%
swept now it is true that the utility
 
04:23:39.349 --> 04:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
property tax won't be making a
 
04:23:42.229 --> 04:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
contribution to the education trust fund
 
04:23:44.750 --> 04:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
but but uh the education trust fund
 
04:23:47.510 --> 04:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
isn't the only place that
 
04:23:51.030 --> 04:23:51.040 align:start position:0%
education uh Revenue comes into the
 
04:23:52.990 --> 04:23:53.000 align:start position:0%
coffers of the
 
04:23:55.670 --> 04:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
state but I mean what I see in the
 
04:23:57.990 --> 04:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal note the bill keeps swept
 
04:24:01.229 --> 04:24:01.239 align:start position:0%
constant so the amount going into swept
 
04:24:02.870 --> 04:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't change I understand it may vary
 
04:24:05.510 --> 04:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
from town to town but but the total
 
04:24:07.590 --> 04:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
amount going into swept doesn't change
 
04:24:09.630 --> 04:24:09.640 align:start position:0%
yet what's going into the ETF does
 
04:24:11.349 --> 04:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
decrease that's what I'm I'm getting
 
04:24:13.590 --> 04:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
hung up on that's because the education
 
04:24:16.630 --> 04:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
trust fund is capped I think it's
 
04:24:20.710 --> 04:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
363 million something like that
 
04:24:24.429 --> 04:24:24.439 align:start position:0%
so if the education trust fund cap was
 
04:24:26.790 --> 04:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
raised then that money could be
 
04:24:30.710 --> 04:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:33.269 --> 04:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
swept but it isn't the job of this bill
 
04:24:37.510 --> 04:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
to raise that that cap so that would
 
04:24:40.229 --> 04:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
that happens during the budget
 
04:24:47.750 --> 04:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:49.950 --> 04:24:49.960 align:start position:0%
representative Summers thank you Mr
 
04:24:52.429 --> 04:24:52.439 align:start position:0%
chairman um just to add on to it I know
 
04:24:54.910 --> 04:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
that many of us and it was a bipartisan
 
04:24:56.950 --> 04:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh group of us from this committee that
 
04:24:58.790 --> 04:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
attended many hours over the Department
 
04:25:01.349 --> 04:25:01.359 align:start position:0%
of Revenue last year discussing these
 
04:25:02.830 --> 04:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
very things and I know the big
 
04:25:05.109 --> 04:25:05.119 align:start position:0%
stipulation there was how to handle
 
04:25:06.790 --> 04:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
these different assessments of property
 
04:25:09.990 --> 04:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
taxes with utility taxes compared and so
 
04:25:12.910 --> 04:25:12.920 align:start position:0%
this would it pass out would ease this
 
04:25:15.309 --> 04:25:15.319 align:start position:0%
whole issue that was that would
 
04:25:17.030 --> 04:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
Troublesome last year between us and the
 
04:25:19.309 --> 04:25:19.319 align:start position:0%
Senate if I remember
 
04:25:21.590 --> 04:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
correctly further
 
04:25:25.149 --> 04:25:25.159 align:start position:0%
discussion representative migy thanks um
 
04:25:27.229 --> 04:25:27.239 align:start position:0%
I guess to for for the conversation
 
04:25:28.389 --> 04:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
that's just been happening the thought
 
04:25:31.349 --> 04:25:31.359 align:start position:0%
that I had is it's I guess it's
 
04:25:35.109 --> 04:25:35.119 align:start position:0%
inevitable that the uh utility tax
 
04:25:37.030 --> 04:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
donation to the education trust fund
 
04:25:38.910 --> 04:25:38.920 align:start position:0%
would no longer be there because we're
 
04:25:43.229 --> 04:25:43.239 align:start position:0%
eliminating it right so um I think there
 
04:25:46.630 --> 04:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
was considerable work done to discuss
 
04:25:48.870 --> 04:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
how that would operate in the towns and
 
04:25:52.109 --> 04:25:52.119 align:start position:0%
in the budgets for the swept and I um my
 
04:25:53.710 --> 04:25:53.720 align:start position:0%
understanding is that it'll be in many
 
04:25:56.149 --> 04:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
cases it's expected to be a wash it's
 
04:25:58.070 --> 04:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
it's not expected to be there will be
 
04:26:00.550 --> 04:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
less money going into the ETF but I
 
04:26:02.469 --> 04:26:02.479 align:start position:0%
don't think it'll be less overall
 
04:26:07.550 --> 04:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
education funding um now that the
 
04:26:11.189 --> 04:26:11.199 align:start position:0%
generators are paying the funds uh at a
 
04:26:14.149 --> 04:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
different rate going into the
 
04:26:16.670 --> 04:26:16.680 align:start position:0%
swept and I guess that's that's that's
 
04:26:18.670 --> 04:26:18.680 align:start position:0%
the thing that I'm hung up on is I'm not
 
04:26:21.830 --> 04:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
sure how the rate differs in that
 
04:26:23.550 --> 04:26:23.560 align:start position:0%
whether it comes out as a plus or a
 
04:26:25.510 --> 04:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
minus the money is not going into the
 
04:26:29.429 --> 04:26:29.439 align:start position:0%
ETF that we can agree but the amount
 
04:26:31.389 --> 04:26:31.399 align:start position:0%
that's going into swept from the
 
04:26:34.309 --> 04:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
generators if it stays the same or if it
 
04:26:36.990 --> 04:26:37.000 align:start position:0%
increases slightly to make up any
 
04:26:40.750 --> 04:26:40.760 align:start position:0%
difference I don't think that's been
 
04:26:43.349 --> 04:26:43.359 align:start position:0%
answered and if it wasn't the purpose of
 
04:26:45.189 --> 04:26:45.199 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:26:50.269 --> 04:26:50.279 align:start position:0%
to uh deal with the the cap on the
 
04:26:52.229 --> 04:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
education trust
 
04:26:55.670 --> 04:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
fund that is for either the Ways and
 
04:26:58.990 --> 04:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
Means Committee or the finance committee
 
04:27:03.070 --> 04:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
to deal with we made it abundantly clear
 
04:27:07.469 --> 04:27:07.479 align:start position:0%
that and by the way to to be clear this
 
04:27:09.750 --> 04:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
bill does not eliminate the utility
 
04:27:12.550 --> 04:27:12.560 align:start position:0%
property tax it just exempts gener ERS
 
04:27:15.070 --> 04:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
from paying it the utility property tax
 
04:27:18.429 --> 04:27:18.439 align:start position:0%
is still going to be paid by utilities
 
04:27:23.189 --> 04:27:23.199 align:start position:0%
and and those who own utility property
 
04:27:25.429 --> 04:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
so and it's a considerable amount of
 
04:27:27.109 --> 04:27:27.119 align:start position:0%
money as I recall from the the
 
04:27:30.030 --> 04:27:30.040 align:start position:0%
commission report it's something like
 
04:27:33.469 --> 04:27:33.479 align:start position:0%
43 million doar that's collected just by
 
04:27:38.429 --> 04:27:38.439 align:start position:0%
the upt each year so
 
04:27:42.790 --> 04:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
uh the bottom line here is that with 10
 
04:27:45.030 --> 04:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
billion million dollar Surplus in the
 
04:27:48.510 --> 04:27:48.520 align:start position:0%
education trust fund any impact that
 
04:27:52.790 --> 04:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
this bill has on that fund will be
 
04:27:57.790 --> 04:27:57.800 align:start position:0%
negligible it will be handled by that uh
 
04:28:02.030 --> 04:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
Surplus so there there's not a negative
 
04:28:05.550 --> 04:28:05.560 align:start position:0%
to uh passing this bill that exempts
 
04:28:07.910 --> 04:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
these generators from the
 
04:28:12.990 --> 04:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:14.990 --> 04:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none I ask the clerk to call the
 
04:28:18.349 --> 04:28:18.359 align:start position:0%
role on the question of ought to pass on
 
04:28:22.950 --> 04:28:22.960 align:start position:0%

pass on House Bill 696 FN without
 
04:29:16.790 --> 04:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
objection we'll put this on the no we
 
04:29:20.389 --> 04:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
can't put it on the uh consent calendar
 
04:29:22.710 --> 04:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
so it'll be on the regular calendar I
 
04:29:26.149 --> 04:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
will write the committee report for
 
04:29:27.429 --> 04:29:27.439 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
04:29:29.870 --> 04:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
696 so with that we'll close the exec

04:29:37.189 --> 04:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
696 yes representative McGee we had um
 
04:29:41.830 --> 04:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
we had uh agreed to put 567 on consent
 
04:29:44.510 --> 04:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
but that also has an FN just that i' oh

it's an

it never
 
04:29:51.830 --> 04:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
mind okay there will be a couple of

04:35:08.429 --> 04:35:08.439 align:start position:0%
okay let me update everybody on what's
 
04:35:10.869 --> 04:35:10.879 align:start position:0%
Happening we just got two bills back
 
04:35:13.470 --> 04:35:13.480 align:start position:0%
from o
 
04:35:17.551 --> 04:35:17.561 align:start position:0%
with requested amendments and the first
 
04:35:22.869 --> 04:35:22.879 align:start position:0%
one we looked at we found errors in the
 
04:35:25.150 --> 04:35:25.160 align:start position:0%
newly crafted
 
04:35:28.429 --> 04:35:28.439 align:start position:0%
Amendment so I'm now I've now texted the
 
04:35:31.269 --> 04:35:31.279 align:start position:0%
clerk to ask if we can adopt this with
 
04:35:34.189 --> 04:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
corrections or do we have to get another
 
04:35:34.199 --> 04:35:35.070 align:start position:0%
corrections or do we have to get another
new

04:35:35.070 --> 04:35:35.080 align:start position:0%
new
 
04:35:37.070 --> 04:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment and so I'm waiting for an
 
04:35:41.629 --> 04:35:41.639 align:start position:0%
answer for him this is on U house bill
 
04:35:41.639 --> 04:35:47.269 align:start position:0%
answer for him this is on U house bill
764

04:35:47.269 --> 04:35:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:50.230 --> 04:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
FN so maybe we could just have a quick
 
04:35:53.070 --> 04:35:53.080 align:start position:0%
work session on this amendment to see if
 
04:35:56.070 --> 04:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
people see how how the committee feels
 
04:35:58.830 --> 04:35:58.840 align:start position:0%
about this amendment in general and then
 
04:36:00.390 --> 04:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
we can decide what to do about
 
04:36:02.869 --> 04:36:02.879 align:start position:0%
correcting the Mis mistakes that we
 
04:36:06.029 --> 04:36:06.039 align:start position:0%
found um U Mr chairman yes probably help
 
04:36:07.789 --> 04:36:07.799 align:start position:0%
everybody if we could tell them where
 
04:36:10.150 --> 04:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
the errors were that weren't caught on
 
04:36:12.310 --> 04:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
on line 15
 
04:36:14.429 --> 04:36:14.439 align:start position:0%
it says general court to prohibit that
 
04:36:19.070 --> 04:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:22.949 --> 04:36:22.959 align:start position:0%
764 line 15 page one the the intention
 
04:36:24.949 --> 04:36:24.959 align:start position:0%
of the general court to take R of the
 
04:36:27.709 --> 04:36:27.719 align:start position:0%
word prohibit and put in discourage and
 
04:36:30.269 --> 04:36:30.279 align:start position:0%
the same thing on line 19 uh Air
 
04:36:32.470 --> 04:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
Pollution Control geoengineering not
 
04:36:35.349 --> 04:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
prohibited discouraged so both cases
 
04:36:43.830 --> 04:36:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:47.869 --> 04:36:47.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:50.269 --> 04:36:50.279 align:start position:0%
two those are the two Corrections that
 
04:36:52.990 --> 04:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
we would need to make and I'm asking the
 
04:36:54.990 --> 04:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
clerk if we can just make those
 
04:36:58.590 --> 04:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
Corrections and pass this amendment or
 
04:37:00.349 --> 04:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
or if we have to get a new
 
04:37:02.990 --> 04:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment no you can't make Corrections
 
04:37:04.990 --> 04:37:05.000 align:start position:0%
you can adopt it and get a floor
 
04:37:06.629 --> 04:37:06.639 align:start position:0%
amendment to fix it that's what Paul
 
04:37:06.639 --> 04:37:08.029 align:start position:0%
amendment to fix it that's what Paul
Smith

04:37:08.029 --> 04:37:08.039 align:start position:0%
Smith
 
04:37:08.039 --> 04:37:10.230 align:start position:0%
Smith
suggests

04:37:10.230 --> 04:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
suggests
 
04:37:14.390 --> 04:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
so so so let's do that okay so let's
 
04:37:17.150 --> 04:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
open an exact session then on House
 
04:37:19.269 --> 04:37:19.279 align:start position:0%

do the
 
04:40:00.070 --> 04:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
amendment um significantly changes the
 
04:40:03.190 --> 04:40:03.200 align:start position:0%
original Bill starting with the
 
04:40:05.910 --> 04:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
title the title
 
04:40:09.070 --> 04:40:09.080 align:start position:0%
now is discouraging the intentional
 
04:40:10.990 --> 04:40:11.000 align:start position:0%
release of polluting emissions including
 
04:40:12.948 --> 04:40:12.958 align:start position:0%
cloud CL seating and weather
 
04:40:16.150 --> 04:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
modification that will be the new
 
04:40:21.670 --> 04:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
bill and the rest of the bill is a
 
04:40:25.350 --> 04:40:25.360 align:start position:0%
subset of an amendment offered by the
 
04:40:28.270 --> 04:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of the bill representative
 
04:40:31.868 --> 04:40:31.878 align:start position:0%
fenza when she introduced the
 
04:40:36.788 --> 04:40:36.798 align:start position:0%
bill we took um her Amendment and made
 
04:40:38.708 --> 04:40:38.718 align:start position:0%
some changes to it
 
04:40:42.230 --> 04:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
including changing the word prohib ited
 
04:40:46.110 --> 04:40:46.120 align:start position:0%
to the word discourage in several
 
04:40:48.868 --> 04:40:48.878 align:start position:0%
places so the bill now
 
04:40:48.878 --> 04:40:50.830 align:start position:0%
places so the bill now
discourages

04:40:50.830 --> 04:40:50.840 align:start position:0%
discourages
 
04:40:53.270 --> 04:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
geoengineering and says that no person
 
04:40:57.190 --> 04:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
should engage in Geon geoengineering
 
04:40:58.910 --> 04:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
activities including weather
 
04:41:00.910 --> 04:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
modification stratospheric aerosol
 
04:41:02.868 --> 04:41:02.878 align:start position:0%
injection or solar radiation
 
04:41:05.350 --> 04:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
modification involving the intentional
 
04:41:08.270 --> 04:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
release of polluting
 
04:41:13.788 --> 04:41:13.798 align:start position:0%
emissions we retained from her earlier
 
04:41:18.150 --> 04:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment a section that
 
04:41:20.270 --> 04:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
exempts cloud seeding weather
 
04:41:25.550 --> 04:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:28.230 --> 04:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
drought and in her
 
04:41:31.868 --> 04:41:31.878 align:start position:0%
Amendment on page two line four she
 
04:41:35.390 --> 04:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
wanted the state to conduct a 14-day a
 
04:41:38.510 --> 04:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
one month environmental review and we
 
04:41:41.868 --> 04:41:41.878 align:start position:0%
changed that to 14 days because if this
 
04:41:44.070 --> 04:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
is a drought
 
04:41:46.230 --> 04:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
catastrophe then a one-month
 
04:41:48.868 --> 04:41:48.878 align:start position:0%
environmental review seems maybe a
 
04:41:48.878 --> 04:41:51.110 align:start position:0%
environmental review seems maybe a
little

04:41:51.110 --> 04:41:51.120 align:start position:0%
little
 
04:41:55.230 --> 04:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
long and uh the amendment also gives to
 
04:41:58.788 --> 04:41:58.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:03.230 --> 04:42:03.240 align:start position:0%
Services the right to maintain oversight
 
04:42:07.390 --> 04:42:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:09.750 --> 04:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
activities although it doesn't
 
04:42:12.788 --> 04:42:12.798 align:start position:0%
necessarily describe
 
04:42:16.750 --> 04:42:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:20.750 --> 04:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
entail and then the only real actionable
 
04:42:24.270 --> 04:42:24.280 align:start position:0%
item that this amendment provides is
 
04:42:26.150 --> 04:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
that the Department of Environmental
 
04:42:28.750 --> 04:42:28.760 align:start position:0%
Services shall within 30 days of the
 
04:42:31.110 --> 04:42:31.120 align:start position:0%
effective date of this section provide
 
04:42:34.030 --> 04:42:34.040 align:start position:0%
notice to the following ENT entities
 
04:42:37.390 --> 04:42:37.400 align:start position:0%
that geo geo engineering is discouraged
 
04:42:39.708 --> 04:42:39.718 align:start position:0%
in lines
 
04:42:41.750 --> 04:42:41.760 align:start position:0%
22 through
 
04:42:45.948 --> 04:42:45.958 align:start position:0%
line line nine on page three list all
 
04:42:48.948 --> 04:42:48.958 align:start position:0%
the federal bureaucracies that need to
 
04:42:53.948 --> 04:42:53.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:56.430 --> 04:42:56.440 align:start position:0%
geoengineering okay now I'm going to
 
04:42:58.590 --> 04:42:58.600 align:start position:0%
recognize Vice chair
 
04:43:01.510 --> 04:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
Thomas thank you Mr chair and just uh
 
04:43:05.190 --> 04:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
for one more change uh if you go to to
 
04:43:07.830 --> 04:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
the first page on line
 
04:43:10.430 --> 04:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
12 uh the original wording in the middle
 
04:43:13.750 --> 04:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
of the sentence was harm to human health
 
04:43:15.470 --> 04:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
and safety we replace that with the
 
04:43:18.910 --> 04:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
phrase have unknown effects to human
 
04:43:25.350 --> 04:43:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:27.910 --> 04:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
same okay further discussion
 
04:43:31.110 --> 04:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
representative PL uh thank you chair uh
 
04:43:33.868 --> 04:43:33.878 align:start position:0%
for the clerk in the record uh could you
 
04:43:36.070 --> 04:43:36.080 align:start position:0%
identify represented
 
04:43:36.080 --> 04:43:37.628 align:start position:0%
identify represented
patens

04:43:37.628 --> 04:43:37.638 align:start position:0%
patens
 
04:43:40.070 --> 04:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
amendment I don't think it has been
 
04:43:42.550 --> 04:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
noted we were disc discussing her
 
04:43:44.830 --> 04:43:44.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment could we just identify it for
 
04:43:44.840 --> 04:43:46.230 align:start position:0%
Amendment could we just identify it for
the

04:43:46.230 --> 04:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:43:48.310 --> 04:43:48.320 align:start position:0%
record that we're change you want the
 
04:43:50.868 --> 04:43:50.878 align:start position:0%
number is that what you're ask yes
 
04:43:55.550 --> 04:43:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:59.990 --> 04:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
0214 you got that okay further
 
04:44:03.590 --> 04:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Corman thank
 
04:44:07.350 --> 04:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh I'm just a little
 
04:44:10.030 --> 04:44:10.040 align:start position:0%
confused what does it mean to discourage
 
04:44:13.030 --> 04:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
the these Act activities and what does
 
04:44:16.270 --> 04:44:16.280 align:start position:0%
it mean that no person should
 
04:44:19.150 --> 04:44:19.160 align:start position:0%
engage what what are we actually saying
 
04:44:21.830 --> 04:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
can and can't happen we're saying things
 
04:44:23.830 --> 04:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
shouldn't happen we don't want them to
 
04:44:30.550 --> 04:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:34.708 --> 04:44:34.718 align:start position:0%
law good question representative Beres
 
04:44:37.190 --> 04:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I also will be
 
04:44:39.430 --> 04:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
voting against this uh Amendment and
 
04:44:42.390 --> 04:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
Bill it's not clear what is enforcable
 
04:44:45.150 --> 04:44:45.160 align:start position:0%
and are there any other examples of of
 
04:44:48.750 --> 04:44:48.760 align:start position:0%
rsas that simply discourage something um
 
04:44:50.470 --> 04:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
I mean it seems like this would make
 
04:44:52.550 --> 04:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
more sense as a house resolution perhaps
 
04:44:55.990 --> 04:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
instead of a state law thank
 
04:45:00.070 --> 04:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
you just to address your point there are
 
04:45:02.948 --> 04:45:02.958 align:start position:0%
lots of state laws that have no U
 
04:45:05.910 --> 04:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
penalties or enforcement Clause that
 
04:45:05.920 --> 04:45:07.190 align:start position:0%
penalties or enforcement Clause that
prohibit

04:45:07.190 --> 04:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
prohibit
 
04:45:10.110 --> 04:45:10.120 align:start position:0%
things further discussion representative
 
04:45:12.788 --> 04:45:12.798 align:start position:0%
Wendy Thomas thank you Mr chair um I
 
04:45:15.390 --> 04:45:15.400 align:start position:0%
actually have a few few points to
 
04:45:18.310 --> 04:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
mention about this bill number one is
 
04:45:22.868 --> 04:45:22.878 align:start position:0%
the change on line 12 on page one um
 
04:45:24.750 --> 04:45:24.760 align:start position:0%
saying that there's unknown effects to
 
04:45:27.708 --> 04:45:27.718 align:start position:0%
human health well that comes in to
 
04:45:30.310 --> 04:45:30.320 align:start position:0%
importance later on page two when they
 
04:45:34.270 --> 04:45:34.280 align:start position:0%
do a a 14-day environmental study to uh
 
04:45:36.990 --> 04:45:37.000 align:start position:0%
identify the harm to Public Health if
 
04:45:38.750 --> 04:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
they're unknown I'm not quite sure how
 
04:45:42.510 --> 04:45:42.520 align:start position:0%
you can identify them um number two is
 
04:45:44.750 --> 04:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
the way that it is written on lines 23
 
04:45:44.760 --> 04:45:45.708 align:start position:0%
the way that it is written on lines 23
and

04:45:45.708 --> 04:45:45.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:45:49.190 --> 04:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
24 um it talks about involving the
 
04:45:51.230 --> 04:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
intentional release of polluting
 
04:45:53.430 --> 04:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
emissions well that discourages all
 
04:45:56.948 --> 04:45:56.958 align:start position:0%
planes over the state of New Hampshire
 
04:45:59.510 --> 04:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
um because they all emit polluting
 
04:46:03.390 --> 04:46:03.400 align:start position:0%
emissions um number uh the third thing
 
04:46:06.910 --> 04:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
is um on page two line four and we
 
04:46:08.830 --> 04:46:08.840 align:start position:0%
talked about this during the the hearing
 
04:46:10.948 --> 04:46:10.958 align:start position:0%
but it says the state shall conduct the
 
04:46:14.110 --> 04:46:14.120 align:start position:0%
this 14-day environmental review um who
 
04:46:16.390 --> 04:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
in the state um we had talked about the
 
04:46:19.190 --> 04:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services but
 
04:46:21.788 --> 04:46:21.798 align:start position:0%
this simply says the state and lastly
 
04:46:24.750 --> 04:46:24.760 align:start position:0%
that 14-day I cannot get over that
 
04:46:26.788 --> 04:46:26.798 align:start position:0%
because um in the town of marac where we
 
04:46:30.390 --> 04:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
have P we've been waiting for nine years
 
04:46:33.868 --> 04:46:33.878 align:start position:0%
to to uh find the environmental public
 
04:46:37.070 --> 04:46:37.080 align:start position:0%
health and Wildlife harms of pest good
 
04:46:39.230 --> 04:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
luck doing that in 14
 
04:46:41.990 --> 04:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
days so I will be voting no on this
 
04:46:45.070 --> 04:46:45.080 align:start position:0%
thank you okay further
 
04:46:48.910 --> 04:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:51.430 --> 04:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
Kaplan yeah thank you Mr chair I I also
 
04:46:54.190 --> 04:46:54.200 align:start position:0%
will be bony against this bill I I have
 
04:46:55.910 --> 04:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
a problem with the exemption for cloud
 
04:46:57.628 --> 04:46:57.638 align:start position:0%
seating in case of drought I don't
 
04:46:58.948 --> 04:46:58.958 align:start position:0%
understand that exemption it doesn't
 
04:47:00.510 --> 04:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
seem to be based on anything we heard in
 
04:47:02.310 --> 04:47:02.320 align:start position:0%
our public hearing about the
 
04:47:05.110 --> 04:47:05.120 align:start position:0%
effectiveness or the Andor the need for
 
04:47:06.708 --> 04:47:06.718 align:start position:0%
cloud seeding in case of drought are we
 
04:47:08.310 --> 04:47:08.320 align:start position:0%
facing imminent drought are we facing
 
04:47:10.548 --> 04:47:10.558 align:start position:0%
long-term drought do we know that and
 
04:47:12.270 --> 04:47:12.280 align:start position:0%
what if effect would cloud seating have
 
04:47:14.590 --> 04:47:14.600 align:start position:0%
on that drought is it an effective means
 
04:47:16.030 --> 04:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
of countering drought do we know that
 
04:47:18.708 --> 04:47:18.718 align:start position:0%
did we hear that I don't think we did so
 
04:47:20.868 --> 04:47:20.878 align:start position:0%
I just don't it's just too vague and the
 
04:47:22.708 --> 04:47:22.718 align:start position:0%
other thing I have a problem with is the
 
04:47:24.430 --> 04:47:24.440 align:start position:0%
notification process to all these
 
04:47:26.868 --> 04:47:26.878 align:start position:0%
federal agencies like is that re
 
04:47:28.310 --> 04:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
recreating the wheel don't we already
 
04:47:31.110 --> 04:47:31.120 align:start position:0%
have processes in place for our state
 
04:47:33.430 --> 04:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
government to be in touch with the
 
04:47:35.990 --> 04:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
federal government and in cases of you
 
04:47:38.350 --> 04:47:38.360 align:start position:0%
know emergency drought or what have you
 
04:47:40.270 --> 04:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
uh and isn't that doesn't that come
 
04:47:42.110 --> 04:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
under the the chain of command that's
 
04:47:45.030 --> 04:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
already in place so I I just I find this
 
04:47:47.788 --> 04:47:47.798 align:start position:0%
bill problematic so I'll be voting
 
04:47:47.798 --> 04:47:49.070 align:start position:0%
bill problematic so I'll be voting
against

04:47:49.070 --> 04:47:49.080 align:start position:0%
against
 
04:47:53.830 --> 04:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:56.390 --> 04:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
04:47:58.628 --> 04:47:58.638 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah I I look at this bill
 
04:48:01.190 --> 04:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
and I have a hard time not almost
 
04:48:04.390 --> 04:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
laughing um for example why in hell
 
04:48:06.070 --> 04:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
would the N nuclear Regulatory
 
04:48:07.990 --> 04:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
Commission care what our opinion on
 
04:48:10.910 --> 04:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
geoengineering is in New Hampshire uh
 
04:48:12.430 --> 04:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
the National Park Service there's no
 
04:48:14.510 --> 04:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
national parks in New Hampshire we we
 
04:48:16.708 --> 04:48:16.718 align:start position:0%
just seem to be blasting every Federal
 
04:48:19.430 --> 04:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
agency they can come up with and I just
 
04:48:21.788 --> 04:48:21.798 align:start position:0%
don't think it accomplishes anything and
 
04:48:25.070 --> 04:48:25.080 align:start position:0%
so uh I I'll be voting against the
 
04:48:28.948 --> 04:48:28.958 align:start position:0%
bill further discussion representative
 
04:48:31.510 --> 04:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
Swanson thank you Mr chair I think the
 
04:48:34.990 --> 04:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
bottom line for me is that uh the people
 
04:48:38.070 --> 04:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
who originated this and who would like
 
04:48:40.390 --> 04:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
to see it passed I do not believe that
 
04:48:43.470 --> 04:48:43.480 align:start position:0%
even if this were to pass that they
 
04:48:46.230 --> 04:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
would be satisfied with the outcome in
 
04:48:48.430 --> 04:48:48.440 align:start position:0%
any way shape or form and this would
 
04:48:51.548 --> 04:48:51.558 align:start position:0%
ultimately be an exercise in futility so
 
04:48:53.430 --> 04:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
I'm against
 
04:48:56.628 --> 04:48:56.638 align:start position:0%
this further discussion representative
 
04:49:00.590 --> 04:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
Bernardi thank you Mr chair so uh this
 
04:49:04.350 --> 04:49:04.360 align:start position:0%
amendment with I think relatively small
 
04:49:07.070 --> 04:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
changes is essentially the amendment
 
04:49:11.030 --> 04:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
that the prime sponsor came up with uh
 
04:49:13.750 --> 04:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
to the original bill which was
 
04:49:17.350 --> 04:49:17.360 align:start position:0%
considered uh just totally out of
 
04:49:17.360 --> 04:49:19.030 align:start position:0%
considered uh just totally out of
bounds

04:49:19.030 --> 04:49:19.040 align:start position:0%
bounds
 
04:49:22.350 --> 04:49:22.360 align:start position:0%
um I believe that the focus of this
 
04:49:25.628 --> 04:49:25.638 align:start position:0%
amendment as well as her original
 
04:49:27.230 --> 04:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
amendment that she
 
04:49:32.990 --> 04:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
presented uh was largely to have two
 
04:49:37.830 --> 04:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
things happen first the repeal of RSA
 
04:49:40.670 --> 04:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
12f which is the second the penel
 
04:49:44.830 --> 04:49:44.840 align:start position:0%
ultimate line on page three and uh the
 
04:49:49.390 --> 04:49:49.400 align:start position:0%
the second thing is to basically make a
 
04:49:52.030 --> 04:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
statement hence it probably should have
 
04:49:54.670 --> 04:49:54.680 align:start position:0%
been a resolution but it wasn't it was
 
04:49:57.788 --> 04:49:57.798 align:start position:0%
filed as a bill uh but make a statement
 
04:50:00.948 --> 04:50:00.958 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire stands against
 
04:50:04.868 --> 04:50:04.878 align:start position:0%
geoengineering and blasts every Federal
 
04:50:08.670 --> 04:50:08.680 align:start position:0%
agency that is known demand of that
 
04:50:10.788 --> 04:50:10.798 align:start position:0%
information that's what this bill does
 
04:50:15.670 --> 04:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
because that's what its purpose was um I
 
04:50:18.190 --> 04:50:18.200 align:start position:0%
I believe it's appropriate to move
 
04:50:22.270 --> 04:50:22.280 align:start position:0%
forward with it uh all otherwise we are
 
04:50:26.230 --> 04:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
going to continue to see this bill in
 
04:50:30.548 --> 04:50:30.558 align:start position:0%
other forms continue to come to
 
04:50:33.868 --> 04:50:33.878 align:start position:0%
us further
 
04:50:36.708 --> 04:50:36.718 align:start position:0%
discussion Vice chair Thomas thank you
 
04:50:40.990 --> 04:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I I share uh my good friend %
 
04:50:43.788 --> 04:50:43.798 align:start position:0%
of B's sentiment on this bill the
 
04:50:45.708 --> 04:50:45.718 align:start position:0%
important thing on this bill is that it
 
04:50:50.230 --> 04:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
does repeal RSA 12f and it
 
04:50:53.510 --> 04:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
also uh puts wording in here that are is
 
04:50:56.270 --> 04:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
a little more palatable in order to uh
 
04:50:59.670 --> 04:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
get this bill passed um since we can't
 
04:51:01.470 --> 04:51:01.480 align:start position:0%
really prohibit things that the federal
 
04:51:04.270 --> 04:51:04.280 align:start position:0%
government might might want per se but
 
04:51:06.868 --> 04:51:06.878 align:start position:0%
it does send a message we found out that
 
04:51:08.910 --> 04:51:08.920 align:start position:0%
we could not change this bill into a
 
04:51:11.230 --> 04:51:11.240 align:start position:0%
resolution it's just against the rule
 
04:51:14.590 --> 04:51:14.600 align:start position:0%
so we decided on this language to uh do
 
04:51:16.590 --> 04:51:16.600 align:start position:0%
exactly what the representative already
 
04:51:18.868 --> 04:51:18.878 align:start position:0%

repeal uh 12f and that's why I'll be

05:00:32.628 --> 05:00:32.638 align:start position:0%
to go through this amendment to explain
 
05:00:35.990 --> 05:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
exactly what it does it makes two
 
05:00:38.670 --> 05:00:38.680 align:start position:0%
relatively major changes and several
 
05:00:40.548 --> 05:00:40.558 align:start position:0%
minor changes
 
05:00:43.310 --> 05:00:43.320 align:start position:0%
the two major changes are it
 
05:00:45.510 --> 05:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
eliminates the first of the two major
 
05:00:48.590 --> 05:00:48.600 align:start position:0%
changes is that it eliminates class two
 
05:00:54.590 --> 05:00:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:58.510 --> 05:00:58.520 align:start position:0%
standard the name of the bill changes to
 
05:01:01.150 --> 05:01:01.160 align:start position:0%
relative to changes to the minimum
 
05:01:05.110 --> 05:01:05.120 align:start position:0%
electric renewable portfolio
 
05:01:08.110 --> 05:01:08.120 align:start position:0%
standard so as I said two major changes
 
05:01:10.430 --> 05:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
one is the elimination of class class
 
05:01:14.548 --> 05:01:14.558 align:start position:0%
two the other major change is a
 
05:01:16.628 --> 05:01:16.638 align:start position:0%
reduction in
 
05:01:21.110 --> 05:01:21.120 align:start position:0%
the obligation under class one
 
05:01:23.470 --> 05:01:23.480 align:start position:0%
thermal and then there are some minor
 
05:01:25.708 --> 05:01:25.718 align:start position:0%
changes so let's talk about the two
 
05:01:28.110 --> 05:01:28.120 align:start position:0%
major changes first why eliminate Class
 
05:01:31.670 --> 05:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
2 well it turns out that for years
 
05:01:33.948 --> 05:01:33.958 align:start position:0%
utilities have not been buying class two
 
05:01:33.958 --> 05:01:35.510 align:start position:0%
utilities have not been buying class two
Rex

05:01:35.510 --> 05:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
Rex
 
05:01:38.548 --> 05:01:38.558 align:start position:0%
because the net metering credits they
 
05:01:42.948 --> 05:01:42.958 align:start position:0%
receive give them enough Rex to satisfy
 
05:01:45.110 --> 05:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
their class two obligations so they're
 
05:01:49.390 --> 05:01:49.400 align:start position:0%
not buying them and therefore Class 2 is
 
05:01:52.470 --> 05:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
not stimulating any
 
05:01:54.708 --> 05:01:54.718 align:start position:0%
additional renewable
 
05:01:59.590 --> 05:01:59.600 align:start position:0%
energy uh building build outs so by
 
05:02:02.590 --> 05:02:02.600 align:start position:0%
removing the class
 
05:02:05.750 --> 05:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
two class from the
 
05:02:08.470 --> 05:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
RPS uh we can generate some
 
05:02:11.070 --> 05:02:11.080 align:start position:0%
savings for rate
 
05:02:13.470 --> 05:02:13.480 align:start position:0%
payers it looks like the elimination of
 
05:02:16.830 --> 05:02:16.840 align:start position:0%
class two generates about $1.5 million
 
05:02:18.590 --> 05:02:18.600 align:start position:0%
in savings for rate
 
05:02:24.590 --> 05:02:24.600 align:start position:0%
payers the other change is uh on line
 
05:02:27.150 --> 05:02:27.160 align:start position:0%
27 it reduces
 
05:02:30.910 --> 05:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
the percentage of class one thermal to
 
05:02:34.510 --> 05:02:34.520 align:start position:0%
1.7% beginning on August 1st of
 
05:02:37.030 --> 05:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
2025 after which it shall remain
 
05:02:37.040 --> 05:02:40.150 align:start position:0%
2025 after which it shall remain
unchanged

05:02:40.150 --> 05:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:42.788 --> 05:02:42.798 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that change is
 
05:02:46.150 --> 05:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
currently the
 
05:02:49.990 --> 05:02:50.000 align:start position:0%
2.2% obligation for class one thermal
 
05:02:51.390 --> 05:02:51.400 align:start position:0%
generates about
 
05:02:55.430 --> 05:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
220,000 wrecks a year but the historical
 
05:02:58.110 --> 05:02:58.120 align:start position:0%
record over the last 10 years is that
 
05:03:01.470 --> 05:03:01.480 align:start position:0%
only about 50 to 60 or 50 to 70,000
 
05:03:04.310 --> 05:03:04.320 align:start position:0%
wrecks have actually been produced T-Rex
 
05:03:06.430 --> 05:03:06.440 align:start position:0%
thermal recks as they're
 
05:03:10.750 --> 05:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
called so by reducing the oblation by
 
05:03:13.190 --> 05:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
from 2.2 to
 
05:03:17.310 --> 05:03:17.320 align:start position:0%
1.7% it'll save about 4 $4.2 million for
 
05:03:19.190 --> 05:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
rate payers without having any
 
05:03:22.788 --> 05:03:22.798 align:start position:0%
measurable effect on class one thermal
 
05:03:24.788 --> 05:03:24.798 align:start position:0%
because there still are not enough
 
05:03:30.708 --> 05:03:30.718 align:start position:0%
wrecks to being produced to satisfy the
 
05:03:33.750 --> 05:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
obligation the minor changes in the bill
 
05:03:36.510 --> 05:03:36.520 align:start position:0%
include the elimination of references to
 
05:03:39.750 --> 05:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
class two in various sections through
 
05:03:44.628 --> 05:03:44.638 align:start position:0%
throughout the the bill and
 
05:03:48.548 --> 05:03:48.558 align:start position:0%
um another change that
 
05:03:52.510 --> 05:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
that kind of jumps out at you is on line
 
05:03:55.990 --> 05:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
eight in class one we defi redefined
 
05:03:59.430 --> 05:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
wind energy to be wind energy except
 
05:04:02.270 --> 05:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
that mandated by government procurements
 
05:04:04.430 --> 05:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
and that's to
 
05:04:07.590 --> 05:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
prevent offshore
 
05:04:10.548 --> 05:04:10.558 align:start position:0%
wind uh from
 
05:04:15.030 --> 05:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
overwhelming class one and making
 
05:04:18.670 --> 05:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
the the reck in class one virtually
 
05:04:20.948 --> 05:04:20.958 align:start position:0%
worthless which could happen if there's
 
05:04:24.110 --> 05:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
a huge influx of offshore wind uh
 
05:04:29.430 --> 05:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:33.430 --> 05:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
credits another important change is on
 
05:04:38.470 --> 05:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
page two starting on line 31 going down
 
05:04:40.310 --> 05:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
to line 3
 
05:04:44.110 --> 05:04:44.120 align:start position:0%
6 this section changes the acps for
 
05:04:46.910 --> 05:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
class 1 3 and four from their current
 
05:04:46.920 --> 05:04:48.628 align:start position:0%
class 1 3 and four from their current
levels

05:04:48.628 --> 05:04:48.638 align:start position:0%
levels
 
05:04:53.150 --> 05:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
to levels that are about $2 above the
 
05:04:55.708 --> 05:04:55.718 align:start position:0%
levels in Massachusetts and
 
05:04:57.948 --> 05:04:57.958 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and the reason for that
 
05:05:03.230 --> 05:05:03.240 align:start position:0%
change is to stimulate more recks being
 
05:05:04.990 --> 05:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
satisfied here in New Hampshire instead
 
05:05:08.190 --> 05:05:08.200 align:start position:0%
of going to U Massachusetts or
 
05:05:11.750 --> 05:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:11.760 --> 05:05:15.470 align:start position:0%
 
and

05:05:15.470 --> 05:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:19.390 --> 05:05:19.400 align:start position:0%
uh that change will also reduce the
 
05:05:21.510 --> 05:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
amount of ACP payments going into the
 
05:05:24.990 --> 05:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:29.590 --> 05:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
fund by uh some amount an amount that
 
05:05:33.390 --> 05:05:33.400 align:start position:0%
hasn't been really uh
 
05:05:35.990 --> 05:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
determined the other change on page
 
05:05:36.000 --> 05:05:40.150 align:start position:0%
determined the other change on page
three

05:05:40.150 --> 05:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:45.788 --> 05:05:45.798 align:start position:0%
on lines 16 through 19 are changes uh
 
05:05:48.948 --> 05:05:48.958 align:start position:0%
that repeal the class two
 
05:05:51.470 --> 05:05:51.480 align:start position:0%
references in the
 
05:05:55.868 --> 05:05:55.878 align:start position:0%
bill and there's a couple of
 
05:06:00.230 --> 05:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
other deletions that OS made like on
 
05:06:01.830 --> 05:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
line four I'm just seeing this for the
 
05:06:05.110 --> 05:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
first time line four on page three they
 
05:06:07.150 --> 05:06:07.160 align:start position:0%
deleted an entire
 
05:06:11.030 --> 05:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
sentence with regard to class 2
 
05:06:14.270 --> 05:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
output so those are the changes that
 
05:06:16.350 --> 05:06:16.360 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
05:06:19.868 --> 05:06:19.878 align:start position:0%
suggests and collectively they'll save
 
05:06:23.830 --> 05:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
about $5.7 million for rate payers
 
05:06:26.390 --> 05:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
without having any really negative
 
05:06:28.150 --> 05:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
effects on Renewables
 
05:06:30.750 --> 05:06:30.760 align:start position:0%
growth and it's interesting to point out
 
05:06:33.190 --> 05:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
that just the other just last week it
 
05:06:35.628 --> 05:06:35.638 align:start position:0%
was real revealed that Massachusetts our
 
05:06:40.948 --> 05:06:40.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:44.110 --> 05:06:44.120 align:start position:0%
29% of the average electricity bill is
 
05:06:48.548 --> 05:06:48.558 align:start position:0%
now spent on public policy almost
 
05:06:52.150 --> 05:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
30% of an electricity bill
 
05:06:55.670 --> 05:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
is is going toward public
 
05:06:55.680 --> 05:06:58.510 align:start position:0%
is is going toward public
policy

05:06:58.510 --> 05:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
policy
 
05:07:01.310 --> 05:07:01.320 align:start position:0%
and the citizens of Massachusetts are
 
05:07:05.150 --> 05:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
quite upset with how much money is being
 
05:07:10.150 --> 05:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:13.430 --> 05:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
of their income that's going to to pay
 
05:07:15.190 --> 05:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
on their electric bill for all these
 
05:07:15.200 --> 05:07:16.510 align:start position:0%
on their electric bill for all these
public

05:07:16.510 --> 05:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
public
 
05:07:19.190 --> 05:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
policies Massachusetts also raised the
 
05:07:21.190 --> 05:07:21.200 align:start position:0%
amount of money it's devoting to Energy
 
05:07:24.230 --> 05:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
Efficiency from 4 billion to 4.5
 
05:07:28.750 --> 05:07:28.760 align:start position:0%
billion and they touted that as a
 
05:07:30.990 --> 05:07:31.000 align:start position:0%
reduction because originally they had
 
05:07:33.868 --> 05:07:33.878 align:start position:0%
planned to raise it to five billion but
 
05:07:35.990 --> 05:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
because they only raised to 4.5 billion
 
05:07:38.150 --> 05:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
they said that was a half a billion
 
05:07:42.390 --> 05:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
dollar uh reduction in their Energy
 
05:07:42.400 --> 05:07:43.868 align:start position:0%
dollar uh reduction in their Energy
Efficiency

05:07:43.868 --> 05:07:43.878 align:start position:0%
Efficiency
 
05:07:46.910 --> 05:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
spending I think those are examples of
 
05:07:49.548 --> 05:07:49.558 align:start position:0%
public policy that's gone off the rails
 
05:07:51.788 --> 05:07:51.798 align:start position:0%
and is out of control and we don't want
 
05:07:53.948 --> 05:07:53.958 align:start position:0%
that to happen here so we think these
 
05:07:57.548 --> 05:07:57.558 align:start position:0%
are uh reasonable reforms to make to the
 
05:07:59.150 --> 05:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
RPS and
 
05:07:59.160 --> 05:08:00.510 align:start position:0%
RPS and
[Music]

05:08:00.510 --> 05:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:08:03.270 --> 05:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm interested to hear what the rest
 
05:08:07.310 --> 05:08:07.320 align:start position:0%
of the committee thinks so I'd open this
 
05:08:09.948 --> 05:08:09.958 align:start position:0%
the floor to the discussion of this uh
 
05:08:09.958 --> 05:08:10.670 align:start position:0%
the floor to the discussion of this uh
this

05:08:10.670 --> 05:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:08:14.150 --> 05:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
amendment representative McGee thank you
 
05:08:15.548 --> 05:08:15.558 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for that
 
05:08:17.628 --> 05:08:17.638 align:start position:0%
explanation I have a couple of questions
 
05:08:21.110 --> 05:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
but um when you mentioned Massachusetts
 
05:08:23.070 --> 05:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
having a third of their bill going to
 
05:08:25.430 --> 05:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
programs do you have information about
 
05:08:27.830 --> 05:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
how much what percentage New Hampshire
 
05:08:30.430 --> 05:08:30.440 align:start position:0%
is spending on
 
05:08:32.350 --> 05:08:32.360 align:start position:0%
programs because I don't think anybody
 
05:08:33.750 --> 05:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
has been complaining about this I know
 
05:08:36.350 --> 05:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
we're always trying to solve for it but
 
05:08:38.430 --> 05:08:38.440 align:start position:0%
that's my question now the exact number
 
05:08:39.910 --> 05:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
05:08:41.948 --> 05:08:41.958 align:start position:0%
is between 10 and
 
05:08:44.190 --> 05:08:44.200 align:start position:0%
12% and the point I'm trying to make
 
05:08:47.310 --> 05:08:47.320 align:start position:0%
here is that we have taken a much more
 
05:08:50.990 --> 05:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
conservative approach yes uh to uh make
 
05:08:55.230 --> 05:08:55.240 align:start position:0%
sure that we don't outrage our citizenry
 
05:08:59.030 --> 05:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
by overcharging them for Public Policy
 
05:09:01.750 --> 05:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
okay then uh let me follow on line 30 I
 
05:09:03.548 --> 05:09:03.558 align:start position:0%
don't think you did highlight on page
 
05:09:06.030 --> 05:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
two which is repealing the renewable
 
05:09:08.470 --> 05:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
energy fund and then replacing it with
 
05:09:10.030 --> 05:09:10.040 align:start position:0%
the language after that which basically
 
05:09:13.150 --> 05:09:13.160 align:start position:0%
changes the classes and the amounts that
 
05:09:16.830 --> 05:09:16.840 align:start position:0%
are paid per wreck um that renewable
 
05:09:19.190 --> 05:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
energy fund from testimony that we
 
05:09:20.750 --> 05:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
received this year in
 
05:09:24.910 --> 05:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
hearing um usually puts out about
 
05:09:29.030 --> 05:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
11% whereas 89% is private dollars in
 
05:09:30.868 --> 05:09:30.878 align:start position:0%
the projects that we invest in in order
 
05:09:33.030 --> 05:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
to have local sustainable energy in the
 
05:09:35.548 --> 05:09:35.558 align:start position:0%
state that is sounds to me like a very
 
05:09:38.110 --> 05:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
good investment in terms of we're not
 
05:09:39.788 --> 05:09:39.798 align:start position:0%
we're not spending the kind of money
 
05:09:41.470 --> 05:09:41.480 align:start position:0%
other states are we have been
 
05:09:43.708 --> 05:09:43.718 align:start position:0%
conservative with the Investments that
 
05:09:47.788 --> 05:09:47.798 align:start position:0%
we make but if this bill passes the
 
05:09:51.670 --> 05:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund is no more and so
 
05:09:54.030 --> 05:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
that 11% that we put forward to help
 
05:09:55.868 --> 05:09:55.878 align:start position:0%
people make the numbers work when they
 
05:09:59.070 --> 05:09:59.080 align:start position:0%
do an upfront investment in a project
 
05:10:02.350 --> 05:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
where they will not have an ongoing fuel
 
05:10:05.990 --> 05:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
cost um you know the the whole point of
 
05:10:08.990 --> 05:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
the program uh and the rec program as
 
05:10:09.000 --> 05:10:09.830 align:start position:0%
the program uh and the rec program as
well

05:10:09.830 --> 05:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:10:14.190 --> 05:10:14.200 align:start position:0%
is to incentivize having more investment
 
05:10:16.070 --> 05:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
in those types of local sustainable
 
05:10:17.830 --> 05:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
energy sources
 
05:10:22.270 --> 05:10:22.280 align:start position:0%
so I I I do uh appreciate the argument
 
05:10:23.948 --> 05:10:23.958 align:start position:0%
that you're making for the fact that we
 
05:10:25.788 --> 05:10:25.798 align:start position:0%
don't want to
 
05:10:29.030 --> 05:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
overspend uh on assisting but I have
 
05:10:30.510 --> 05:10:30.520 align:start position:0%
actually had people when I'm knocking
 
05:10:32.830 --> 05:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
doors complain that New Hampshire
 
05:10:36.510 --> 05:10:36.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't have enough um help for people
 
05:10:38.150 --> 05:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
who are trying to actually lower their
 
05:10:39.910 --> 05:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
own energy bills right they they want to
 
05:10:42.788 --> 05:10:42.798 align:start position:0%
know what programs we have so there must
 
05:10:46.190 --> 05:10:46.200 align:start position:0%
be some kind of happy medium here but
 
05:10:48.430 --> 05:10:48.440 align:start position:0%
you didn't mention that we're repealing
 
05:10:50.350 --> 05:10:50.360 align:start position:0%
the renewable energy fund as well so
 
05:10:52.990 --> 05:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
there'll be no more Investments if this
 
05:10:56.390 --> 05:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
bill passes in the RF well I didn't
 
05:10:58.788 --> 05:10:58.798 align:start position:0%
mention that because the bill doesn't do
 
05:11:02.470 --> 05:11:02.480 align:start position:0%
that it makes some changes to the text
 
05:11:07.350 --> 05:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
of the uh RSA 362 F10 which is the
 
05:11:09.990 --> 05:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
section about the renewable energy fund
 
05:11:12.750 --> 05:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
but it does not repeal
 
05:11:15.230 --> 05:11:15.240 align:start position:0%
it just section
 
05:11:18.590 --> 05:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
three AC
 
05:11:22.670 --> 05:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
amount section six of the bill page two
 
05:11:25.830 --> 05:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
starting on line
 
05:11:30.230 --> 05:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
11 amends RSA 362 F col
 
05:11:33.628 --> 05:11:33.638 align:start position:0%
10 uh to read as follows and you can
 
05:11:36.030 --> 05:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
read the text it does
 
05:11:39.868 --> 05:11:39.878 align:start position:0%
not eliminate or repeal the renewable
 
05:11:41.708 --> 05:11:41.718 align:start position:0%
energy fund all it does is delete some
 
05:11:43.750 --> 05:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
references to class
 
05:11:47.910 --> 05:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
two so I'm not sure and then if you look
 
05:11:52.390 --> 05:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
on page three lines 17 18 and
 
05:11:56.070 --> 05:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
19 there are a couple of repeals there
 
05:12:00.390 --> 05:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
but um none of those are I'm referring
 
05:12:03.670 --> 05:12:03.680 align:start position:0%
to page two line 30 section 7 renewable
 
05:12:06.830 --> 05:12:06.840 align:start position:0%
energy fund where it says RSA 362 f103
 
05:12:10.150 --> 05:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
is repealed and Reena Ed so I'm looking
 
05:12:12.990 --> 05:12:13.000 align:start position:0%
at that section
 
05:12:15.150 --> 05:12:15.160 align:start position:0%
F10 yes but
 
05:12:20.708 --> 05:12:20.718 align:start position:0%
f103 and f103 is the r ACP payment
 
05:12:23.110 --> 05:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
section so there'll be no more ACP
 
05:12:24.628 --> 05:12:24.638 align:start position:0%
payments by the utilities is that what
 
05:12:25.788 --> 05:12:25.798 align:start position:0%
we're saying
 
05:12:30.230 --> 05:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
no the the section is repealed and then
 
05:12:33.310 --> 05:12:33.320 align:start position:0%
reenacted so it just changes the acps
 
05:12:35.788 --> 05:12:35.798 align:start position:0%
from what they were before in the cas
 
05:12:38.830 --> 05:12:38.840 align:start position:0%
case of class one it was $68 in the CL
 
05:12:41.030 --> 05:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
case of Class 2 it
 
05:12:44.590 --> 05:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
was $55 I think and class 4 it might
 
05:12:45.910 --> 05:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
have been
 
05:12:49.270 --> 05:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
$45 it just changes the amounts from
 
05:12:50.910 --> 05:12:50.920 align:start position:0%
those numbers to the numbers that you
 
05:12:54.670 --> 05:12:54.680 align:start position:0%
see here it doesn't repeal it it
 
05:12:57.628 --> 05:12:57.638 align:start position:0%
technically it just uh reenacts it and
 
05:12:59.430 --> 05:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
changes the numbers okay I'm looking at
 
05:13:01.948 --> 05:13:01.958 align:start position:0%
it yes so it's replacing that section
 
05:13:04.430 --> 05:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
section right replacing it and what are
 
05:13:07.150 --> 05:13:07.160 align:start position:0%
those numbers based on those are ACP
 
05:13:08.750 --> 05:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
payments and no what are the numbers
 
05:13:10.548 --> 05:13:10.558 align:start position:0%
based on why are we changing them
 
05:13:12.590 --> 05:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
they're based on Massachusetts
 
05:13:14.750 --> 05:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and Rhode Island
 
05:13:17.948 --> 05:13:17.958 align:start position:0%
acps which are
 
05:13:22.230 --> 05:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
40 and um
 
05:13:24.948 --> 05:13:24.958 align:start position:0%
35 uh for class 1 three and four
 
05:13:27.070 --> 05:13:27.080 align:start position:0%
respectively and there is of course no
 
05:13:29.948 --> 05:13:29.958 align:start position:0%
thermal energy in those States so is
 
05:13:32.150 --> 05:13:32.160 align:start position:0%
that is that designed to reinvigorate
 
05:13:36.150 --> 05:13:36.160 align:start position:0%
the Rex which are not yes yeah yes okay
 
05:13:38.510 --> 05:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
thanks representative Corman has a
 
05:13:40.350 --> 05:13:40.360 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman not
 
05:13:43.990 --> 05:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
really a question more of a request I
 
05:13:46.788 --> 05:13:46.798 align:start position:0%
mean this to me is a pretty big change
 
05:13:48.990 --> 05:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm having trouble wrapping my head
 
05:13:51.350 --> 05:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
around it at least in in the time frame
 
05:13:54.628 --> 05:13:54.638 align:start position:0%
that we have today so I would request
 
05:13:57.110 --> 05:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
one of two things one is that we recess
 
05:13:59.150 --> 05:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
the hearing to give us time to really
 
05:14:04.110 --> 05:14:04.120 align:start position:0%
absorb this or the other is that we um
 
05:14:06.628 --> 05:14:06.638 align:start position:0%
retain the bill so that we can actually
 
05:14:11.910 --> 05:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:15.190 --> 05:14:15.200 align:start position:0%
changes well this is an early bill so it
 
05:14:18.230 --> 05:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
has to be done either today or
 
05:14:22.470 --> 05:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
tomorrow um or or retained or retained
 
05:14:26.430 --> 05:14:26.440 align:start position:0%
right um but it has to be done no later
 
05:14:29.270 --> 05:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
than tomorrow motion on the floor to
 
05:14:30.910 --> 05:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
pass right now we have a motion on the
 
05:14:30.920 --> 05:14:33.548 align:start position:0%
pass right now we have a motion on the
floor

05:14:33.548 --> 05:14:33.558 align:start position:0%
floor
 
05:14:36.750 --> 05:14:36.760 align:start position:0%
so uh representative McGee I I made a
 
05:14:37.990 --> 05:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
note as I was looking through here
 
05:14:40.070 --> 05:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
because it to representative corman's
 
05:14:41.868 --> 05:14:41.878 align:start position:0%
point there are a lot of changes in here
 
05:14:45.470 --> 05:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
to absorb and on page three I wrote
 
05:14:48.590 --> 05:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
based on what um on line three a
 
05:14:49.830 --> 05:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
sentence starts that says for the
 
05:14:51.390 --> 05:14:51.400 align:start position:0%
purpose of estimation the department of
 
05:14:53.510 --> 05:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
energy shall use a capacity Factor
 
05:14:56.548 --> 05:14:56.558 align:start position:0%
rating of 20% for each class one
 
05:14:59.868 --> 05:14:59.878 align:start position:0%
installation and again we are just we're
 
05:15:02.830 --> 05:15:02.840 align:start position:0%
just pronouncing that and I don't know
 
05:15:04.708 --> 05:15:04.718 align:start position:0%
if that's accurate if that's good if
 
05:15:06.070 --> 05:15:06.080 align:start position:0%
that's what we should be doing if it's
 
05:15:09.430 --> 05:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
helpful if it hurts that's existing
 
05:15:11.230 --> 05:15:11.240 align:start position:0%
statute no
 
05:15:13.548 --> 05:15:13.558 align:start position:0%
change that's already that text is
 
05:15:16.310 --> 05:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:19.830 --> 05:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
statute I I understand but again I I I'm
 
05:15:22.030 --> 05:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
thinking if we're going to be revamping
 
05:15:23.548 --> 05:15:23.558 align:start position:0%
this section I think we should
 
05:15:25.230 --> 05:15:25.240 align:start position:0%
understand what we're putting in place
 
05:15:29.150 --> 05:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
for capacity factors on uh because class
 
05:15:33.910 --> 05:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
one is also new renewable installments
 
05:15:35.948 --> 05:15:35.958 align:start position:0%
right so we could have much higher
 
05:15:37.750 --> 05:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
capacity factors and maybe that language
 
05:15:42.788 --> 05:15:42.798 align:start position:0%
is is is not uh adequate so I I just
 
05:15:44.708 --> 05:15:44.718 align:start position:0%
would like to know that we're doing
 
05:15:46.470 --> 05:15:46.480 align:start position:0%
something that's actually what we want
 
05:15:49.270 --> 05:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
to be doing if we're going to be making
 
05:15:51.190 --> 05:15:51.200 align:start position:0%
significant changes I know that's not a
 
05:15:54.070 --> 05:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
change but I'm just saying it may need
 
05:15:56.390 --> 05:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
changing and so I think we need some
 
05:15:58.670 --> 05:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
answers before we just pass
 
05:16:01.350 --> 05:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
it representative
 
05:16:04.670 --> 05:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
Swanson thank you Mr chair uh as the new
 
05:16:07.750 --> 05:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
guy here once again as very much a
 
05:16:09.628 --> 05:16:09.638 align:start position:0%
process question
 
05:16:12.110 --> 05:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
but uh I received a lot of mail on this
 
05:16:14.788 --> 05:16:14.798 align:start position:0%
one as far it was
 
05:16:17.310 --> 05:16:17.320 align:start position:0%
originally uh I'd like the changes that
 
05:16:20.670 --> 05:16:20.680 align:start position:0%
were made and feel very positive about
 
05:16:23.990 --> 05:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
them uh as far as process goes we had a
 
05:16:27.628 --> 05:16:27.638 align:start position:0%
public hearing on the previous version
 
05:16:30.150 --> 05:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
we don't do we need a public hearing on
 
05:16:32.070 --> 05:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
this amendment given the level of
 
05:16:34.230 --> 05:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
changes and how would that
 
05:16:37.350 --> 05:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
work well house rules say that if you're
 
05:16:39.190 --> 05:16:39.200 align:start position:0%
going to
 
05:16:42.708 --> 05:16:42.718 align:start position:0%
no amend a bill
 
05:16:45.990 --> 05:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
um amend a different section of law than
 
05:16:47.230 --> 05:16:47.240 align:start position:0%
the original
 
05:16:50.708 --> 05:16:50.718 align:start position:0%
Bill amended or the original Bill
 
05:16:52.948 --> 05:16:52.958 align:start position:0%
addressed then you have
 
05:16:56.230 --> 05:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
to that that Amendment could be ruled
 
05:16:59.270 --> 05:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
non- gerine unless you held another
 
05:17:02.350 --> 05:17:02.360 align:start position:0%
public hearing but this bill or this
 
05:17:05.390 --> 05:17:05.400 align:start position:0%
amendment addresses the exact same
 
05:17:08.590 --> 05:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
section of law as the original bill so
 
05:17:12.510 --> 05:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
it is Germain to make an amendment like
 
05:17:16.628 --> 05:17:16.638 align:start position:0%
this uh without having another public
 
05:17:19.150 --> 05:17:19.160 align:start position:0%
hearing thank you Mr chair I I was
 
05:17:20.990 --> 05:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
prepared to offer very stirring
 
05:17:24.270 --> 05:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
Soliloquy on this but uh I have uh
 
05:17:25.948 --> 05:17:25.958 align:start position:0%
decided that's no longer going to be
 
05:17:28.110 --> 05:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
necessary based upon what I'm seeing so
 
05:17:30.708 --> 05:17:30.718 align:start position:0%
far thank you
 
05:17:32.910 --> 05:17:32.920 align:start position:0%
okay Rel
 
05:17:36.590 --> 05:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
uh re let's go to representative Kaplan
 
05:17:37.830 --> 05:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
first and then we'll come back to you
 
05:17:40.110 --> 05:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
representative McGee so I I thank you Mr
 
05:17:41.750 --> 05:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
chair I just have couple questions for
 
05:17:45.150 --> 05:17:45.160 align:start position:0%
you uh correct me if I'm wrong this this
 
05:17:45.160 --> 05:17:46.548 align:start position:0%
you uh correct me if I'm wrong this this
amendment

05:17:46.548 --> 05:17:46.558 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:17:49.190 --> 05:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
basically eliminates class
 
05:17:53.470 --> 05:17:53.480 align:start position:0%
two and increases ACP payments second
 
05:17:55.310 --> 05:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
question I do have a problem with
 
05:17:58.788 --> 05:17:58.798 align:start position:0%
actually decreases ACP payments ACP
 
05:18:00.868 --> 05:18:00.878 align:start position:0%
amounts oh it decreases the ACP amounts
 
05:18:02.788 --> 05:18:02.798 align:start position:0%
but incre the amounts are higher than
 
05:18:04.470 --> 05:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
the massachus in Connecticut and Rhode
 
05:18:06.470 --> 05:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
Island ACB payments but they're already
 
05:18:08.190 --> 05:18:08.200 align:start position:0%
higher than Mass they're already so it's
 
05:18:10.190 --> 05:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
actually lower the ACB things okay thank
 
05:18:11.590 --> 05:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
you for that clarification my second
 
05:18:14.868 --> 05:18:14.878 align:start position:0%
question is uh on line eight wind energy
 
05:18:16.750 --> 05:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
ex uh so you're you're adding the
 
05:18:19.350 --> 05:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
language except mandated by government
 
05:18:21.270 --> 05:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
procurements which government it seems
 
05:18:22.990 --> 05:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
unclear and vague like what government
 
05:18:23.990 --> 05:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
are you talking about the federal
 
05:18:26.030 --> 05:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
government New Hampshire
 
05:18:28.470 --> 05:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
government um any government any
 
05:18:30.830 --> 05:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
government so you talk
 
05:18:33.310 --> 05:18:33.320 align:start position:0%
China they're they're they're mandating
 
05:18:36.190 --> 05:18:36.200 align:start position:0%
offo wind in some other jurisdiction and
 
05:18:38.110 --> 05:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to say that's not going to
 
05:18:40.190 --> 05:18:40.200 align:start position:0%
count for new ampire I'm just unclear
 
05:18:42.350 --> 05:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
how that would even work well it's not
 
05:18:44.110 --> 05:18:44.120 align:start position:0%
likely that a
 
05:18:48.110 --> 05:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
Chinese wind farm would uh try to sell
 
05:18:52.190 --> 05:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
Rex into New England's RPS Market but
 
05:18:54.390 --> 05:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
wind farms off the coast of
 
05:18:58.948 --> 05:18:58.958 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Maine Rhode Island yeah U
 
05:19:02.350 --> 05:19:02.360 align:start position:0%
if they try to sell Rex into the New
 
05:19:06.910 --> 05:19:06.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Market we say no because we
 
05:19:08.548 --> 05:19:08.558 align:start position:0%
don't want to get our Market flooded
 
05:19:12.150 --> 05:19:12.160 align:start position:0%
with with class one Rex thank you
 
05:19:15.868 --> 05:19:15.878 align:start position:0%
Goa additional comment representative PL
 
05:19:19.628 --> 05:19:19.638 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chair uh I myself also over
 
05:19:22.350 --> 05:19:22.360 align:start position:0%
the years had input from my constituents
 
05:19:24.788 --> 05:19:24.798 align:start position:0%
and involvement in this and your
 
05:19:29.150 --> 05:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
explanation on page one line
 
05:19:35.868 --> 05:19:35.878 align:start position:0%
2728 of the amount of thermal Rex being
 
05:19:39.670 --> 05:19:39.680 align:start position:0%
um used now I will be voting in favor to
 
05:19:41.868 --> 05:19:41.878 align:start position:0%
off to pass thank
 
05:19:44.750 --> 05:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
you further discussion representative
 
05:19:47.030 --> 05:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
mcke my question was on that section as
 
05:19:48.948 --> 05:19:48.958 align:start position:0%
well because I I keep reading it over
 
05:19:50.190 --> 05:19:50.200 align:start position:0%
and over again but I don't know what the
 
05:19:52.548 --> 05:19:52.558 align:start position:0%
impact is going to be I know you said
 
05:19:53.910 --> 05:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
that there would be
 
05:19:59.150 --> 05:19:59.160 align:start position:0%
savings um but on line 26 on page one of
 
05:20:01.830 --> 05:20:01.840 align:start position:0%
the of well I'm reading I'm actually
 
05:20:06.948 --> 05:20:06.958 align:start position:0%
reading the amendment right um it says
 
05:20:09.510 --> 05:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
the set percentage shall be
 
05:20:13.230 --> 05:20:13.240 align:start position:0%
4% in 2014 and then it goes up
 
05:20:15.510 --> 05:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
2% uh each
 
05:20:20.390 --> 05:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
year uh landing at 8% in 2016 and then
 
05:20:24.708 --> 05:20:24.718 align:start position:0%
2% per year from 2017 through 2023 which
 
05:20:27.310 --> 05:20:27.320 align:start position:0%
brings us up to the 2.2% which you
 
05:20:30.670 --> 05:20:30.680 align:start position:0%
referred to and then beginning in the
 
05:20:32.190 --> 05:20:32.200 align:start position:0%
summer of this year it's going to be
 
05:20:36.150 --> 05:20:36.160 align:start position:0%
reduced back by 0.5% to
 
05:20:38.390 --> 05:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
1.7% and I'm not sure what that does
 
05:20:39.708 --> 05:20:39.718 align:start position:0%
because because my understanding from
 
05:20:41.948 --> 05:20:41.958 align:start position:0%
our hearings was that class one was when
 
05:20:45.190 --> 05:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
people are investing in new Renewables
 
05:20:48.110 --> 05:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
right so if they want to put in a new uh
 
05:20:50.350 --> 05:20:50.360 align:start position:0%
source of energy that would be an
 
05:20:52.990 --> 05:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
expensive undertaking there it it's
 
05:20:54.350 --> 05:20:54.360 align:start position:0%
we're going to be going backwards in
 
05:20:57.430 --> 05:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
terms of what we're going to
 
05:21:00.830 --> 05:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
um provide for folks who are making
 
05:21:05.948 --> 05:21:05.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:09.510 --> 05:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
value so this is pertaining to class one
 
05:21:09.520 --> 05:21:11.030 align:start position:0%
value so this is pertaining to class one
thermal

05:21:11.030 --> 05:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
thermal
 
05:21:14.670 --> 05:21:14.680 align:start position:0%
yeah well I'm I'm thinking of um I'm
 
05:21:16.628 --> 05:21:16.638 align:start position:0%
thinking of John Moses who came here
 
05:21:19.310 --> 05:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
from was it Britain Lumber speaking
 
05:21:20.670 --> 05:21:20.680 align:start position:0%
about the fact that they had just put
 
05:21:23.230 --> 05:21:23.240 align:start position:0%
put in a new thermal unit that they
 
05:21:24.470 --> 05:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have made that investment if
 
05:21:26.590 --> 05:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
they didn't have the Rex that's what I'm
 
05:21:27.628 --> 05:21:27.638 align:start position:0%
thinking of I'm thinking of the people
 
05:21:29.270 --> 05:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
who came here and told us how valuable
 
05:21:34.230 --> 05:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
it is because they have they have the um
 
05:21:37.110 --> 05:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
the capacity and they have the energy
 
05:21:39.310 --> 05:21:39.320 align:start position:0%
and then they have the Rex and that's
 
05:21:43.230 --> 05:21:43.240 align:start position:0%
sort of what makes up the the fiscal
 
05:21:45.430 --> 05:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
reality of whether they can do these
 
05:21:46.788 --> 05:21:46.798 align:start position:0%
kinds of Investments so they want to
 
05:21:49.470 --> 05:21:49.480 align:start position:0%
make the Investments but these types of
 
05:21:51.788 --> 05:21:51.798 align:start position:0%
programs actually are supporting that
 
05:21:51.798 --> 05:21:52.590 align:start position:0%
programs actually are supporting that
they

05:21:52.590 --> 05:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:21:52.600 --> 05:21:55.270 align:start position:0%
they
happen

05:21:55.270 --> 05:21:55.280 align:start position:0%
happen
 
05:21:57.910 --> 05:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
and I don't know what will happen if we
 
05:22:00.670 --> 05:22:00.680 align:start position:0%
are uh lowering the value at a point
 
05:22:03.390 --> 05:22:03.400 align:start position:0%
when many people around us in our in the
 
05:22:06.070 --> 05:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
energy economy are are you know
 
05:22:10.350 --> 05:22:10.360 align:start position:0%
increasing their support for
 
05:22:10.360 --> 05:22:11.628 align:start position:0%
increasing their support for
fuel

05:22:11.628 --> 05:22:11.638 align:start position:0%
fuel
 
05:22:14.750 --> 05:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
diversity so right now the 2.2%
 
05:22:17.110 --> 05:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
requirement obligates the utilities to
 
05:22:19.670 --> 05:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
purchase about
 
05:22:22.948 --> 05:22:22.958 align:start position:0%
220,000 T-Rex per
 
05:22:25.708 --> 05:22:25.718 align:start position:0%
year reducing at to
 
05:22:30.150 --> 05:22:30.160 align:start position:0%
1.7 will lower that obligation to about
 
05:22:33.150 --> 05:22:33.160 align:start position:0%
170,000 t-rex per
 
05:22:35.868 --> 05:22:35.878 align:start position:0%
year over the last 10
 
05:22:38.910 --> 05:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
years the industry has produced
 
05:22:42.830 --> 05:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
somewhere between 50 and 70,000
 
05:22:47.910 --> 05:22:47.920 align:start position:0%
T-Rex so that falls well short of the
 
05:22:51.510 --> 05:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
obligation that would be set by
 
05:22:54.590 --> 05:22:54.600 align:start position:0%
reducing the utility obligation to
 
05:22:57.510 --> 05:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
1.7% there'd still be plenty of room for
 
05:22:58.708 --> 05:22:58.718 align:start position:0%
growth in
 
05:23:01.990 --> 05:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
T-Rex while simultaneously saving about
 
05:23:02.000 --> 05:23:02.788 align:start position:0%
T-Rex while simultaneously saving about
4

05:23:02.788 --> 05:23:02.798 align:start position:0%
4
 
05:23:06.788 --> 05:23:06.798 align:start position:0%
million in cost to the utilities for
 
05:23:06.798 --> 05:23:08.910 align:start position:0%
million in cost to the utilities for
purchasing

05:23:08.910 --> 05:23:08.920 align:start position:0%
purchasing
 
05:23:12.110 --> 05:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
either T-rex or acps if there are no
 
05:23:14.708 --> 05:23:14.718 align:start position:0%
T-Rex to purchase thank you that's a
 
05:23:16.190 --> 05:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
great explanation because I did take
 
05:23:17.590 --> 05:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
notes when you were talking about that
 
05:23:20.190 --> 05:23:20.200 align:start position:0%
before but I don't think I netted what
 
05:23:23.948 --> 05:23:23.958 align:start position:0%
you just explained thank you you're
 
05:23:26.270 --> 05:23:26.280 align:start position:0%
welcome representative
 
05:23:28.310 --> 05:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
Harrington yeah I just like to remind
 
05:23:29.868 --> 05:23:29.878 align:start position:0%
the committee what we're talking about
 
05:23:32.070 --> 05:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
here we're talking about the electric
 
05:23:34.510 --> 05:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
rate payers subsidizing people who burn
 
05:23:37.230 --> 05:23:37.240 align:start position:0%
wood for industrial boilers there is no
 
05:23:38.830 --> 05:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
benefit to the rate payers is they don't
 
05:23:40.590 --> 05:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
see their electric bill go down because
 
05:23:42.510 --> 05:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
there's no decrease in usage I don't
 
05:23:43.948 --> 05:23:43.958 align:start position:0%
think there's anybody in New Hampshire
 
05:23:45.910 --> 05:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
that said I've been using massive
 
05:23:48.110 --> 05:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
amounts of electric space heaters to
 
05:23:51.350 --> 05:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
heat my facility my factory whatever and
 
05:23:53.590 --> 05:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
now I'm going to switch over to Wood
 
05:23:57.030 --> 05:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
they were using Oil propane or gas so
 
05:23:58.910 --> 05:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
now they're switching over to Wood and
 
05:24:00.230 --> 05:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
someone who's struggling to pay their
 
05:24:02.150 --> 05:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
electric bill plays pays a slightly
 
05:24:04.390 --> 05:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
higher bill every month to subsidize
 
05:24:06.750 --> 05:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
those industrial boilers so anything
 
05:24:08.590 --> 05:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
they get they should be very very happy
 
05:24:10.270 --> 05:24:10.280 align:start position:0%
with because they're getting free money
 
05:24:13.910 --> 05:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:16.590 --> 05:24:16.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire representative McGee I know
 
05:24:19.270 --> 05:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
when um when Mr nebling who's here today
 
05:24:21.030 --> 05:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
submitted testimony to us which I have
 
05:24:23.590 --> 05:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
with me he listed all the folks who are
 
05:24:25.590 --> 05:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
you know currently invested in these
 
05:24:27.910 --> 05:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
types of projects and my town ofus has
 
05:24:29.910 --> 05:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
both the police station and the town
 
05:24:32.788 --> 05:24:32.798 align:start position:0%
hall that they converted over to you
 
05:24:35.150 --> 05:24:35.160 align:start position:0%
know thermal uh generation and what
 
05:24:36.788 --> 05:24:36.798 align:start position:0%
they've done is they've lowered electric
 
05:24:39.030 --> 05:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
bills for everybody in town
 
05:24:41.310 --> 05:24:41.320 align:start position:0%
uh so I I mean people make these
 
05:24:43.948 --> 05:24:43.958 align:start position:0%
Investments because it's less expensive
 
05:24:45.510 --> 05:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
to operate these facilities and they're
 
05:24:46.948 --> 05:24:46.958 align:start position:0%
trying to get to the place where they
 
05:24:48.590 --> 05:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
can afford to make the investment so
 
05:24:50.390 --> 05:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
that they can lower people's costs so
 
05:24:52.190 --> 05:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
there's arguments on both sides it's not
 
05:24:54.230 --> 05:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
just a one-sided argument didn't lower
 
05:24:56.270 --> 05:24:56.280 align:start position:0%
my counts well they lowered Mine by a
 
05:24:58.708 --> 05:24:58.718 align:start position:0%
lot and we also received stuff from the
 
05:25:01.030 --> 05:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
Rye energy committee we had testimony
 
05:25:03.670 --> 05:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
here saying how much millions of dollars
 
05:25:06.590 --> 05:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
that certain uh constituencies and
 
05:25:08.708 --> 05:25:08.718 align:start position:0%
municipalities in the state have lowered
 
05:25:11.548 --> 05:25:11.558 align:start position:0%
their energy bills because of these
 
05:25:13.788 --> 05:25:13.798 align:start position:0%
Investments how did the the town of
 
05:25:17.430 --> 05:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
Hollis lower their electric bill by
 
05:25:20.150 --> 05:25:20.160 align:start position:0%
putting in Wood Fired
 
05:25:22.548 --> 05:25:22.558 align:start position:0%
boilers they converted from oil and it
 
05:25:24.670 --> 05:25:24.680 align:start position:0%
was cheaper cheaper to run cheaper to
 
05:25:27.110 --> 05:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
operate cheaper Fuel and and the cost
 
05:25:28.470 --> 05:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
went down by hundreds of thousands of
 
05:25:29.868 --> 05:25:29.878 align:start position:0%
dollars because the energy Committee in
 
05:25:32.270 --> 05:25:32.280 align:start position:0%
our town tracks that stuff and reports
 
05:25:35.070 --> 05:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
that stuff and I remember that the um we
 
05:25:36.990 --> 05:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
were very excited because this they
 
05:25:38.350 --> 05:25:38.360 align:start position:0%
promised that the savings would be
 
05:25:39.910 --> 05:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
significant and the savings were
 
05:25:42.590 --> 05:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
significant people were very happy so
 
05:25:44.868 --> 05:25:44.878 align:start position:0%
your energy bill went down but not your
 
05:25:46.990 --> 05:25:47.000 align:start position:0%
electricity bill
 
05:25:49.948 --> 05:25:49.958 align:start position:0%
necessarily it's money I don't know what
 
05:25:52.590 --> 05:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
to say like I mentioned before a lot of
 
05:25:55.190 --> 05:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
places are looking at energy as energy
 
05:25:57.310 --> 05:25:57.320 align:start position:0%
um how it's delivered
 
05:26:01.110 --> 05:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
is um not as germine as whether or not
 
05:26:04.310 --> 05:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
you're able to create efficiencies
 
05:26:06.830 --> 05:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
sustainability um lower your dependence
 
05:26:08.910 --> 05:26:08.920 align:start position:0%
for you know shipping stuff in that
 
05:26:10.350 --> 05:26:10.360 align:start position:0%
maybe you won't be able to get when
 
05:26:12.868 --> 05:26:12.878 align:start position:0%
there's a war or whatever um you know
 
05:26:15.708 --> 05:26:15.718 align:start position:0%
there there's a value to us having more
 
05:26:17.708 --> 05:26:17.718 align:start position:0%
reliability which we talk about a lot on
 
05:26:21.270 --> 05:26:21.280 align:start position:0%
this committee and so I I I just think
 
05:26:23.910 --> 05:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
you know it we're enabling people to
 
05:26:25.590 --> 05:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
make the decisions they can make by
 
05:26:27.910 --> 05:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
giving them just a little teeny bit of
 
05:26:29.750 --> 05:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
what they need to invest to make it work
 
05:26:32.590 --> 05:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
for themselves but there is money to be
 
05:26:35.670 --> 05:26:35.680 align:start position:0%
saved and that money gets shared by the
 
05:26:38.350 --> 05:26:38.360 align:start position:0%
people um who are investing in these
 
05:26:39.948 --> 05:26:39.958 align:start position:0%
types of things and and so that's just
 
05:26:42.190 --> 05:26:42.200 align:start position:0%
my example because my town is on that
 
05:26:44.708 --> 05:26:44.718 align:start position:0%
list and it reminded me that I was aware
 
05:26:46.990 --> 05:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
when we made those initial Investments
 
05:26:49.030 --> 05:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
we were kind of early to make those
 
05:26:51.390 --> 05:26:51.400 align:start position:0%
conversions but the savings have been
 
05:26:54.190 --> 05:26:54.200 align:start position:0%
significant so who gets those savings
 
05:26:56.270 --> 05:26:56.280 align:start position:0%
everybody it doesn't you know we all
 
05:26:58.230 --> 05:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
have electric bills and we need
 
05:27:00.310 --> 05:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
mechanisms in order
 
05:27:03.990 --> 05:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
to uh you know make stuff happen right
 
05:27:06.590 --> 05:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't have another way
 
05:27:10.070 --> 05:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
to never mind won go into all that but
 
05:27:13.270 --> 05:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
but I guess my point is it's not just uh
 
05:27:16.750 --> 05:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
one for one that somebody invests in
 
05:27:19.150 --> 05:27:19.160 align:start position:0%
something here and then somebody else
 
05:27:21.390 --> 05:27:21.400 align:start position:0%
gets stuff taken out of their pocket
 
05:27:23.670 --> 05:27:23.680 align:start position:0%
there's also somebody invests in
 
05:27:26.150 --> 05:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
something here that lowers costs which
 
05:27:28.270 --> 05:27:28.280 align:start position:0%
means that also affects people in the
 
05:27:30.350 --> 05:27:30.360 align:start position:0%
positive the same way so the argument
 
05:27:31.470 --> 05:27:31.480 align:start position:0%
goes both
 
05:27:34.070 --> 05:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
ways I think representative Harrington
 
05:27:35.830 --> 05:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
was talking specifically about
 
05:27:39.150 --> 05:27:39.160 align:start position:0%
electricity costs but
 
05:27:39.160 --> 05:27:40.030 align:start position:0%
electricity costs but
his

05:27:40.030 --> 05:27:40.040 align:start position:0%
his
 
05:27:43.110 --> 05:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
point okay further
 
05:27:45.750 --> 05:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
05:27:47.788 --> 05:27:47.798 align:start position:0%
Kaplan thank you yeah I just wanted to
 
05:27:50.270 --> 05:27:50.280 align:start position:0%
add that it might not be you know gerain
 
05:27:51.350 --> 05:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
to the electricity bills but it
 
05:27:53.110 --> 05:27:53.120 align:start position:0%
certainly is gerain to property taxes in
 
05:27:54.948 --> 05:27:54.958 align:start position:0%
the towns that have taken advantage of
 
05:27:56.990 --> 05:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
these projects so I mean that's as
 
05:27:59.230 --> 05:27:59.240 align:start position:0%
representative McGee said money is money
 
05:28:01.470 --> 05:28:01.480 align:start position:0%
but U the point I want I actual point I
 
05:28:04.270 --> 05:28:04.280 align:start position:0%
want to make is um on class two
 
05:28:05.990 --> 05:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
eliminating class two I know that you
 
05:28:07.270 --> 05:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
know there's not enough re being
 
05:28:09.350 --> 05:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
generated in class if any Rex generated
 
05:28:11.788 --> 05:28:11.798 align:start position:0%
being in class 2 but what effect will
 
05:28:13.948 --> 05:28:13.958 align:start position:0%
eliminating the entire class have I I'm
 
05:28:17.030 --> 05:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
not sure we at least I don't have a good
 
05:28:19.788 --> 05:28:19.798 align:start position:0%
handle on that in terms of going forward
 
05:28:21.750 --> 05:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
are there businesses that would seek to
 
05:28:23.270 --> 05:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
make those kind of investments in this
 
05:28:25.310 --> 05:28:25.320 align:start position:0%
state and are we cutting ourselves off
 
05:28:26.868 --> 05:28:26.878 align:start position:0%
from those opportunities I'd just like
 
05:28:29.030 --> 05:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
to have some more information on
 
05:28:31.590 --> 05:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
that so a lot of
 
05:28:33.830 --> 05:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
class what would have been class two
 
05:28:35.910 --> 05:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
recks are now claimed in class one
 
05:28:38.548 --> 05:28:38.558 align:start position:0%
because class one also allows
 
05:28:43.070 --> 05:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
new uh resources to be identified as
 
05:28:45.750 --> 05:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
class one instead of class two so since
 
05:28:49.070 --> 05:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
class two is is essentially saturated a
 
05:28:52.788 --> 05:28:52.798 align:start position:0%
lot of new solar wrecks are actually
 
05:28:55.708 --> 05:28:55.718 align:start position:0%
qualifying for class one so it's not
 
05:28:58.910 --> 05:28:58.920 align:start position:0%
going to harm those new resources or
 
05:29:02.230 --> 05:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
prevent them from taking advantage of
 
05:29:06.230 --> 05:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:09.030 --> 05:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
standard all right seeing no further
 
05:29:11.190 --> 05:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
discussion since we do have a motion on
 
05:29:12.830 --> 05:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
the floor I'm going ask the clerk to
 
05:29:17.030 --> 05:29:17.040 align:start position:0%

FN any further discussion
 
05:31:00.788 --> 05:31:00.798 align:start position:0%
needed representative McGee thank you Mr
 
05:31:02.628 --> 05:31:02.638 align:start position:0%
chairman um the only thing I'd like to
 
05:31:06.708 --> 05:31:06.718 align:start position:0%
say is on the class two um I understand
 
05:31:10.110 --> 05:31:10.120 align:start position:0%
that new solar projects would
 
05:31:12.430 --> 05:31:12.440 align:start position:0%
potentially be eligible under class one
 
05:31:15.190 --> 05:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
but I'm concerned about people who are

05:33:56.430 --> 05:33:56.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:34:00.548 --> 05:34:00.558 align:start position:0%
week next week we will meet on
 
05:34:03.948 --> 05:34:03.958 align:start position:0%
Monday the 10th of March but we will not
 
05:34:06.990 --> 05:34:07.000 align:start position:0%
meet on Tuesday the 11th Tuesday the
 
05:34:11.510 --> 05:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
11th is 10 town meeting day and
 
05:34:14.788 --> 05:34:14.798 align:start position:0%
the speaker of the house has basically
 
05:34:16.910 --> 05:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
said we're shutting down the state house
 
05:34:19.110 --> 05:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
that day so please don't schedule any
 
05:34:22.070 --> 05:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
meetings for town meeting day so we will
 
05:34:25.868 --> 05:34:25.878 align:start position:0%
not do any session on March 11th but we
 
05:34:29.230 --> 05:34:29.240 align:start position:0%
will do an executive session on on the
 
05:34:33.230 --> 05:34:33.240 align:start position:0%
10th we will have 11 bills remaining
 
05:34:36.310 --> 05:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
after we finish our work tomorrow
 
05:34:38.590 --> 05:34:38.600 align:start position:0%
afternoon so
 
05:34:41.070 --> 05:34:41.080 align:start position:0%
whether we'll do all 11 on the 10th or
 
05:34:44.868 --> 05:34:44.878 align:start position:0%
not uh I haven't decided yet we probably
 
05:34:46.470 --> 05:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
will do them all even though it'll be a
 
05:34:50.470 --> 05:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
long day um because we have to be done
 
05:34:54.350 --> 05:34:54.360 align:start position:0%
by March 20th so we're getting kind of
 
05:34:56.230 --> 05:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
close by March 10th so we'll probably do
 
05:34:58.310 --> 05:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
them all on March 10th but there is a
 
05:35:00.750 --> 05:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
possibility we might go to the following
 
05:35:03.110 --> 05:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
Monday which would be the 17th are these
 
05:35:05.510 --> 05:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
bills that have had hearings or haven't
 
05:35:07.070 --> 05:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
every bill at this point has had a
 
05:35:07.080 --> 05:35:08.510 align:start position:0%
every bill at this point has had a
hearing

05:35:08.510 --> 05:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
05:35:11.310 --> 05:35:11.320 align:start position:0%
we have no more bills to hear we now we
 
05:35:15.270 --> 05:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
just need to make a decision on bills so
 
05:35:16.868 --> 05:35:16.878 align:start position:0%
we've got a lot of important bills ahead
 
05:35:19.910 --> 05:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
of us we've got House Bill 760 House
 
05:35:19.920 --> 05:35:21.270 align:start position:0%
of us we've got House Bill 760 House
Bill

05:35:21.270 --> 05:35:21.280 align:start position:0%

755
 
05:35:25.868 --> 05:35:25.878 align:start position:0%
um other numbers that don't jump right
 
05:35:28.270 --> 05:35:28.280 align:start position:0%
out at me but there are quite a few
 
05:35:29.948 --> 05:35:29.958 align:start position:0%
significant bills that we still have to
 
05:35:32.350 --> 05:35:32.360 align:start position:0%
deal with so we will have a work session
 
05:35:34.708 --> 05:35:34.718 align:start position:0%
on the 10th followed by an exec session
 
05:35:37.430 --> 05:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
it'll be a long day probably so plan on
 
05:35:40.470 --> 05:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
being being here probably till 5: on
 
05:35:42.110 --> 05:35:42.120 align:start position:0%

uh I'm just going to re recap what I
 
05:48:59.910 --> 05:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
believe the key issue is which is
 
05:48:59.920 --> 05:49:01.788 align:start position:0%
believe the key issue is which is
um

05:49:01.788 --> 05:49:01.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:49:05.230 --> 05:49:05.240 align:start position:0%
because certain Services of the
 
05:49:08.468 --> 05:49:08.478 align:start position:0%
associations are built build to a
 
05:49:11.350 --> 05:49:11.360 align:start position:0%
business address they are build at a
 
05:49:13.670 --> 05:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
commercial rate rather than a
 
05:49:17.708 --> 05:49:17.718 align:start position:0%
residential rate yet those services are
 
05:49:21.270 --> 05:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
services that typically would be uh if
 
05:49:22.390 --> 05:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
in a
 
05:49:25.868 --> 05:49:25.878 align:start position:0%
homeowners uh property would be build at
 
05:49:28.948 --> 05:49:28.958 align:start position:0%
a residential rate so a well Septic
 
05:49:33.070 --> 05:49:33.080 align:start position:0%
System Sprinklers for your garden uh
 
05:49:36.150 --> 05:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
washing dryer machine if was in a in a
 
05:49:38.510 --> 05:49:38.520 align:start position:0%
sub integreated facility those normally
 
05:49:40.788 --> 05:49:40.798 align:start position:0%
would would be homeowners or
 
05:49:43.270 --> 05:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
expenses they' all be build residential
 
05:49:46.830 --> 05:49:46.840 align:start position:0%
rate not a commercial right and uh we
 
05:49:49.270 --> 05:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
have three bills that essentially are
 
05:49:53.590 --> 05:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
focusing on that same common subject um
 
05:49:56.430 --> 05:49:56.440 align:start position:0%
so uh the purpose of the subcommittee is
 
05:49:56.440 --> 05:49:57.430 align:start position:0%
so uh the purpose of the subcommittee is
to

05:49:57.430 --> 05:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:50:01.990 --> 05:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
evaluate what action um can or should be
 
05:50:04.750 --> 05:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
taken on on this
 
05:50:07.390 --> 05:50:07.400 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to
 
05:50:11.390 --> 05:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
uh start with uh
 
05:50:14.070 --> 05:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
one potential modest proposal and there
 
05:50:15.310 --> 05:50:15.320 align:start position:0%
are others
 
05:50:15.320 --> 05:50:17.030 align:start position:0%
are others
here

05:50:17.030 --> 05:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:50:20.708 --> 05:50:20.718 align:start position:0%
um one proposal would be having someone
 
05:50:24.830 --> 05:50:24.840 align:start position:0%
named in the in the uh
 
05:50:29.390 --> 05:50:29.400 align:start position:0%
Association as a named uh physical
 
05:50:32.788 --> 05:50:32.798 align:start position:0%
person to have that bill show
 
05:50:35.030 --> 05:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
up in their
 
05:50:37.230 --> 05:50:37.240 align:start position:0%
name um
 
05:50:39.830 --> 05:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
that would then automatically by the way
 
05:50:42.948 --> 05:50:42.958 align:start position:0%
utilities Bill be built at a residential
 
05:50:45.390 --> 05:50:45.400 align:start position:0%
rate rather than a commercial rate
 
05:50:47.510 --> 05:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
because it's not a business
 
05:50:51.548 --> 05:50:51.558 align:start position:0%
name that that is the biggest objection
 
05:50:56.190 --> 05:50:56.200 align:start position:0%
from the uh utilities about uh um in
 
05:50:58.670 --> 05:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
dealing with this issue if if they are
 
05:51:02.030 --> 05:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
required to sort through and
 
05:51:02.040 --> 05:51:03.590 align:start position:0%
required to sort through and
identify

05:51:03.590 --> 05:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
identify
 
05:51:06.750 --> 05:51:06.760 align:start position:0%
commercial business names that now need
 
05:51:09.468 --> 05:51:09.478 align:start position:0%
to be built at a residential rate that
 
05:51:11.708 --> 05:51:11.718 align:start position:0%
that that's a major
 
05:51:15.510 --> 05:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
software program or billing program
 
05:51:17.548 --> 05:51:17.558 align:start position:0%
reconstruction that is going to cost
 
05:51:22.030 --> 05:51:22.040 align:start position:0%
them a lot of money um and we hear that
 
05:51:25.350 --> 05:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
every time we pass legislation that
 
05:51:28.948 --> 05:51:28.958 align:start position:0%
tries to influence um anything that
 
05:51:31.350 --> 05:51:31.360 align:start position:0%
impacts billing
 
05:51:36.150 --> 05:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
so um to do such I've asked whether the
 
05:51:39.750 --> 05:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
department energy could be a named party
 
05:51:43.708 --> 05:51:43.718 align:start position:0%
to send out such a letter to all
 
05:51:46.910 --> 05:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
associations they've been lukewarm on
 
05:51:46.920 --> 05:51:47.750 align:start position:0%
associations they've been lukewarm on
that

05:51:47.750 --> 05:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:51:51.830 --> 05:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
proposal um but they they could do that
 
05:51:56.350 --> 05:51:56.360 align:start position:0%
and we have a list or a list of
 
05:51:59.590 --> 05:51:59.600 align:start position:0%
501c4 entities could be generated that
 
05:52:03.270 --> 05:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't name those entities that are not
 
05:52:05.468 --> 05:52:05.478 align:start position:0%
registered with the Secretary of State
 
05:52:07.190 --> 05:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
there are about a 100 that are with the
 
05:52:08.310 --> 05:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
secretary of
 
05:52:11.310 --> 05:52:11.320 align:start position:0%
state so with that
 
05:52:14.190 --> 05:52:14.200 align:start position:0%
I'm acknowledge representative Corman
 
05:52:18.190 --> 05:52:18.200 align:start position:0%
who has uh some words to offer to this
 
05:52:21.750 --> 05:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
session and a another potential
 
05:52:23.948 --> 05:52:23.958 align:start position:0%
alternative thank you representative
 
05:52:26.030 --> 05:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
bernardy am I supposed to call you Mr
 
05:52:27.350 --> 05:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
chairman no okay thank you
 
05:52:29.430 --> 05:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
representative bernardy so you don't
 
05:52:32.310 --> 05:52:32.320 align:start position:0%
have a gavel so I have nothing
 
05:52:36.948 --> 05:52:36.958 align:start position:0%
here yeah so uh just to to give um
 
05:52:39.350 --> 05:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh where where I feel like we're at
 
05:52:43.788 --> 05:52:43.798 align:start position:0%
we're really talking about well and or
 
05:52:46.350 --> 05:52:46.360 align:start position:0%
septic meters so electric meters for
 
05:52:47.350 --> 05:52:47.360 align:start position:0%
well or
 
05:52:51.628 --> 05:52:51.638 align:start position:0%
septic that are in homeowners
 
05:52:54.628 --> 05:52:54.638 align:start position:0%
associations where they are
 
05:52:59.270 --> 05:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
shared by more than one unit so it's
 
05:53:00.830 --> 05:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
really just well in septic that we're
 
05:53:02.270 --> 05:53:02.280 align:start position:0%
trying to talk about with these bills I
 
05:53:05.150 --> 05:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
know you mentioned a few other things um
 
05:53:07.030 --> 05:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
these bills are
 
05:53:08.990 --> 05:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
this this concept went to the Commerce
 
05:53:11.628 --> 05:53:11.638 align:start position:0%
Committee last year and there was all
 
05:53:14.590 --> 05:53:14.600 align:start position:0%
sorts of push back on anything that
 
05:53:16.430 --> 05:53:16.440 align:start position:0%
could be considered a common area like a
 
05:53:19.110 --> 05:53:19.120 align:start position:0%
sprinkler so it so that's that's why
 
05:53:21.510 --> 05:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
we've tried to restrict it to just
 
05:53:23.510 --> 05:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
shared well shared septic that are
 
05:53:27.788 --> 05:53:27.798 align:start position:0%
serving only residential units so as you
 
05:53:29.788 --> 05:53:29.798 align:start position:0%
identified there were there were two
 
05:53:33.548 --> 05:53:33.558 align:start position:0%
related issues here one being because
 
05:53:36.868 --> 05:53:36.878 align:start position:0%
the bill is going to the HOA
 
05:53:40.190 --> 05:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
it's being built at a commercial rate
 
05:53:43.708 --> 05:53:43.718 align:start position:0%
even though the use is 100% residential
 
05:53:47.948 --> 05:53:47.958 align:start position:0%
by 100% residential units and then the
 
05:53:51.548 --> 05:53:51.558 align:start position:0%
other issue is how it's actually paid
 
05:53:55.510 --> 05:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
for because when it's build to the HOA
 
05:53:59.788 --> 05:53:59.798 align:start position:0%
the HOA builds all the units so that
 
05:54:02.230 --> 05:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
people who are not on the shared well
 
05:54:05.468 --> 05:54:05.478 align:start position:0%
and septic are actually paying a part of
 
05:54:08.190 --> 05:54:08.200 align:start position:0%
the bill for the shared well and
 
05:54:10.990 --> 05:54:11.000 align:start position:0%
septic so that's that's what we're what
 
05:54:13.110 --> 05:54:13.120 align:start position:0%
we're trying to deal with is have just
 
05:54:14.948 --> 05:54:14.958 align:start position:0%
the units with the shared well and
 
05:54:17.070 --> 05:54:17.080 align:start position:0%
septic pay for the shared well and
 
05:54:20.670 --> 05:54:20.680 align:start position:0%
septic and not have it spread across the
 
05:54:23.270 --> 05:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
entire uh
 
05:54:25.270 --> 05:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
condominium okay so th those are the
 
05:54:29.230 --> 05:54:29.240 align:start position:0%
issues um I know that one of the
 
05:54:32.110 --> 05:54:32.120 align:start position:0%
Condominiums involved uh has Unitil as
 
05:54:34.230 --> 05:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
their supplier they've tried to work
 
05:54:37.590 --> 05:54:37.600 align:start position:0%
with Unitil to get this dealt with and
 
05:54:38.948 --> 05:54:38.958 align:start position:0%
that they haven't gotten anywhere with
 
05:54:41.948 --> 05:54:41.958 align:start position:0%
it which is why they have asked for a
 
05:54:41.958 --> 05:54:43.590 align:start position:0%
it which is why they have asked for a
legislative

05:54:43.590 --> 05:54:43.600 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
05:54:47.948 --> 05:54:47.958 align:start position:0%
solution so I did uh I I have offered an
 
05:54:50.310 --> 05:54:50.320 align:start position:0%
amendment um that I worked on with
 
05:54:53.190 --> 05:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
representative Manos the prime sponsor
 
05:54:55.548 --> 05:54:55.558 align:start position:0%
of these three bills uh she and I worked
 
05:54:57.510 --> 05:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
on this amendment and I can go through
 
05:55:00.670 --> 05:55:00.680 align:start position:0%
it whenever you'd like me
 
05:55:06.910 --> 05:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:11.190 --> 05:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
um I think that's fine I I I know uh Mr
 
05:55:16.548 --> 05:55:16.558 align:start position:0%
sweat is here who can also offer us some
 
05:55:18.468 --> 05:55:18.478 align:start position:0%
uh information about costing
 
05:55:20.310 --> 05:55:20.320 align:start position:0%
differentials and what they really mean
 
05:55:24.350 --> 05:55:24.360 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to acknowledge uh Mr sweat
 
05:55:28.390 --> 05:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
to um just quickly review that and you
 
05:55:29.788 --> 05:55:29.798 align:start position:0%
provided us with a package of
 
05:55:29.798 --> 05:55:37.830 align:start position:0%
provided us with a package of
information

05:55:37.830 --> 05:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:39.750 --> 05:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much I would like to
 
05:55:44.270 --> 05:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
point out that in both the Tariff
 
05:55:47.230 --> 05:55:47.240 align:start position:0%
regulations Schedule D and schedule
 
05:55:51.390 --> 05:55:51.400 align:start position:0%
G2 it does not reference uh at all the
 
05:55:53.590 --> 05:55:53.600 align:start position:0%
bu where you're bilding to it talks
 
05:55:58.190 --> 05:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
about domestic use and non-domestic use
 
05:56:00.270 --> 05:56:00.280 align:start position:0%
and those are the two criteria that
 
05:56:02.270 --> 05:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
we're really talking about in the
 
05:56:04.430 --> 05:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
tariffs there is really nothing about
 
05:56:08.150 --> 05:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
shared meters or how you Bill it or
 
05:56:10.510 --> 05:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
anything like that it's domestic or
 
05:56:13.750 --> 05:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
non-domestic use it's the purpose of the
 
05:56:16.110 --> 05:56:16.120 align:start position:0%
electricity okay let's get on to what I
 
05:56:18.230 --> 05:56:18.240 align:start position:0%
handed out I think the most important
 
05:56:22.070 --> 05:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
thing is on page two and if you look at
 
05:56:26.430 --> 05:56:26.440 align:start position:0%
this there are columns and these are
 
05:56:29.468 --> 05:56:29.478 align:start position:0%
household units 25 Vineyards seven
 
05:56:32.830 --> 05:56:32.840 align:start position:0%
Woodside and two Vineyard and it shows
 
05:56:36.390 --> 05:56:36.400 align:start position:0%
under the G2 rates the electric power
 
05:56:38.548 --> 05:56:38.558 align:start position:0%
the electric charges for these rates and
 
05:56:41.990 --> 05:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
these are the delivery cost only uh down
 
05:56:44.788 --> 05:56:44.798 align:start position:0%
to said down to Total delivery charge
 
05:56:47.590 --> 05:56:47.600 align:start position:0%
the supplier charge once again is a
 
05:56:50.628 --> 05:56:50.638 align:start position:0%
Marketplace charge we have 19 people
 
05:56:54.910 --> 05:56:54.920 align:start position:0%
competing for uh suppliers the the uh
 
05:56:57.830 --> 05:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
delivery charge is a franchise and
 
05:57:00.548 --> 05:57:00.558 align:start position:0%
really it's the responsibility of the
 
05:57:03.830 --> 05:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
franchise holder to properly assign to
 
05:57:06.270 --> 05:57:06.280 align:start position:0%
properly assign the Tariff rates for
 
05:57:08.350 --> 05:57:08.360 align:start position:0%
what use it is either domestic or
 
05:57:10.788 --> 05:57:10.798 align:start position:0%
non-domestic anyway if you get down to
 
05:57:12.910 --> 05:57:12.920 align:start position:0%
the very bottom line where it says total
 
05:57:16.910 --> 05:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
build you'll see for 25 Vineyard it's
 
05:57:19.590 --> 05:57:19.600 align:start position:0%
$515 that's an actual billing and it's
 
05:57:21.868 --> 05:57:21.878 align:start position:0%
included in your package if you go over
 
05:57:23.548 --> 05:57:23.558 align:start position:0%
to the right under the
 
05:57:26.868 --> 05:57:26.878 align:start position:0%
d25 the total bill if it were a consumer
 
05:57:28.390 --> 05:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
rate is
 
05:57:30.670 --> 05:57:30.680 align:start position:0%
$302 and you can see this for the
 
05:57:35.590 --> 05:57:35.600 align:start position:0%
Woodside also and for the uh uh Woodside
 
05:57:38.390 --> 05:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
and the two Vineyard the main charges
 
05:57:41.350 --> 05:57:41.360 align:start position:0%
are really in the customer charge where
 
05:57:43.948 --> 05:57:43.958 align:start position:0%
the domest where the uh commercial rate
 
05:57:43.958 --> 05:57:45.628 align:start position:0%
the domest where the uh commercial rate
is

05:57:45.628 --> 05:57:45.638 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:57:50.628 --> 05:57:50.638 align:start position:0%
$29.19 per meter the domestic rate is
 
05:57:53.670 --> 05:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
$16.22 per meter there is a demand
 
05:57:58.628 --> 05:57:58.638 align:start position:0%
charge for the uh commercial rate of
 
05:58:02.670 --> 05:58:02.680 align:start position:0%
$12.13 that demand charge is required
 
05:58:06.390 --> 05:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
for one kilowatt hour if you you use
 
05:58:09.230 --> 05:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
less than 1 kilowatt hour you would be
 
05:58:12.190 --> 05:58:12.200 align:start position:0%
still charged for a full kilowatt hour
 
05:58:14.670 --> 05:58:14.680 align:start position:0%
if you go up under the G2 section where
 
05:58:17.190 --> 05:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
it says meter demand and you see under
 
05:58:19.670 --> 05:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
25 Vineyard they didn't use a full
 
05:58:21.788 --> 05:58:21.798 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour but they were charged a
 
05:58:24.070 --> 05:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
full kilowatt hour if you go to seven
 
05:58:25.868 --> 05:58:25.878 align:start position:0%
Woods side they did not use a full
 
05:58:28.070 --> 05:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour they were charged a full
 
05:58:31.468 --> 05:58:31.478 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour so those are the two areas
 
05:58:34.708 --> 05:58:34.718 align:start position:0%
where the main charges are the uh demand
 
05:58:36.910 --> 05:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
charge and the meter charge those two
 
05:58:40.670 --> 05:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
areas they are delivery charges and that
 
05:58:43.350 --> 05:58:43.360 align:start position:0%
is where the major discrepancy is now
 
05:58:47.190 --> 05:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
eversource estimates that 600 kilowatt
 
05:58:49.430 --> 05:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
hours is what a residential customer
 
05:58:52.070 --> 05:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
uses I mean we are talking about if you
 
05:58:54.510 --> 05:58:54.520 align:start position:0%
look at the top here the kilowatt hours
 
05:58:58.628 --> 05:58:58.638 align:start position:0%
used for the septic system is 82 33 and
 
05:59:01.948 --> 05:59:01.958 align:start position:0%
40 for a billing period the average
 
05:59:04.230 --> 05:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours used in a building power
 
05:59:07.350 --> 05:59:07.360 align:start position:0%
period for the septic is 64 kilowatt
 
05:59:10.670 --> 05:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
hours not even close to 600 kilowatt
 
05:59:14.628 --> 05:59:14.638 align:start position:0%
hours and if you have look for uh if if
 
05:59:16.868 --> 05:59:16.878 align:start position:0%
this was going to be a commercial rate
 
05:59:18.990 --> 05:59:19.000 align:start position:0%
those kilowatt hours would be
 
05:59:21.590 --> 05:59:21.600 align:start position:0%
substantially more than what they are
 
05:59:24.910 --> 05:59:24.920 align:start position:0%
what they are now these the rate has not
 
05:59:28.948 --> 05:59:28.958 align:start position:0%
been properly assigned for this purpose
 
05:59:31.670 --> 05:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
domestic or non-domestic I would also
 
05:59:34.510 --> 05:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
say that every source which said they
 
05:59:36.708 --> 05:59:36.718 align:start position:0%
don't have the resources to to do this
 
05:59:40.990 --> 05:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
Rivers Source had revenues in 2024 of
 
05:59:44.910 --> 05:59:44.920 align:start position:0%
close of $1.9 million and paid a
 
05:59:48.510 --> 05:59:48.520 align:start position:0%
dividend of roughly 4% I would think a
 
05:59:50.310 --> 05:59:50.320 align:start position:0%
company like that does have the
 
05:59:52.948 --> 05:59:52.958 align:start position:0%
capability and the resources to come up
 
05:59:54.430 --> 05:59:54.440 align:start position:0%
with a plan where they could
 
05:59:54.440 --> 05:59:56.270 align:start position:0%
with a plan where they could
differentiate

05:59:56.270 --> 05:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
differentiate
 
05:59:59.350 --> 05:59:59.360 align:start position:0%
between uh uh the residential and
 
06:00:01.270 --> 06:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
domestic customers and this is a very
 
06:00:04.030 --> 06:00:04.040 align:start position:0%
limited one it's limited to septic it's
 
06:00:07.510 --> 06:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
limited to pump water and uh I think
 
06:00:12.390 --> 06:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
it's quite doable thank you thank
 
06:00:15.910 --> 06:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
you does anyone else have uh comments
 
06:00:19.030 --> 06:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
they would like to make before this
 
06:00:19.040 --> 06:00:27.110 align:start position:0%
they would like to make before this
subcommittee

06:00:27.110 --> 06:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:29.430 --> 06:00:29.440 align:start position:0%

hundreds more in in Massachusetts I'm

06:01:11.628 --> 06:01:11.638 align:start position:0%
England we look at this from a legal
 
06:01:14.150 --> 06:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
perspective uh of course
 
06:01:17.430 --> 06:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
and the proposed uh
 
06:01:21.468 --> 06:01:21.478 align:start position:0%
Amendment um to the statute that is 356b
 
06:01:22.750 --> 06:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
talking about section
 
06:01:26.350 --> 06:01:26.360 align:start position:0%
45 uh we you know as a practitioner
 
06:01:29.070 --> 06:01:29.080 align:start position:0%
support this amendment it'll it assigns
 
06:01:31.590 --> 06:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
a residential rate for these limited
 
06:01:34.190 --> 06:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
purposes of the septic and Wells to
 
06:01:36.590 --> 06:01:36.600 align:start position:0%
residential Condominiums um and it does
 
06:01:38.350 --> 06:01:38.360 align:start position:0%
it in an equitable manner wherein the
 
06:01:41.468 --> 06:01:41.478 align:start position:0%
units that utilize those Services pay
 
06:01:43.708 --> 06:01:43.718 align:start position:0%
for those Services which is consistent
 
06:01:45.350 --> 06:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
with the the overall framework of the
 
06:01:48.110 --> 06:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
condominium statute so
 
06:01:50.430 --> 06:01:50.440 align:start position:0%
um which is the the current existing
 
06:01:52.910 --> 06:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
section 40 section 45 sub paragraphs 2
 
06:01:55.110 --> 06:01:55.120 align:start position:0%
and three I'm happy to address the
 
06:01:58.430 --> 06:01:58.440 align:start position:0%
specifics of those sections um but one
 
06:02:00.830 --> 06:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
of the difficulties I would suggest that
 
06:02:02.468 --> 06:02:02.478 align:start position:0%
that I see as a practitioner in this
 
06:02:04.868 --> 06:02:04.878 align:start position:0%
area is finding uh and addressing
 
06:02:06.868 --> 06:02:06.878 align:start position:0%
solutions that are Equitable and fair
 
06:02:09.350 --> 06:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
where for some reason one unit owner is
 
06:02:11.070 --> 06:02:11.080 align:start position:0%
being charged an amount for which they
 
06:02:13.270 --> 06:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
receive no benefit in this proposed
 
06:02:15.310 --> 06:02:15.320 align:start position:0%
legislation seeks to remedy that at
 
06:02:21.110 --> 06:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:25.230 --> 06:02:25.240 align:start position:0%
Dynamic so um thank you thank thank you
 
06:02:28.590 --> 06:02:28.600 align:start position:0%
for coming uh I just want to make sure
 
06:02:31.070 --> 06:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
that we all
 
06:02:34.510 --> 06:02:34.520 align:start position:0%
understand what it is that currently
 
06:02:36.510 --> 06:02:36.520 align:start position:0%
could inhibit
 
06:02:38.750 --> 06:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
a condo association an
 
06:02:42.430 --> 06:02:42.440 align:start position:0%
HOA from doing the type of billing that
 
06:02:44.110 --> 06:02:44.120 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here where where the
 
06:02:46.390 --> 06:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
chargeback would be divided among the
 
06:02:48.548 --> 06:02:48.558 align:start position:0%
various units
 
06:02:51.590 --> 06:02:51.600 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is that it depends
 
06:02:54.070 --> 06:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
on how what What's called the
 
06:02:58.150 --> 06:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
condominium instruments in uh 356b call
 
06:03:01.708 --> 06:03:01.718 align:start position:0%
45 and in paragraph two of the existing
 
06:03:03.868 --> 06:03:03.878 align:start position:0%
law it says to the extent that the
 
06:03:06.270 --> 06:03:06.280 align:start position:0%
condominium instruments Express so
 
06:03:10.548 --> 06:03:10.558 align:start position:0%
provide and then it goes on so if the
 
06:03:12.468 --> 06:03:12.478 align:start position:0%
the condominium instruments don't
 
06:03:14.270 --> 06:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
provide for that then they don't have
 
06:03:16.510 --> 06:03:16.520 align:start position:0%
the ability to do this charge back is
 
06:03:19.150 --> 06:03:19.160 align:start position:0%
that correct so let's let's break that
 
06:03:21.510 --> 06:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
down a little bit so under section under
 
06:03:24.510 --> 06:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph two of section 45 it says that
 
06:03:26.590 --> 06:03:26.600 align:start position:0%
the condominium instruments have the
 
06:03:28.030 --> 06:03:28.040 align:start position:0%
authority so this be the Declaration of
 
06:03:29.948 --> 06:03:29.958 align:start position:0%
condominium and the bylaws could in
 
06:03:33.390 --> 06:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
theory charge back to the unit owners
 
06:03:35.110 --> 06:03:35.120 align:start position:0%
that portion here the the well and
 
06:03:38.670 --> 06:03:38.680 align:start position:0%
septic to those units that receive that
 
06:03:41.868 --> 06:03:41.878 align:start position:0%
benefit it has to be stated in the
 
06:03:44.510 --> 06:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
condominium instruments if it is not
 
06:03:46.390 --> 06:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
then we look at paragraph three which
 
06:03:49.430 --> 06:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
says all these charges shall be assessed
 
06:03:52.030 --> 06:03:52.040 align:start position:0%
to all unit owners so we have to look at
 
06:03:53.868 --> 06:03:53.878 align:start position:0%
this in both context paragraph two
 
06:03:56.270 --> 06:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
creates the possibility but it then
 
06:03:57.948 --> 06:03:57.958 align:start position:0%
defers to the governing documents for
 
06:04:00.310 --> 06:04:00.320 align:start position:0%
the association if the drafter of the
 
06:04:03.628 --> 06:04:03.638 align:start position:0%
instruments did not contemplate this or
 
06:04:05.948 --> 06:04:05.958 align:start position:0%
wasn't thorough then you the def fault
 
06:04:07.990 --> 06:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
to paragraph 3 which would kick in which
 
06:04:10.190 --> 06:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
says that all unit owners are paying for
 
06:04:16.110 --> 06:04:16.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:37.070 --> 06:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:39.350 --> 06:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
thank you m committee members my name is
 
06:04:42.868 --> 06:04:42.878 align:start position:0%
Zoe Manos I represent stratum which is
 
06:04:45.230 --> 06:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
where The Vineyards is located and where
 
06:04:47.990 --> 06:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
dick sweat lives I wanted to just
 
06:04:51.510 --> 06:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
address the issue of uh the proposed
 
06:04:54.468 --> 06:04:54.478 align:start position:0%
solution of the meter simply being put
 
06:04:58.230 --> 06:04:58.240 align:start position:0%
in the name of individual homeowners um
 
06:05:00.270 --> 06:05:00.280 align:start position:0%
I think that that's not a practical
 
06:05:03.430 --> 06:05:03.440 align:start position:0%
solution um I believe that The Vineyards
 
06:05:08.270 --> 06:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
tried to do that with um with Unitil and
 
06:05:11.150 --> 06:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
uh Unitil refused to do that but I think
 
06:05:14.750 --> 06:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
even beyond that even if the meter um
 
06:05:18.628 --> 06:05:18.638 align:start position:0%
were in the name of the of individual uh
 
06:05:21.030 --> 06:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
individual unit owner you would still
 
06:05:24.430 --> 06:05:24.440 align:start position:0%
have the problem of two
 
06:05:28.788 --> 06:05:28.798 align:start position:0%
units uh I believe Unitil was also
 
06:05:31.788 --> 06:05:31.798 align:start position:0%
further not willing to if two units were
 
06:05:34.270 --> 06:05:34.280 align:start position:0%
sharing one meter to put it in the name
 
06:05:38.350 --> 06:05:38.360 align:start position:0%
of both Bob Smith and Clara Jones they
 
06:05:40.548 --> 06:05:40.558 align:start position:0%
wanted it in the name of one or the
 
06:05:43.110 --> 06:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
other but in either case you would have
 
06:05:46.110 --> 06:05:46.120 align:start position:0%
the problem of then two unit owners
 
06:05:49.830 --> 06:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
potentially squabbling over who owes
 
06:05:52.670 --> 06:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
what is the bill paid is the bill not
 
06:05:56.150 --> 06:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
paid etc etc and I think that that's a
 
06:05:59.468 --> 06:05:59.478 align:start position:0%
pretty predictable situation that would
 
06:06:03.990 --> 06:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
arise and in addition at The Vineyards
 
06:06:06.708 --> 06:06:06.718 align:start position:0%
specifically I think there are 22 if I
 
06:06:09.750 --> 06:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
remember correctly 22 paired meters so
 
06:06:12.070 --> 06:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
you would then have
 
06:06:12.080 --> 06:06:13.590 align:start position:0%
you would then have
22

06:06:13.590 --> 06:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
22
 
06:06:16.190 --> 06:06:16.200 align:start position:0%
possible a deterioration in
 
06:06:20.230 --> 06:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
relationships and unpaid bills and Etc
 
06:06:22.910 --> 06:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
so I don't think that that's a uh
 
06:06:25.708 --> 06:06:25.718 align:start position:0%
realistic solution and that's another
 
06:06:29.430 --> 06:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
reason that the legislation is needed to
 
06:06:33.468 --> 06:06:33.478 align:start position:0%
address this problem thank
 
06:06:38.230 --> 06:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:39.468 --> 06:06:39.478 align:start position:0%
yeah and and to add to what
 
06:06:41.190 --> 06:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
representative Manos said you know I'm
 
06:06:43.390 --> 06:06:43.400 align:start position:0%
thinking of a situation where um you
 
06:06:45.030 --> 06:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
know again we have two units let's say A
 
06:06:48.430 --> 06:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
and B A is the uh the address that the
 
06:06:52.468 --> 06:06:52.478 align:start position:0%
bill goes to a moves out C moves into
 
06:06:55.468 --> 06:06:55.478 align:start position:0%
where a was and C doesn't want to be the
 
06:06:58.270 --> 06:06:58.280 align:start position:0%
record holder uh you I just I just feel
 
06:07:01.230 --> 06:07:01.240 align:start position:0%
like this is um there could be all sorts
 
06:07:04.230 --> 06:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
of sticky situations that can engender
 
06:07:04.240 --> 06:07:19.070 align:start position:0%
of sticky situations that can engender
animosity

06:07:19.070 --> 06:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:22.468 --> 06:07:22.478 align:start position:0%
yes thank you everybody has a copy
 
06:07:25.708 --> 06:07:25.718 align:start position:0%
and the draft Amendment yeah you get a
 
06:07:25.718 --> 06:07:43.190 align:start position:0%
and the draft Amendment yeah you get a
copy

06:07:43.190 --> 06:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:46.110 --> 06:07:46.120 align:start position:0%
all right yeah so okay thank you so this
 
06:07:49.628 --> 06:07:49.638 align:start position:0%
draws from uh from the three bills that
 
06:07:52.548 --> 06:07:52.558 align:start position:0%
we considered as well as just other
 
06:07:55.070 --> 06:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
ideas representative madis and I had
 
06:07:57.670 --> 06:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
talked for quite a while yesterday I I
 
06:07:59.670 --> 06:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
drafted something and then we figured
 
06:08:05.590 --> 06:08:05.600 align:start position:0%
out how to make it better so in
 
06:08:09.390 --> 06:08:09.400 align:start position:0%
think two of the bills in 537 and
 
06:08:12.468 --> 06:08:12.478 align:start position:0%
539 uh there was something uh akin to
 
06:08:16.230 --> 06:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
section one of the draft except that I
 
06:08:18.788 --> 06:08:18.798 align:start position:0%
think it was not in the right place it
 
06:08:22.468 --> 06:08:22.478 align:start position:0%
was almost in the right place um so this
 
06:08:24.670 --> 06:08:24.680 align:start position:0%
idea of a statement of the purposes for
 
06:08:26.310 --> 06:08:26.320 align:start position:0%
which the condominium and each of the
 
06:08:28.830 --> 06:08:28.840 align:start position:0%
units are intended and restricted as to
 
06:08:31.430 --> 06:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
use and then adding language and whether
 
06:08:33.510 --> 06:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
any commercial or business enterprises
 
06:08:35.788 --> 06:08:35.798 align:start position:0%
are permitted in the original bill it
 
06:08:38.070 --> 06:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
was about the limited common areas and
 
06:08:39.430 --> 06:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
whether any commercial or business
 
06:08:41.430 --> 06:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
enterprises are permitted and here it
 
06:08:42.990 --> 06:08:43.000 align:start position:0%
seems like it because we're really
 
06:08:45.510 --> 06:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
talking about the individual units and
 
06:08:48.030 --> 06:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
well and septic for those units it seems
 
06:08:50.030 --> 06:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
like this is the right place to put it
 
06:08:53.230 --> 06:08:53.240 align:start position:0%
in sub paragraph H instead of which sub
 
06:08:57.430 --> 06:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
paragraph it was in before which was um
 
06:09:00.150 --> 06:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
where are we here uh e was in sub
 
06:09:01.910 --> 06:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
paragraph E
 
06:09:05.548 --> 06:09:05.558 align:start position:0%
before and then uh in I think think it
 
06:09:10.390 --> 06:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
was in 680 uh section two uh that
 
06:09:12.390 --> 06:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
language not exactly the language you
 
06:09:14.430 --> 06:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
see here but something similar appeared
 
06:09:19.350 --> 06:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
in 680 but it was actually in RSA 378
 
06:09:21.590 --> 06:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
which is about the public
 
06:09:26.548 --> 06:09:26.558 align:start position:0%
utilities and what we realized is this
 
06:09:29.750 --> 06:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh chargeback has nothing to do with the
 
06:09:31.990 --> 06:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
public utilities it has to do with the
 
06:09:33.468 --> 06:09:33.478 align:start position:0%
operation of the
 
06:09:35.990 --> 06:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
HOA so instead instead of putting it
 
06:09:37.910 --> 06:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
into RSA
 
06:09:40.510 --> 06:09:40.520 align:start position:0%
378 we think that it actually should go
 
06:09:46.230 --> 06:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
into RSA 356b which is about condos and
 
06:09:49.788 --> 06:09:49.798 align:start position:0%
in particular into section 45 and I did
 
06:09:53.270 --> 06:09:53.280 align:start position:0%
give everybody a copy of uh section 16
 
06:09:55.350 --> 06:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
and section
 
06:09:58.230 --> 06:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
45 and um and in fact we were just
 
06:10:00.548 --> 06:10:00.558 align:start position:0%
talking about paragraph 2 of 45 and
 
06:10:03.030 --> 06:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
paragraph 3 so what what we're
 
06:10:06.150 --> 06:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
suggesting is let's um add a new
 
06:10:08.868 --> 06:10:08.878 align:start position:0%
paragraph 3 rumber the existing 3 to
 
06:10:11.708 --> 06:10:11.718 align:start position:0%
four and say that regardless of the
 
06:10:14.270 --> 06:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
condominium instruments the cost for the
 
06:10:15.990 --> 06:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
shared meter usage for the septic
 
06:10:18.030 --> 06:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
systems and well pumps shall be charged
 
06:10:20.070 --> 06:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
back only to the residential units that
 
06:10:22.830 --> 06:10:22.840 align:start position:0%
share each meter even if the homeowners
 
06:10:24.390 --> 06:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
association is the customer of the
 
06:10:26.830 --> 06:10:26.840 align:start position:0%
public utility or Rural Electric
 
06:10:28.270 --> 06:10:28.280 align:start position:0%
Cooperative and we wanted to make sure
 
06:10:30.350 --> 06:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
that we included Rural Electric
 
06:10:32.430 --> 06:10:32.440 align:start position:0%
cooperatives in case there are condos
 
06:10:34.468 --> 06:10:34.478 align:start position:0%
served by the New Hampshire Electric
 
06:10:36.990 --> 06:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
Co-op and the chargeback shall be
 
06:10:38.788 --> 06:10:38.798 align:start position:0%
divided among these units ensuring that
 
06:10:40.628 --> 06:10:40.638 align:start position:0%
the cost is equally split according to
 
06:10:42.750 --> 06:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
the number of units sharing the meter
 
06:10:47.190 --> 06:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
that language was in uh in 680 um with
 
06:10:49.948 --> 06:10:49.958 align:start position:0%
one typo corrected here so so our
 
06:10:51.590 --> 06:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
thought was that this really belongs in
 
06:10:55.350 --> 06:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
the condo chapter not in the utility
 
06:10:55.360 --> 06:11:07.788 align:start position:0%
the condo chapter not in the utility
chapter

06:11:07.788 --> 06:11:07.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:10.110 --> 06:11:10.120 align:start position:0%
um yeah we might need to do that might
 
06:11:10.120 --> 06:11:11.070 align:start position:0%
um yeah we might need to do that might
to

06:11:11.070 --> 06:11:11.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:11:11.080 --> 06:11:12.628 align:start position:0%
to
do

06:11:12.628 --> 06:11:12.638 align:start position:0%
do
 
06:11:16.070 --> 06:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
supp states um oh no actually wait a
 
06:11:18.150 --> 06:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
minute no um because they're not they're
 
06:11:19.708 --> 06:11:19.718 align:start position:0%
not the distributor right they're not
 
06:11:22.030 --> 06:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
who who's doing the billing right the
 
06:11:24.750 --> 06:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
the actual billing is coming from one of
 
06:11:29.468 --> 06:11:29.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:31.510 --> 06:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
co-op okay I guess there are the
 
06:11:33.910 --> 06:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
municipal power
 
06:11:36.390 --> 06:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
companies yeah
 
06:11:38.030 --> 06:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
all right so we might need to adjust
 
06:11:43.070 --> 06:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:47.670 --> 06:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
cover yeah okay good thank you and then
 
06:11:50.708 --> 06:11:50.718 align:start position:0%
let's see um section three actually was
 
06:11:52.750 --> 06:11:52.760 align:start position:0%
in I forget which one of the other bills
 
06:11:55.990 --> 06:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
but it's essentially the same thing um
 
06:11:59.390 --> 06:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
saying that the uh electric rate
 
06:12:01.670 --> 06:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
schedule of a public utility filed with
 
06:12:03.750 --> 06:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
the commission and commission being the
 
06:12:05.830 --> 06:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
Pu shall ensure that condominium
 
06:12:08.390 --> 06:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
associations under
 
06:12:11.230 --> 06:12:11.240 align:start position:0%
356b which do not permit commercial or
 
06:12:12.990 --> 06:12:13.000 align:start position:0%
business enterprises are charged the
 
06:12:14.910 --> 06:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
same rates as condominium res
 
06:12:17.510 --> 06:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
residential units for domestic septic
 
06:12:19.510 --> 06:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
and well pump electric usage so really
 
06:12:22.670 --> 06:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
just specifying it to that and ensure
 
06:12:24.030 --> 06:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
that the billing for all such
 
06:12:26.070 --> 06:12:26.080 align:start position:0%
residential units is at residential
 
06:12:28.350 --> 06:12:28.360 align:start position:0%
rates even if the HOA is the customer
 
06:12:31.110 --> 06:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
and even if shared meters are used so
 
06:12:33.830 --> 06:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
and that's in 378 so it's in the public
 
06:12:33.840 --> 06:12:35.430 align:start position:0%
and that's in 378 so it's in the public
utilities

06:12:35.430 --> 06:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
06:12:37.708 --> 06:12:37.718 align:start position:0%
and then uh section
 
06:12:42.468 --> 06:12:42.478 align:start position:0%
four is um in 362 which is also about
 
06:12:44.868 --> 06:12:44.878 align:start position:0%
public utilities if you look very
 
06:12:47.750 --> 06:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
carefully in paragraph two in the fifth
 
06:12:51.430 --> 06:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
line there's a a bolded Edition right in
 
06:12:55.030 --> 06:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
the middle of the Fifth Line 378 col
 
06:12:58.350 --> 06:12:58.360 align:start position:0%
6-a which is what we create in section
 
06:13:03.830 --> 06:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
three so just updating that and then uh
 
06:13:06.510 --> 06:13:06.520 align:start position:0%
adding uh actually the uh yeah in fact I
 
06:13:09.390 --> 06:13:09.400 align:start position:0%
I should say that 362 is also about uh
 
06:13:12.350 --> 06:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
Rural Electric co-ops so section three
 
06:13:15.830 --> 06:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
or paragraph three is really the same
 
06:13:17.990 --> 06:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
language as before but for a Rural
 
06:13:18.000 --> 06:13:23.590 align:start position:0%
language as before but for a Rural
Electric

06:13:23.590 --> 06:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:26.270 --> 06:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
Co-op but you're you're point about um
 
06:13:30.230 --> 06:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
getting any other distribution or B
 
06:13:33.110 --> 06:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
biller uh yeah we that's good point sure
 
06:13:57.788 --> 06:13:57.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:59.430 --> 06:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
good afternoon one of these days I'll
 
06:14:00.830 --> 06:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
know whether or not to push that button
 
06:14:05.270 --> 06:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
when I sit here um first of all uh thank
 
06:14:06.708 --> 06:14:06.718 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity to speak and
 
06:14:08.628 --> 06:14:08.638 align:start position:0%
apologies for not being at the public
 
06:14:11.110 --> 06:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
hearing I I would have been uh we had
 
06:14:13.230 --> 06:14:13.240 align:start position:0%
thought that this wasn't necessarily A
 
06:14:15.628 --> 06:14:15.638 align:start position:0%
Unitil specific issue and as the hearing
 
06:14:18.510 --> 06:14:18.520 align:start position:0%
progressed it we came up a lot and had I
 
06:14:20.548 --> 06:14:20.558 align:start position:0%
foreseen that I would have been here so
 
06:14:22.150 --> 06:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
we we'll blame the new guy as far as
 
06:14:25.110 --> 06:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
that goes and lesson learned
 
06:14:27.510 --> 06:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
ever no and I I saw that and I
 
06:14:30.070 --> 06:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate that um I I don't know how
 
06:14:31.910 --> 06:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
much I can say that will be helpful but
 
06:14:34.628 --> 06:14:34.638 align:start position:0%
I did uh follow up with our customer
 
06:14:37.070 --> 06:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
service folks to get the background in
 
06:14:39.350 --> 06:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
terms of our own specific tariffs and at
 
06:14:42.310 --> 06:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
least be able to explain uh what our
 
06:14:44.390 --> 06:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
position has been throughout this and
 
06:14:47.310 --> 06:14:47.320 align:start position:0%
and that may or may not be helpful um
 
06:14:51.030 --> 06:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
effectively uh our tariff uh which
 
06:14:53.230 --> 06:14:53.240 align:start position:0%
governs how we organize these rate
 
06:14:56.230 --> 06:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
classes uh has effectively there's two
 
06:14:58.070 --> 06:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
specific categories we're talking about
 
06:15:00.750 --> 06:15:00.760 align:start position:0%
here we have what's called our domestic
 
06:15:03.270 --> 06:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh rate and then we have what's called
 
06:15:05.230 --> 06:15:05.240 align:start position:0%
uh the general rate which has been
 
06:15:07.110 --> 06:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
called the commercial rate but just to
 
06:15:08.628 --> 06:15:08.638 align:start position:0%
be specific there it's specifically
 
06:15:10.270 --> 06:15:10.280 align:start position:0%
referred to as the general rate within
 
06:15:13.510 --> 06:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
our tariff the domestic rate and I
 
06:15:15.030 --> 06:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
pulled it up here on my laptop just to
 
06:15:16.190 --> 06:15:16.200 align:start position:0%
make sure I'm seeing the language
 
06:15:19.270 --> 06:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
correctly uh specifically refers to
 
06:15:23.150 --> 06:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
metering on individual private dwellings
 
06:15:26.230 --> 06:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
and individual Apartments so our tariff
 
06:15:28.310 --> 06:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
specifically outlines that if you have a
 
06:15:30.350 --> 06:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
meter and it's going to a specific unit
 
06:15:31.750 --> 06:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
and everything that's feeding that unit
 
06:15:33.628 --> 06:15:33.638 align:start position:0%
is for that unit then it's part of the
 
06:15:36.310 --> 06:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
domestic rate the general service rate
 
06:15:38.350 --> 06:15:38.360 align:start position:0%
and we have a small general service rate
 
06:15:40.788 --> 06:15:40.798 align:start position:0%
and we have a large general service rate
 
06:15:43.510 --> 06:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh specifically says it's for all
 
06:15:45.750 --> 06:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
purposes meaning if it doesn't fall into
 
06:15:48.310 --> 06:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
that very specific domestic rate then
 
06:15:50.230 --> 06:15:50.240 align:start position:0%
it's metered under our general rate
 
06:15:52.230 --> 06:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
which is lists with the specific rates
 
06:15:54.948 --> 06:15:54.958 align:start position:0%
and the charges and the uh demand
 
06:15:58.230 --> 06:15:58.240 align:start position:0%
charges that exist so our tariff is
 
06:16:00.590 --> 06:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
designed specifically to try to account
 
06:16:04.670 --> 06:16:04.680 align:start position:0%
for different kinds of uses uh be that a
 
06:16:06.910 --> 06:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
bus business be that a meter that's
 
06:16:09.190 --> 06:16:09.200 align:start position:0%
specifically looking at a well pump or a
 
06:16:12.030 --> 06:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
septic pump so the way our tariff is
 
06:16:14.628 --> 06:16:14.638 align:start position:0%
written the general service appears to
 
06:16:18.788 --> 06:16:18.798 align:start position:0%
be where this would live effectively and
 
06:16:20.590 --> 06:16:20.600 align:start position:0%
from our customer service team's
 
06:16:22.628 --> 06:16:22.638 align:start position:0%
perspective consistency was the big
 
06:16:24.150 --> 06:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
thing we needed to look at so if we're
 
06:16:26.070 --> 06:16:26.080 align:start position:0%
doing it here and we're doing it over
 
06:16:28.548 --> 06:16:28.558 align:start position:0%
here we want to make sure that the same
 
06:16:30.510 --> 06:16:30.520 align:start position:0%
uses throughout our system are governed
 
06:16:33.310 --> 06:16:33.320 align:start position:0%
the same way so that's effectively how
 
06:16:36.030 --> 06:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
we got to the solution we got to on this
 
06:16:37.628 --> 06:16:37.638 align:start position:0%
uh we did seek guidance from the
 
06:16:40.070 --> 06:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
Department of energy when this came up
 
06:16:41.868 --> 06:16:41.878 align:start position:0%
uh we were told we were interpreting our
 
06:16:44.510 --> 06:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
tariff correctly so that's effectively
 
06:16:46.548 --> 06:16:46.558 align:start position:0%
where we are on this I I wanted to
 
06:16:48.468 --> 06:16:48.478 align:start position:0%
provide that background at minimum to
 
06:16:50.788 --> 06:16:50.798 align:start position:0%
show that that's how our tariff is
 
06:16:53.670 --> 06:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
interpreting this specific issue um in
 
06:16:55.948 --> 06:16:55.958 align:start position:0%
regards to the amendment that was shared
 
06:16:58.350 --> 06:16:58.360 align:start position:0%
uh one of the questions I would have uh
 
06:17:01.510 --> 06:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
just in trying to understand it uh in
 
06:17:05.628 --> 06:17:05.638 align:start position:0%
terms of how that bill gets
 
06:17:07.990 --> 06:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
redistributed within the condo
 
06:17:10.670 --> 06:17:10.680 align:start position:0%
association uh that would be a key
 
06:17:11.910 --> 06:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
question that I would have that I want
 
06:17:13.230 --> 06:17:13.240 align:start position:0%
to bring back to my folk so we
 
06:17:14.830 --> 06:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
understood what the potential impact of
 
06:17:18.628 --> 06:17:18.638 align:start position:0%
this bill would be uh is the idea among
 
06:17:20.670 --> 06:17:20.680 align:start position:0%
this that because it's effectively the
 
06:17:22.708 --> 06:17:22.718 align:start position:0%
homeowners association or the condo
 
06:17:25.548 --> 06:17:25.558 align:start position:0%
association and what they is governing
 
06:17:27.910 --> 06:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
them is changing is this billing
 
06:17:30.430 --> 06:17:30.440 align:start position:0%
happening beyond the meter so to speak
 
06:17:31.868 --> 06:17:31.878 align:start position:0%
so in other words we would continue to
 
06:17:34.948 --> 06:17:34.958 align:start position:0%
build a meter as per our tariff and then
 
06:17:36.468 --> 06:17:36.478 align:start position:0%
the condo association would be
 
06:17:38.990 --> 06:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
redistributing that after those billing
 
06:17:41.590 --> 06:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
occurred or is the idea that our billing
 
06:17:43.788 --> 06:17:43.798 align:start position:0%
department would need to be implementing
 
06:17:47.468 --> 06:17:47.478 align:start position:0%
some sort of new uh process which could
 
06:17:50.270 --> 06:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
theoretically have cost Associated so I
 
06:17:52.708 --> 06:17:52.718 align:start position:0%
don't know if if that's part of this
 
06:17:54.150 --> 06:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
conversation that would be helpful
 
06:17:55.628 --> 06:17:55.638 align:start position:0%
feedback that I could bring back to our
 
06:17:59.590 --> 06:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:01.868 --> 06:18:01.878 align:start position:0%
this so good
 
06:18:04.390 --> 06:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
question uh the way that I believe
 
06:18:08.030 --> 06:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
represent Madness and I think of this is
 
06:18:10.948 --> 06:18:10.958 align:start position:0%
that what would change would be the
 
06:18:13.230 --> 06:18:13.240 align:start position:0%
Tariff that you're charging on these
 
06:18:15.910 --> 06:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
shared meters so you know for the shared
 
06:18:18.548 --> 06:18:18.558 align:start position:0%
well shared septic instead of being
 
06:18:21.190 --> 06:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
built at The General commercial rate it
 
06:18:23.230 --> 06:18:23.240 align:start position:0%
it would be build at the residential
 
06:18:25.948 --> 06:18:25.958 align:start position:0%
rate where the bill would go would not
 
06:18:28.030 --> 06:18:28.040 align:start position:0%
change so the bill would still go to the
 
06:18:33.070 --> 06:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
HOA and then the HOA would say okay this
 
06:18:35.310 --> 06:18:35.320 align:start position:0%
uh bill is for these two units we're
 
06:18:38.990 --> 06:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
going to build them so that doesn't that
 
06:18:40.230 --> 06:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
part of it doesn't change you're still
 
06:18:42.468 --> 06:18:42.478 align:start position:0%
building the HOA all that would change
 
06:18:48.788 --> 06:18:48.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:52.628 --> 06:18:52.638 align:start position:0%
rate so in defining your three classes
 
06:18:56.548 --> 06:18:56.558 align:start position:0%
your domestic and your yeah two generals
 
06:19:00.230 --> 06:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh is is that based on any statutory
 
06:19:04.270 --> 06:19:04.280 align:start position:0%
construction or is that just the uh the
 
06:19:07.708 --> 06:19:07.718 align:start position:0%
rules that Unitil came up with as part
 
06:19:10.350 --> 06:19:10.360 align:start position:0%
of you know defining how they're going
 
06:19:13.390 --> 06:19:13.400 align:start position:0%
to do billing sure uh well first of all
 
06:19:14.868 --> 06:19:14.878 align:start position:0%
there are more than three rate classes I
 
06:19:15.948 --> 06:19:15.958 align:start position:0%
should just point that out for the
 
06:19:17.830 --> 06:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
record we have other rate classes time
 
06:19:20.670 --> 06:19:20.680 align:start position:0%
of use rates rates for electric vehicles
 
06:19:21.910 --> 06:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
those are the relevant rates for this
 
06:19:25.150 --> 06:19:25.160 align:start position:0%
particular conversation uh the way the
 
06:19:26.708 --> 06:19:26.718 align:start position:0%
Tariff is written in terms of that
 
06:19:30.628 --> 06:19:30.638 align:start position:0%
general service rate we believe that
 
06:19:33.548 --> 06:19:33.558 align:start position:0%
based on the way that our overall
 
06:19:34.948 --> 06:19:34.958 align:start position:0%
tariffs are written and going through
 
06:19:36.708 --> 06:19:36.718 align:start position:0%
rate cases with the Public Utilities
 
06:19:40.030 --> 06:19:40.040 align:start position:0%
Commission this usage meaning a metered
 
06:19:43.110 --> 06:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
septic pump or a metered well pump is in
 
06:19:45.230 --> 06:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
the appropriate rate class for that
 
06:19:47.830 --> 06:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
usage so you want your rate categories
 
06:19:50.830 --> 06:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
to properly identify the kind of usage
 
06:19:53.230 --> 06:19:53.240 align:start position:0%
that is occurring for that usage so in
 
06:19:55.510 --> 06:19:55.520 align:start position:0%
this particular case if it's a metered
 
06:19:58.070 --> 06:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
septic pump whether that's for-profit or
 
06:20:00.150 --> 06:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
nonprofit it lives within this
 
06:20:01.990 --> 06:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
particular rate class that's that's the
 
06:20:04.708 --> 06:20:04.718 align:start position:0%
overall design and the overall concept
 
06:20:06.670 --> 06:20:06.680 align:start position:0%
ultimately when we go before the Public
 
06:20:08.868 --> 06:20:08.878 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission to you know have a
 
06:20:11.270 --> 06:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
rate you know have any kind of rate
 
06:20:13.350 --> 06:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
review that would be an opportunity to
 
06:20:14.670 --> 06:20:14.680 align:start position:0%
look at those tariffs and see if you
 
06:20:18.230 --> 06:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
needed to further clarify or Define
 
06:20:20.110 --> 06:20:20.120 align:start position:0%
ultimately what those definitions are so
 
06:20:21.708 --> 06:20:21.718 align:start position:0%
under our existing definitions which
 
06:20:23.910 --> 06:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
have been approved we believe that this
 
06:20:26.670 --> 06:20:26.680 align:start position:0%
is currently appropriately uh accounted
 
06:20:29.430 --> 06:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
for anytime we go before the P that
 
06:20:31.070 --> 06:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity to look at that
 
06:20:35.110 --> 06:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
and review it so by Statute we Chang
 
06:20:39.270 --> 06:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
that you would move it from General one
 
06:20:42.110 --> 06:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
or what the lowest group to
 
06:20:44.670 --> 06:20:44.680 align:start position:0%
domestic in theory yeah I mean that
 
06:20:47.110 --> 06:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
would be ultimately uh our regulatory
 
06:20:48.708 --> 06:20:48.718 align:start position:0%
folks would be able to provide better
 
06:20:51.468 --> 06:20:51.478 align:start position:0%
but yeah anytime you move any specific
 
06:20:54.310 --> 06:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
entity from one group to another group
 
06:20:56.390 --> 06:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
then you go before you know that that
 
06:20:57.990 --> 06:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
rate class and then effectively those
 
06:20:59.548 --> 06:20:59.558 align:start position:0%
rates get redistributed because the
 
06:21:01.590 --> 06:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
costs are still going to be the costs
 
06:21:03.910 --> 06:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
across the system so you have a move
 
06:21:05.830 --> 06:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
effectively changes that and then the
 
06:21:08.670 --> 06:21:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:10.868 --> 06:21:10.878 align:start position:0%
redistributed right yeah and I
 
06:21:12.310 --> 06:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying uh I would
 
06:21:14.628 --> 06:21:14.638 align:start position:0%
just say a couple of things one is that
 
06:21:16.350 --> 06:21:16.360 align:start position:0%
given that what we're talking about are
 
06:21:20.310 --> 06:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
are uh meters that are purely serving
 
06:21:23.548 --> 06:21:23.558 align:start position:0%
you residential units it just seems like
 
06:21:27.070 --> 06:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
residential rates really ought to apply
 
06:21:30.070 --> 06:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
and as far as the uh the
 
06:21:32.430 --> 06:21:32.440 align:start position:0%
redistribution I would say that the that
 
06:21:34.150 --> 06:21:34.160 align:start position:0%
we have a problem right now which is
 
06:21:38.628 --> 06:21:38.638 align:start position:0%
that the uh the the payments are
 
06:21:41.310 --> 06:21:41.320 align:start position:0%
distributed the wrong way in that
 
06:21:44.110 --> 06:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
residential units are being are paying
 
06:21:45.868 --> 06:21:45.878 align:start position:0%
the commercial rates when they should be
 
06:21:47.948 --> 06:21:47.958 align:start position:0%
paying residential rates so I think what
 
06:21:51.230 --> 06:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do is undo this
 
06:21:54.750 --> 06:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
incorrect way of of assessing the The
 
06:21:56.788 --> 06:21:56.798 align:start position:0%
Meters no I I very much understand that
 
06:21:58.590 --> 06:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
I can only say that our rate definitions
 
06:22:00.030 --> 06:22:00.040 align:start position:0%
aren't necessarily residential and
 
06:22:02.350 --> 06:22:02.360 align:start position:0%
Commercial our domestic rate is specific
 
06:22:04.788 --> 06:22:04.798 align:start position:0%
to individual residential dwellings and
 
06:22:10.030 --> 06:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:12.150 --> 06:22:12.160 align:start position:0%
understood does anybody else have
 
06:22:16.230 --> 06:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:26.030 --> 06:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:32.230 --> 06:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
much so yeah so I I will look into
 
06:22:35.310 --> 06:22:35.320 align:start position:0%
um seeing what else we need to do with
 
06:22:37.548 --> 06:22:37.558 align:start position:0%
section two in terms
 
06:22:40.230 --> 06:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
of ensuring that we cover
 
06:22:42.948 --> 06:22:42.958 align:start position:0%
everybody yes I I hope I can work with
 
06:22:45.350 --> 06:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
maybe the department of energy to get a
 
06:22:48.310 --> 06:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
an idea of of what we could do with with
 
06:22:58.670 --> 06:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:58.680 --> 06:23:00.670 align:start position:0%
 
amendment

06:23:00.670 --> 06:23:00.680 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
06:23:05.628 --> 06:23:05.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:05.638 --> 06:23:58.548 align:start position:0%
 
right

06:23:58.548 --> 06:23:58.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:58.558 --> 06:24:03.350 align:start position:0%
 
great

06:24:03.350 --> 06:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
