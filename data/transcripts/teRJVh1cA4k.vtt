committee represent
 
00:07:57.589 --> 00:07:57.599 align:start position:0%
London yes thank you um little history
 
00:07:58.950 --> 00:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
I'm the one that actually drafted the
 
00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
legislation for the funeral procession
 
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:03.800 align:start position:0%
with the uh purple lights and the signs
 
00:08:05.790 --> 00:08:05.800 align:start position:0%
and the certain signage and everything
 
00:08:07.869 --> 00:08:07.879 align:start position:0%
so I'm familiar with with with the
 
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
legislation this is adding on to um and
 
00:08:13.629 --> 00:08:13.639 align:start position:0%
I do concur it I mean it makes sense to
 
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:17.240 align:start position:0%
have the lead vehicle U yield or or
 
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
follow uh uh stop signs and and lights
 
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:23.720 align:start position:0%
and everything
 
00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:25.960 align:start position:0%
um I just want to make sure that this
 
00:08:29.029 --> 00:08:29.039 align:start position:0%
does not it uh mean that the procession
 
00:08:29.039 --> 00:08:30.070 align:start position:0%
does not it uh mean that the procession
itself

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
itself
 
00:08:32.389 --> 00:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
has to start it's that lead vehicle and
 
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:35.360 align:start position:0%
the other vehicles can follow Sue
 
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
sometimes there a large uh processions
 
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
and if all the vehicles have their uh
 
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
signage or Flags it should be a safe
 
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
process I I don't know if you can answer
 
00:08:50.269 --> 00:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
that but I just want to make sure that
 
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:52.760 align:start position:0%
uh it's primarily lead Vehicles the rest
 
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
can follow sou yeah absolutely um I will
 
00:08:57.949 --> 00:08:57.959 align:start position:0%
ask Senator shardy I can give her a call
 
00:08:59.590 --> 00:08:59.600 align:start position:0%
after this and I can find out an answer
 
00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:01.279 align:start position:0%

all all
 
00:09:54.509 --> 00:09:54.519 align:start position:0%

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
necessary I I know the procession is
 
00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:00.320 align:start position:0%

car is supposed to follow all current
 
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
traffic laws okay so I don't know if

to to do that today um this bill uh is
 
00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:35.399 align:start position:0%
basically uh housekeeping if you will
 
00:11:37.629 --> 00:11:37.639 align:start position:0%
that back in 2002 when the original
 
00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
legislation which we needed desperately
 
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
at the time and thank you very much for
 
00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:45.320 align:start position:0%
your service and writing that um is uh
 
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
didn't seem to didn't even occur to us
 
00:11:49.389 --> 00:11:49.399 align:start position:0%
that it needed to include yield signs
 
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
what's happened and I think the
 
00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:53.440 align:start position:0%
representative from Kean will know is I
 
00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
think in Kean we have about seven
 
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
roundabouts or traffic circles now that
 
00:11:59.829 --> 00:11:59.839 align:start position:0%
there more and more roundabout traffic
 
00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:01.839 align:start position:0%
circles rotaries whatever you might call
 
00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%
them which we really didn't have very
 
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
many uh a number of years ago and
 
00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:10.120 align:start position:0%
now as with including funeral
 
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
processions if we can allow that lead
 
00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
car and yes the funeral uh funeral
 
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
processions would remain with the lead
 
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:21.560 align:start position:0%
car um and uh so that this would would
 
00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
uh because with the roundabouts and the
 
00:12:26.189 --> 00:12:26.199 align:start position:0%
traffic circles is that they're all the
 
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
control and that of that traffic is all
 
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
done by yield signs all of them even in
 
00:12:33.389 --> 00:12:33.399 align:start position:0%
in Central Square and Kean we have three
 
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
entrances that are by traffic lights but
 
00:12:38.509 --> 00:12:38.519 align:start position:0%
they're two by yield signs so but uh and
 
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
so it's a matter of just having it work
 
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
out so the procession stays together but
 
00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
that that lead car you know will yield
 
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:46.360 align:start position:0%
to that sign and the rest of the
 
00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:48.680 align:start position:0%
procession will go with it uh again I
 
00:12:51.189 --> 00:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
mean with due caution you know as we
 
00:12:52.829 --> 00:12:52.839 align:start position:0%
knew when they we first did the big one
 
00:12:55.629 --> 00:12:55.639 align:start position:0%
on one1 in in Keen there was quite a
 
00:12:57.509 --> 00:12:57.519 align:start position:0%
learning curve to any kind of traffic
 
00:12:59.389 --> 00:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
circle around about I mean the police
 
00:13:01.269 --> 00:13:01.279 align:start position:0%
were called out daily to offender
 
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
benders with that but um so we're really
 
00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
just looking to to do this bit of
 
00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:08.680 align:start position:0%
housekeeping um and I think I can answer
 
00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
the other questions if you like but um
 
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
so we're here to to navigate to uh to
 
00:13:16.189 --> 00:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
support this and uh we think it's just a
 
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
very simple fix so we appreciate your
 
00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:19.880 align:start position:0%
time and I'll be happy to try to answer
 
00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:20.790 align:start position:0%
time and I'll be happy to try to answer
any

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:13:22.829 --> 00:13:22.839 align:start position:0%
questions thank you sir questions from
 
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
the committee representer
 
00:13:29.389 --> 00:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
Fox thank you Mr chairman um in thank
 
00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
you for taking my
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
question what does the lead car
 
00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:36.360 align:start position:0%
currently do if they don't yield do they
 
00:13:38.509 --> 00:13:38.519 align:start position:0%
oh they would yield yes they do yield
 
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
it's putting it in in statute where the
 
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
other the other means of regulating
 
00:13:46.269 --> 00:13:46.279 align:start position:0%
funeral processions this this uh this
 
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
legislation is specifically for funeral
 
00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:51.519 align:start position:0%
processions and uh it's like that once
 
00:13:55.189 --> 00:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
we uh go into an intersection and we
 
00:13:56.990 --> 00:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
follow you know with a light we can go
 
00:13:58.470 --> 00:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
through the intersection when we stop
 
00:14:00.189 --> 00:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
and check and then the rest of the
 
00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
procession can stay with the lead car
 
00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
even though the light may turn red or
 
00:14:06.829 --> 00:14:06.839 align:start position:0%
whatever they they have that they have
 
00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:09.160 align:start position:0%
that status if you will to to remain
 
00:14:11.790 --> 00:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
with the uh um with the lead car and
 
00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
again it's all done with with due
 
00:14:15.069 --> 00:14:15.079 align:start position:0%
caution and common sense of course I
 
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
mean you know the law I don't I don't
 
00:14:20.829 --> 00:14:20.839 align:start position:0%
argue with the laws of physics myself
 
00:14:25.069 --> 00:14:25.079 align:start position:0%
so yeah follow y follow up thank you um
 
00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
and I'm as I'm reading the the uh the
 
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
bill it is just the addition of yield
 
00:14:34.069 --> 00:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
signs and yield the current the bill is
 
00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:36.240 align:start position:0%
is uh remains untouched other than that
 
00:14:38.189 --> 00:14:38.199 align:start position:0%
thank you unchanged yes yeah yeah
 
00:14:40.189 --> 00:14:40.199 align:start position:0%
because again as I said before because
 
00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
all of the traffic circles this type of
 
00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:45.880 align:start position:0%
um traffic pattern um is all controlled
 
00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
by yield signs and U thanks you bring up
 
00:14:52.389 --> 00:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
a good point I guess with the Advent of
 
00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
the as a
 
00:14:55.949 --> 00:14:55.959 align:start position:0%
roundabouts not of which I'm a big fan
 
00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:57.839 align:start position:0%
of by the way for these reasons how big
 
00:14:59.670 --> 00:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
a problem do you have with the rest of
 
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
the people not yielding and just joining
 
00:15:05.150 --> 00:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
your procession because they refuse to
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
stop in the middle of a roundabout right
 
00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:10.040 align:start position:0%
most well as you pointed out before if
 
00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
they have their their lights in their
 
00:15:13.269 --> 00:15:13.279 align:start position:0%
flat the lead car would have lights or
 
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
the F the hearse would have lights their
 
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
their strobes their purple strobes um
 
00:15:20.949 --> 00:15:20.959 align:start position:0%
the cars have uh funeral flags of course
 
00:15:23.629 --> 00:15:23.639 align:start position:0%
as we know nowadays you know well we see
 
00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:24.920 align:start position:0%
more often than not the drivers aren't
 
00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
paying attention to anything but what's
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
going on with them um but um but most
 
00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
what we found in New Hampshire is that
 
00:15:34.309 --> 00:15:34.319 align:start position:0%
most people are incredibly
 
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
courteous uh they're very very you know
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
very thoughtful very and they will yield
 
00:15:41.949 --> 00:15:41.959 align:start position:0%
to the and and the main the hard the
 
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
hardest problem we have in a funeral
 
00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:45.279 align:start position:0%
procession is keeping the cars close
 
00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:47.240 align:start position:0%
enough together because you'll be
 
00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
surprised strobes or not I mean I've had
 
00:15:51.389 --> 00:15:51.399 align:start position:0%
cars pull in between the hearse and the
 
00:15:53.749 --> 00:15:53.759 align:start position:0%
lead car I mean like and we had to
 
00:15:55.629 --> 00:15:55.639 align:start position:0%
police escort then that was through
 
00:15:57.949 --> 00:15:57.959 align:start position:0%
Peterboro uh the other the other
 
00:15:59.590 --> 00:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
question I think you did have was about
 
00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:02.360 align:start position:0%
the police uh police escort I know Mark
 
00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:04.600 align:start position:0%
has Mark canoer and Jaffrey has a he was
 
00:16:07.069 --> 00:16:07.079 align:start position:0%
a former law enforcement he has a very
 
00:16:08.949 --> 00:16:08.959 align:start position:0%
close relationship with the Jaffrey PD
 
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
and the Peto PD locally um but of course
 
00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
we can have that all arranged which is
 
00:16:16.949 --> 00:16:16.959 align:start position:0%
ideal and particularly like in Keane you
 
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
know we have a lot of traffic and so
 
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
forth a lot of traffic circles uh if we
 
00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
have the the police escort that's ideal
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
but as we know they may be scheduled to
 
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
do that but they get called away uh then
 
00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be there so we have
 
00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
to navigate on our own uh and so if we
 
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
have this it gives us that legal
 
00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
Authority that we have the right of way
 
00:16:37.949 --> 00:16:37.959 align:start position:0%
after we yield at the yield sign and the
 
00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
procession can go through yeah anybody
 
00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
else represent
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
Gorski thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:16:49.389 --> 00:16:49.399 align:start position:0%
you uh for taking my question so I'm
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
still kind of confused
 
00:16:55.189 --> 00:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
if the the lead driver is yielding right
 
00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
um in currently right
 
00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:01.240 align:start position:0%
now why why do why is this why is this
 
00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:02.590 align:start position:0%
now why why do why is this why is this
bill

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
needed well I would I believe it's
 
00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:06.750 align:start position:0%
needed well I would I believe it's
needed

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:06.760 align:start position:0%
needed
 
00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:09.160 align:start position:0%
because uh again with the new traffic
 
00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
patterns with traffic circles and
 
00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:13.720 align:start position:0%
roundabouts U that we haven't addressed
 
00:17:16.909 --> 00:17:16.919 align:start position:0%
those specific traffic patterns uh
 
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
because as I said yield signs aren't in
 
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
the statute at the time at now they're
 
00:17:24.429 --> 00:17:24.439 align:start position:0%
not they presently not there and uh so I
 
00:17:26.789 --> 00:17:26.799 align:start position:0%
guess being under the funeral procession
 
00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:29.720 align:start position:0%
uh statute is that then gives the
 
00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
procession The Authority or the
 
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
permission to follow the lead car as
 
00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:36.360 align:start position:0%
they would through a typical
 
00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
intersection with traffic lights or
 
00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
whatever I mean once they establish um
 
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
sometimes we will have a car a separate
 
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
car which will actually help not sure if
 
00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:47.320 align:start position:0%
this is entirely legal but actually
 
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:50.200 align:start position:0%
block coming oncoming traffic from both
 
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
directions if we have particularly if
 
00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
it's a higher speed highway kind of
 
00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:56.200 align:start position:0%
thing but yeah so I don't know if that
 
00:17:57.909 --> 00:17:57.919 align:start position:0%
answers your question okay you're
 
00:17:57.919 --> 00:17:59.470 align:start position:0%
answers your question okay you're
welcome

00:17:59.470 --> 00:17:59.480 align:start position:0%
welcome
 
00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
representative Hill thank you Mr
 
00:18:02.789 --> 00:18:02.799 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
00:18:05.909 --> 00:18:05.919 align:start position:0%
question do you know if there's a fine
 
00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:09.400 align:start position:0%
for this if you break into the uh well
 
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
technically yes there is um but I think
 
00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:18.280 align:start position:0%
it's I think it's rarely enforced I mean
 
00:18:20.149 --> 00:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
if we sometimes we'll do we may get
 
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
we'll get a plate I mean of course we're
 
00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
in a procession we're driving a car you
 
00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
know we have the family there behind us
 
00:18:27.149 --> 00:18:27.159 align:start position:0%
and have the hearse and the other
 
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
vehicles and like I said that when I had
 
00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:31.000 align:start position:0%
in Peterboro I mean it was only a short
 
00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:33.480 align:start position:0%
time they came off Pine Street because
 
00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
there was like 10 ft between me and the
 
00:18:37.830 --> 00:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
lead car and they and it was an elderly
 
00:18:39.549 --> 00:18:39.559 align:start position:0%
driver she just slipped right in there
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
and did a great job but then we got down
 
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
to but we got down to where they were
 
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
doing the construction more than just
 
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:49.240 align:start position:0%
maybe 400 500 feet away and that's when
 
00:18:50.909 --> 00:18:50.919 align:start position:0%
she went off One Direction we went the
 
00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
rest of the way but uh although by then
 
00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:54.600 align:start position:0%
I think there was a police car behind
 
00:18:56.669 --> 00:18:56.679 align:start position:0%
her at that point U so whether they
 
00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
spoke with her or not I don't know I
 
00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:01.480 align:start position:0%
don't think she was even aware of
 
00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:04.760 align:start position:0%
what I shouldn't speculate sorry follow
 
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
up I'm not getting yeah follow up thank
 
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
you um I see in the fiscal note it talks
 
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
about under the current law there's a
 
00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:15.400 align:start position:0%
violation level penalty with a $100 fine
 
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
yield who would under this
 
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
law who would pay that
 
00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:29.720 align:start position:0%
fine would that
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:37.480 align:start position:0%
vehicle for
 
00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:40.280 align:start position:0%
failing um well I guess in the case of
 
00:19:42.789 --> 00:19:42.799 align:start position:0%
any any vehicle involved in the funeral
 
00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
procession um if the responsibility
 
00:19:47.789 --> 00:19:47.799 align:start position:0%
would would go to the funeral
 
00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:49.880 align:start position:0%
home yeah we'll mean we're we're in
 
00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
charge of the procession I mean we we
 
00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:53.720 align:start position:0%
can't determine what everyone else does
 
00:19:56.909 --> 00:19:56.919 align:start position:0%
in the procession of course um uh I mean
 
00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
I've worked in other other are is not
 
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire but in when I was
 
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
in school and I mean I had people go up
 
00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
on the sidewalk to get around a funeral
 
00:20:08.149 --> 00:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
procession I kid you not I kid you not
 
00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:10.360 align:start position:0%
this is yeah
 
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
yes that's a good question I think we'll
 
00:20:14.669 --> 00:20:14.679 align:start position:0%
look at the rest of the chapter I think
 
00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:16.360 align:start position:0%
this deals with the processions
 
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
themselves but what happens to somebody
 
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
who breaks the procession could be
 
00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
different thing and we have
 
00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:24.520 align:start position:0%
representative pondon thank you Mr chair
 
00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
yeah just for clarification the original
 
00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
legislation that $100 fund is for a
 
00:20:32.789 --> 00:20:32.799 align:start position:0%
vehicle not yielding to the procession
 
00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
itself so cutting in so and again to
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
address uh the comments made that the
 
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
issue is enforcement you know if a
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
police officer sees it U then they can
 
00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
issue the citation but
 
00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:50.440 align:start position:0%
U so that I just wanted to clarify no
 
00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate thank you for the
 
00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:55.480 align:start position:0%
clarification representative Jones Thank
 
00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:20:59.549 --> 00:20:59.559 align:start position:0%
question very um
 
00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
I'm very familiar with king um I was
 
00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
part of all those roundabouts that did
 
00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
go in there uh but um many of the
 
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
roundabouts don't have signage it's the
 
00:21:13.269 --> 00:21:13.279 align:start position:0%
law is you yield to the to those in the
 
00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
circle right and but that's not
 
00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:17.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned in this
 
00:21:21.669 --> 00:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:24.799 align:start position:0%
it I'm not really sure to be honest with
 
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
you I mean um yes I do yeah I see what
 
00:21:29.549 --> 00:21:29.559 align:start position:0%
you're saying
 
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
but I'm trying to think I'm not and I
 
00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
mean I'm thinking when I I look back I
 
00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
mean that's there's so much signage you
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
know they've done a new one on on U
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
Winchester Street uh a smaller one in
 
00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
Island Street which is they're doing the
 
00:21:47.149 --> 00:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
bridge work and that's all I all I can
 
00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
see is signage you know about yield and
 
00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
and which I don't know but yeah like
 
00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:53.720 align:start position:0%
some of the ones like on Court Street is
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
there a followup don't have it I'm sorry
 
00:21:57.750 --> 00:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh well they do have yes they I Sor I
 
00:21:59.590 --> 00:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
don't mean to cont they do have yield
 
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
signs uh at each entrance uh Court
 
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
Street from the hospital entrance um oh
 
00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:08.120 align:start position:0%
what's the other the other Road um
 
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
coming in but I believe they do I
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
believe they do I don't mean mean to
 
00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:13.720 align:start position:0%
contradict you but I believe I go up
 
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
Court Street all the time so I live in
 
00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:17.720 align:start position:0%
Sur so thank you Mr chair yeah and you
 
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
raised a good point uh I know the
 
00:22:21.149 --> 00:22:21.159 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation isn't here
 
00:22:22.909 --> 00:22:22.919 align:start position:0%
now but they will be here later so
 
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps we can get the answer from them
 
00:22:26.190 --> 00:22:26.200 align:start position:0%
and determine whether or not you think
 
00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
something needs to be added to this one
 
00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
yeah and we'd be we'd be welcome to we'd

00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
present this bill by the DMV this bill
 
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
permits residents to use an alternate

mailing address with the DMV when absent
 
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
from their residence for less than six
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
months several years ago when the DMV
 
00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:51.880 align:start position:0%
implemented temporary licenses in the
 
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
process of mailing the permanent license
 
00:24:55.389 --> 00:24:55.399 align:start position:0%
they recognized the amount of New
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents that were out of the
 
00:24:59.389 --> 00:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
state during or or around their renewal
 
00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
time many were snowbirds going south for
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
the winter months or students away at
 
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
College internally they implemented a
 
00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
process where these applicants could
 
00:25:10.029 --> 00:25:10.039 align:start position:0%
fill out a temporarily away form with
 
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
their out of state information as well
 
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
as the reason they would be out of state
 
00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
to have their new hampsher license or ID
 
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
mailed to that out ofate address this
 
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
form was eventually assigned a form
 
00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
number DSM V V5 94 and began to be used
 
00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:26.440 align:start position:0%
in all bureaus for any DMV document that
 
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
was applied for and needed to be mailed
 
00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
while the applicant was away for example
 
00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:32.600 align:start position:0%
titles and boat
 
00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
registrations the only exception to this
 
00:25:36.750 --> 00:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
was has always been the original or the
 
00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
firsttime license or ID card obtained in
 
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is mailing the original
 
00:25:42.830 --> 00:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
credential to a New Hampshire address is
 
00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
an important part of confirming
 
00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:46.360 align:start position:0%
residency in the
 
00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
state under new Administration it was
 
00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:50.559 align:start position:0%
recognized that the temporarily away
 
00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:53.320 align:start position:0%
process is not defined in in statute the
 
00:25:55.149 --> 00:25:55.159 align:start position:0%
DMV believes this process is beneficial
 
00:25:56.909 --> 00:25:56.919 align:start position:0%
to the residents of the state and wants
 
00:25:59.470 --> 00:25:59.480 align:start position:0%
to formalize the process in statute the
 
00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:01.880 align:start position:0%
DMV will be will then further Define the
 
00:26:04.389 --> 00:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
form used and information requested on
 
00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:06.640 align:start position:0%

question I'd like to know why the the
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
normal post office uh

would like to hear what the what the
 
00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
purpose for this is that isn't covered
 
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
by uh the normal forwarding process
 
00:28:17.149 --> 00:28:17.159 align:start position:0%
through the post office I'd be happy to
 
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840 align:start position:0%

introduction that you read could I get a
 
00:28:31.509 --> 00:28:31.519 align:start position:0%
copy of that absolutely thank you very
 
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
much I can send the committee a copy of
 
00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:36.200 align:start position:0%
my written
 
00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
testimony representative Club thank you
 
00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:43.720 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um if we could get at least
 
00:28:47.389 --> 00:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
if not from Senator ricardi um from the
 
00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation some idea
 
00:28:50.549 --> 00:28:50.559 align:start position:0%
of what that's going to look like
 
00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
because from my standpoint it sounds
 
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
like we're going to be considering
 
00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
adding a whole bunch of additional
 
00:28:59.789 --> 00:28:59.799 align:start position:0%
government to to be able to make that
 
00:29:04.029 --> 00:29:04.039 align:start position:0%
happen and I'm I'm just asking what does
 
00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:07.240 align:start position:0%
that look like to create this well we
 
00:29:09.509 --> 00:29:09.519 align:start position:0%
again we do have somebody from the
 
00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:11.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Motor Vehicles who's going
 
00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
to testify next and maybe we can ask her
 
00:29:15.549 --> 00:29:15.559 align:start position:0%
the same question and get an answer all
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
right thank you any representative
 
00:29:20.029 --> 00:29:20.039 align:start position:0%
pondon yes thank you Mr chair I think of
 
00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
taking a question my only concern is
 
00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
where it states on on line 13 alternate
 
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
mailing address outside of New Hampshire
 
00:29:30.389 --> 00:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
to me that's kind of vague uh a lot of
 
00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
the snowbirds and so on are use Campers
 
00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:35.200 align:start position:0%
or they're tenting or whatever say they
 
00:29:38.190 --> 00:29:38.200 align:start position:0%
go down south for the snowbirds um
 
00:29:42.110 --> 00:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
should that specifically say a physical
 
00:29:45.909 --> 00:29:45.919 align:start position:0%
address um for those that are mobile
 
00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
while they're gone for the less than six
 
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
months um I don't want this to be an
 
00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:53.000 align:start position:0%
excuse or whatever there's got to to me
 
00:29:55.149 --> 00:29:55.159 align:start position:0%
there's got to be a physical location a
 
00:29:56.830 --> 00:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
post office box or something where they
 
00:29:58.669 --> 00:29:58.679 align:start position:0%
can retrieve their mail
 
00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
would be my
 
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
concern thank you Mr chair again we have
 
00:30:04.830 --> 00:30:04.840 align:start position:0%
somebody from the Department of Motor
 
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
Vehicles that's coming up next uh this
 
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:12.480 align:start position:0%
also is subject to RSA 541 which means
 
00:30:15.269 --> 00:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
that uh for the details the department
 
00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:16.840 align:start position:0%
usually does go through the rules
 
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
process to Pro a specific in info but
 
00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:21.880 align:start position:0%
we'll find out what DMV says in a minute
 
00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
anybody else from the committee seeing
 
00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:25.840 align:start position:0%

00:30:32.269 --> 00:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
that being said next up chair recognizes
 
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
Jennifer Bailey from the Department of
 
00:30:37.990 --> 00:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:40.669 --> 00:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
bill did you get all those questions yes
 
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
I them all down um good morning my name
 
00:30:44.909 --> 00:30:44.919 align:start position:0%
is Jennifer Bailey I'm one of the
 
00:30:45.909 --> 00:30:45.919 align:start position:0%
administrators for the Department of
 
00:30:48.549 --> 00:30:48.559 align:start position:0%
Motor Vehicles um I don't have much more
 
00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:49.960 align:start position:0%
to introduce to the bill he did a very
 
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
good job on what the reasoning is that
 
00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
we're requesting this as for so your
 
00:30:56.669 --> 00:30:56.679 align:start position:0%
questions so plates um we the only thing
 
00:30:58.750 --> 00:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
we restrict from this form using is for
 
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
original driver's license because that's
 
00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
in statute that we mail that to your New
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents to prove that you're
 
00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire resident upon that but
 
00:31:09.389 --> 00:31:09.399 align:start position:0%
anything else original we do allow you
 
00:31:11.389 --> 00:31:11.399 align:start position:0%
to use this form to mail out of
 
00:31:14.549 --> 00:31:14.559 align:start position:0%
state second question New Hampshire um
 
00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
DMV mail is all mail with a no
 
00:31:19.629 --> 00:31:19.639 align:start position:0%
forwarding um requirement on it so our
 
00:31:23.149 --> 00:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
mail does not forward due to the Privacy
 
00:31:24.909 --> 00:31:24.919 align:start position:0%
Law and stuff that we are mailing we're
 
00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:26.840 align:start position:0%
mailing credentials we're mailing titles
 
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
um if those are forwarded to the wrong
 
00:31:31.909 --> 00:31:31.919 align:start position:0%
location for example we've seen many
 
00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:34.120 align:start position:0%
times that a husband and wife are
 
00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:35.960 align:start position:0%
separated one forwards their mail the
 
00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:37.960 align:start position:0%
post office forwards both their males so
 
00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
that's why we do not forward our mail so
 
00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:43.240 align:start position:0%
we created this alternative way for
 
00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:47.240 align:start position:0%
people to receive their DMV documents by
 
00:31:48.509 --> 00:31:48.519 align:start position:0%
physically telling us where they're
 
00:31:50.909 --> 00:31:50.919 align:start position:0%
going to be they're signing a document
 
00:31:55.389 --> 00:31:55.399 align:start position:0%
um there was one question about the um
 
00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:57.320 align:start position:0%
process what that looks like we have
 
00:31:58.870 --> 00:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
been doing this for I would say
 
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
approximately 12 to 15 years already
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
this is again us doing a cleanup Act of
 
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
actually putting it in statute so we
 
00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
have a form they put their name their
 
00:32:09.509 --> 00:32:09.519 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire information they're
 
00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:11.240 align:start position:0%
putting the term that they're going to
 
00:32:13.909 --> 00:32:13.919 align:start position:0%
be out of state which we do Max that
 
00:32:16.629 --> 00:32:16.639 align:start position:0%
term at six months that they're still
 
00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
considered a resident of the state um
 
00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:21.720 align:start position:0%
they then list the alternative mailing
 
00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:24.440 align:start position:0%
address we do not change their address
 
00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
in the system we have a third address um
 
00:32:30.269 --> 00:32:30.279 align:start position:0%
location in our computer that we can
 
00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
list an A A temporarily away away
 
00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:34.840 align:start position:0%
address and we even put the dates in the
 
00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
system so that when those dates have
 
00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
bypassed then their mailes no longer
 
00:32:41.549 --> 00:32:41.559 align:start position:0%
going to that temporary location so
 
00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
there it would there would be no new
 
00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:45.480 align:start position:0%
procedure created we've already been
 
00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:47.960 align:start position:0%
doing this for many
 
00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
years where did I
 
00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.830 align:start position:0%
years where did I
miss

00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
miss
 
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
um I believe that's it I think I hit
 
00:32:58.590 --> 00:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
them all but I do have a question for
 
00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
you a couple of them actually yeah um
 
00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
you this is news to me you've been doing
 
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:04.200 align:start position:0%
this for 12 to 15 years in terms of
 
00:33:07.149 --> 00:33:07.159 align:start position:0%
mailing out most of the information not
 
00:33:09.549 --> 00:33:09.559 align:start position:0%
but except the originals yes I had a
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
constituent a couple of years ago who
 
00:33:13.789 --> 00:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
does the same thing moves to Florida
 
00:33:17.629 --> 00:33:17.639 align:start position:0%
every year for the winter months and
 
00:33:20.269 --> 00:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
could not get the title of his
 
00:33:22.669 --> 00:33:22.679 align:start position:0%
motorcycle sent to him in Florida
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
because of the do not
 
00:33:28.029 --> 00:33:28.039 align:start position:0%
forward uh policy and was told over over
 
00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:29.960 align:start position:0%
and over and over again that they would
 
00:33:32.269 --> 00:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
not send it to Florida so if we've been
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
doing this for 12 to 15 years why did we
 
00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:37.720 align:start position:0%
almost give this guy a heart attack two
 
00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
years ago so that I'm not sure because
 
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
we have been originally it was only
 
00:33:44.029 --> 00:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
driver licensing that only lasted for a
 
00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
few years though um then we implemented
 
00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:48.880 align:start position:0%
in all of our bureaus um boats
 
00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
especially Massachusetts residents
 
00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
registering their boats during off
 
00:33:55.029 --> 00:33:55.039 align:start position:0%
season um so I do not know why he was
 
00:33:57.389 --> 00:33:57.399 align:start position:0%
turned down unless he had not completed
 
00:33:59.549 --> 00:33:59.559 align:start position:0%
that form again we don't have it written
 
00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:02.559 align:start position:0%
anywhere in statute um we do have it
 
00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:05.240 align:start position:0%
listed on our website so if he was in
 
00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:07.000 align:start position:0%
Florida he wouldn't have any way to get
 
00:34:09.629 --> 00:34:09.639 align:start position:0%
the form is that a possible scenario
 
00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:11.560 align:start position:0%
that is a possible scenario we do have
 
00:34:14.349 --> 00:34:14.359 align:start position:0%
it online now and it can be mailed in um
 
00:34:16.349 --> 00:34:16.359 align:start position:0%
we also allow you if you are out of
 
00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
state to and processing your transaction
 
00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
through mail to mail that form in along
 
00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
with your transaction okay I was again I
 
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
was just hoping this was a solution to
 
00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:27.399 align:start position:0%
that issue because that was a it would
 
00:34:29.589 --> 00:34:29.599 align:start position:0%
was a one y uh any other questions from
 
00:34:29.599 --> 00:34:30.710 align:start position:0%
was a one y uh any other questions from
the

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:33.399 align:start position:0%
committee representative plon thank you
 
00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:35.480 align:start position:0%
and I maybe I didn't understand
 
00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:36.760 align:start position:0%
everything but I don't think my question
 
00:34:38.669 --> 00:34:38.679 align:start position:0%
was answered or I didn't explain it
 
00:34:41.149 --> 00:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
clear enough my concern is where you've
 
00:34:43.829 --> 00:34:43.839 align:start position:0%
been doing this is uh snowb Birds they
 
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily go to one Campground
 
00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
yep so how do we handle say they're at a
 
00:34:51.950 --> 00:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
campground in Clear Water for two weeks
 
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
then they go to Miami for three weeks
 
00:34:56.349 --> 00:34:56.359 align:start position:0%
then they go you know they're traveling
 
00:34:56.359 --> 00:34:57.910 align:start position:0%
then they go you know they're traveling
around

00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:34:59.670 --> 00:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
you only have room for one forwarding
 
00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
address and I'm assuming it's a it's a
 
00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
you know physical location how do we
 
00:35:08.069 --> 00:35:08.079 align:start position:0%
handle that or do we limit them or we
 
00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:09.560 align:start position:0%
don't limit it's whatever address they
 
00:35:11.069 --> 00:35:11.079 align:start position:0%
put down as a mailing so they can have a
 
00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:13.240 align:start position:0%
PO Box in that state that they can go to
 
00:35:14.589 --> 00:35:14.599 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to be a physical
 
00:35:16.589 --> 00:35:16.599 align:start position:0%
location it's just a mailing so it can
 
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
be PO Box it can be a friend of theirs
 
00:35:20.230 --> 00:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
family that lives down the area it's
 
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:22.079 align:start position:0%
just whatever address they are providing
 
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
us and followup followup and it's been
 
00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:27.960 align:start position:0%
successful for these 12 15 years no
 
00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:30.520 align:start position:0%

Senate Bill 471 FN relative to adding a
 
00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:40.640 align:start position:0%
speed limit of 45 miles hour on Rural
 
00:41:42.829 --> 00:41:42.839 align:start position:0%
highways chair recognizes the prime
 
00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:45.839 align:start position:0%
sponsor Senator Waters good morning
 
00:41:47.589 --> 00:41:47.599 align:start position:0%
thanks you so much Mr chairman Senator
 
00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
David Waters District Four coming over
 
00:41:52.589 --> 00:41:52.599 align:start position:0%
from Senate transportation to house
 
00:41:54.829 --> 00:41:54.839 align:start position:0%
transportation to introduce uh Senate
 
00:41:59.230 --> 00:41:59.240 align:start position:0%
Bill 471 um relative to the speed limits
 
00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:01.240 align:start position:0%
um the bill itself as you'll see on the
 
00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:02.680 align:start position:0%
first page is pretty simple it
 
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
introduced in into the statute a middle
 
00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:08.720 align:start position:0%
ground speed limit in Statue between the
 
00:42:14.349 --> 00:42:14.359 align:start position:0%
35 and the 55 um this bill uh is
 
00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:16.240 align:start position:0%
necessary because the Department of
 
00:42:17.829 --> 00:42:17.839 align:start position:0%
Transportation needs legislative
 
00:42:20.349 --> 00:42:20.359 align:start position:0%
authority to set 45 miles an hour
 
00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:24.040 align:start position:0%
instead of 55 um under current
 
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
statute um there's a distinction between
 
00:42:28.870 --> 00:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
Suburban and Rural speed limits that's
 
00:42:33.589 --> 00:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
why we get the 35 and the uh 50 55 but
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
there really are just some roads where
 
00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
that 55 no matter what the engineering
 
00:42:41.069 --> 00:42:41.079 align:start position:0%
you know with its template may say uh
 
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
situations have developed where the 55 M
 
00:42:46.150 --> 00:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
hour limit um is really not appropriate
 
00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:49.480 align:start position:0%
for that that road um I will just
 
00:42:51.150 --> 00:42:51.160 align:start position:0%
mention and I'm sure all of you have
 
00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:53.800 align:start position:0%
your District's roads that might come
 
00:42:56.230 --> 00:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
into this situation on Route four coming
 
00:43:00.109 --> 00:43:00.119 align:start position:0%
out of Dover heading over towards um
 
00:43:00.119 --> 00:43:00.950 align:start position:0%
out of Dover heading over towards um
South

00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
South
 
00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
Berwick uh it's it's a good road well
 
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
wellmaintained um to Lane a 55 mile hour
 
00:43:10.349 --> 00:43:10.359 align:start position:0%
but there were just a series of just
 
00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
Grievous fatal accidents on that road
 
00:43:16.069 --> 00:43:16.079 align:start position:0%
over a number of years and since its
 
00:43:19.549 --> 00:43:19.559 align:start position:0%
first designation um as the the Rural
 
00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
Road uh more curb Cuts more housing more
 
00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
housing developments even with a
 
00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:28.040 align:start position:0%
flashing light uh one intersection
 
00:43:30.589 --> 00:43:30.599 align:start position:0%
coming over a hill where there you are
 
00:43:32.109 --> 00:43:32.119 align:start position:0%
and that's where one of the most
 
00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
horrible uh accidents happen so um to
 
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
petition Rollins Rollinsford to petition
 
00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
to have that be made into a slightly
 
00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:44.200 align:start position:0%
lower speed limit was an extraordinary
 
00:43:46.589 --> 00:43:46.599 align:start position:0%
process uh and took a couple years and
 
00:43:47.829 --> 00:43:47.839 align:start position:0%
there was another accident in the
 
00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
meantime um so this would just give this
 
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
tool to the department um they they'd
 
00:43:54.750 --> 00:43:54.760 align:start position:0%
like to have this and the rest of the
 
00:43:57.990 --> 00:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
bill just how things kind of fall out as
 
00:44:01.309 --> 00:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
to the Fine structure and so on and uh
 
00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:03.040 align:start position:0%
and so forth
 
00:44:05.829 --> 00:44:05.839 align:start position:0%
um and uh the department as you will
 
00:44:07.750 --> 00:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
hear um thinks this would be very
 
00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
helpful to them to give them this
 
00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
flexibility um there certainly uh would
 
00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
be a robust process in terms of DET
 
00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:18.920 align:start position:0%
determining a a road that was
 
00:44:21.069 --> 00:44:21.079 align:start position:0%
appropriate for this working with the
 
00:44:23.109 --> 00:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
local communities who are most likely to
 
00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
be the ones who will bring forward
 
00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:29.480 align:start position:0%
requests uh such as such as this um this
 
00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:31.880 align:start position:0%
is not meant to be as a re-evaluation of
 
00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
all of our roads in the state it's just
 
00:44:36.109 --> 00:44:36.119 align:start position:0%
as a tool that when requests come up
 
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:38.200 align:start position:0%
there'll be in statute this possibility
 
00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:41.000 align:start position:0%
of the dot keeping keeping people safe
 
00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
and protecting our municipalities um so
 
00:44:45.549 --> 00:44:45.559 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman I'm glad to talk about it

Transportation committee for the record

my name is Sharon Carson I have the
 
00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:37.240 align:start position:0%
pleasure of representing Senate District
 
00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:40.680 align:start position:0%

Auburn London Derry and Hudson and I'm
 
00:45:46.270 --> 00:45:46.280 align:start position:0%
here today in in strong support of this
 
00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
piece of
 
00:45:51.549 --> 00:45:51.559 align:start position:0%
legislation um route 102 runs right
 
00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:55.880 align:start position:0%
through London dairing it um it connects
 
00:46:00.309 --> 00:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
to exit four um on Route 93 so you can
 
00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
imagine it is a well traveled Road um
 
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
over the past few years I would say
 
00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:09.630 align:start position:0%
over the past few years I would say
eight

00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:09.640 align:start position:0%
eight
 
00:46:12.630 --> 00:46:12.640 align:start position:0%
years it's changed everything has
 
00:46:15.549 --> 00:46:15.559 align:start position:0%
changed when we first moved to London
 
00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
Derry 35 years ago it was kind of like
 
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
you'd get some traffic on 102 during the
 
00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:23.640 align:start position:0%
busy times of the day but for most of
 
00:46:27.549 --> 00:46:27.559 align:start position:0%
the part you really minimal traffic in
 
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
fact there was a beautiful rest area
 
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
with a pump and uh London Dairy was
 
00:46:35.349 --> 00:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
known for its water the pureness of its
 
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
water and people would go and they'd
 
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
bring jugs and they'd pump water and
 
00:46:40.829 --> 00:46:40.839 align:start position:0%
take it
 
00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:43.480 align:start position:0%
home that London Dairy doesn't exist
 
00:46:46.030 --> 00:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
anymore it's gone and there have been a
 
00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
102 it's become in my opinion Fair
 
00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:55.069 align:start position:0%
102 it's become in my opinion Fair
pretty

00:46:55.069 --> 00:46:55.079 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
dangerous um especially between West
 
00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:00.200 align:start position:0%
Road which is right at the Town Line
 
00:47:02.549 --> 00:47:02.559 align:start position:0%
with London Derry and Lichfield and
 
00:47:06.430 --> 00:47:06.440 align:start position:0%
Route 102 the speed limit is 55 miles an
 
00:47:09.589 --> 00:47:09.599 align:start position:0%
hour until you approach more the more
 
00:47:12.069 --> 00:47:12.079 align:start position:0%
dense area where there are businesses
 
00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:14.680 align:start position:0%
and it goes down to 40 now you can
 
00:47:18.430 --> 00:47:18.440 align:start position:0%
imagine 55 people are not going 55
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
they're going 65 70 miles an hour we're
 
00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
seeing an increase of traffic accidents
 
00:47:29.030 --> 00:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
on this road um and what really spurred
 
00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
um the real interest in this was we had
 
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
a fatality um a young man who had just
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
graduated from the adult education class
 
00:47:41.549 --> 00:47:41.559 align:start position:0%
was pulling out from a side road he got
 
00:47:44.430 --> 00:47:44.440 align:start position:0%
hit and he was killed there was a huge
 
00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
outcry from my community um there was an
 
00:47:49.829 --> 00:47:49.839 align:start position:0%
online petition with well over a
 
00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
thousand signatures that something needs
 
00:47:55.309 --> 00:47:55.319 align:start position:0%
to happen so I pulled together a meeting
 
00:47:57.349 --> 00:47:57.359 align:start position:0%
with commissioner Cass along with our
 
00:47:59.670 --> 00:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
town officials to have a discussion
 
00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
about what can we do in this instance
 
00:48:07.069 --> 00:48:07.079 align:start position:0%
can we slow down the traffic he informed
 
00:48:10.309 --> 00:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
us of this bill and told us this is
 
00:48:12.349 --> 00:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
coming through it's p the Senate we need
 
00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:15.640 align:start position:0%
it to pass the house so I'm here to ask
 
00:48:19.030 --> 00:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
you to please pass this bill it would
 
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
give the state the ability to lower the
 
00:48:25.309 --> 00:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
the speed limit on Route 102 in London
 
00:48:29.870 --> 00:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
Dairy and help to make it safer for our
 
00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
communities I I think a big problem is
 
00:48:34.829 --> 00:48:34.839 align:start position:0%
the drivers as well everybody's in a big
 
00:48:37.589 --> 00:48:37.599 align:start position:0%
hurry to get everywhere and people are
 
00:48:40.829 --> 00:48:40.839 align:start position:0%
disregarding what are the long terms of
 
00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
the road um I can't tell you the number
 
00:48:45.549 --> 00:48:45.559 align:start position:0%
of times I've been on Route 102 and I've
 
00:48:48.829 --> 00:48:48.839 align:start position:0%
been passed on the right side um we've
 
00:48:51.750 --> 00:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
been we've talked about can we expand
 
00:48:55.789 --> 00:48:55.799 align:start position:0%
102 in this area and have turn Lanes
 
00:48:58.190 --> 00:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
well no I don't think that's going to
 
00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
work because of eminent domain they're
 
00:49:03.230 --> 00:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
going to have to go in and take property
 
00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
and I think all of you know how
 
00:49:07.309 --> 00:49:07.319 align:start position:0%
difficult it is so it seems the best
 
00:49:09.990 --> 00:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
thing that we can do at this point is to
 
00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:13.240 align:start position:0%
lower the speed limit we also have uh
 
00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:15.880 align:start position:0%
you know police are willing to enforce
 
00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
but one of the things that I learned
 
00:49:19.789 --> 00:49:19.799 align:start position:0%
during this meeting was we had our fire
 
00:49:23.069 --> 00:49:23.079 align:start position:0%
chief there and we built a new fire
 
00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
station along
 
00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:29.960 align:start position:0%
102 they had at times they can't get out
 
00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
they can't get out onto 102 that they
 
00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
have to actually go around the backway
 
00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:40.520 align:start position:0%
to get on to 102 because we cover um 93
 
00:49:42.430 --> 00:49:42.440 align:start position:0%
when there are automobile
 
00:49:45.870 --> 00:49:45.880 align:start position:0%
accidents and I see that as minutes lost
 
00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
in saving lives so please I'm asking you
 
00:49:52.990 --> 00:49:53.000 align:start position:0%
can we lower the the speed limit can you
 
00:49:56.109 --> 00:49:56.119 align:start position:0%
support this legislation and help a town
 
00:49:57.230 --> 00:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
like London
 
00:49:59.910 --> 00:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
that's really struggling with traffic
 
00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:03.160 align:start position:0%
issues on 102 and please pass this bill
 
00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
so we can lower the speed limit thank
 
00:50:06.670 --> 00:50:06.680 align:start position:0%
you very
 
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
much thank you any questions from the
 
00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:13.160 align:start position:0%
committee I I just have one um not to be
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
argumentative the bill is specific to
 
00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:17.720 align:start position:0%
unimproved rural highways and I'm just
 
00:50:19.309 --> 00:50:19.319 align:start position:0%
curious if the section of Road you were
 
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
just referring to from West Road to Exit
 
00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:25.000 align:start position:0%
4 most of what I know of 102 is improved
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
um we were thank you for the question Mr
 
00:50:29.950 --> 00:50:29.960 align:start position:0%
chairman we were told that this bill
 
00:50:31.549 --> 00:50:31.559 align:start position:0%
would fix the problem from the
 
00:50:34.710 --> 00:50:34.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner so um I also have here and
 
00:50:37.069 --> 00:50:37.079 align:start position:0%
I can make available because I can get
 
00:50:41.069 --> 00:50:41.079 align:start position:0%
um uh I can get the information again
 
00:50:43.309 --> 00:50:43.319 align:start position:0%
this was an analysis that was done in
 
00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
March of this year and it's an accident
 
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
analysis of um Na it's called Nashville
 
00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
Road that's what it was known years ago
 
00:50:53.109 --> 00:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
um and I'll just submit it to the
 
00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
committee when my husband was young um
 
00:50:58.349 --> 00:50:58.359 align:start position:0%
they used to come up to London Dairy to
 
00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
this pool store and that part of 102 was
 
00:51:03.390 --> 00:51:03.400 align:start position:0%
actually a dirt road back in the early
 
00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:05.069 align:start position:0%
actually a dirt road back in the early
1960s

00:51:05.069 --> 00:51:05.079 align:start position:0%
1960s
 
00:51:07.309 --> 00:51:07.319 align:start position:0%

00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
a you know you know a a very um a much
 
00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
less busy road than it is now um the in
 
00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
my town there are three um Key Road
 
00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
Crossings North Road Middle Road South
 
00:52:40.910 --> 00:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
Road that's how brentwood's built um and
 
00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:43.240 align:start position:0%
along that stretch there are many curb
 
00:52:46.589 --> 00:52:46.599 align:start position:0%
cuts um there are many businesses there
 
00:52:49.230 --> 00:52:49.240 align:start position:0%
are homes where there are still school
 
00:52:52.030 --> 00:52:52.040 align:start position:0%
bus stops um and increasingly number of
 
00:52:53.910 --> 00:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
developments that directly attach to the
 
00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
road um it is Zone commercial
 
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
um uh and I understand that it that it
 
00:53:02.069 --> 00:53:02.079 align:start position:0%
would qualify under the definition for
 
00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
this again from the Department of
 
00:53:06.990 --> 00:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
Transportation um it's it's become so
 
00:53:09.230 --> 00:53:09.240 align:start position:0%
dangerous um that a lot of people just
 
00:53:11.109 --> 00:53:11.119 align:start position:0%
avoid Crossing it other than at the one
 
00:53:13.069 --> 00:53:13.079 align:start position:0%
light that's been installed a few years
 
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
ago um there's almost almost annually
 
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
one or more fatal accidents on that
 
00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:19.640 align:start position:0%
stretch of road and there there's
 
00:53:21.549 --> 00:53:21.559 align:start position:0%
currently a an intersection that they're
 
00:53:23.829 --> 00:53:23.839 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what to do with um
 
00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
so at those Town
 
00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
meetings um the Department of
 
00:53:29.589 --> 00:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
Transportation actually raised this bill
 
00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:31.640 align:start position:0%
as something that they needed in order
 
00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
to address the the speed problem as part
 
00:53:36.950 --> 00:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
of not the entire solution to to what's
 
00:53:40.349 --> 00:53:40.359 align:start position:0%
going what's going on in our town
 
00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
um the reason they said this is needed
 
00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
and and I think this is important is uh
 
00:53:48.109 --> 00:53:48.119 align:start position:0%
the only other way to lower the speed
 
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
limit is to do a a speed study of the
 
00:53:54.069 --> 00:53:54.079 align:start position:0%
road and basically they said we use this
 
00:53:56.910 --> 00:53:56.920 align:start position:0%
I guess what's considered an somewhat uh
 
00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
Arcane process of the 85th percentile of
 
00:54:02.789 --> 00:54:02.799 align:start position:0%
of the cars going through um and because
 
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
the road essentially is now used almost
 
00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
as a highway um it's estimated they
 
00:54:10.309 --> 00:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
estimate that that the result of that
 
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
would actually likely increase rather
 
00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
than decrease the speed limit on on
 
00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
those section of Road and they they
 
00:54:18.109 --> 00:54:18.119 align:start position:0%
don't have another option the only other
 
00:54:20.109 --> 00:54:20.119 align:start position:0%
option would be to create a commercial
 
00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
Zone through the middle of town and then
 
00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:23.720 align:start position:0%
that would drop the speed limit down to
 
00:54:26.589 --> 00:54:26.599 align:start position:0%
35 which I don't think any of us think
 
00:54:28.589 --> 00:54:28.599 align:start position:0%
is the is the right number so this
 
00:54:31.109 --> 00:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
basically provides an option that the
 
00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:34.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation said uh
 
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
again there will be studies I I assume
 
00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:39.720 align:start position:0%
but but that that they think would be uh
 
00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
applicable to the situation going on in
 
00:54:43.589 --> 00:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
Brentwood and hopefully you know
 
00:54:45.870 --> 00:54:45.880 align:start position:0%
contribute to making this this road um
 
00:54:49.710 --> 00:54:49.720 align:start position:0%
somewhat safer um than it is today so
 
00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll end with that but I'm glad to
 
00:54:53.309 --> 00:54:53.319 align:start position:0%
take any questions to the extent that I
 
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
can answer them thank you any questions
 
00:54:59.549 --> 00:54:59.559 align:start position:0%
from the committee seeing none thank
 
00:55:02.829 --> 00:55:02.839 align:start position:0%
you representative of St Clair thank you
 
00:55:06.789 --> 00:55:06.799 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um I just glanced at the uh
 
00:55:09.150 --> 00:55:09.160 align:start position:0%
causation of accidents that report that
 
00:55:11.069 --> 00:55:11.079 align:start position:0%
the uh Senator gave us did you have a
 
00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:12.440 align:start position:0%
chance to look at
 
00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
that I have not like I said uh
 
00:55:16.789 --> 00:55:16.799 align:start position:0%
originally uh my planning board chair
 
00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
Kristen aldred was was going to attend
 
00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:21.720 align:start position:0%
uh but she wasn't able to make it so um
 
00:55:23.349 --> 00:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
I I've talked with her quite a bit but I
 
00:55:24.829 --> 00:55:24.839 align:start position:0%
haven't seen that report is there is
 
00:55:27.270 --> 00:55:27.280 align:start position:0%
there something particularly in it that
 
00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:29.160 align:start position:0%
that I I would encourage you to look at
 
00:55:30.829 --> 00:55:30.839 align:start position:0%
that thank you oh I certainly will
 
00:55:32.789 --> 00:55:32.799 align:start position:0%
thanks anybody else from the
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%

thank you chairman Walsh and members of
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
the transportation committee uh again
 
00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Chris melier I
 
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
represent Carroll County District 2
 
00:56:13.309 --> 00:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
which includes the town of
 
00:56:13.319 --> 00:56:14.910 align:start position:0%
which includes the town of
Albany

00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:14.920 align:start position:0%
Albany
 
00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:18.680 align:start position:0%
um couple weeks ago I got a uh a
 
00:56:21.710 --> 00:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
petition from the town of of Albany they
 
00:56:24.789 --> 00:56:24.799 align:start position:0%
wanted to reduce the speed limit on
 
00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
Route 16 from 50 m hour to 40 m an hour
 
00:56:31.390 --> 00:56:31.400 align:start position:0%
now as it turns out they tried to do
 
00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
this back in uh in September of
 
00:56:37.390 --> 00:56:37.400 align:start position:0%
20122 the Department of Transportation
 
00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
did a major study and they would not
 
00:56:42.750 --> 00:56:42.760 align:start position:0%
reduce the speed limit to 40 miles an
 
00:56:46.029 --> 00:56:46.039 align:start position:0%
hour um when I heard about this bill 45
 
00:56:48.309 --> 00:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
miles an hour I talked to the selectman
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
at at Aly and I think that they would
 
00:56:53.349 --> 00:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
accept this as a reasonable
 
00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
compromise uh I don't know how many of
 
00:57:00.069 --> 00:57:00.079 align:start position:0%
you tra Route 16 that much um but from
 
00:57:03.150 --> 00:57:03.160 align:start position:0%
uh where the the the four-lane highway
 
00:57:06.789 --> 00:57:06.799 align:start position:0%
ends uh and be and the regular Road
 
00:57:09.789 --> 00:57:09.799 align:start position:0%
begins in Wakefield that's the improved
 
00:57:12.829 --> 00:57:12.839 align:start position:0%
section of 16 back in the old days you
 
00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:14.440 align:start position:0%
had to go through Milton and Union and
 
00:57:18.750 --> 00:57:18.760 align:start position:0%
it was uh really a unimproved road there
 
00:57:20.510 --> 00:57:20.520 align:start position:0%
other sections of Earth 16 that are
 
00:57:22.829 --> 00:57:22.839 align:start position:0%
improved but the section through Alban
 
00:57:24.870 --> 00:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
has not been improved a couple years ago
 
00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
there was talk about a major widening
 
00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
and straightening of the road that has
 
00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
not happened um it is a hilly road it is
 
00:57:35.829 --> 00:57:35.839 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of turns on it in in some
 
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
sections there's very little uh you know
 
00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
sighing to it um the these people in
 
00:57:45.710 --> 00:57:45.720 align:start position:0%
Albany are very very concerned they've
 
00:57:47.150 --> 00:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
had a number of accidents the most
 
00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:49.640 align:start position:0%
recent accident I believe was a was a
 
00:57:52.630 --> 00:57:52.640 align:start position:0%
head-on um where a eight eight-year-old
 
00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
kid was was killed uh this is their Main
 
00:57:58.829 --> 00:57:58.839 align:start position:0%
Street this is their Main Street um I'm
 
00:58:01.190 --> 00:58:01.200 align:start position:0%
hoping that you pass the bill and
 
00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
that'll give the town the opportunity to
 
00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
petition the state to to review the road
 
00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
again and hopefully we can get it get
 
00:58:12.309 --> 00:58:12.319 align:start position:0%
the speed limit down to 45 miles an hour
 
00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
um I thank you very much if anybody has
 
00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:16.270 align:start position:0%
um I thank you very much if anybody has
any

00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:16.280 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:18.680 align:start position:0%
questions thank you thank you questions
 
00:58:21.109 --> 00:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
from the committee seeing
 
00:58:25.309 --> 00:58:25.319 align:start position:0%
now okay for lots of answers chair
 
00:58:28.349 --> 00:58:28.359 align:start position:0%
recognizes Bill Lambert from the primary
 
00:59:02.069 --> 00:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members of the
 
00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
committee for the record uh my name is
 
00:59:10.029 --> 00:59:10.039 align:start position:0%
Bill Lambert I'm the state administrator
 
00:59:13.029 --> 00:59:13.039 align:start position:0%
for the dot uh office of Highway Safety
 
00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
and active Transportation with me today
 
00:59:18.789 --> 00:59:18.799 align:start position:0%
is Amanda Joe zeka she is our uh senior
 
00:59:20.829 --> 00:59:20.839 align:start position:0%
highway safety engineer and she's also
 
00:59:22.829 --> 00:59:22.839 align:start position:0%
our internal subject matter expert on
 
00:59:25.230 --> 00:59:25.240 align:start position:0%
crashes so first time to the legislature
 
00:59:27.349 --> 00:59:27.359 align:start position:0%
I figur i' put her in the hot seat with
 
00:59:31.589 --> 00:59:31.599 align:start position:0%
me um so um a previous chair of this
 
00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
committee reminded me that folks in this
 
00:59:35.710 --> 00:59:35.720 align:start position:0%
uh committee do not need me to read the
 
00:59:37.029 --> 00:59:37.039 align:start position:0%
testimony so I've handed out the
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
testimony that was signed by
 
00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:39.190 align:start position:0%
testimony that was signed by
commissioner

00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:59:41.470 --> 00:59:41.480 align:start position:0%
Cass uh and I'll try to summarize as
 
00:59:43.270 --> 00:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
briefly as I can I know you have some
 
00:59:45.309 --> 00:59:45.319 align:start position:0%
time constraints the first thing I want
 
00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
to do is I want to dispel the notion
 
00:59:49.109 --> 00:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
that the dot set speed limits on state
 
00:59:51.710 --> 00:59:51.720 align:start position:0%
highways we do not the folks in this
 
00:59:54.549 --> 00:59:54.559 align:start position:0%
body set speed limits statutory speed
 
00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
limits are determined by RSA
 
01:00:00.069 --> 01:00:00.079 align:start position:0%
26560 Loosely based on the context and
 
01:00:02.549 --> 01:00:02.559 align:start position:0%
character of the highways so there's
 
01:00:04.230 --> 01:00:04.240 align:start position:0%
three statutory speed limits in that
 
01:00:05.829 --> 01:00:05.839 align:start position:0%
statute four if you count the
 
01:00:07.430 --> 01:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
interstates but we're not talking about
 
01:00:10.789 --> 01:00:10.799 align:start position:0%
them you've got a 35 a 30 m hour speed
 
01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:13.720 align:start position:0%
limit for urban residence District or
 
01:00:15.789 --> 01:00:15.799 align:start position:0%
business district and business district
 
01:00:17.829 --> 01:00:17.839 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily mean commercial like
 
01:00:21.349 --> 01:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
101a in that in Nash to Milford it's
 
01:00:23.029 --> 01:00:23.039 align:start position:0%
more of the downtown Main Street
 
01:00:23.039 --> 01:00:24.029 align:start position:0%
more of the downtown Main Street
conquered

01:00:24.029 --> 01:00:24.039 align:start position:0%
conquered
 
01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
environment uh and then Urban res
 
01:00:27.549 --> 01:00:27.559 align:start position:0%
District would be the street system
 
01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
that's here in conquer um 35 M hour
 
01:00:34.109 --> 01:00:34.119 align:start position:0%
would be the statutory speed limit for a
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
rural residence District which is a
 
01:00:39.069 --> 01:00:39.079 align:start position:0%
pretty dense Suburban development it
 
01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:40.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't match most of the roads and in
 
01:00:43.069 --> 01:00:43.079 align:start position:0%
statute speed limits for other locations
 
01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
are 55 miles an hour so arguably uh the
 
01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
legislative body has left the majority
 
01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
of State highways um in that other Lo
 
01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:54.760 align:start position:0%
that other condition and for most of us
 
01:00:57.870 --> 01:00:57.880 align:start position:0%
55 milph for most of those roads is not
 
01:00:59.630 --> 01:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate the commissioner of
 
01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
Transportation does have the authority
 
01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
to alter from the statutory speed limits
 
01:01:06.029 --> 01:01:06.039 align:start position:0%
in RSA
 
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
26562 however that's required to be
 
01:01:09.870 --> 01:01:09.880 align:start position:0%
based on an engineering and traffic
 
01:01:11.309 --> 01:01:11.319 align:start position:0%
investigation and that's kind of what
 
01:01:13.349 --> 01:01:13.359 align:start position:0%
you've heard so far is that more often
 
01:01:15.950 --> 01:01:15.960 align:start position:0%
than not when we conduct an engineering
 
01:01:17.589 --> 01:01:17.599 align:start position:0%
and traffic investigation it does not
 
01:01:19.150 --> 01:01:19.160 align:start position:0%
support lower speed
 
01:01:21.390 --> 01:01:21.400 align:start position:0%
limits uh I want to make it clear that
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
this statute this bill does not address
 
01:01:26.270 --> 01:01:26.280 align:start position:0%
class five roads under Town jurisdiction
 
01:01:29.710 --> 01:01:29.720 align:start position:0%
so the 26560 also says that class five
 
01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:31.880 align:start position:0%
highways outside of compact parts of
 
01:01:35.069 --> 01:01:35.079 align:start position:0%
cities and towns is 35 miles an hour so
 
01:01:36.710 --> 01:01:36.720 align:start position:0%
town roads are either going to be 30 mil
 
01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
an hour in the compact parts of the town
 
01:01:41.549 --> 01:01:41.559 align:start position:0%
or city or 35 so we're only talking
 
01:01:44.190 --> 01:01:44.200 align:start position:0%
about State highways with this
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
buil um the fact that we've got that Gap
 
01:01:50.230 --> 01:01:50.240 align:start position:0%
from 35 to 40 to 55 in the statutory
 
01:01:52.990 --> 01:01:53.000 align:start position:0%
speed limits over the last 100 years or
 
01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
whatever it is that that we've had the
 
01:01:59.349 --> 01:01:59.359 align:start position:0%
statute uh has resulted in I think some
 
01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
arbitrary reductions and loose
 
01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
interpretations of the commissioner's
 
01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
Authority so that if you're driving on
 
01:02:06.910 --> 01:02:06.920 align:start position:0%
state highways and you see speed limits
 
01:02:11.349 --> 01:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
of 40 45 or 50 by definition those are
 
01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
State speed zones determined by the
 
01:02:15.109 --> 01:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
commissioner of Transportation I would
 
01:02:17.069 --> 01:02:17.079 align:start position:0%
say that a lot of those have been
 
01:02:19.510 --> 01:02:19.520 align:start position:0%
lowered that they're not consistent um
 
01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
so what we're really looking to do here
 
01:02:24.190 --> 01:02:24.200 align:start position:0%
is is determine the legislative intent
 
01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
for the statutory speed limit for the
 
01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
majority of State highways we don't have
 
01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:30.880 align:start position:0%
a plan to go out and proactively review
 
01:02:33.029 --> 01:02:33.039 align:start position:0%
all of the speed limits but having that
 
01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
statutory value gives us a tool so then
 
01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
we get some of the roads that we've
 
01:02:39.390 --> 01:02:39.400 align:start position:0%
heard about this already this morning uh
 
01:02:41.950 --> 01:02:41.960 align:start position:0%
and many more throughout the state we
 
01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:43.960 align:start position:0%
can first identify what the the
 
01:02:46.589 --> 01:02:46.599 align:start position:0%
statutory speed limit is we don't need
 
01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
the engineering and traffic
 
01:02:49.309 --> 01:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
investigation to change the speed limit
 
01:02:52.990 --> 01:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
if it per statute um but we would have
 
01:02:55.710 --> 01:02:55.720 align:start position:0%
that tool um and it's not always going
 
01:02:57.069 --> 01:02:57.079 align:start position:0%
to going to be about lowering speed
 
01:02:59.589 --> 01:02:59.599 align:start position:0%
limits I can point to a couple examples
 
01:03:01.549 --> 01:03:01.559 align:start position:0%
um the first one I would talk uh I would
 
01:03:03.789 --> 01:03:03.799 align:start position:0%
point to is New Hampshire 120 from
 
01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
clamont to Lebanon and I know
 
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes is probably
 
01:03:08.710 --> 01:03:08.720 align:start position:0%
familiar with that and probably others
 
01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
are as well um we had gotten a request
 
01:03:13.069 --> 01:03:13.079 align:start position:0%
several years ago from the village of
 
01:03:15.269 --> 01:03:15.279 align:start position:0%
Cornish Flats to lower the speed limit
 
01:03:16.990 --> 01:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
but because 120 is pretty much a
 
01:03:19.109 --> 01:03:19.119 align:start position:0%
homogeneous Road from Claremont to to
 
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
Lebanon we looked at the whole Corridor
 
01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
and I want to say that there's eight or
 
01:03:25.269 --> 01:03:25.279 align:start position:0%
nine different speed limits in that
 
01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
short section of Highway it goes up and
 
01:03:31.549 --> 01:03:31.559 align:start position:0%
down frequently um we asked uh we went
 
01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:33.319 align:start position:0%
to some of the towns I met with several
 
01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
of the towns along the corridor looking
 
01:03:37.589 --> 01:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
to have a uniform 45 which I think means
 
01:03:39.549 --> 01:03:39.559 align:start position:0%
that people aren't trying to guess what
 
01:03:40.950 --> 01:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
the speed limit is they would know that
 
01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:43.480 align:start position:0%
from Lebanon to clont it's 45 miles an
 
01:03:46.349 --> 01:03:46.359 align:start position:0%
hour we didn't get broad support but I
 
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
think if there was that legislative
 
01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
intent we could go back and revisit that
 
01:03:52.309 --> 01:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
another location that's been on my radar
 
01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:54.440 align:start position:0%
is one that was arbitrarily lowered in
 
01:03:58.269 --> 01:03:58.279 align:start position:0%
the past is route 12 uh from Bath holl
 
01:04:01.990 --> 01:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
to the West uh 302 and 10 to Woodstock
 
01:04:05.470 --> 01:04:05.480 align:start position:0%
to the east um Lost River area has been
 
01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:08.480 align:start position:0%
improved it's posted at 40 miles hour
 
01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
but arguably that that stretch that
 
01:04:13.549 --> 01:04:13.559 align:start position:0%
follows the AMC River of 112 is 35 for
 
01:04:16.589 --> 01:04:16.599 align:start position:0%
that whole way and the only part that's
 
01:04:19.470 --> 01:04:19.480 align:start position:0%
really condensed or warrants that lower
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
speed limit is a village of Swiftwater
 
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
with it posted 35 for that whole length
 
01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:25.240 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that tells somebody
 
01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
that's driving that and it's a scenic
 
01:04:29.150 --> 01:04:29.160 align:start position:0%
route that gets a lot of tourist traffic
 
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
that you've reached this point where you
 
01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
need to slow down so if that 120 was
 
01:04:38.390 --> 01:04:38.400 align:start position:0%
posted at at 30 at 45 then we go back
 
01:04:41.069 --> 01:04:41.079 align:start position:0%
let me stop on that so that 35 that
 
01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:42.559 align:start position:0%
historically has been posted for Route
 
01:04:45.870 --> 01:04:45.880 align:start position:0%
112 um this our regulation says that
 
01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:47.200 align:start position:0%
it's because of the curval the KNE or
 
01:04:49.269 --> 01:04:49.279 align:start position:0%
nature of the road but rather than
 
01:04:51.109 --> 01:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
telling somebody at either end that you
 
01:04:53.829 --> 01:04:53.839 align:start position:0%
should go 35 for the next 20
 
01:04:56.190 --> 01:04:56.200 align:start position:0%
miles the better thing would be to give
 
01:04:58.470 --> 01:04:58.480 align:start position:0%
them the speed limit that reflects the
 
01:05:00.190 --> 01:05:00.200 align:start position:0%
the best you condition on the road and
 
01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
then warn them for those curves and tell
 
01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:04.160 align:start position:0%
them that the appropriate advisory speed
 
01:05:07.309 --> 01:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
for those specific locations so like I
 
01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:09.160 align:start position:0%
said it's not always about lowering the
 
01:05:10.349 --> 01:05:10.359 align:start position:0%
speed limits like we've heard this
 
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
morning but it's giving us that
 
01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
statutory value that we can go back and
 
01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
look at some of these places that might
 
01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
have been lowered in the past maybe
 
01:05:19.349 --> 01:05:19.359 align:start position:0%
inappropriately or trying to to make a
 
01:05:22.549 --> 01:05:22.559 align:start position:0%
more consistent uniform speed limit over
 
01:05:24.390 --> 01:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
long segments rather than the patch work
 
01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
that we have in a lot of places
 
01:05:29.109 --> 01:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
today so like I said the purpose of this
 
01:05:30.990 --> 01:05:31.000 align:start position:0%
bill and it and it comes from a lot of
 
01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
the requests we get from towns uh to
 
01:05:34.829 --> 01:05:34.839 align:start position:0%
look at speed limits and and when we do
 
01:05:36.349 --> 01:05:36.359 align:start position:0%
this engineering and traffic
 
01:05:38.430 --> 01:05:38.440 align:start position:0%
investigation which takes some time and
 
01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:40.960 align:start position:0%
resources uh that those that data
 
01:05:43.150 --> 01:05:43.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't support the lower speed limit or
 
01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
change um but like I said when I started
 
01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
speed limits in the state are determined
 
01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
by this body so if this body determines
 
01:05:52.789 --> 01:05:52.799 align:start position:0%
that the statutory value for those rural
 
01:05:55.829 --> 01:05:55.839 align:start position:0%
two-lane roads is 45 and that's what the
 
01:05:57.670 --> 01:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
dot should follow and exceptions from
 
01:06:01.150 --> 01:06:01.160 align:start position:0%
that value should be an exception and
 
01:06:02.670 --> 01:06:02.680 align:start position:0%
based on a pretty high bar of an
 
01:06:05.150 --> 01:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
engineering and traffic investigation I
 
01:06:06.349 --> 01:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
apologize for the length of the
 
01:06:09.309 --> 01:06:09.319 align:start position:0%
testimony but I'd be happy to answer any
 
01:06:11.630 --> 01:06:11.640 align:start position:0%
questions thank you I've got I've got a
 
01:06:13.390 --> 01:06:13.400 align:start position:0%
couple and I'm sure the hands will go up
 
01:06:15.150 --> 01:06:15.160 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind while it's fresh
 
01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
representative 112 if I can ask you on
 
01:06:20.109 --> 01:06:20.119 align:start position:0%
112 if that's if that's considered a
 
01:06:23.430 --> 01:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
rural High rate correct mhm why is it 35
 
01:06:26.349 --> 01:06:26.359 align:start position:0%
mph from Woodstock to Swiftwater Village
 
01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
I've looked at the regulation on that
 
01:06:29.589 --> 01:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
and again it came from what folks and
 
01:06:31.549 --> 01:06:31.559 align:start position:0%
Swift water wanted the lower speed limit
 
01:06:34.670 --> 01:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
and the regulation um says it's due to
 
01:06:36.510 --> 01:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
the curval linear nature of the road so
 
01:06:39.069 --> 01:06:39.079 align:start position:0%
someone back in history in the
 
01:06:41.549 --> 01:06:41.559 align:start position:0%
dot probably had some crashes in some of
 
01:06:43.870 --> 01:06:43.880 align:start position:0%
those curves along the river and said
 
01:06:45.470 --> 01:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
people should slow down so let's make it
 
01:06:48.390 --> 01:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
35 um people aren't I just did the speed
 
01:06:50.950 --> 01:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
report yesterday and um the 85th
 
01:06:54.990 --> 01:06:55.000 align:start position:0%
percentile speed is close to 47 to 50
 
01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:56.480 align:start position:0%
right a lot of those locations so it
 
01:06:57.950 --> 01:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
would be more appropriate if it's the
 
01:07:00.269 --> 01:07:00.279 align:start position:0%
curves that are the problem put curve
 
01:07:02.069 --> 01:07:02.079 align:start position:0%
signs up and then tell people what the
 
01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
measured advisory speed for that curve
 
01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
is but but that's where I'm confused if
 
01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
if you're saying that it's actually the
 
01:07:10.549 --> 01:07:10.559 align:start position:0%
towns that have dictated that speed
 
01:07:12.589 --> 01:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
limit at 35 because of the curvy nature
 
01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:14.480 align:start position:0%
of the road even though most of the
 
01:07:16.269 --> 01:07:16.279 align:start position:0%
curves are gone
 
01:07:19.390 --> 01:07:19.400 align:start position:0%
now how is this going to change with
 
01:07:21.549 --> 01:07:21.559 align:start position:0%
your authority to supersede the towns to
 
01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
increase it to 45 from the 35
 
01:07:28.230 --> 01:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
um to clarify the town's not responsible
 
01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
for that 35 that would have been
 
01:07:31.829 --> 01:07:31.839 align:start position:0%
somebody from the department and back in
 
01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:33.160 align:start position:0%
the day it would would have been our
 
01:07:34.910 --> 01:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
Highway Maintenance Engineers the
 
01:07:36.349 --> 01:07:36.359 align:start position:0%
district Engineers that were determining
 
01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
speed limits uh so the definition of a
 
01:07:41.549 --> 01:07:41.559 align:start position:0%
engineering and traffic investigation
 
01:07:43.150 --> 01:07:43.160 align:start position:0%
would probably Loosely interpreted to
 
01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
somebody driving in best guess of what
 
01:07:49.470 --> 01:07:49.480 align:start position:0%
that should be um this statutory 45
 
01:07:51.589 --> 01:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
would give us the ability to to uh reach
 
01:07:55.630 --> 01:07:55.640 align:start position:0%
out to a town of Hao or bath or um some
 
01:07:58.349 --> 01:07:58.359 align:start position:0%
of the towns in between Benton and and
 
01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
uh propose that we change the speed
 
01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
limit and add the curve signs an example
 
01:08:06.470 --> 01:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
would be uh and and we like you said we
 
01:08:09.390 --> 01:08:09.400 align:start position:0%
don't have a proactive plan to address
 
01:08:12.109 --> 01:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
all the roads in the state um but we can
 
01:08:14.109 --> 01:08:14.119 align:start position:0%
be responsive uh the police chief in
 
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
Wakefield several years ago had asked us
 
01:08:18.390 --> 01:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
to look at the speed limit on 153 that
 
01:08:20.669 --> 01:08:20.679 align:start position:0%
was 35 and from his perspective he had a
 
01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
hard time enforcing 35 because um if he
 
01:08:26.309 --> 01:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
pulled somebody over at 45 to 50 he was
 
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
pulling them over at the prevailing
 
01:08:29.430 --> 01:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
speed which he thought was reasonable
 
01:08:31.749 --> 01:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
and safe if his officers were pulling
 
01:08:33.430 --> 01:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
people over at 60 which he thought was
 
01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
speeding now it's 25 over the speed
 
01:08:37.229 --> 01:08:37.239 align:start position:0%
limit and it's a stiffer penalty and it
 
01:08:40.030 --> 01:08:40.040 align:start position:0%
must appear in court so at his request
 
01:08:41.590 --> 01:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
we looked at the speed limit we met with
 
01:08:43.269 --> 01:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
the town and we raised the speed limit
 
01:08:46.030 --> 01:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
to 45 but before we did that we measured
 
01:08:48.110 --> 01:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
all the curves and we put I want to say
 
01:08:51.550 --> 01:08:51.560 align:start position:0%
over 12 miles 200 curve assets which to
 
01:08:53.110 --> 01:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
me is safer because we're telling people
 
01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
why they should slow down and where and
 
01:08:57.870 --> 01:08:57.880 align:start position:0%
to what value yeah and thank you for
 
01:08:59.390 --> 01:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
that and know it's a follow up on the
 
01:09:01.309 --> 01:09:01.319 align:start position:0%
same question so if it's actually the
 
01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
department that created the 35 on 112
 
01:09:06.990 --> 01:09:07.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not on 153 I'm back to
 
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
112 does the department have the ability
 
01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
to revisit their own decisions if if you
 
01:09:16.229 --> 01:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
say it was done 30 years ago um doesn't
 
01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
the department have an opportunity now
 
01:09:21.030 --> 01:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
under current Law Without this to
 
01:09:22.590 --> 01:09:22.600 align:start position:0%
actually do what you propose because
 
01:09:25.149 --> 01:09:25.159 align:start position:0%
some areas can support the 55 there with
 
01:09:28.189 --> 01:09:28.199 align:start position:0%
the reduced in the corners if do you
 
01:09:30.149 --> 01:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
have the ability now that's a great
 
01:09:31.950 --> 01:09:31.960 align:start position:0%
question thank you for that question um
 
01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
the statutes do allow the commissioner
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
of Transportation um to unilaterally set
 
01:09:38.789 --> 01:09:38.799 align:start position:0%
speed limits um that's delegated to the
 
01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:40.799 align:start position:0%
state traffic engineer I'm not a
 
01:09:42.630 --> 01:09:42.640 align:start position:0%
masochist I'm not going to Interchange
 
01:09:44.789 --> 01:09:44.799 align:start position:0%
signs unless I have got local support So
 
01:09:47.110 --> 01:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
putting that in statute gives me
 
01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
something that I can you I can bring to
 
01:09:50.390 --> 01:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
the town and say that the legislative
 
01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
intent is 45 and um I can be persuasive
 
01:09:56.149 --> 01:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
I've I've raised more speed limits in
 
01:09:58.709 --> 01:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
the last 15 years than I've lowered um
 
01:10:00.750 --> 01:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
but I certainly understand that there
 
01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
are places like a 102 in London Dair in
 
01:10:06.590 --> 01:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
a group four Rollinsford where people
 
01:10:08.830 --> 01:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
are driving just too fast so it kind of
 
01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
addresses both of those conditions okay
 
01:10:13.070 --> 01:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
and and again the commissioner does have
 
01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:14.590 align:start position:0%
and and again the commissioner does have
RSA

01:10:14.590 --> 01:10:14.600 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
01:10:16.709 --> 01:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
26562 uh it doesn't Define what an
 
01:10:18.350 --> 01:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
engineering and traffic investigation is
 
01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
it does require it um but the
 
01:10:22.149 --> 01:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner does have that Authority
 
01:10:24.510 --> 01:10:24.520 align:start position:0%
thank you I've got more but I'll share
 
01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
um any other question questions from the
 
01:10:27.709 --> 01:10:27.719 align:start position:0%
committee I saw representative
 
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
SES thank you Mr chairman Mr Lambert
 
01:10:33.430 --> 01:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
welcome to the transportation committee
 
01:10:36.270 --> 01:10:36.280 align:start position:0%
again um my question
 
01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
is do we have actual crash fatality data
 
01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
that is tied to the specific types of
 
01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
roads that we are that are under
 
01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.550 align:start position:0%
roads that we are that are under
discussion

01:10:47.550 --> 01:10:47.560 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
um I heard a lot about fatal crashes it
 
01:10:52.470 --> 01:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
would be nice to have an actual hard
 
01:10:55.950 --> 01:10:55.960 align:start position:0%
data point that would point to uh
 
01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:57.590 align:start position:0%
data point that would point to uh
that

01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:10:59.910 --> 01:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
information uh amander is our subject
 
01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
matter expert I mean the crash data is
 
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
usually from the Department of Safety uh
 
01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
we are customers of the crash data I
 
01:11:10.830 --> 01:11:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
that our CR our crashes are um very
 
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
difficult to locate actually a a person
 
01:11:19.950 --> 01:11:19.960 align:start position:0%
from DMV is at the room uh who's in the
 
01:11:22.750 --> 01:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
room right now uh we work actively on
 
01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
that um to try to identify that
 
01:11:29.550 --> 01:11:29.560 align:start position:0%
um it's it's hard to pull out that
 
01:11:33.470 --> 01:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
information I did do a uh crash study on
 
01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:36.400 align:start position:0%
i93 where the uh speed limit was raised
 
01:11:39.390 --> 01:11:39.400 align:start position:0%
from 65 to 70 and we were only really
 
01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
able to locate it by town but
 
01:11:47.189 --> 01:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
um and that's where it kind of stops um
 
01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
unless we
 
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
actually get every crash report in the
 
01:11:53.669 --> 01:11:53.679 align:start position:0%
state which we don't have access to
 
01:11:57.229 --> 01:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
right now mostly because of uh
 
01:11:59.149 --> 01:11:59.159 align:start position:0%
privacy personal identification
 
01:12:01.910 --> 01:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
information um then we could do that but
 
01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
that's it's a lot of work for the DMV
 
01:12:07.390 --> 01:12:07.400 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of work for us so follow
 
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
up if I understand you correctly then my
 
01:12:13.669 --> 01:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
question ought more properly be asked of
 
01:12:13.679 --> 01:12:15.110 align:start position:0%
question ought more properly be asked of
the

01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
DMV to get that
 
01:12:21.310 --> 01:12:21.320 align:start position:0%
data um I think the DMB and or the
 
01:12:23.149 --> 01:12:23.159 align:start position:0%
office of Highway Safety both within the
 
01:12:25.470 --> 01:12:25.480 align:start position:0%
department of safety okay I will ask
 
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
that question if I assume we're hearing
 
01:12:31.470 --> 01:12:31.480 align:start position:0%
from DMV about this and if not I'll ask
 
01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:32.390 align:start position:0%
from DMV about this and if not I'll ask
the

01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:32.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:33.910 align:start position:0%
the
question

01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
okay representative a thank you Mr
 
01:12:39.070 --> 01:12:39.080 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mr Lambert for taking
 
01:12:41.870 --> 01:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
my question um we've heard testimony
 
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
before that simply lowering a speed
 
01:12:45.390 --> 01:12:45.400 align:start position:0%
limit doesn't
 
01:12:47.590 --> 01:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily make people drive slower
 
01:12:48.910 --> 01:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
that the conditions of the roads are
 
01:12:50.390 --> 01:12:50.400 align:start position:0%
going to dictate what the speed limit is
 
01:12:52.030 --> 01:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
without constant law enforcement
 
01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:54.280 align:start position:0%
presence um if you do lower the speed
 
01:12:58.149 --> 01:12:58.159 align:start position:0%
limit on like a 102 how is there a way
 
01:13:00.030 --> 01:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
where do you have plans to add elements
 
01:13:01.430 --> 01:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
to the roadway to cause create more
 
01:13:03.790 --> 01:13:03.800 align:start position:0%
friction to slow traffic down
 
01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
appropriately or is this just going to
 
01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
be symbolic or just a tool for law
 
01:13:09.669 --> 01:13:09.679 align:start position:0%
enforcement to be able to
 
01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
use thank you for the question
 
01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
representative that testimony was
 
01:13:16.510 --> 01:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
probably from me um people have been in
 
01:13:18.830 --> 01:13:18.840 align:start position:0%
this room for a while know that um I
 
01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
have made that testimony that changing
 
01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
the speed limit alone doesn't uh doesn't
 
01:13:25.629 --> 01:13:25.639 align:start position:0%
change behavior however um changing the
 
01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
speed limit to a consistent uniform
 
01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
value um gives law enforcement a tool
 
01:13:33.070 --> 01:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
that they can they can enforce town like
 
01:13:37.149 --> 01:13:37.159 align:start position:0%
London der has pretty um robust uh
 
01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement resources and they can also
 
01:13:41.830 --> 01:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
reach out to the office of Highway
 
01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:43.960 align:start position:0%
Safety they do do targeted enforcement
 
01:13:47.669 --> 01:13:47.679 align:start position:0%
grants so um again if this if the
 
01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
legislative intent for Rural highways is
 
01:13:52.350 --> 01:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
45 M hour then that's what the speed
 
01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:54.440 align:start position:0%
limit is unless Modified by an
 
01:13:56.110 --> 01:13:56.120 align:start position:0%
engineering traffic
 
01:13:59.750 --> 01:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
investigation um so I I I would say that
 
01:14:01.990 --> 01:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
this is a matter of the statutory value
 
01:14:04.149 --> 01:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
of the speed limit so it's what your
 
01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
intent would be for Rural I'd say the
 
01:14:10.590 --> 01:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
majority of highways in the state of New
 
01:14:12.629 --> 01:14:12.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I've got to jump back in here
 
01:14:14.910 --> 01:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
for a minute the legislative intent
 
01:14:16.830 --> 01:14:16.840 align:start position:0%
right now is 55 miles an hour with the
 
01:14:18.470 --> 01:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation having the
 
01:14:20.709 --> 01:14:20.719 align:start position:0%
authority to make changes and reduce it
 
01:14:20.719 --> 01:14:21.910 align:start position:0%
authority to make changes and reduce it
where

01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:24.760 align:start position:0%
needed so let's look at Albany that that
 
01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
one raised a couple of eyebrows for me
 
01:14:30.669 --> 01:14:30.679 align:start position:0%
they said it took an Act of God to get
 
01:14:32.229 --> 01:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
the engineering and the information from
 
01:14:33.950 --> 01:14:33.960 align:start position:0%
the dot when they requested their speed
 
01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
limit to go down I don't know why it
 
01:14:38.590 --> 01:14:38.600 align:start position:0%
would be a lengthy or drwn out process
 
01:14:40.030 --> 01:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
and two they were
 
01:14:44.709 --> 01:14:44.719 align:start position:0%
deny so if this passes I
 
01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
guess why was it denied and and and then
 
01:14:50.510 --> 01:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
therefore why would it should be 45 If
 
01:14:52.110 --> 01:14:52.120 align:start position:0%
This Were to
 
01:14:55.590 --> 01:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
pass that's a good question um in 201 22
 
01:14:58.189 --> 01:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
when they petitioned a department for uh
 
01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
speed limit reduction um the resources
 
01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
that we had for getting speed data were
 
01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
um cumbersome we'd have to send a crew
 
01:15:09.870 --> 01:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
out with tubes or radar side um sidef
 
01:15:11.669 --> 01:15:11.679 align:start position:0%
fired radar device or some device to
 
01:15:14.030 --> 01:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
measure speeds at a point maybe several
 
01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
points on a road like one or like
 
01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
16 since that time we've got probe data
 
01:15:21.709 --> 01:15:21.719 align:start position:0%
so we can get not every vehicle on the
 
01:15:24.030 --> 01:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
road but there a pretty good percentage
 
01:15:26.669 --> 01:15:26.679 align:start position:0%
of U pen ation of the vehicle so speed
 
01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
data is a lot easier for us to get now
 
01:15:30.430 --> 01:15:30.440 align:start position:0%
but the reason that it was denied is
 
01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
because we're the statutory value is 55
 
01:15:34.550 --> 01:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't meet one of the other
 
01:15:36.709 --> 01:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
criteria and so it had to be based on
 
01:15:38.790 --> 01:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
engineering and traffic investigation
 
01:15:41.629 --> 01:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
and the 85th percentile speeds were in
 
01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
the 55 to 60 range if I remember right I
 
01:15:47.229 --> 01:15:47.239 align:start position:0%
didn't bring that speed study with me um
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
and and that's part of the criteria but
 
01:15:51.390 --> 01:15:51.400 align:start position:0%
we also look at roadside hazards um
 
01:15:52.870 --> 01:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
crash history and things like that we
 
01:15:55.990 --> 01:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
use a a program that Federal Highway
 
01:15:58.030 --> 01:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
produce called us limits 2 that that
 
01:16:00.510 --> 01:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
takes all the data and then um runs
 
01:16:02.110 --> 01:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
algorithms come up with a recommended
 
01:16:04.830 --> 01:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
value and it supported the the
 
01:16:08.750 --> 01:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
55 um if if this bill were to pass then
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
we can look at the context of the road
 
01:16:12.709 --> 01:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
just like we would in a rural residence
 
01:16:15.310 --> 01:16:15.320 align:start position:0%
District or a business district and say
 
01:16:17.189 --> 01:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
this is an unimproved two-lane rural
 
01:16:21.629 --> 01:16:21.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:23.950 --> 01:16:23.960 align:start position:0%
45 I'm not trying to be a hog last one
 
01:16:25.870 --> 01:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
for me it'll be a quick one
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
one that leads me to my last question
 
01:16:33.149 --> 01:16:33.159 align:start position:0%
will this Bill affect route 102 because
 
01:16:36.750 --> 01:16:36.760 align:start position:0%
every stretch of 102 that I know of is
 
01:16:39.229 --> 01:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
improved this bill specifically calls
 
01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
unimproved good question I think this
 
01:16:47.189 --> 01:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
body has granted the authority to to
 
01:16:50.430 --> 01:16:50.440 align:start position:0%
change um to interpret the statutes on
 
01:16:52.750 --> 01:16:52.760 align:start position:0%
RSA 26562 to the commissioner of
 
01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
transportation and as Senator Carson
 
01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:55.870 align:start position:0%
transportation and as Senator Carson
test

01:16:55.870 --> 01:16:55.880 align:start position:0%
test
 
01:16:58.510 --> 01:16:58.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner Cass did indicate that 102
 
01:17:01.149 --> 01:17:01.159 align:start position:0%
would fit the nature of this bill um I
 
01:17:04.149 --> 01:17:04.159 align:start position:0%
would say that in the statutes the the
 
01:17:06.149 --> 01:17:06.159 align:start position:0%
the definitions in chapter
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
259 uh if you read the definition of
 
01:17:10.629 --> 01:17:10.639 align:start position:0%
urban residential rural rural
 
01:17:12.629 --> 01:17:12.639 align:start position:0%
residential and business district it's
 
01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
not necessarily clear um I would say
 
01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
that the definition that I drafted for
 
01:17:20.430 --> 01:17:20.440 align:start position:0%
the rural unimproved rural two-lane road
 
01:17:22.229 --> 01:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
similarly unclear I think there's room
 
01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
for interpretation and discretion um but
 
01:17:27.430 --> 01:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner Cass has indicated that 102
 
01:17:32.590 --> 01:17:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:34.669 --> 01:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
description U let me go on the order I
 
01:17:36.270 --> 01:17:36.280 align:start position:0%
found them thank you any other questions
 
01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:42.870 --> 01:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
committee okay repres Johnson
 
01:17:44.990 --> 01:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
Mr Lambert um my question regards to the
 
01:17:49.470 --> 01:17:49.480 align:start position:0%
text of the language for the
 
01:17:52.870 --> 01:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
um the text itself so when we've we've
 
01:17:55.669 --> 01:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
inserted section D the new section D and
 
01:17:57.270 --> 01:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
therefore all the subsequent lettered
 
01:18:00.270 --> 01:18:00.280 align:start position:0%
sections should be uh shifted down by
 
01:18:03.149 --> 01:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
one e becomes f f becomes G if you read
 
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
the new section e itself 55 miles per
 
01:18:07.750 --> 01:18:07.760 align:start position:0%
hour in other locations except as
 
01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
provided in E it hasn't been changed to
 
01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
F so is that a is that a typo or is that
 
01:18:15.790 --> 01:18:15.800 align:start position:0%
on purpose or that is an error thank you
 
01:18:17.790 --> 01:18:17.800 align:start position:0%
for the thank
 
01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
you further
 
01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:18:25.709 --> 01:18:25.719 align:start position:0%
C thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh I was a little
 
01:18:31.229 --> 01:18:31.239 align:start position:0%
concerned on section two uh adding the
 
01:18:33.390 --> 01:18:33.400 align:start position:0%
description of an unimproved rural
 
01:18:35.910 --> 01:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
highway but all of the it seemed like
 
01:18:39.790 --> 01:18:39.800 align:start position:0%
all the U testimony we heard before you
 
01:18:42.270 --> 01:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
um including 102 and
 
01:18:44.750 --> 01:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
londondary uh that just doesn't sound to
 
01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
me like it's unimproved roads so I'm
 
01:18:50.990 --> 01:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
wondering whether this uh change would
 
01:18:54.070 --> 01:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
affect those roads at all and did I just
 
01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:01.390 --> 01:19:01.400 align:start position:0%
would thank you for the question um I
 
01:19:03.189 --> 01:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
think what what you heard me say was
 
01:19:05.310 --> 01:19:05.320 align:start position:0%
that uh ultimately this authorities the
 
01:19:06.669 --> 01:19:06.679 align:start position:0%
commissioner of transportation and
 
01:19:08.629 --> 01:19:08.639 align:start position:0%
commissioner Cass has indicated in some
 
01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
of these locations um because he gets
 
01:19:12.629 --> 01:19:12.639 align:start position:0%
the calls all the time everybody wants
 
01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
people to go slower uh 102 specifically
 
01:19:18.990 --> 01:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm thinking route four in uh ra
 
01:19:21.550 --> 01:19:21.560 align:start position:0%
it's New Hampshire 4 not us4 and
 
01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
Rollinsford uh he agreed with as well U
 
01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
both of those
 
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
locations uh I came up with the
 
01:19:29.910 --> 01:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
definition uh because of those are the
 
01:19:31.390 --> 01:19:31.400 align:start position:0%
kinds of roads that we get we get
 
01:19:33.510 --> 01:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
complaints about a lot and and I
 
01:19:35.870 --> 01:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
struggled with it
 
01:19:39.790 --> 01:19:39.800 align:start position:0%
um it been vetted through some internal
 
01:19:42.709 --> 01:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
resources my intent would be the 112s
 
01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
and the the route 16s that that are
 
01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
truly just paved versions of the
 
01:19:51.189 --> 01:19:51.199 align:start position:0%
historic cart paths um but it's subject
 
01:19:52.709 --> 01:19:52.719 align:start position:0%
to interpretation and I think the
 
01:19:55.310 --> 01:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
commissioner U transportation has
 
01:19:56.950 --> 01:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
indicated that a couple of those roads
 
01:19:59.510 --> 01:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
would fit that I don't know if that's a
 
01:20:02.110 --> 01:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
great answer um I I struggle with trying
 
01:20:03.910 --> 01:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
to interpret all of the definitions in
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
259 in the statute and I probably added
 
01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
just a fourth one that's going to add to
 
01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:10.550 align:start position:0%
just a fourth one that's going to add to
the

01:20:10.550 --> 01:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:20:12.669 --> 01:20:12.679 align:start position:0%
confusion represent of
 
01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
SES thank you Mr chairman M uh Mr
 
01:20:20.830 --> 01:20:20.840 align:start position:0%
Lambert um some of this uh research that
 
01:20:25.390 --> 01:20:25.400 align:start position:0%
I've seen indicates that the 85th
 
01:20:28.790 --> 01:20:28.800 align:start position:0%
percentile is problematic in so many
 
01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
different ways and I wonder a where is
 
01:20:38.590 --> 01:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
the statutory authority to use the 80 uh
 
01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
is it 85 I think right 85 85th
 
01:20:43.629 --> 01:20:43.639 align:start position:0%
percentile to determine speed limits
 
01:20:45.950 --> 01:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
come from and and
 
01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
secondarily um is there any effort on
 
01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
the part of the department to take a
 
01:20:52.669 --> 01:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
look at that and see if that should be
 
01:20:52.679 --> 01:20:54.750 align:start position:0%
look at that and see if that should be
changed

01:20:54.750 --> 01:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
changed
 
01:20:56.470 --> 01:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
great question appreciate the the
 
01:20:56.480 --> 01:20:58.830 align:start position:0%
great question appreciate the the
question

01:20:58.830 --> 01:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:21:01.629 --> 01:21:01.639 align:start position:0%
um the 85th percentile historically
 
01:21:03.550 --> 01:21:03.560 align:start position:0%
comes from research that was done by
 
01:21:06.229 --> 01:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
what's now Federal Highway in the 1960s
 
01:21:08.830 --> 01:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
um by um an engineer named David Solomon
 
01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
and the determination that if you looked
 
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
at the the 85th percentile if you looked
 
01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
at the crash rate curve versus the speed
 
01:21:18.189 --> 01:21:18.199 align:start position:0%
distribution curve that the 85th
 
01:21:20.110 --> 01:21:20.120 align:start position:0%
percentile speed tended to be the lowest
 
01:21:23.030 --> 01:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
point on the crash rate curve um there's
 
01:21:24.870 --> 01:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
been a lot of dialogue about that ever
 
01:21:27.310 --> 01:21:27.320 align:start position:0%
since then um a lot of the research
 
01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
that's out there I think is somewhat
 
01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
biased as the research that supports the
 
01:21:33.790 --> 01:21:33.800 align:start position:0%
85th percentile people that do research
 
01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
can can can bias it in a number of
 
01:21:39.910 --> 01:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
different ways um I think the
 
01:21:42.550 --> 01:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
current feel philosophy on the 85th
 
01:21:45.350 --> 01:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
percentile on speed setting is that the
 
01:21:47.550 --> 01:21:47.560 align:start position:0%
85th percentile is probably appropriate
 
01:21:50.030 --> 01:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
for Rural highways um but that when
 
01:21:52.709 --> 01:21:52.719 align:start position:0%
you're looking at urban areas then you
 
01:21:55.070 --> 01:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
need to look more at context
 
01:21:57.629 --> 01:21:57.639 align:start position:0%
um research that was done by Texas
 
01:22:00.430 --> 01:22:00.440 align:start position:0%
Transportation Institute um not too long
 
01:22:02.189 --> 01:22:02.199 align:start position:0%
ago that Federal highways using to
 
01:22:04.709 --> 01:22:04.719 align:start position:0%
upgrade their their project is looking
 
01:22:07.350 --> 01:22:07.360 align:start position:0%
at more like the 50th percentile um
 
01:22:09.709 --> 01:22:09.719 align:start position:0%
there's about a 5 mph difference at most
 
01:22:12.709 --> 01:22:12.719 align:start position:0%
at the higher speeds
 
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
um um we look at the data um right now
 
01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
we're using the US limits too because
 
01:22:19.910 --> 01:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
that's a tool that that's objective um
 
01:22:22.390 --> 01:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
but it's only there's engineering
 
01:22:24.110 --> 01:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
judgment involved as well but the 85th
 
01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
percenti St is very controversial you
 
01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
asked about where that is in statute
 
01:22:32.550 --> 01:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
um it's based on that research from the
 
01:22:34.870 --> 01:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
1960s but it lives in federal
 
01:22:36.510 --> 01:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
regulations in the federal manual and
 
01:22:39.229 --> 01:22:39.239 align:start position:0%
uniform traffic control devices which
 
01:22:41.030 --> 01:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
says that speed limits that aren't
 
01:22:43.110 --> 01:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
statuto uh that a based on engineering
 
01:22:45.310 --> 01:22:45.320 align:start position:0%
and traffic investigation should be
 
01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:52.709 --> 01:22:52.719 align:start position:0%
percentile still have a
 
01:22:56.709 --> 01:22:56.719 align:start position:0%
question oh what was represent
 
01:22:58.870 --> 01:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
Jones Thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:23:01.430 --> 01:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
both for being here um and if I Mr chair
 
01:23:02.910 --> 01:23:02.920 align:start position:0%
if I may follow up on the question from
 
01:23:06.750 --> 01:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
both you and representative c um do we
 
01:23:09.950 --> 01:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
need that term unimproved in
 
01:23:15.870 --> 01:23:15.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:19.590 --> 01:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
things thank you for the question um I
 
01:23:22.470 --> 01:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
would say that that my intent with that
 
01:23:25.110 --> 01:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
was to be that cart path that was over
 
01:23:27.510 --> 01:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
but um hearing testimony today and the
 
01:23:30.030 --> 01:23:30.040 align:start position:0%
questions from this this committee
 
01:23:31.669 --> 01:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
striking the term unapproved would
 
01:23:38.070 --> 01:23:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:41.189 --> 01:23:41.199 align:start position:0%
language that's represent
 
01:23:43.790 --> 01:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
blonda thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:23:45.910 --> 01:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
for being here thank you for that
 
01:23:48.229 --> 01:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
question because that was one of mine um
 
01:23:50.430 --> 01:23:50.440 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to ask a couple questions
 
01:23:53.430 --> 01:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
one is um in the areas where we're
 
01:23:56.430 --> 01:23:56.440 align:start position:0%
looking been going from 35 to 45 a lot
 
01:23:58.189 --> 01:23:58.199 align:start position:0%
of the roads have been mentioned are up
 
01:24:01.350 --> 01:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
north my concern is during the winter
 
01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
months do you foresee any flexibility
 
01:24:08.709 --> 01:24:08.719 align:start position:0%
that during the winter months the dot
 
01:24:12.430 --> 01:24:12.440 align:start position:0%
can lower the rates back to 35 or do you
 
01:24:15.870 --> 01:24:15.880 align:start position:0%
feel there's any concern in during the
 
01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:18.480 align:start position:0%
winter months and these speed
 
01:24:20.629 --> 01:24:20.639 align:start position:0%
changes thank you for the question so
 
01:24:22.990 --> 01:24:23.000 align:start position:0%
the the winter months during snowstorms
 
01:24:25.629 --> 01:24:25.639 align:start position:0%
the statute uh to
 
01:24:28.189 --> 01:24:28.199 align:start position:0%
26560 requires drivers to drive to
 
01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
conditions so the winter months when the
 
01:24:33.709 --> 01:24:33.719 align:start position:0%
when the pavement is icy or wet I think
 
01:24:35.629 --> 01:24:35.639 align:start position:0%
that's already covered in statutes and
 
01:24:37.350 --> 01:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
I'm not a believer that we should be
 
01:24:39.550 --> 01:24:39.560 align:start position:0%
lowering speed limits for those
 
01:24:41.229 --> 01:24:41.239 align:start position:0%
conditions that we need to hold drivers
 
01:24:42.709 --> 01:24:42.719 align:start position:0%
somewhat accountable to understand what
 
01:24:45.709 --> 01:24:45.719 align:start position:0%
the conditions are um I I don't think we
 
01:24:47.669 --> 01:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
would raise any of those rural highways
 
01:24:50.590 --> 01:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
to 45 if this passed unless we had local
 
01:24:52.350 --> 01:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
support and part of that local support
 
01:24:54.990 --> 01:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
would be a um we do the engineering
 
01:24:56.629 --> 01:24:56.639 align:start position:0%
study to bring to a community but we
 
01:24:58.270 --> 01:24:58.280 align:start position:0%
would take that recommendation to a
 
01:25:00.270 --> 01:25:00.280 align:start position:0%
community before we'd make any changes
 
01:25:01.550 --> 01:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
and some of the cases like I said in
 
01:25:03.470 --> 01:25:03.480 align:start position:0%
Wakefield before we change the black and
 
01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
white signs to to a higher value we want
 
01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
to make sure we look at the engineering
 
01:25:09.790 --> 01:25:09.800 align:start position:0%
to see if we need to put any additional
 
01:25:11.229 --> 01:25:11.239 align:start position:0%
warning signs or change guard real
 
01:25:13.550 --> 01:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
limits or or any of that type of thing I
 
01:25:15.149 --> 01:25:15.159 align:start position:0%
hope that answered your question thank
 
01:25:17.870 --> 01:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
you follow up Mr chair last one follow
 
01:25:20.030 --> 01:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
up yep last one
 
01:25:23.510 --> 01:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
um I've requested many traffic models uh
 
01:25:25.950 --> 01:25:25.960 align:start position:0%
and n area and it was always in
 
01:25:27.750 --> 01:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the regional Planning
 
01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
Commission and
 
01:25:31.870 --> 01:25:31.880 align:start position:0%
do my question is has there been any
 
01:25:33.830 --> 01:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
feedback from uh Regional planning
 
01:25:35.390 --> 01:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
commissions throughout New Hampshire on
 
01:25:39.070 --> 01:25:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
of thank you for the question
 
01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
um as we've reconstructed our highway
 
01:25:46.510 --> 01:25:46.520 align:start position:0%
safety section and Amanda is part of
 
01:25:48.790 --> 01:25:48.800 align:start position:0%
that process we've been revisit we've
 
01:25:50.830 --> 01:25:50.840 align:start position:0%
been visiting with the regional planning
 
01:25:52.990 --> 01:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
commissions uh throughout the state
 
01:25:54.790 --> 01:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
we've hit all of a sudden Regional
 
01:25:56.830 --> 01:25:56.840 align:start position:0%
planning commissions and part of our
 
01:25:58.510 --> 01:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
update we talk about all the things that
 
01:26:00.750 --> 01:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
we're working on and this this proposed
 
01:26:02.790 --> 01:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
bill has been part of that discussion U
 
01:26:05.669 --> 01:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
not getting any negative not getting any
 
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
feedback one way or the other getting
 
01:26:08.470 --> 01:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
some head
 
01:26:11.470 --> 01:26:11.480 align:start position:0%
nods thank you Mr
 
01:26:15.070 --> 01:26:15.080 align:start position:0%
chair okay one last one for me and this
 
01:26:17.470 --> 01:26:17.480 align:start position:0%
is why I'll be honest with everybody
 
01:26:19.390 --> 01:26:19.400 align:start position:0%
I've never been a fan of these bills and
 
01:26:22.950 --> 01:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
this is why 26560 is pretty simple no
 
01:26:24.830 --> 01:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
person shall drive a vehicle on on away
 
01:26:26.669 --> 01:26:26.679 align:start position:0%
at a speed greater than is reasonable
 
01:26:29.470 --> 01:26:29.480 align:start position:0%
and prudent under the conditions and
 
01:26:31.390 --> 01:26:31.400 align:start position:0%
having regard for the actual potential
 
01:26:34.030 --> 01:26:34.040 align:start position:0%
hazards then existing in other words the
 
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
onus and the responsibility has always
 
01:26:38.629 --> 01:26:38.639 align:start position:0%
been us on us as individuals the speed
 
01:26:41.189 --> 01:26:41.199 align:start position:0%
limits we have are speed limits it
 
01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean you have to go 55 if the
 
01:26:45.030 --> 01:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
sign says it if there are people in the
 
01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:47.880 align:start position:0%
street and so I see this and would you
 
01:26:50.950 --> 01:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
agree that all passing this is going to
 
01:26:54.510 --> 01:26:54.520 align:start position:0%
do is slow down traffic even even though
 
01:26:56.030 --> 01:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
we a lot of us agree that it's probably
 
01:26:58.750 --> 01:26:58.760 align:start position:0%
not going to make people drive slower uh
 
01:27:02.669 --> 01:27:02.679 align:start position:0%
it's an effort in areas that even the
 
01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
traffic studies don't
 
01:27:07.870 --> 01:27:07.880 align:start position:0%
support such as
 
01:27:14.070 --> 01:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:17.270 --> 01:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
um I I think the easy answer for that is
 
01:27:18.750 --> 01:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
that Commissioner of Transportation
 
01:27:20.750 --> 01:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
struggles with responding to communities
 
01:27:24.229 --> 01:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
that are looking for Speed um reduction
 
01:27:26.270 --> 01:27:26.280 align:start position:0%
speed reductions and speed reduction is
 
01:27:27.950 --> 01:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
not speed limit reduction that they just
 
01:27:30.310 --> 01:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
want people going through slower a lot
 
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
of the the places that we get the calls
 
01:27:34.229 --> 01:27:34.239 align:start position:0%
and complaints from are are places like
 
01:27:36.750 --> 01:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
Albany where the state highway is the
 
01:27:40.109 --> 01:27:40.119 align:start position:0%
main street um the commissioner has
 
01:27:43.510 --> 01:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
struggle with being able to be um
 
01:27:45.189 --> 01:27:45.199 align:start position:0%
responsive to those communities but
 
01:27:46.590 --> 01:27:46.600 align:start position:0%
where they the statute and the
 
01:27:48.310 --> 01:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
engineering and traffic investigation do
 
01:27:52.189 --> 01:27:52.199 align:start position:0%
not support the change um am I going to
 
01:27:54.629 --> 01:27:54.639 align:start position:0%
fix the world with this with this bill I
 
01:27:58.790 --> 01:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
don't think so uh I I think it's um one
 
01:28:00.430 --> 01:28:00.440 align:start position:0%
of one of the things we struggle with is
 
01:28:02.790 --> 01:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
that there's a you heard the bill
 
01:28:04.390 --> 01:28:04.400 align:start position:0%
earlyer of the session there's a there's
 
01:28:06.990 --> 01:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
a culture that thinks that 10 miles an
 
01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
hour over the speed limit is the speed
 
01:28:10.590 --> 01:28:10.600 align:start position:0%
limit that it's not the number on the
 
01:28:13.550 --> 01:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
sign it's that plus 10 and this is an
 
01:28:15.310 --> 01:28:15.320 align:start position:0%
attempt to get that culture to
 
01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:17.840 align:start position:0%
understand that less than the speed the
 
01:28:19.310 --> 01:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
speed limit is a maximum value it's not
 
01:28:22.390 --> 01:28:22.400 align:start position:0%
a minimum value I I did have um a prop
 
01:28:23.709 --> 01:28:23.719 align:start position:0%
that I was going to bring in today it's
 
01:28:27.910 --> 01:28:27.920 align:start position:0%
a there was a place in 135 in I think
 
01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
bath but north of Woodsville where
 
01:28:32.109 --> 01:28:32.119 align:start position:0%
previous commissioner had been armed
 
01:28:33.790 --> 01:28:33.800 align:start position:0%
Twisted to lower the speed limit to 30
 
01:28:36.510 --> 01:28:36.520 align:start position:0%
for an agricultural property well
 
01:28:38.950 --> 01:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
outside the village of Woodsville and um
 
01:28:40.590 --> 01:28:40.600 align:start position:0%
we put the sign up and the chief was
 
01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
enforcing it and then it had to be
 
01:28:44.950 --> 01:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
replaced three or four times because of
 
01:28:46.709 --> 01:28:46.719 align:start position:0%
all the shotgun shells that went through
 
01:28:49.550 --> 01:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
it thought the last one that my sign
 
01:28:51.669 --> 01:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
foran replaced had a note in the back
 
01:28:53.790 --> 01:28:53.800 align:start position:0%
that said please don't shoot me so speed
 
01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:54.790 align:start position:0%
that said please don't shoot me so speed
limit

01:28:54.790 --> 01:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
limit
 
01:28:56.390 --> 01:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
speed limits are pretty sensitive for
 
01:28:58.189 --> 01:28:58.199 align:start position:0%
the drivers in public and they're
 
01:28:59.470 --> 01:28:59.480 align:start position:0%
sensitive for the people that live near
 
01:29:00.550 --> 01:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
the roads as
 
01:29:03.270 --> 01:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
well thank you for your time thank you
 
01:29:05.189 --> 01:29:05.199 align:start position:0%
very much um I should have given this
 
01:29:07.350 --> 01:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
one a couple hours I could keep going
 
01:29:10.189 --> 01:29:10.199 align:start position:0%
but uh without seeing anybody else uh or
 
01:29:11.470 --> 01:29:11.480 align:start position:0%
having anybody else signed up I'm going
 
01:29:13.510 --> 01:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
to close the public hearing on Senate
 
01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:14.709 align:start position:0%
to close the public hearing on Senate
Bill

01:29:14.709 --> 01:29:14.719 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:29:17.149 --> 01:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
471 and we are running behind that is
 
01:29:18.990 --> 01:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
why I built in this time I kind of had a
 
01:29:21.229 --> 01:29:21.239 align:start position:0%
feeling uh just a minute to reset we'll
 
01:29:24.229 --> 01:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
go into Senate Bill 581
 
01:29:26.109 --> 01:29:26.119 align:start position:0%
and representative Waters is probably
 
01:29:31.350 --> 01:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:53.030 --> 01:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:36.669 --> 01:30:36.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:39.109 --> 01:30:39.119 align:start position:0%
okay be uh be at 11:29 I'm going to open
 
01:30:43.070 --> 01:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
up the public hearing on SB 469 relative
 
01:30:45.629 --> 01:30:45.639 align:start position:0%
to allowing surveillance of a park and
 
01:30:49.030 --> 01:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
ride facility in certain
 
01:30:52.350 --> 01:30:52.360 align:start position:0%
circumstances um chair Rec uh recognizes
 
01:30:54.510 --> 01:30:54.520 align:start position:0%
Senator David Waters welcome back
 
01:30:56.470 --> 01:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
Senator thank you very much uh Mr
 
01:30:58.390 --> 01:30:58.400 align:start position:0%
chairman Senator David Waters District 4
 
01:31:00.229 --> 01:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
introducing Senate Bill
 
01:31:02.709 --> 01:31:02.719 align:start position:0%
469 relative to allowing surveillance to
 
01:31:05.189 --> 01:31:05.199 align:start position:0%
the park ride facility in certain uh
 
01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
circumstances this bill is a request of
 
01:31:11.470 --> 01:31:11.480 align:start position:0%
of the department um trying to uh amend
 
01:31:15.270 --> 01:31:15.280 align:start position:0%
our existing statute on surveillance um
 
01:31:17.470 --> 01:31:17.480 align:start position:0%
uh that of entities that at least or
 
01:31:19.390 --> 01:31:19.400 align:start position:0%
otherwise operate on behalf of the
 
01:31:20.870 --> 01:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
department which means your Park and
 
01:31:24.550 --> 01:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
Ride um facilities now I will back up
 
01:31:25.750 --> 01:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
just a moment to talk about it
 
01:31:27.669 --> 01:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
surveillance in general I've worked for
 
01:31:29.590 --> 01:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
many many years with representative Kirk
 
01:31:31.510 --> 01:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
on privacy and surveillance issues
 
01:31:34.109 --> 01:31:34.119 align:start position:0%
because we know how Bedrock important
 
01:31:37.669 --> 01:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
that is um what we are in a situation um
 
01:31:39.669 --> 01:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
now is that private businesses that have
 
01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
a parking lot can have that kind of
 
01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
surveillance of it and what what uh this
 
01:31:47.910 --> 01:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
bill aims to do is to let private
 
01:31:50.350 --> 01:31:50.360 align:start position:0%
entities I'll mention C&amp;J Bus Lines
 
01:31:54.149 --> 01:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
because they're in in my area and uh you
 
01:31:56.350 --> 01:31:56.360 align:start position:0%
all know Jim jalbert from the
 
01:31:58.709 --> 01:31:58.719 align:start position:0%
Transportation Council um that's his
 
01:32:02.430 --> 01:32:02.440 align:start position:0%
company and uh so in and over or down in
 
01:32:04.510 --> 01:32:04.520 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth or down in Seabrook now but
 
01:32:06.390 --> 01:32:06.400 align:start position:0%
it's not just him it's others who do the
 
01:32:08.510 --> 01:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
leasing of the park and ride um
 
01:32:11.350 --> 01:32:11.360 align:start position:0%
facilities uh right now because we don't
 
01:32:15.109 --> 01:32:15.119 align:start position:0%
have this um opportunity in in statute
 
01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
um they can't use the possibility of
 
01:32:20.750 --> 01:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
surveillance to keep customers safe and
 
01:32:24.310 --> 01:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
their property safe what we' and I think
 
01:32:26.669 --> 01:32:26.679 align:start position:0%
they should I mean I I I I think that
 
01:32:27.950 --> 01:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
they really should it's so the people
 
01:32:29.629 --> 01:32:29.639 align:start position:0%
who use those Park and Ride facilities
 
01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
want to get in a bus and come back and
 
01:32:34.149 --> 01:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
have their car um be safe what we have
 
01:32:36.629 --> 01:32:36.639 align:start position:0%
built into this statute are the kind of
 
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate privacy
 
01:32:42.070 --> 01:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
protections how long can one of these
 
01:32:45.270 --> 01:32:45.280 align:start position:0%
surveillance tapes be kept now if you're
 
01:32:46.950 --> 01:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
a private business you can keep it about
 
01:32:49.229 --> 01:32:49.239 align:start position:0%
forever if you want but it's important
 
01:32:51.629 --> 01:32:51.639 align:start position:0%
to have restrictions on that and then
 
01:32:53.470 --> 01:32:53.480 align:start position:0%
who would have access to it important to
 
01:32:56.189 --> 01:32:56.199 align:start position:0%
have restri restrictions on that as well
 
01:32:58.030 --> 01:32:58.040 align:start position:0%
what the bill would allow is a police
 
01:33:01.030 --> 01:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
department to go to the operator of the
 
01:33:03.510 --> 01:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
of the lot and to have access if there's
 
01:33:06.669 --> 01:33:06.679 align:start position:0%
a criminal Cain now what would have to
 
01:33:08.709 --> 01:33:08.719 align:start position:0%
happen is they have to go through the
 
01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
department and then go through through
 
01:33:13.430 --> 01:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
the department through the operator to
 
01:33:14.629 --> 01:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
the police
 
01:33:17.149 --> 01:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
department um so that seems like an
 
01:33:17.159 --> 01:33:18.470 align:start position:0%
department um so that seems like an
unnecessary

01:33:18.470 --> 01:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
unnecessary
 
01:33:21.270 --> 01:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
cumbersome uh procedure we have folks
 
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
here from uh do who can talk a lot more
 
01:33:27.310 --> 01:33:27.320 align:start position:0%
about the particular samples but I think
 
01:33:29.550 --> 01:33:29.560 align:start position:0%
it's a a reasonable accommodation for
 
01:33:32.229 --> 01:33:32.239 align:start position:0%
our concerns about uh privacy and
 
01:33:34.950 --> 01:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
surveillance uh that if you are a
 
01:33:36.870 --> 01:33:36.880 align:start position:0%
private entity there's leasing a lot and
 
01:33:38.910 --> 01:33:38.920 align:start position:0%
you could do this anyways if it was your
 
01:33:40.629 --> 01:33:40.639 align:start position:0%
own lot but because you're leased you
 
01:33:43.470 --> 01:33:43.480 align:start position:0%
can't I think we ought to have some
 
01:33:45.470 --> 01:33:45.480 align:start position:0%
common sense accommodation and thank you
 
01:33:48.910 --> 01:33:48.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and I am expected back in my
 
01:33:50.310 --> 01:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
hearing so i' be glad if there is a
 
01:33:52.109 --> 01:33:52.119 align:start position:0%
question for me but I if you wouldn't
 
01:33:55.390 --> 01:33:55.400 align:start position:0%
mind going to the do folks
 
01:33:58.189 --> 01:33:58.199 align:start position:0%
okay you have one quick
 
01:34:01.270 --> 01:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
question representative Hill uh could
 
01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
you speak to the Constitutional
 
01:34:06.189 --> 01:34:06.199 align:start position:0%
Amendment we recently passed that said
 
01:34:08.790 --> 01:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
an individual's right to live free from
 
01:34:10.470 --> 01:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
government intrusion and private or
 
01:34:12.270 --> 01:34:12.280 align:start position:0%
personal information is natural
 
01:34:14.590 --> 01:34:14.600 align:start position:0%
essential and inherent I'm concerned
 
01:34:17.270 --> 01:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
about the storage part of
 
01:34:20.390 --> 01:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
this bill yeah uh thanks for the
 
01:34:22.910 --> 01:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
question um you know it's interesting
 
01:34:25.270 --> 01:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
because in fact this is not a you know
 
01:34:27.910 --> 01:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
it's a leased facility and so business
 
01:34:30.709 --> 01:34:30.719 align:start position:0%
operating a parking lot now that
 
01:34:33.109 --> 01:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
constitutional provision would not would
 
01:34:36.350 --> 01:34:36.360 align:start position:0%
not apply um it I do think that this
 
01:34:38.270 --> 01:34:38.280 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:34:41.550 --> 01:34:41.560 align:start position:0%
permissible um given the restraints that
 
01:34:44.149 --> 01:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
are in here it is only for law
 
01:34:47.350 --> 01:34:47.360 align:start position:0%
enforcement purposes that that tape can
 
01:34:49.990 --> 01:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
be accessed because there has been a
 
01:34:52.390 --> 01:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
criminal activity there's been potential
 
01:34:54.430 --> 01:34:54.440 align:start position:0%
potentially Criminal activ
 
01:34:57.510 --> 01:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
reported so I I my I mean not being a
 
01:34:59.229 --> 01:34:59.239 align:start position:0%
constitutional lawyer but I I do think
 
01:35:01.470 --> 01:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
that the uh protection of Provisions
 
01:35:03.629 --> 01:35:03.639 align:start position:0%
here for this these circumstances would
 
01:35:06.430 --> 01:35:06.440 align:start position:0%
not um come into conflict with that
 
01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:11.310 align:start position:0%
not um come into conflict with that
constitutional

01:35:11.310 --> 01:35:11.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:14.830 --> 01:35:14.840 align:start position:0%
provision thank you thank you
 
01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
Senator chair and I would like to
 
01:35:19.470 --> 01:35:19.480 align:start position:0%
recognize Shelley
 
01:35:22.070 --> 01:35:22.080 align:start position:0%
Winters who is in support of the bill
 
01:35:24.629 --> 01:35:24.639 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire deal
 
01:35:27.669 --> 01:35:27.679 align:start position:0%
requesting five minutes
 
01:35:29.870 --> 01:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you and for the record my
 
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
name is Shelley Winters I'm the director
 
01:35:33.629 --> 01:35:33.639 align:start position:0%
of Aeronautics Rail and Transit at the
 
01:35:35.910 --> 01:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation and as
 
01:35:37.390 --> 01:35:37.400 align:start position:0%
Senator water said the department is in
 
01:35:40.149 --> 01:35:40.159 align:start position:0%
favor of this and requested this um what
 
01:35:42.270 --> 01:35:42.280 align:start position:0%
we're looking to do is basically restore
 
01:35:44.709 --> 01:35:44.719 align:start position:0%
provide the rights of private businesses
 
01:35:46.830 --> 01:35:46.840 align:start position:0%
that are entering into agreements with
 
01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
the state um we don't feel like they
 
01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
should be penalized for entering to an
 
01:35:52.709 --> 01:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
agreements with the state and standing
 
01:35:55.470 --> 01:35:55.480 align:start position:0%
in the shoes to help facilitate safe
 
01:35:57.189 --> 01:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
passenger transportation and in this
 
01:35:59.310 --> 01:35:59.320 align:start position:0%
case we're mostly talking about uh bus
 
01:36:01.950 --> 01:36:01.960 align:start position:0%
companies that are managing the the nine
 
01:36:03.830 --> 01:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
up to nine state owned parking ride lots
 
01:36:05.870 --> 01:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
and bus terminals that have a heavy
 
01:36:07.350 --> 01:36:07.360 align:start position:0%
Transit presence we're talking about
 
01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
hundreds and thousands of New Hampshire
 
01:36:11.310 --> 01:36:11.320 align:start position:0%
residents going through on a regular
 
01:36:13.229 --> 01:36:13.239 align:start position:0%
basis we're talking about people leaving
 
01:36:14.870 --> 01:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
their personal vehicles there we're
 
01:36:16.870 --> 01:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
talking about people um dropping off
 
01:36:19.229 --> 01:36:19.239 align:start position:0%
their daughters their wives um leaving
 
01:36:20.910 --> 01:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
their vehicles there so what we're
 
01:36:24.830 --> 01:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
looking to do is basically allow them to
 
01:36:27.189 --> 01:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
to follow industry standards similar to
 
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
how um the airline industry and and TSA
 
01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
and airports are now um having you know
 
01:36:35.550 --> 01:36:35.560 align:start position:0%
a safe security system and and doing it
 
01:36:36.910 --> 01:36:36.920 align:start position:0%
on a parallel with each other we're
 
01:36:38.790 --> 01:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
looking to to allow that to happen on
 
01:36:41.590 --> 01:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
state owned facilities that are managed
 
01:36:43.990 --> 01:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
by private entities mostly bus companies
 
01:36:46.470 --> 01:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
to allow comparability of the security
 
01:36:49.229 --> 01:36:49.239 align:start position:0%
systems there so it would be expanding
 
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
to Industry standard um the archival
 
01:36:54.270 --> 01:36:54.280 align:start position:0%
video footage that is retained it would
 
01:36:56.750 --> 01:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
be allowing law enforcement direct
 
01:36:58.790 --> 01:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
access to those images on site instead
 
01:37:00.109 --> 01:37:00.119 align:start position:0%
of going through the department and
 
01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:02.159 align:start position:0%
three or four signatures in multiple
 
01:37:04.510 --> 01:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
days to be able to access that footage
 
01:37:06.590 --> 01:37:06.600 align:start position:0%
should something um time sensive or
 
01:37:08.790 --> 01:37:08.800 align:start position:0%
nefarious uh were to occur and it would
 
01:37:10.870 --> 01:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
allow live viewing by local police
 
01:37:12.590 --> 01:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
departments on site working with those
 
01:37:14.709 --> 01:37:14.719 align:start position:0%
contracted facility operators who manage
 
01:37:18.669 --> 01:37:18.679 align:start position:0%
our facility so um again unfortunately
 
01:37:20.310 --> 01:37:20.320 align:start position:0%
things occur in these Park and Ride Lots
 
01:37:22.550 --> 01:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
we wish they wouldn't um we see that's
 
01:37:24.390 --> 01:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
you know pervasive everywhere right now
 
01:37:26.229 --> 01:37:26.239 align:start position:0%
so again this is just for security to
 
01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
allow um safety of the state
 
01:37:30.709 --> 01:37:30.719 align:start position:0%
infrastructure safety of the passengers
 
01:37:32.229 --> 01:37:32.239 align:start position:0%
using these Terminals and leaving their
 
01:37:34.709 --> 01:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
personal vehicles and belongings there
 
01:37:37.189 --> 01:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
and the bus terminal staff themselves
 
01:37:39.030 --> 01:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
and we feel that this will streamline
 
01:37:41.430 --> 01:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
the process to make it quicker easier
 
01:37:42.990 --> 01:37:43.000 align:start position:0%
for law enforcement as well as the
 
01:37:44.430 --> 01:37:44.440 align:start position:0%
facility operators and bring a
 
01:37:46.990 --> 01:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
comparable Lev level of security to the
 
01:37:49.950 --> 01:37:49.960 align:start position:0%
industry um that these bus operators use
 
01:37:51.950 --> 01:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
at their own personal facilities that
 
01:37:53.870 --> 01:37:53.880 align:start position:0%
they own that they privately own or as
 
01:37:55.910 --> 01:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
they operate in other states and as we
 
01:37:59.550 --> 01:37:59.560 align:start position:0%
talk with our counterparts nationally um
 
01:38:02.669 --> 01:38:02.679 align:start position:0%
so again with that I'm happy to to
 
01:38:04.189 --> 01:38:04.199 align:start position:0%
answer questions that you may have and
 
01:38:05.870 --> 01:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
again it would just apply to the nine
 
01:38:07.910 --> 01:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
listed facilities we aren't asking it to
 
01:38:11.229 --> 01:38:11.239 align:start position:0%
expand to you know 26 or 30 or any in
 
01:38:13.390 --> 01:38:13.400 align:start position:0%
all of the park and ride Lots it's just
 
01:38:15.430 --> 01:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
applies to those that would have um
 
01:38:17.510 --> 01:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
scheduled bus services and that are
 
01:38:21.270 --> 01:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:24.149 --> 01:38:24.159 align:start position:0%
statute thank you so much any questions
 
01:38:26.470 --> 01:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative St
 
01:38:29.870 --> 01:38:29.880 align:start position:0%
Clair thank you Mr chair thank you um
 
01:38:32.750 --> 01:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
does the railroad station in
 
01:38:36.470 --> 01:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
Dover have is that covered by this now
 
01:38:38.149 --> 01:38:38.159 align:start position:0%
or do they do you know how that works
 
01:38:40.709 --> 01:38:40.719 align:start position:0%
there I'm unsure of the the Amtrak down
 
01:38:42.830 --> 01:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
Easter stations I know on the UNH campus
 
01:38:44.470 --> 01:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
they do have security cameras they are
 
01:38:46.870 --> 01:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
not subject under the same statute those
 
01:38:48.790 --> 01:38:48.800 align:start position:0%
are not state owned facilities that were
 
01:38:51.950 --> 01:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
privately owned by um used to be PanAm
 
01:38:54.950 --> 01:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
by CSX and those host communities lease
 
01:38:57.350 --> 01:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
space from them so I'm not sure where
 
01:38:59.229 --> 01:38:59.239 align:start position:0%
they fall my guess is that they fall
 
01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
under much like a private business and
 
01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
entity and would not be subject um to
 
01:39:06.070 --> 01:39:06.080 align:start position:0%
the limitations that that this is
 
01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:08.719 align:start position:0%
talking about right thank you
 
01:39:10.550 --> 01:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
representative Hill thank you Mr
 
01:39:12.669 --> 01:39:12.679 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:39:15.390 --> 01:39:15.400 align:start position:0%
question um it's really a two question
 
01:39:18.149 --> 01:39:18.159 align:start position:0%
how long is this is the are the items
 
01:39:21.510 --> 01:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
being stored um and the second part is
 
01:39:24.629 --> 01:39:24.639 align:start position:0%
you're only asking for
 
01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:28.639 align:start position:0%
um the the surveillance for those nine I
 
01:39:32.189 --> 01:39:32.199 align:start position:0%
think you mentioned what prevents the
 
01:39:36.390 --> 01:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
others currently from being uh
 
01:39:38.750 --> 01:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
surveilled so for the two-part question
 
01:39:41.270 --> 01:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
the first question is um under statute
 
01:39:43.830 --> 01:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
24 days is the limitation in in current
 
01:39:46.430 --> 01:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
statute that the images can be retained
 
01:39:49.470 --> 01:39:49.480 align:start position:0%
for unless they were requested under a
 
01:39:50.910 --> 01:39:50.920 align:start position:0%
legal Authority and then there's a
 
01:39:52.669 --> 01:39:52.679 align:start position:0%
longer thing because it could be held up
 
01:39:54.709 --> 01:39:54.719 align:start position:0%
for a court case so 24 days right now is
 
01:39:57.870 --> 01:39:57.880 align:start position:0%
the current under statute um and what's
 
01:39:59.629 --> 01:39:59.639 align:start position:0%
to stop any of the other Park and Ride
 
01:40:01.470 --> 01:40:01.480 align:start position:0%
Lots from having cameras I'd have to dig
 
01:40:03.709 --> 01:40:03.719 align:start position:0%
into the current RSA we looked for the
 
01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
exemption or the inclusion of those nine
 
01:40:08.470 --> 01:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
locations because they had terminals
 
01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
with more um State more expensive State
 
01:40:13.109 --> 01:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and there was a higher
 
01:40:15.390 --> 01:40:15.400 align:start position:0%
presence of of public going through
 
01:40:17.990 --> 01:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
there so I would have to um look into
 
01:40:20.510 --> 01:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
that about adding adding more if they
 
01:40:25.030 --> 01:40:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:26.229 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:40:26.229 --> 01:40:26.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:40:29.830 --> 01:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
Sykes thank you Mr chairman uh Miss
 
01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:31.430 align:start position:0%
Sykes thank you Mr chairman uh Miss
Winters

01:40:31.430 --> 01:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
Winters
 
01:40:35.510 --> 01:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to remember it seems to me
 
01:40:38.350 --> 01:40:38.360 align:start position:0%
that a bill passed through the house and
 
01:40:41.629 --> 01:40:41.639 align:start position:0%
was signed that would allow for the type
 
01:40:43.950 --> 01:40:43.960 align:start position:0%
of surveillance you're asking about at
 
01:40:46.910 --> 01:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
the park and ride in New London correct
 
01:40:50.589 --> 01:40:50.599 align:start position:0%
why is why is that the tool that allowed
 
01:40:53.910 --> 01:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
that to happen however that happened
 
01:40:56.589 --> 01:40:56.599 align:start position:0%
not sufficient as opposed to a separate
 
01:40:58.709 --> 01:40:58.719 align:start position:0%
wholly separate
 
01:41:01.109 --> 01:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
bill right you are correct so New London
 
01:41:03.430 --> 01:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
was was one of the ones added is in the
 
01:41:07.669 --> 01:41:07.679 align:start position:0%
listed um the nine Lots in there the
 
01:41:09.430 --> 01:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
department right now is in a position we
 
01:41:11.669 --> 01:41:11.679 align:start position:0%
are not directly uh we don't have the
 
01:41:13.790 --> 01:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
staff to directly manage and facilitate
 
01:41:15.629 --> 01:41:15.639 align:start position:0%
the transportation services out of these
 
01:41:17.629 --> 01:41:17.639 align:start position:0%
locations including New London so we
 
01:41:20.149 --> 01:41:20.159 align:start position:0%
have long-term agreements leases or
 
01:41:21.709 --> 01:41:21.719 align:start position:0%
other agreements with private entities
 
01:41:23.310 --> 01:41:23.320 align:start position:0%
that are standing in the state's shoes
 
01:41:26.270 --> 01:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
to operate manage and maintain and so
 
01:41:27.390 --> 01:41:27.400 align:start position:0%
we're looking to allow that
 
01:41:30.229 --> 01:41:30.239 align:start position:0%
comparability to Industry standard um
 
01:41:31.589 --> 01:41:31.599 align:start position:0%
you know vehicles are allowed to park up
 
01:41:33.629 --> 01:41:33.639 align:start position:0%
to 21 days when you have a 24 day
 
01:41:35.390 --> 01:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
restriction on the video images by the
 
01:41:37.109 --> 01:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
time somebody comes back they get a late
 
01:41:38.709 --> 01:41:38.719 align:start position:0%
flight they may actually you know be
 
01:41:40.790 --> 01:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
there longer than 24 days or they don't
 
01:41:42.589 --> 01:41:42.599 align:start position:0%
realize something is is missing or
 
01:41:44.470 --> 01:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
something occurred um the retention
 
01:41:46.629 --> 01:41:46.639 align:start position:0%
period really doesn't allow one to go
 
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
back to try to identify the root cause
 
01:41:50.950 --> 01:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
but I I think repes to your your
 
01:41:52.910 --> 01:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
question it's the state has someone else
 
01:41:55.510 --> 01:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
standing in our shoes who um is looking
 
01:41:57.270 --> 01:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
to do this business and do it comparably
 
01:41:59.189 --> 01:41:59.199 align:start position:0%
to Industry standards so that's that's
 
01:42:00.910 --> 01:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
what we didn't contemplate back when we
 
01:42:02.750 --> 01:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
added New London and these other listed
 
01:42:04.149 --> 01:42:04.159 align:start position:0%
locations is we didn't look at the
 
01:42:06.750 --> 01:42:06.760 align:start position:0%
long-term implications of the facility
 
01:42:10.629 --> 01:42:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:12.750 --> 01:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
operators I actually have a question for
 
01:42:15.390 --> 01:42:15.400 align:start position:0%
you uh allowing surveillance are we
 
01:42:18.669 --> 01:42:18.679 align:start position:0%
talking cameras are we talking you know
 
01:42:21.629 --> 01:42:21.639 align:start position:0%
police you know security cars kind of
 
01:42:22.910 --> 01:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
going up and down the roads of these
 
01:42:24.870 --> 01:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
Park Lots is it both I mean what what's
 
01:42:26.910 --> 01:42:26.920 align:start position:0%
surveillance are we talking so we're
 
01:42:29.070 --> 01:42:29.080 align:start position:0%
talking security I know the wording in
 
01:42:30.910 --> 01:42:30.920 align:start position:0%
the RSA says surveillance but these are
 
01:42:32.550 --> 01:42:32.560 align:start position:0%
we're really talking about security
 
01:42:37.149 --> 01:42:37.159 align:start position:0%
camera system so um allowing a different
 
01:42:39.189 --> 01:42:39.199 align:start position:0%
software type a different uh app that
 
01:42:41.470 --> 01:42:41.480 align:start position:0%
can be viewed by the facility operators
 
01:42:44.310 --> 01:42:44.320 align:start position:0%
so um you know most of them do not have
 
01:42:47.310 --> 01:42:47.320 align:start position:0%
security firms or staff that are driving
 
01:42:48.750 --> 01:42:48.760 align:start position:0%
vehicles around they're really relying
 
01:42:52.350 --> 01:42:52.360 align:start position:0%
on the technology to to be that security
 
01:42:55.510 --> 01:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
presence to try to um you know follow up
 
01:42:57.149 --> 01:42:57.159 align:start position:0%
on anything that were to
 
01:42:59.709 --> 01:42:59.719 align:start position:0%
occur any other questions with committee
 
01:43:02.669 --> 01:43:02.679 align:start position:0%
representative plon thank you Mr chair
 
01:43:04.229 --> 01:43:04.239 align:start position:0%
just a quick question I just want to be
 
01:43:06.550 --> 01:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
clear it sounds like the installation
 
01:43:08.669 --> 01:43:08.679 align:start position:0%
and the management of the the
 
01:43:10.430 --> 01:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
surveillance equipment would be by the
 
01:43:13.470 --> 01:43:13.480 align:start position:0%
state not the the private entity bus
 
01:43:16.270 --> 01:43:16.280 align:start position:0%
companies is is not that accurate So
 
01:43:18.709 --> 01:43:18.719 align:start position:0%
currently right now all of the camera
 
01:43:20.910 --> 01:43:20.920 align:start position:0%
security systems that are in there were
 
01:43:22.950 --> 01:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
purchased installed and implemented by
 
01:43:25.550 --> 01:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
the the department and managed or viewed
 
01:43:27.229 --> 01:43:27.239 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis by the facility
 
01:43:29.550 --> 01:43:29.560 align:start position:0%
operators this change would allow under
 
01:43:31.950 --> 01:43:31.960 align:start position:0%
a long-term leas agreement for the
 
01:43:34.430 --> 01:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
facility operator as the cameras become
 
01:43:37.669 --> 01:43:37.679 align:start position:0%
Antiquated security no longer you know
 
01:43:39.109 --> 01:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
patches don't support it would allow the
 
01:43:41.669 --> 01:43:41.679 align:start position:0%
facility operator to act more quickly
 
01:43:43.510 --> 01:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
than the department going out to bid
 
01:43:45.830 --> 01:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
going to a state contract going you know
 
01:43:48.589 --> 01:43:48.599 align:start position:0%
taking six to 6 months to 3 years to
 
01:43:50.149 --> 01:43:50.159 align:start position:0%
replace a system it would allow them to
 
01:43:52.189 --> 01:43:52.199 align:start position:0%
quickly replace it to comparable
 
01:43:54.430 --> 01:43:54.440 align:start position:0%
standards and then manage it accordingly
 
01:43:57.510 --> 01:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
retain it um as they see fit and to work
 
01:44:00.629 --> 01:44:00.639 align:start position:0%
locally with law enforcement so just a
 
01:44:03.790 --> 01:44:03.800 align:start position:0%
quick follow up followup um where the
 
01:44:07.070 --> 01:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
legislation is currently written and it
 
01:44:09.669 --> 01:44:09.679 align:start position:0%
ident you stated it identifies only the
 
01:44:09.679 --> 01:44:11.430 align:start position:0%
ident you stated it identifies only the
nine

01:44:11.430 --> 01:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
nine
 
01:44:13.709 --> 01:44:13.719 align:start position:0%
facilities would it take additional
 
01:44:16.310 --> 01:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
legislation to cover the other Park and
 
01:44:18.750 --> 01:44:18.760 align:start position:0%
rides in the state where we do have
 
01:44:23.629 --> 01:44:23.639 align:start position:0%
vandalism and a series of other uh
 
01:44:27.109 --> 01:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
you know class A felonies going on uh
 
01:44:28.870 --> 01:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
would you do you think we would need
 
01:44:30.270 --> 01:44:30.280 align:start position:0%
additional legislation or would this
 
01:44:34.550 --> 01:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:38.189 --> 01:44:38.199 align:start position:0%
future I'm looking at uh Kathy M who's
 
01:44:39.709 --> 01:44:39.719 align:start position:0%
who's an attorney I'm not an attorney
 
01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
and not going to play with today I we I
 
01:44:43.470 --> 01:44:43.480 align:start position:0%
would have to as the question was asked
 
01:44:45.030 --> 01:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
before I'd have to go back and and look
 
01:44:46.669 --> 01:44:46.679 align:start position:0%
at that this would be laying a couple a
 
01:44:49.910 --> 01:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
couple exemptions within 236 130 so I'd
 
01:44:52.109 --> 01:44:52.119 align:start position:0%
have to see how how they would lay in
 
01:44:54.030 --> 01:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
layer I can't say right right now we do
 
01:44:56.950 --> 01:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
not have any security cameras in any of
 
01:44:58.510 --> 01:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
the Lots other than those that are
 
01:45:03.070 --> 01:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
currently listed um in paragraph
 
01:45:08.189 --> 01:45:08.199 align:start position:0%
uh under G1 so G1 through um nine are
 
01:45:10.709 --> 01:45:10.719 align:start position:0%
the only locations of state owned Park
 
01:45:13.070 --> 01:45:13.080 align:start position:0%
and Ride lots that we have cameras in so
 
01:45:14.669 --> 01:45:14.679 align:start position:0%
there are in none of the others and I I
 
01:45:16.950 --> 01:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
would have to again look into
 
01:45:19.470 --> 01:45:19.480 align:start position:0%
this okay thank you thank you Mr chair
 
01:45:21.669 --> 01:45:21.679 align:start position:0%
representative Hill thank you Mr
 
01:45:24.310 --> 01:45:24.320 align:start position:0%
chairman um currently we're talking
 
01:45:27.589 --> 01:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
about cameras um is there anything in
 
01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
this legislation that would preclude
 
01:45:32.550 --> 01:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
additional surveillance items I'm
 
01:45:34.790 --> 01:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
thinking if somewhere along the line
 
01:45:37.629 --> 01:45:37.639 align:start position:0%
someone wanted to install uh plate
 
01:45:39.870 --> 01:45:39.880 align:start position:0%
readers or something like that would
 
01:45:43.910 --> 01:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
that would that be um possible or is
 
01:45:46.390 --> 01:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
that is it strictly cameras at this
 
01:45:49.030 --> 01:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
point it dist strictly cameras so
 
01:45:53.229 --> 01:45:53.239 align:start position:0%
additional follow up additional
 
01:45:54.589 --> 01:45:54.599 align:start position:0%
types of
 
01:45:57.950 --> 01:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
surveillance couldn't be added without
 
01:46:02.229 --> 01:46:02.239 align:start position:0%
coming back to us and modifying the
 
01:46:06.750 --> 01:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
RSA I think the RSA as it exists 236 130
 
01:46:10.189 --> 01:46:10.199 align:start position:0%
paragraph one defines surveillance and I
 
01:46:12.390 --> 01:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
think that's probably addressed in here
 
01:46:14.790 --> 01:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
again not an attorney we can go back and
 
01:46:18.070 --> 01:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
confer on on that but rules or something
 
01:46:20.350 --> 01:46:20.360 align:start position:0%
like that though surveillance not that
 
01:46:22.310 --> 01:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of it's surveillance means
 
01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:23.990 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of it's surveillance means
cameras

01:46:23.990 --> 01:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
cameras
 
01:46:25.990 --> 01:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
surveillances for Highway surveillances
 
01:46:29.109 --> 01:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
as defined in 236 130 um Roman numeral
 
01:46:31.390 --> 01:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
one so I don't think we intended to
 
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
change that at all we're just intending
 
01:46:36.270 --> 01:46:36.280 align:start position:0%
to to add on this new sub paragraph
 
01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:37.950 align:start position:0%
to to add on this new sub paragraph
thank

01:46:37.950 --> 01:46:37.960 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:46:40.830 --> 01:46:40.840 align:start position:0%
you you also were mentioning uh you were
 
01:46:42.270 --> 01:46:42.280 align:start position:0%
looking at a piece of paper about letter
 
01:46:44.270 --> 01:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
g with some things listed and I see a
 
01:46:46.189 --> 01:46:46.199 align:start position:0%
lot of of people in the committee kind
 
01:46:47.430 --> 01:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
of looking for that can you make sure
 
01:46:49.070 --> 01:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
that we get a copy yeah it's just
 
01:46:50.669 --> 01:46:50.679 align:start position:0%
actually it's 2:30 it's the it's the
 
01:46:54.510 --> 01:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
current RSA it's 236 uh 130 so I was
 
01:46:56.709 --> 01:46:56.719 align:start position:0%
just making sure I cited the right
 
01:46:59.390 --> 01:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
letter any other questions from the
 
01:47:01.910 --> 01:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you very
 
01:47:03.870 --> 01:47:03.880 align:start position:0%
much thank you for your time and with

01:47:08.149 --> 01:47:08.159 align:start position:0%
to testify so at this moment I'm going
 
01:47:11.149 --> 01:47:11.159 align:start position:0%
to close the testimony and the hearing
 
01:47:13.990 --> 01:47:14.000 align:start position:0%

temporary proof of license license or
 
01:49:24.990 --> 01:49:25.000 align:start position:0%
non-driver identification upon
 
01:49:27.229 --> 01:49:27.239 align:start position:0%
expiration of a valid driver driver's
 
01:49:29.350 --> 01:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
license or non-driver identification
 
01:49:31.629 --> 01:49:31.639 align:start position:0%
card the DMV has issued temporary
 
01:49:33.390 --> 01:49:33.400 align:start position:0%
credentials at the counter for several
 
01:49:35.430 --> 01:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
years for every type of Licensing or
 
01:49:37.629 --> 01:49:37.639 align:start position:0%
identification card transaction your
 
01:49:39.149 --> 01:49:39.159 align:start position:0%
permanent credential is then mailed to
 
01:49:40.589 --> 01:49:40.599 align:start position:0%
the mailing address you have on file
 
01:49:41.669 --> 01:49:41.679 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:49:43.830 --> 01:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
Department in addition the DMV
 
01:49:45.830 --> 01:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
implemented an online renewal process
 
01:49:47.350 --> 01:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
which allows a New Hampshire resident to
 
01:49:49.589 --> 01:49:49.599 align:start position:0%

address or any demographic information
 
01:50:31.030 --> 01:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
listed the intent of this temporary
 
01:50:33.149 --> 01:50:33.159 align:start position:0%
proof was that it would be used in Con
 
01:50:34.790 --> 01:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with their current or
 
01:50:36.830 --> 01:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
previous license or ID until they obtain

the permanent one and this is stated at
 
01:50:40.430 --> 01:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the print out they
 
01:50:42.830 --> 01:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
receive under new Administration it was
 
01:50:44.310 --> 01:50:44.320 align:start position:0%
recognized that this temporary proof of
 
01:50:45.950 --> 01:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
license process is not defined in
 
01:50:48.669 --> 01:50:48.679 align:start position:0%
statute the DMV believes this process to
 
01:50:50.790 --> 01:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
be uh beneficial to the residents of the
 
01:50:52.870 --> 01:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
state and once formalized process and
 
01:50:54.510 --> 01:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
statute so the citizens of New Hampshire
 
01:50:56.390 --> 01:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
as well as law enforcement understand
 
01:50:58.109 --> 01:50:58.119 align:start position:0%
how this temporary proof of license
 
01:51:00.470 --> 01:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
intended to be used and accepted thank

senator but I also believe there's
 
01:51:10.709 --> 01:51:10.719 align:start position:0%
someone from DMV here who would be able
 
01:51:12.229 --> 01:51:12.239 align:start position:0%

Jennifer Bailey I'm the administrator of
 
01:51:40.910 --> 01:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Motor Vehicles um so yes
 
01:51:42.830 --> 01:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
we are in support we requested this bill
 
01:51:45.149 --> 01:51:45.159 align:start position:0%
as stated another cleanup Bill where we
 
01:51:47.629 --> 01:51:47.639 align:start position:0%
realized that the although we do have
 
01:51:49.750 --> 01:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
authority to issue temporary license in
 
01:51:52.830 --> 01:51:52.840 align:start position:0%
the statute currently that tempor
 
01:51:55.510 --> 01:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
license wasn't defined um so this bill
 
01:51:57.990 --> 01:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
is putting in several one to define the
 
01:52:01.390 --> 01:52:01.400 align:start position:0%
temporary license as an actual license
 
01:52:04.669 --> 01:52:04.679 align:start position:0%
um as well as add in what that temporary
 
01:52:06.629 --> 01:52:06.639 align:start position:0%
proof when you renew online is able to
 
01:52:09.870 --> 01:52:09.880 align:start position:0%
be used as um there's not much more he
 
01:52:12.109 --> 01:52:12.119 align:start position:0%
did a great introduction I'm open for
 
01:52:13.709 --> 01:52:13.719 align:start position:0%
any questions that you might may have
 
01:52:16.790 --> 01:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
about the on the
 
01:52:19.589 --> 01:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
process thank you um have we always had
 
01:52:21.589 --> 01:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
temporary licenses or is this just an
 
01:52:24.470 --> 01:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
advent of more technology because I
 
01:52:26.629 --> 01:52:26.639 align:start position:0%
remember when they used to heat seal it
 
01:52:28.430 --> 01:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
after they took your picture your left
 
01:52:30.629 --> 01:52:30.639 align:start position:0%
there with your permanent license yep um
 
01:52:32.189 --> 01:52:32.199 align:start position:0%
so I that's when I first started working
 
01:52:33.830 --> 01:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
there we were doing that we have been
 
01:52:37.589 --> 01:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
doing temporary licenses for I would say
 
01:52:39.950 --> 01:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
I think we're at like 13 to 14 years now
 
01:52:41.950 --> 01:52:41.960 align:start position:0%
so it was with a new contract we got all
 
01:52:43.669 --> 01:52:43.679 align:start position:0%
new equipment and that's when we
 
01:52:45.750 --> 01:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
implemented the temporary licenses we
 
01:52:48.229 --> 01:52:48.239 align:start position:0%
were I believe the 30th state to
 
01:52:50.189 --> 01:52:50.199 align:start position:0%
implement that most States now follow
 
01:52:53.109 --> 01:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
that temporary license first process
 
01:52:55.350 --> 01:52:55.360 align:start position:0%
right so this is self-inflicted any
 
01:52:57.149 --> 01:52:57.159 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
01:53:00.589 --> 01:53:00.599 align:start position:0%
committee representative Hill thank Mr
 
01:53:01.950 --> 01:53:01.960 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:53:06.510 --> 01:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
question can you please um explain to me
 
01:53:10.870 --> 01:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
well the the differences or or how the
 
01:53:14.990 --> 01:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
temporary license differs visually from
 
01:53:17.870 --> 01:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
another license specifically for this
 
01:53:20.069 --> 01:53:20.079 align:start position:0%
identification for any legal purpose
 
01:53:23.109 --> 01:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
except voting section of the of the bill
 
01:53:24.830 --> 01:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
sure thank you for the question so when
 
01:53:27.390 --> 01:53:27.400 align:start position:0%
you renew in person you are issued a
 
01:53:29.910 --> 01:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
temporary license that looks just like
 
01:53:31.950 --> 01:53:31.960 align:start position:0%
your primary hard copy license it has
 
01:53:34.229 --> 01:53:34.239 align:start position:0%
your image on it your signature your
 
01:53:36.109 --> 01:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
credential it's it's an actual physical
 
01:53:37.709 --> 01:53:37.719 align:start position:0%
copy of your license just in paper black
 
01:53:40.830 --> 01:53:40.840 align:start position:0%
and white form that's why for that
 
01:53:44.109 --> 01:53:44.119 align:start position:0%
purpose of over the counter temporary
 
01:53:45.750 --> 01:53:45.760 align:start position:0%
we're saying that you're able to use
 
01:53:47.709 --> 01:53:47.719 align:start position:0%
that as proof of drive and for
 
01:53:49.310 --> 01:53:49.320 align:start position:0%
identification because it has all your
 
01:53:51.109 --> 01:53:51.119 align:start position:0%
demographics all of your information on
 
01:53:55.750 --> 01:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
it when you renew online due to privacy
 
01:53:57.470 --> 01:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
and that we don't have a portal where
 
01:53:59.510 --> 01:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
you're logging into your account you're
 
01:54:02.229 --> 01:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
using a ren number to Access that and
 
01:54:04.030 --> 01:54:04.040 align:start position:0%
we're issuing that based off the
 
01:54:06.990 --> 01:54:07.000 align:start position:0%
information we have in our system um
 
01:54:09.350 --> 01:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
you're only receiving a receipt that
 
01:54:11.510 --> 01:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
tells you that you have renewed online
 
01:54:14.069 --> 01:54:14.079 align:start position:0%
it lists your class and your
 
01:54:16.229 --> 01:54:16.239 align:start position:0%
endorsements and a temporary expiration
 
01:54:17.950 --> 01:54:17.960 align:start position:0%
date but there is no image or anything
 
01:54:20.149 --> 01:54:20.159 align:start position:0%
to attach that to your license so in
 
01:54:21.750 --> 01:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
that case we're asking that you use that
 
01:54:23.030 --> 01:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
in conjunction
 
01:54:25.109 --> 01:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
with your current or previous license
 
01:54:26.350 --> 01:54:26.360 align:start position:0%
that you have on hand so you have a
 
01:54:29.310 --> 01:54:29.320 align:start position:0%
picture photo ID and this temporary
 
01:54:30.950 --> 01:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
receipt is just an act that you have
 
01:54:32.669 --> 01:54:32.679 align:start position:0%
extended your license and we waiting for
 
01:54:36.470 --> 01:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:38.990 --> 01:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
one anybody else from the
 
01:54:41.470 --> 01:54:41.480 align:start position:0%
committee I knew it representative
 
01:54:44.709 --> 01:54:44.719 align:start position:0%
P just got my there we go just got my
 
01:54:46.830 --> 01:54:46.840 align:start position:0%
temporary and I just for the record want
 
01:54:48.430 --> 01:54:48.440 align:start position:0%
to make it clear
 
01:54:51.990 --> 01:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
that to any in order to to renew a
 
01:54:54.229 --> 01:54:54.239 align:start position:0%
license if there's any changes on your
 
01:54:56.790 --> 01:54:56.800 align:start position:0%
existing license you cannot renew online
 
01:54:59.950 --> 01:54:59.960 align:start position:0%
you have to go to a DMV and get one of
 
01:55:02.950 --> 01:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
these With The Changes wait for the new
 
01:55:05.709 --> 01:55:05.719 align:start position:0%
one so just just for clarification there
 
01:55:08.430 --> 01:55:08.440 align:start position:0%
are restrictions that's uh on getting
 
01:55:11.669 --> 01:55:11.679 align:start position:0%
renewals it's only if there's no changes
 
01:55:12.910 --> 01:55:12.920 align:start position:0%
correct you are able to change your
 
01:55:14.990 --> 01:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
height and weight um in eye color and
 
01:55:16.390 --> 01:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
hair color but you're not able to update
 
01:55:18.149 --> 01:55:18.159 align:start position:0%
your address you're not able to change
 
01:55:21.470 --> 01:55:21.480 align:start position:0%

01:55:22.870 --> 01:55:22.880 align:start position:0%

01:55:26.669 --> 01:55:26.679 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:55:30.189 --> 01:55:30.199 align:start position:0%
height I got one one more question
 
01:55:33.669 --> 01:55:33.679 align:start position:0%
um since we've been using the temporary
 
01:55:35.430 --> 01:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
licenses especially the copy ones with
 
01:55:37.229 --> 01:55:37.239 align:start position:0%
the picture and all that have there ever
 
01:55:41.069 --> 01:55:41.079 align:start position:0%
been any cases of fraud making their own
 
01:55:44.550 --> 01:55:44.560 align:start position:0%
copies not that I'm aware of um we are
 
01:55:46.589 --> 01:55:46.599 align:start position:0%
right now you're not holding the
 
01:55:48.390 --> 01:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
temporary for that long um we are
 
01:55:50.550 --> 01:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
mailing on a I believe we're at seven
 
01:55:52.750 --> 01:55:52.760 align:start position:0%
days right now so we
 
01:55:55.069 --> 01:55:55.079 align:start position:0%
do advertise that you're receiving it
 
01:55:56.990 --> 01:55:57.000 align:start position:0%
within 60 days but we are able to
 
01:55:58.950 --> 01:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
produce a license within we're at seven
 
01:56:00.470 --> 01:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
business days right now so you're
 
01:56:02.430 --> 01:56:02.440 align:start position:0%

01:56:30.669 --> 01:56:30.679 align:start position:0%
lucky yep um so we'll take a break for
 
01:56:32.910 --> 01:56:32.920 align:start position:0%
lunch um we've got two more bills to
 
01:56:35.149 --> 01:56:35.159 align:start position:0%
hear this afternoon I assume we'll
 
01:56:38.589 --> 01:56:38.599 align:start position:0%
probably have a little caucus time and
 
01:56:41.109 --> 01:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
um then going to Executive session and I
 
01:56:43.990 --> 01:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
have requested of the ranking member uh
 
01:56:45.629 --> 01:56:45.639 align:start position:0%
when I did our schedule just so you all
 
01:56:47.430 --> 01:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
know why they're not there I was just in
 
01:56:49.350 --> 01:56:49.360 align:start position:0%
haste and I didn't think to put down the
 
01:56:51.669 --> 01:56:51.679 align:start position:0%
four bills that we heard three weeks ago
 
01:56:54.669 --> 01:56:54.679 align:start position:0%
as poss believe being exact so uh we may
 
01:56:56.910 --> 01:56:56.920 align:start position:0%
take those up as well if we come to an
 
01:57:01.270 --> 01:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
agreement yeah and a time and the time
 
01:57:03.030 --> 01:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh that's why I did put these last two
 
01:57:04.470 --> 01:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
in the afternoon just in case they do
 
01:57:07.149 --> 01:57:07.159 align:start position:0%
run over so uh but if we could chip away
 
01:57:08.910 --> 01:57:08.920 align:start position:0%
at some of the ones we don't have to
 
01:57:11.669 --> 01:57:11.679 align:start position:0%
stare at 10 executive sessions on our
 
01:57:13.350 --> 01:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
last day that would be helpful for all
 
01:57:21.149 --> 01:57:21.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:21.159 --> 01:57:51.109 align:start position:0%

district 10 I'm here to introduce Senate
 
03:16:04.070 --> 03:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
Bill 501 relative to driver's licenses
 
03:16:05.990 --> 03:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
for non-citizens R residing in New
 
03:16:08.910 --> 03:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the proposed amendments to RSA
 
03:16:11.910 --> 03:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
263 39a in this bill provide further
 
03:16:14.070 --> 03:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
Clarity to the issue of driver's license
 
03:16:16.950 --> 03:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
eligibility for noncitizen residents of
 
03:16:20.189 --> 03:16:20.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire this bill does not add or
 
03:16:22.590 --> 03:16:22.600 align:start position:0%
expand classes of immigrants eligible
 
03:16:24.110 --> 03:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire driver's license I
 
03:16:25.790 --> 03:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
want to be very clear about that this
 
03:16:28.150 --> 03:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
bill is simplifying simply clarifying
 
03:16:30.630 --> 03:16:30.640 align:start position:0%
language that the DMV already does it is
 
03:16:32.150 --> 03:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
consistent with the Hampshire's DMV's
 
03:16:34.110 --> 03:16:34.120 align:start position:0%
historic and current interpretation and
 
03:16:35.790 --> 03:16:35.800 align:start position:0%
administration of driver's licensing
 
03:16:37.870 --> 03:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
statutes and administrative rules it
 
03:16:39.750 --> 03:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
states with Clarity the classes of
 
03:16:41.590 --> 03:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
non-citizens who are currently applying
 
03:16:43.550 --> 03:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire driver's license in
 
03:16:45.150 --> 03:16:45.160 align:start position:0%
most cases the New Hampshire gmv
 
03:16:46.389 --> 03:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
conditions the issuance of a New
 
03:16:47.630 --> 03:16:47.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire driver license on a
 
03:16:50.189 --> 03:16:50.199 align:start position:0%
non-citizen authorization to work in the
 
03:16:52.710 --> 03:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
US any non-citizen authorized to work in
 
03:16:54.189 --> 03:16:54.199 align:start position:0%
the US will possess a social security
 
03:16:55.710 --> 03:16:55.720 align:start position:0%
number which is also required in most
 
03:16:57.429 --> 03:16:57.439 align:start position:0%
cases to obtain a New Hampshire driver's
 
03:16:59.510 --> 03:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
license and a big reason for this bill
 
03:17:02.510 --> 03:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
was that I had a uh constituent in uh
 
03:17:03.990 --> 03:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
district 10 who was the overnight
 
03:17:07.030 --> 03:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
janitor at our Hospital a job very
 
03:17:09.469 --> 03:17:09.479 align:start position:0%
difficult to fill and um they had
 
03:17:11.670 --> 03:17:11.680 align:start position:0%
trouble getting their driver's license
 
03:17:14.429 --> 03:17:14.439 align:start position:0%
due to uh the language not being clear
 
03:17:16.469 --> 03:17:16.479 align:start position:0%
and this individual had time Hard Times
 
03:17:18.110 --> 03:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
getting to the job because of so
 
03:17:21.389 --> 03:17:21.399 align:start position:0%
snowstorm rain and and these are jobs we
 
03:17:23.830 --> 03:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
need to fill an amendment was requested
 
03:17:25.790 --> 03:17:25.800 align:start position:0%
by the DMV uh that adopted to remove the
 
03:17:26.950 --> 03:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
requirement of proof of vehicle
 
03:17:28.429 --> 03:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
operation in a foreign country for
 
03:17:31.030 --> 03:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
temporary non-citizen drivers
 
03:17:33.110 --> 03:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
license and essentially you know this
 
03:17:34.830 --> 03:17:34.840 align:start position:0%
bill memorizes the process that the DMV
 
03:17:37.550 --> 03:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
currently utilizes and uh paves away for
 
03:17:39.030 --> 03:17:39.040 align:start position:0%
law to align with the rule change that
 
03:17:41.750 --> 03:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
was made and to sum it all up folks you
 
03:17:45.070 --> 03:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
know we had 47,000 job openings last
 
03:17:46.670 --> 03:17:46.680 align:start position:0%
year in April it' be really nice to fill
 
03:17:48.790 --> 03:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
this um there's not a lot of public
 
03:17:50.189 --> 03:17:50.199 align:start position:0%
transportation in my neck of the woods
 
03:17:52.950 --> 03:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
and especially a lot of rural areas and
 
03:17:54.590 --> 03:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
uh clarifying this language will help
 
03:17:56.110 --> 03:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
you get their driver's licenses and get
 
03:17:59.030 --> 03:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
them to jobs um you know I have a family
 
03:18:01.110 --> 03:18:01.120 align:start position:0%
business and I have 10 job openings at
 
03:18:02.790 --> 03:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
the moment and one of the main questions
 
03:18:04.550 --> 03:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
I ask is do you have reliable
 
03:18:07.070 --> 03:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
transportation and I own a car business
 
03:18:08.870 --> 03:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
which is kind of a weird question to ask
 
03:18:10.110 --> 03:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
somebody when I'm trying to get hire
 
03:18:11.750 --> 03:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
them but a lot of these individuals
 
03:18:14.150 --> 03:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
there's no public transportation so uh
 
03:18:15.830 --> 03:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
this is really a Workforce Bill and with
 
03:18:17.429 --> 03:18:17.439 align:start position:0%
that I'm happy to take any questions you
 
03:18:17.439 --> 03:18:18.710 align:start position:0%
that I'm happy to take any questions you
may

03:18:18.710 --> 03:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
may
 
03:18:21.550 --> 03:18:21.560 align:start position:0%
have thank you any questions from the
 
03:18:24.510 --> 03:18:24.520 align:start position:0%
committee representative Hill thank you
 
03:18:27.710 --> 03:18:27.720 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you Senator uh welcome
 
03:18:30.429 --> 03:18:30.439 align:start position:0%
again back here um I'm wondering if you
 
03:18:32.910 --> 03:18:32.920 align:start position:0%
can explain to me uh the cross out of
 
03:18:36.630 --> 03:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
non-resident alien and inserting
 
03:18:38.429 --> 03:18:38.439 align:start position:0%
non-citizen thank you for the question
 
03:18:40.790 --> 03:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative I think there's um an
 
03:18:42.389 --> 03:18:42.399 align:start position:0%
effort to
 
03:18:45.389 --> 03:18:45.399 align:start position:0%
reclassify uh uh these individuals
 
03:18:48.150 --> 03:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
coming to country as non-citizens
 
03:18:50.590 --> 03:18:50.600 align:start position:0%
instead of aliens um so I think that's
 
03:18:53.510 --> 03:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
just updating language
 
03:18:53.520 --> 03:18:55.349 align:start position:0%
just updating language
um

03:18:55.349 --> 03:18:55.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:58.150 --> 03:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
essentially from from the language is
 
03:18:59.990 --> 03:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
being updated from
 
03:19:03.110 --> 03:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
where it's changing aliens to
 
03:19:04.630 --> 03:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
non-citizens because we're talking about
 
03:19:06.710 --> 03:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
individuals who have work permits that
 
03:19:08.389 --> 03:19:08.399 align:start position:0%
are working here're they're not aliens
 
03:19:10.110 --> 03:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
they're non-citizens who are able to
 
03:19:10.120 --> 03:19:10.950 align:start position:0%
they're non-citizens who are able to
work

03:19:10.950 --> 03:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
work
 
03:19:17.389 --> 03:19:17.399 align:start position:0%
here thank you any other questions OB C
 
03:19:18.550 --> 03:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:19:22.150 --> 03:19:22.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question um is there any way
 
03:19:24.469 --> 03:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
on here to prevent these people who are
 
03:19:26.990 --> 03:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
not citizens from voting using this ID
 
03:19:31.670 --> 03:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
card as a voter so voting uh carries a
 
03:19:35.750 --> 03:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
very heavy um retribution if they vote
 
03:19:37.990 --> 03:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
with this they're they don't get their
 
03:19:39.309 --> 03:19:39.319 align:start position:0%
driver's license they're they're they're
 
03:19:42.110 --> 03:19:42.120 align:start position:0%
kicked out of the country it's uh this
 
03:19:44.429 --> 03:19:44.439 align:start position:0%
this this bill which passed unanimously
 
03:19:47.030 --> 03:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
through the Senate I might add um we
 
03:19:48.790 --> 03:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
worked on it um that doesn't have
 
03:19:50.189 --> 03:19:50.199 align:start position:0%
anything to do with voting it has to do
 
03:19:53.389 --> 03:19:53.399 align:start position:0%
with individuals who are uh legally
 
03:19:55.269 --> 03:19:55.279 align:start position:0%
allowed to work here obtaining a
 
03:19:55.279 --> 03:19:56.670 align:start position:0%
allowed to work here obtaining a
driver's

03:19:56.670 --> 03:19:56.680 align:start position:0%
driver's
 
03:19:58.990 --> 03:19:59.000 align:start position:0%
license yeah go ahead follow
 
03:20:05.150 --> 03:20:05.160 align:start position:0%
up u in New Hampshire a driver's license
 
03:20:06.870 --> 03:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
even even if it's not New Hampshire
 
03:20:08.510 --> 03:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
driver's license but a driver's license
 
03:20:11.790 --> 03:20:11.800 align:start position:0%
is valid ID for voting and that's that's
 
03:20:13.510 --> 03:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
my concern
 
03:20:15.550 --> 03:20:15.560 align:start position:0%
there thank you for the question you
 
03:20:17.950 --> 03:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
know um
 
03:20:20.229 --> 03:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
you know we have individuals who are
 
03:20:22.469 --> 03:20:22.479 align:start position:0%
non-citizens with work permits who have
 
03:20:24.750 --> 03:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses already and we are
 
03:20:26.870 --> 03:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
currently already doing this it's just
 
03:20:28.469 --> 03:20:28.479 align:start position:0%
clarifying the language to the DMV so
 
03:20:29.790 --> 03:20:29.800 align:start position:0%
that we can help these individuals get
 
03:20:31.510 --> 03:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
to their
 
03:20:34.910 --> 03:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
jobs for the questions well it's
 
03:20:36.830 --> 03:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
interesting that you bring that up let
 
03:20:38.830 --> 03:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
me ask the first question line
 
03:20:42.670 --> 03:20:42.680 align:start position:0%
five uh who has been granted permanent
 
03:20:45.189 --> 03:20:45.199 align:start position:0%
residence that's already in law and
 
03:20:47.110 --> 03:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
somebody given permanent res residents
 
03:20:49.070 --> 03:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
can already get an HED driver's license
 
03:20:50.830 --> 03:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
they have all their information can you
 
03:20:53.349 --> 03:20:53.359 align:start position:0%
give me some examples of
 
03:20:55.590 --> 03:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
conditional you know you might it's a
 
03:20:57.389 --> 03:20:57.399 align:start position:0%
good question Mr chairman um I do
 
03:20:59.189 --> 03:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
believe someone from the DMV is here and

they can
 
03:21:02.870 --> 03:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh probably Define that a little better
 
03:21:03.790 --> 03:21:03.800 align:start position:0%

for immigrants and refugees is also here
 
03:22:27.590 --> 03:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
with me to just briefly U follow up on
 
03:22:32.070 --> 03:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
um Senator Fenton's remarks um so one
 
03:22:34.710 --> 03:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
thing I just want to make clear is that
 
03:22:37.349 --> 03:22:37.359 align:start position:0%
this this bill pertains to non-citizens
 
03:22:40.110 --> 03:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
who are lawfully present I.E that the US
 
03:22:42.349 --> 03:22:42.359 align:start position:0%
government has given them U permission
 
03:22:44.389 --> 03:22:44.399 align:start position:0%
to be here whether it's permanently or
 
03:22:47.030 --> 03:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
temporarily uh temporarily that's
 
03:22:49.670 --> 03:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
based on their particular status at the
 
03:22:55.349 --> 03:22:55.359 align:start position:0%
time um the uh non-citizens usage uh one
 
03:22:57.750 --> 03:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
of the reasons that the language appears
 
03:22:59.630 --> 03:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
in the bill is because that is the
 
03:23:02.189 --> 03:23:02.199 align:start position:0%
terminology that the DMV uses in their
 
03:23:04.910 --> 03:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
regulations and we thought that the um
 
03:23:07.150 --> 03:23:07.160 align:start position:0%
using the the same language would make
 
03:23:09.550 --> 03:23:09.560 align:start position:0%
it less confusing that's really the
 
03:23:12.590 --> 03:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
intention of the bill in my opinion to
 
03:23:15.830 --> 03:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
um site um language that's found in
 
03:23:19.469 --> 03:23:19.479 align:start position:0%
other parts of the um uh chapter 263 to
 
03:23:23.309 --> 03:23:23.319 align:start position:0%
be um in one location so it reduces
 
03:23:26.910 --> 03:23:26.920 align:start position:0%
confusion people can go and see who can
 
03:23:29.189 --> 03:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
get a driver's license it doesn't change
 
03:23:33.990 --> 03:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
anything it only um situates um the
 
03:23:36.830 --> 03:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
language in one location um I just want
 
03:23:40.189 --> 03:23:40.199 align:start position:0%
to uh mention briefly about uh concerns
 
03:23:42.870 --> 03:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
about voter fraud this comes up um all
 
03:23:45.790 --> 03:23:45.800 align:start position:0%
the time um as Senator Senator Fenton
 
03:23:47.189 --> 03:23:47.199 align:start position:0%
pointed out
 
03:23:49.469 --> 03:23:49.479 align:start position:0%
um there's already mechanisms in place
 
03:23:51.309 --> 03:23:51.319 align:start position:0%
you have to be a US citizen you have to
 
03:23:53.670 --> 03:23:53.680 align:start position:0%
be a certain age and you have to be a
 
03:23:55.429 --> 03:23:55.439 align:start position:0%
resident of the town where you're
 
03:23:57.870 --> 03:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
registering I am not an expert on uh
 
03:23:59.790 --> 03:23:59.800 align:start position:0%
voter law but my understanding is if
 
03:24:02.670 --> 03:24:02.680 align:start position:0%
somebody doesn't have um proof of
 
03:24:04.510 --> 03:24:04.520 align:start position:0%
citizenship there they you're signing an
 
03:24:06.710 --> 03:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
affidavit when I moved to New Hampshire
 
03:24:09.229 --> 03:24:09.239 align:start position:0%
we registered at the clerk's office and
 
03:24:11.790 --> 03:24:11.800 align:start position:0%
I had to get my a long form birth
 
03:24:13.550 --> 03:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
certificate to prove that I was eligible
 
03:24:16.790 --> 03:24:16.800 align:start position:0%
to register to vote so I think new Hamp
 
03:24:20.550 --> 03:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
has um mechanisms in place I also want
 
03:24:22.710 --> 03:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
to point out that voter fraud just
 
03:24:24.590 --> 03:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
generally is throughout the United
 
03:24:27.950 --> 03:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
States is not a huge issue and there was
 
03:24:30.110 --> 03:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
a Heritage Foundation study I believe it
 
03:24:32.189 --> 03:24:32.199 align:start position:0%
was that looked at voter fraud New
 
03:24:34.229 --> 03:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and other states uh New
 
03:24:36.790 --> 03:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for a period of over 10 years
 
03:24:38.429 --> 03:24:38.439 align:start position:0%
had only
 
03:24:41.710 --> 03:24:41.720 align:start position:0%
22 um incidents of voter fraud that was
 
03:24:43.990 --> 03:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
caught and none of them appeared to be
 
03:24:46.389 --> 03:24:46.399 align:start position:0%
people who were non-citizens they were
 
03:24:49.030 --> 03:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
people that um got caught voting in the
 
03:24:51.309 --> 03:24:51.319 align:start position:0%
wrong jurisdiction or something else so
 
03:24:53.269 --> 03:24:53.279 align:start position:0%
this does not appear to be a major issue
 
03:24:55.349 --> 03:24:55.359 align:start position:0%
either in the United States or in our
 
03:25:00.030 --> 03:25:00.040 align:start position:0%
own State um the DMV and we do have a
 
03:25:02.830 --> 03:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
DMV representative here today is really
 
03:25:05.469 --> 03:25:05.479 align:start position:0%
on top of um identity fraud and they
 
03:25:08.030 --> 03:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
have put mechanisms in place um one of
 
03:25:09.550 --> 03:25:09.560 align:start position:0%
the mechanisms that refers to
 
03:25:12.830 --> 03:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
non-citizens is a save program which DMV
 
03:25:15.710 --> 03:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
employees utilize to verify somebody's
 
03:25:17.830 --> 03:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
lawful presence within the United States
 
03:25:20.790 --> 03:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
or citizenship within the United States
 
03:25:23.110 --> 03:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
um people also bring up sometimes worry
 
03:25:25.269 --> 03:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
about access to benefits to which the
 
03:25:28.309 --> 03:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
person might not be eligible for that
 
03:25:31.309 --> 03:25:31.319 align:start position:0%
also I I I have confidence having worked
 
03:25:33.229 --> 03:25:33.239 align:start position:0%
in legal services for most of my career
 
03:25:35.910 --> 03:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire that our state
 
03:25:38.950 --> 03:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
agencies have mechanisms in place to
 
03:25:42.389 --> 03:25:42.399 align:start position:0%
establish um eligibility uh and and have
 
03:25:45.790 --> 03:25:45.800 align:start position:0%
Protections in place so that's really um
 
03:25:48.189 --> 03:25:48.199 align:start position:0%
my comments um to add on to Senator
 
03:25:51.309 --> 03:25:51.319 align:start position:0%
Fenton and um my colleague Eva and and
 
03:25:54.830 --> 03:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
as a as a US citizen by choice I can
 
03:25:56.309 --> 03:25:56.319 align:start position:0%
tell you there are plenty of people
 
03:25:57.389 --> 03:25:57.399 align:start position:0%
excuse me can I get you to state your
 
03:25:59.750 --> 03:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
name for the Castillo I live in
 
03:25:59.760 --> 03:26:01.269 align:start position:0%
name for the Castillo I live in
Manchester

03:26:01.269 --> 03:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
Manchester
 
03:26:04.750 --> 03:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
uh I worked in every single election
 
03:26:08.150 --> 03:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
before I became a citizen but motivating
 
03:26:11.110 --> 03:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
people to to vote and if you see you
 
03:26:13.429 --> 03:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
look at uh the secretary of state has a
 
03:26:17.670 --> 03:26:17.680 align:start position:0%
a nice video uh of about legal permanent
 
03:26:19.830 --> 03:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
residents and welcoming new citizens and
 
03:26:23.189 --> 03:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
I'm featuring that people can live here
 
03:26:24.870 --> 03:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
as legal permanent residens without
 
03:26:26.830 --> 03:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
becoming citizens they have no right to
 
03:26:30.750 --> 03:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
vote and I have never heard anybody uh
 
03:26:32.950 --> 03:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
voting taking that because that could
 
03:26:36.750 --> 03:26:36.760 align:start position:0%
really cost you a lot so people are not
 
03:26:39.630 --> 03:26:39.640 align:start position:0%
you know they're legally here they're
 
03:26:42.269 --> 03:26:42.279 align:start position:0%
legally driving here with drivers
 
03:26:45.070 --> 03:26:45.080 align:start position:0%
licenses people do not go to vote if
 
03:26:47.389 --> 03:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
they do not have the right to vote so
 
03:26:50.590 --> 03:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
the the T the voting places are very
 
03:26:54.910 --> 03:26:54.920 align:start position:0%
well educated uh in that sense and they
 
03:26:58.030 --> 03:26:58.040 align:start position:0%
make sure that nobody that's not
 
03:27:00.870 --> 03:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
supposed to vote uh does that this is a
 
03:27:03.349 --> 03:27:03.359 align:start position:0%
non-nonsense bill really it's not adding
 
03:27:05.790 --> 03:27:05.800 align:start position:0%
anything other than putting everything
 
03:27:07.990 --> 03:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
together in one place you know if you
 
03:27:09.950 --> 03:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
have an employment authorization you're
 
03:27:13.150 --> 03:27:13.160 align:start position:0%
Dy qu legal in this country regardless
 
03:27:16.830 --> 03:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
of what type of uh stat you have if
 
03:27:19.150 --> 03:27:19.160 align:start position:0%
you're legally in the country and the
 
03:27:21.469 --> 03:27:21.479 align:start position:0%
lady from the DMV can tell you exactly
 
03:27:24.269 --> 03:27:24.279 align:start position:0%
where it is you're going to be able to
 
03:27:26.349 --> 03:27:26.359 align:start position:0%
drive that's all you know in New
 
03:27:28.910 --> 03:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're safer and we're better
 
03:27:31.070 --> 03:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
when people
 
03:27:33.950 --> 03:27:33.960 align:start position:0%
drive according to the laws and the
 
03:27:36.750 --> 03:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
rules and we need to drive to go to work
 
03:27:38.630 --> 03:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
and to go to school and to go everything
 
03:27:40.189 --> 03:27:40.199 align:start position:0%
because we do not have a good
 
03:27:42.110 --> 03:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
transportation system so this bill
 
03:27:44.910 --> 03:27:44.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't really add any extra benefit and
 
03:27:47.070 --> 03:27:47.080 align:start position:0%
as far as benefit talking about that if
 
03:27:49.349 --> 03:27:49.359 align:start position:0%
you don't have a valid social security
 
03:27:51.750 --> 03:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
number you do not qualify for anything
 
03:27:54.349 --> 03:27:54.359 align:start position:0%
and even the people that are here as
 
03:27:55.910 --> 03:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
legal permanent residents that have
 
03:27:58.150 --> 03:27:58.160 align:start position:0%
their social security numbers for the
 
03:28:00.429 --> 03:28:00.439 align:start position:0%
first five years of becoming uh legal
 
03:28:02.750 --> 03:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
permanent residents they do not qualify
 
03:28:05.670 --> 03:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
for benefits from welfare for Medicaid
 
03:28:09.030 --> 03:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
for anything so they there are tons of
 
03:28:11.950 --> 03:28:11.960 align:start position:0%
mechanisms to for for that so there's no
 
03:28:15.070 --> 03:28:15.080 align:start position:0%
reason to to fear anything uh with this
 
03:28:18.030 --> 03:28:18.040 align:start position:0%
bill that really doesn't have much uh
 
03:28:20.830 --> 03:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
other than simplifying
 
03:28:24.349 --> 03:28:24.359 align:start position:0%
things thank you any questions from the
 
03:28:27.710 --> 03:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
committee oh um yes I will need you to
 
03:28:29.030 --> 03:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
fill out one of these pink cards too I
 
03:28:31.389 --> 03:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
didn't know you were going to be t i you
 
03:28:35.550 --> 03:28:35.560 align:start position:0%
can do it after the fact okay may
 
03:28:38.590 --> 03:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr
 
03:28:38.600 --> 03:28:40.830 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr
chairman

03:28:40.830 --> 03:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
03:28:43.229 --> 03:28:43.239 align:start position:0%
um neither of you ladies may be the
 
03:28:44.710 --> 03:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
right person to ask this question but
 
03:28:46.670 --> 03:28:46.680 align:start position:0%
I'll put it out there now so that the
 
03:28:49.710 --> 03:28:49.720 align:start position:0%
person or persons who can answer it can
 
03:28:53.750 --> 03:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
answer it for me um my understanding is
 
03:28:58.389 --> 03:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
that is is my understanding correct that
 
03:29:02.990 --> 03:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
if a person has a nonresident driver's
 
03:29:06.870 --> 03:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
license who is not a citizen who then
 
03:29:10.590 --> 03:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
tries to vote and is caught they then in
 
03:29:13.670 --> 03:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
fact would lose their status as being
 
03:29:17.710 --> 03:29:17.720 align:start position:0%
able to continue their residence in this
 
03:29:20.349 --> 03:29:20.359 align:start position:0%
country yes that is correct that that's
 
03:29:21.510 --> 03:29:21.520 align:start position:0%
a very good point Thank You
 
03:29:24.469 --> 03:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
representative Sykes um in immigration
 
03:29:27.550 --> 03:29:27.560 align:start position:0%
law if you are caught representing
 
03:29:30.550 --> 03:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
yourself as a citizen a US citizen in
 
03:29:33.790 --> 03:29:33.800 align:start position:0%
any um scenario that triggers what they
 
03:29:37.590 --> 03:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
call a permanent bar uh which would
 
03:29:42.030 --> 03:29:42.040 align:start position:0%
uh trigger um a removal process um from
 
03:29:45.269 --> 03:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
this country um it's it's one of the
 
03:29:47.229 --> 03:29:47.239 align:start position:0%
biggest known knows I think the other
 
03:29:49.590 --> 03:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
permanent bar is if you belong to the
 
03:29:51.830 --> 03:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
Nazi party that's right which dates back
 
03:29:54.790 --> 03:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
to like the 1930s so that that's a very
 
03:29:56.790 --> 03:29:56.800 align:start position:0%
good point to make it it it is a
 
03:29:59.030 --> 03:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
catastrophic thing to do to represent
 
03:30:02.070 --> 03:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
whether in a voting situation or in any
 
03:30:04.269 --> 03:30:04.279 align:start position:0%
other situation that you are US citizen
 
03:30:06.030 --> 03:30:06.040 align:start position:0%
if you are
 
03:30:08.670 --> 03:30:08.680 align:start position:0%
not thank you in fact that's one of the
 
03:30:10.990 --> 03:30:11.000 align:start position:0%
questions they ask you when you put your
 
03:30:13.309 --> 03:30:13.319 align:start position:0%
citizenship application and they go you
 
03:30:15.150 --> 03:30:15.160 align:start position:0%
go to the interview they ask have you
 
03:30:18.110 --> 03:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
ever claimed to be are you a citizen in
 
03:30:21.110 --> 03:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
anything thank you um I've heard I have
 
03:30:24.189 --> 03:30:24.199 align:start position:0%
one I've heard a few times uh the term
 
03:30:26.830 --> 03:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
lawfully present does it say this
 
03:30:29.630 --> 03:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the bill excuse me does it
 
03:30:31.630 --> 03:30:31.640 align:start position:0%
say the words lawful presence or
 
03:30:34.229 --> 03:30:34.239 align:start position:0%
lawfully present anywhere in the bill in
 
03:30:37.389 --> 03:30:37.399 align:start position:0%
the bill no because this bill doesn't
 
03:30:40.429 --> 03:30:40.439 align:start position:0%
change the um the statutes that are
 
03:30:44.150 --> 03:30:44.160 align:start position:0%
already in existence it's just uh puts
 
03:30:47.309 --> 03:30:47.319 align:start position:0%
all the information into 26 6
 
03:30:47.319 --> 03:30:48.910 align:start position:0%
all the information into 26 6
339a

03:30:48.910 --> 03:30:48.920 align:start position:0%
339a
 
03:30:53.590 --> 03:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
um D and I think the DMV person uh could
 
03:30:57.070 --> 03:30:57.080 align:start position:0%
probably uh answer this better but um
 
03:30:58.910 --> 03:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's a baseline that you have
 
03:31:01.469 --> 03:31:01.479 align:start position:0%
to prove that you have the permission of
 
03:31:04.269 --> 03:31:04.279 align:start position:0%
the US government to be here to get a
 
03:31:06.870 --> 03:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire driver's license so you
 
03:31:09.710 --> 03:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
have to have certain us-based documents
 
03:31:13.030 --> 03:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
you you're going to also use your your
 
03:31:16.070 --> 03:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
foreign birth certificate or your pass
 
03:31:17.550 --> 03:31:17.560 align:start position:0%
Port from your home country if you're
 
03:31:19.910 --> 03:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
not a US citizen but you also have to
 
03:31:23.550 --> 03:31:23.560 align:start position:0%
show us issued immigration status
 
03:31:26.309 --> 03:31:26.319 align:start position:0%
documents and per permission to work and
 
03:31:28.790 --> 03:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
the social security number that's US
 
03:31:28.800 --> 03:31:30.990 align:start position:0%
the social security number that's US
government

03:31:30.990 --> 03:31:31.000 align:start position:0%
government
 
03:31:33.630 --> 03:31:33.640 align:start position:0%
based um just a
 
03:31:36.630 --> 03:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
followup do you know and I'll ask this
 
03:31:38.469 --> 03:31:38.479 align:start position:0%
now and we might get in I'll ask it
 
03:31:42.349 --> 03:31:42.359 align:start position:0%
again who the federal government grants
 
03:31:44.070 --> 03:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
lawful presence
 
03:31:47.349 --> 03:31:47.359 align:start position:0%
to that is a question that would have to
 
03:31:50.870 --> 03:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
do as an immigration law 101 if there
 
03:31:53.550 --> 03:31:53.560 align:start position:0%
there's numerous numerous statuses some
 
03:31:55.790 --> 03:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
are statuses that will eventually lead
 
03:31:58.429 --> 03:31:58.439 align:start position:0%
somebody to be able to um apply for US
 
03:32:00.790 --> 03:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
citizenship some like the original
 
03:32:05.189 --> 03:32:05.199 align:start position:0%
language in 239 uh 263 39a refer to
 
03:32:07.349 --> 03:32:07.359 align:start position:0%
people that are here on temporary work
 
03:32:10.070 --> 03:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
visas by studying uh within the United

would have to show to the DMV to to um
 
03:33:35.910 --> 03:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
to um establish that they were eligible
 
03:33:39.910 --> 03:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
for a license before you come over or if
 
03:33:43.030 --> 03:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
you apply here you those two scenarios
 
03:33:45.309 --> 03:33:45.319 align:start position:0%
both happen people apply from outside
 
03:33:48.229 --> 03:33:48.239 align:start position:0%
the United States and get permission
 
03:33:50.590 --> 03:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
some people apply with from within the
 
03:33:53.870 --> 03:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
United States um it it's an extremely
 
03:33:56.870 --> 03:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
complicated process uh no matter what
 
03:34:02.070 --> 03:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
but you have to show documents um to be
 
03:34:04.950 --> 03:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
given permission um they they always
 
03:34:09.429 --> 03:34:09.439 align:start position:0%
involve um birth certificates and
 
03:34:11.870 --> 03:34:11.880 align:start position:0%
passports uh and other documents that
 
03:34:15.070 --> 03:34:15.080 align:start position:0%
might be relevant depending on what kind
 
03:34:18.429 --> 03:34:18.439 align:start position:0%
of immigration benefit you're
 
03:34:22.790 --> 03:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
seeking followup followup thank you if
 
03:34:26.269 --> 03:34:26.279 align:start position:0%
you arrive here um with no
 
03:34:30.269 --> 03:34:30.279 align:start position:0%
documentation are you able to be legally
 
03:34:33.110 --> 03:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
present um there are many folks that
 
03:34:35.550 --> 03:34:35.560 align:start position:0%
arrive here without documentation that
 
03:34:38.590 --> 03:34:38.600 align:start position:0%
may never be able to secure a pathway to
 
03:34:42.150 --> 03:34:42.160 align:start position:0%
lawful presence if you arrive here
 
03:34:44.469 --> 03:34:44.479 align:start position:0%
without permission of the US government
 
03:34:46.150 --> 03:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
and you um
 
03:34:51.070 --> 03:34:51.080 align:start position:0%
seek Asylum you may be able to um stay
 
03:34:53.309 --> 03:34:53.319 align:start position:0%
in the United States that's a a long
 
03:34:55.389 --> 03:34:55.399 align:start position:0%
drawn out process where you have to
 
03:34:57.750 --> 03:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
first establish with an immigration
 
03:35:00.630 --> 03:35:00.640 align:start position:0%
officer that you you have articulated a
 
03:35:02.910 --> 03:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
credible fear of being harmed or
 
03:35:04.510 --> 03:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
tortured when you go back to your
 
03:35:07.070 --> 03:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
country um so there's some people that
 
03:35:10.269 --> 03:35:10.279 align:start position:0%
may be here while they're that the
 
03:35:12.030 --> 03:35:12.040 align:start position:0%
government giv gives them permission you
 
03:35:13.910 --> 03:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
may wait here while we're figuring out
 
03:35:17.309 --> 03:35:17.319 align:start position:0%
your case um as cases the vast majority
 
03:35:20.790 --> 03:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
of Asylum cases are denied in the end um
 
03:35:23.469 --> 03:35:23.479 align:start position:0%
because it's a very high bar to show
 
03:35:26.870 --> 03:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
that you are in particular danger people
 
03:35:29.550 --> 03:35:29.560 align:start position:0%
from C certain countries um that are
 
03:35:34.070 --> 03:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
experiencing uh war or um severe
 
03:35:36.990 --> 03:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
disasters um may be given uh temporary
 
03:35:39.189 --> 03:35:39.199 align:start position:0%
protected status for instance that that
 
03:35:42.269 --> 03:35:42.279 align:start position:0%
may um you know be for a period of time
 
03:35:43.790 --> 03:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
that the government May renew or they
 
03:35:46.189 --> 03:35:46.199 align:start position:0%
say well the country is back to normal
 
03:35:47.910 --> 03:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
we're not going to allow that status
 
03:35:50.750 --> 03:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
anymore so it's just so complicated and
 
03:35:52.389 --> 03:35:52.399 align:start position:0%
you have to be sort of an expert on
 
03:35:53.830 --> 03:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
these different areas so even in
 
03:35:55.870 --> 03:35:55.880 align:start position:0%
immigration law usually folks
 
03:35:58.110 --> 03:35:58.120 align:start position:0%
concentrate on you know certain aspects
 
03:35:59.990 --> 03:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
of it because it's it's very difficult
 
03:36:03.309 --> 03:36:03.319 align:start position:0%
to cover the whole realm of that that
 
03:36:03.319 --> 03:36:05.269 align:start position:0%
to cover the whole realm of that that
area

03:36:05.269 --> 03:36:05.279 align:start position:0%
area
 
03:36:07.469 --> 03:36:07.479 align:start position:0%
law but there are some people that will
 
03:36:11.469 --> 03:36:11.479 align:start position:0%
never be able to get um status in the a
 
03:36:14.030 --> 03:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
lawful status in the United States at
 
03:36:16.950 --> 03:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
this point in time yeah any other
 
03:36:18.990 --> 03:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
03:36:20.469 --> 03:36:20.479 align:start position:0%
much thank
 
03:36:22.870 --> 03:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
you next up chair recognizes Jennifer
 
03:36:33.229 --> 03:36:33.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:35.309 --> 03:36:35.319 align:start position:0%
Vehicles good afternoon my name's
 
03:36:37.189 --> 03:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
Jennifer Bailey again I'm here for the
 
03:36:41.309 --> 03:36:41.319 align:start position:0%
DMV um we are in support of this bill um
 
03:36:42.710 --> 03:36:42.720 align:start position:0%
a lot to unpack here but let me start
 
03:36:45.030 --> 03:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
with the bill itself first um so the
 
03:36:48.269 --> 03:36:48.279 align:start position:0%
first part of the bill before amendments
 
03:36:50.710 --> 03:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
is just clarifying what we already do um
 
03:36:53.590 --> 03:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
what this is adding is in our current
 
03:36:56.630 --> 03:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
laws under 263 we consider permanent
 
03:36:59.590 --> 03:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
residents similar to US citizens so
 
03:37:01.990 --> 03:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
their authorization to get licenses was
 
03:37:04.590 --> 03:37:04.600 align:start position:0%
in that law Senator Fenton is just
 
03:37:07.670 --> 03:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
adding them into the non- US citizen
 
03:37:10.309 --> 03:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
bill as a whole so this is not changing
 
03:37:11.990 --> 03:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
anything as to what we're currently
 
03:37:14.590 --> 03:37:14.600 align:start position:0%
issuing or how we're currently issuing
 
03:37:16.189 --> 03:37:16.199 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
03:37:16.199 --> 03:37:17.110 align:start position:0%
the amendment
was

03:37:17.110 --> 03:37:17.120 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:37:20.670 --> 03:37:20.680 align:start position:0%
originally um SB Bill 568 from Senator
 
03:37:23.150 --> 03:37:23.160 align:start position:0%
richardi that we were requiring removing
 
03:37:25.830 --> 03:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
the requirement for driver education and
 
03:37:28.070 --> 03:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
Proof of Your Home Country license we
 
03:37:30.110 --> 03:37:30.120 align:start position:0%
worked last summer and eliminated that
 
03:37:32.389 --> 03:37:32.399 align:start position:0%
from from our administrative Rule and
 
03:37:34.910 --> 03:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
this was a cleanup to remove that from
 
03:37:37.510 --> 03:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
there since both bills were addressing
 
03:37:40.070 --> 03:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
the same RSA they combined them um
 
03:37:42.630 --> 03:37:42.640 align:start position:0%
instead of having two separate so that
 
03:37:46.710 --> 03:37:46.720 align:start position:0%
is that part of things um for
 
03:37:49.710 --> 03:37:49.720 align:start position:0%
several of the questions coming
 
03:37:52.429 --> 03:37:52.439 align:start position:0%
up and I may not catch all of them so
 
03:37:55.229 --> 03:37:55.239 align:start position:0%
you can Reas them the conditional or
 
03:37:58.150 --> 03:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
permanent status so when you are a
 
03:37:59.790 --> 03:37:59.800 align:start position:0%
permanent resident you may not
 
03:38:02.189 --> 03:38:02.199 align:start position:0%
physically get your hard copy card
 
03:38:04.030 --> 03:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
originally they will put a stamp it's
 
03:38:07.030 --> 03:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
called an i51 stamp in your passport
 
03:38:08.590 --> 03:38:08.600 align:start position:0%
that is your conditional it's usually
 
03:38:11.110 --> 03:38:11.120 align:start position:0%
valid for one year until while you're
 
03:38:13.510 --> 03:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
waiting for your actual card to come in
 
03:38:17.309 --> 03:38:17.319 align:start position:0%
so that's what that intent by IAL
 
03:38:22.309 --> 03:38:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:26.269 --> 03:38:26.279 align:start position:0%
see I've testified in here before on the
 
03:38:30.630 --> 03:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
asy refugee um lawful presence before
 
03:38:32.630 --> 03:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
and I've tried afterwards to try to get
 
03:38:34.750 --> 03:38:34.760 align:start position:0%
it into my head to kind of clarify it as
 
03:38:36.830 --> 03:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
best I can and the most I can clarify it
 
03:38:39.469 --> 03:38:39.479 align:start position:0%
is there are
 
03:38:42.189 --> 03:38:42.199 align:start position:0%
three sets of presence in the United
 
03:38:44.550 --> 03:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
States you're a US citizen you're
 
03:38:47.229 --> 03:38:47.239 align:start position:0%
permanently here a permanent resident or
 
03:38:49.750 --> 03:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
you are temporarily here permanent
 
03:38:51.710 --> 03:38:51.720 align:start position:0%
resident includes permanent resident
 
03:38:55.910 --> 03:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
cards Ayes refugees temporary residents
 
03:38:57.710 --> 03:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
are going to be any visas as they
 
03:39:00.790 --> 03:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
explained work visas um employment visas
 
03:39:02.630 --> 03:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
work employment cards that are only
 
03:39:05.469 --> 03:39:05.479 align:start position:0%
valid for one year to five years
 
03:39:06.910 --> 03:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
depending on what they're being allowed
 
03:39:08.429 --> 03:39:08.439 align:start position:0%
here to
 
03:39:11.950 --> 03:39:11.960 align:start position:0%
do you can come here as a temporary
 
03:39:14.830 --> 03:39:14.840 align:start position:0%
resident as a student and be here
 
03:39:14.840 --> 03:39:15.910 align:start position:0%
resident as a student and be here
legally

03:39:15.910 --> 03:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
legally
 
03:39:20.710 --> 03:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
get a license under your student
 
03:39:24.070 --> 03:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
visa while you're here you now feel
 
03:39:26.750 --> 03:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
unsafe to return to your home country
 
03:39:30.070 --> 03:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
you can apply for Asylum status that is
 
03:39:33.030 --> 03:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
going from a temporary status to a
 
03:39:34.510 --> 03:39:34.520 align:start position:0%
permanent status in the United States
 
03:39:37.110 --> 03:39:37.120 align:start position:0%
which is why it takes so long and that's
 
03:39:39.750 --> 03:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
where that lawfully present is because
 
03:39:41.469 --> 03:39:41.479 align:start position:0%
they are legally here either under a
 
03:39:43.590 --> 03:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
Visa or a work employment card so
 
03:39:46.389 --> 03:39:46.399 align:start position:0%
they're eligible to have A license they
 
03:39:48.070 --> 03:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
have a Social Security card but now
 
03:39:50.429 --> 03:39:50.439 align:start position:0%
they're seeking permanent residents here
 
03:39:52.150 --> 03:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
due to something happening in their home
 
03:39:55.550 --> 03:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
country that's where that lawful
 
03:39:58.910 --> 03:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
presence comes about um as they
 
03:40:01.150 --> 03:40:01.160 align:start position:0%
explained if you come here with no
 
03:40:03.510 --> 03:40:03.520 align:start position:0%
documents you are not getting a license
 
03:40:05.389 --> 03:40:05.399 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire you have to present
 
03:40:07.309 --> 03:40:07.319 align:start position:0%
several documents your home country
 
03:40:09.030 --> 03:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
passport because it will have your Visa
 
03:40:11.830 --> 03:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
in it it may have a stamp in it as well
 
03:40:13.550 --> 03:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
if you're here for duration of stay for
 
03:40:15.990 --> 03:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
your education you'll also have
 
03:40:17.630 --> 03:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
additional documents from immigration
 
03:40:19.830 --> 03:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
for what college you're enrolled in or
 
03:40:21.950 --> 03:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
what um agency you're working for that
 
03:40:23.469 --> 03:40:23.479 align:start position:0%
you're providing and then your social
 
03:40:25.830 --> 03:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
security card or a denial letter from
 
03:40:27.910 --> 03:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
the Social Security office for example
 
03:40:29.670 --> 03:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
as a student you're not eligible to work
 
03:40:31.670 --> 03:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
in the US so you're not eligible for a
 
03:40:32.750 --> 03:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
social security card they're going to
 
03:40:34.750 --> 03:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
give you a letter stating
 
03:40:38.269 --> 03:40:38.279 align:start position:0%
that um I believe I covered some of the
 
03:40:40.630 --> 03:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
questions if I missed any of them please
 
03:40:43.269 --> 03:40:43.279 align:start position:0%
feel free to ask me again but that is
 
03:40:46.229 --> 03:40:46.239 align:start position:0%
all that I have for you guys today
 
03:40:47.550 --> 03:40:47.560 align:start position:0%
thank you and I just want to clarify a
 
03:40:49.630 --> 03:40:49.640 align:start position:0%
couple things I'm sure we'll have a few
 
03:40:51.830 --> 03:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
questions not to throw anybody out of
 
03:40:53.910 --> 03:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
the bus but when we were going through
 
03:40:55.910 --> 03:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
are these are similar bills last year
 
03:40:59.150 --> 03:40:59.160 align:start position:0%
the house bills I Time and Time asked
 
03:41:01.550 --> 03:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
the director of Motor Vehicles how the
 
03:41:04.189 --> 03:41:04.199 align:start position:0%
whole process works and he told me that
 
03:41:05.830 --> 03:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
anybody that comes across the border
 
03:41:08.750 --> 03:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
through a Port of Entry anybody
 
03:41:12.590 --> 03:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
everybody who claims Asylum is given or
 
03:41:14.910 --> 03:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
granted lawful presence that's what I
 
03:41:15.910 --> 03:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
was told
 
03:41:17.830 --> 03:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
over and over you're telling me that's
 
03:41:21.030 --> 03:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
not the case not always the case no not
 
03:41:22.389 --> 03:41:22.399 align:start position:0%
always the case not always the but
 
03:41:24.910 --> 03:41:24.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes the case sometime it's not you
 
03:41:27.429 --> 03:41:27.439 align:start position:0%
saying automatically granted lawful if
 
03:41:29.630 --> 03:41:29.640 align:start position:0%
if they provide a name and it goes into
 
03:41:31.950 --> 03:41:31.960 align:start position:0%
the save database and they're given an
 
03:41:34.510 --> 03:41:34.520 align:start position:0%
asylum hearing or date they were granted
 
03:41:36.269 --> 03:41:36.279 align:start position:0%
lawful presence to enter the country
 
03:41:37.630 --> 03:41:37.640 align:start position:0%
that's what I've been told over and over
 
03:41:40.309 --> 03:41:40.319 align:start position:0%
by the department not that I'm aware
 
03:41:43.309 --> 03:41:43.319 align:start position:0%
there they have to apply with the with
 
03:41:46.030 --> 03:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
immigration for that status
 
03:41:49.550 --> 03:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
um and then again while that's pending
 
03:41:52.030 --> 03:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
they may be granted lawful presence or
 
03:41:53.630 --> 03:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
they may go through sending them right
 
03:41:54.950 --> 03:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
back and that's only if they're coming
 
03:41:58.469 --> 03:41:58.479 align:start position:0%
over with no no documents right so so I
 
03:42:00.790 --> 03:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
I still need to verify that information
 
03:42:03.469 --> 03:42:03.479 align:start position:0%
with with u immigration I'm not saying
 
03:42:05.269 --> 03:42:05.279 align:start position:0%
it's the Department of Motor Vehicles
 
03:42:07.110 --> 03:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
I'm just telling you what I was told the
 
03:42:08.990 --> 03:42:09.000 align:start position:0%
last time we've heard these bills now
 
03:42:10.670 --> 03:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
let's look at while somebody's here with
 
03:42:14.030 --> 03:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
an asylum claim yes I was also told that
 
03:42:15.790 --> 03:42:15.800 align:start position:0%
we were not giving drivers like is to
 
03:42:18.429 --> 03:42:18.439 align:start position:0%
anybody with pending claims over and
 
03:42:20.790 --> 03:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
over correct then I find out at the last
 
03:42:23.710 --> 03:42:23.720 align:start position:0%
hearing that oh well no if they get a
 
03:42:25.750 --> 03:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
temporary work authorization then we
 
03:42:27.030 --> 03:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
will give them a driver's license
 
03:42:28.229 --> 03:42:28.239 align:start position:0%
because that comes with a social
 
03:42:30.870 --> 03:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
security number correct because they are
 
03:42:32.630 --> 03:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
they have a work employment card that
 
03:42:34.269 --> 03:42:34.279 align:start position:0%
may have been how they were originally
 
03:42:36.110 --> 03:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
here they came here as a work employment
 
03:42:37.870 --> 03:42:37.880 align:start position:0%
card while they're here because a work
 
03:42:40.070 --> 03:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
employment card only allows them to stay
 
03:42:42.149 --> 03:42:42.159 align:start position:0%
usually it's a one-year
 
03:42:44.830 --> 03:42:44.840 align:start position:0%
period so then while they're here they
 
03:42:46.950 --> 03:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
now feel unsafe to return home so
 
03:42:48.070 --> 03:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
they're going to immigration and
 
03:42:50.550 --> 03:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
applying for Asylum status to stay in
 
03:42:53.349 --> 03:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
the US permanently and now that status
 
03:42:55.870 --> 03:42:55.880 align:start position:0%
is pending but they're still they were
 
03:42:58.149 --> 03:42:58.159 align:start position:0%
still legally here as to work on a work
 
03:43:00.030 --> 03:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
employment cart we're talking about two
 
03:43:01.990 --> 03:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
different groups of people we're talking
 
03:43:03.429 --> 03:43:03.439 align:start position:0%
about the people that came here with a
 
03:43:05.349 --> 03:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
Visa and the people that came here with
 
03:43:07.389 --> 03:43:07.399 align:start position:0%
no documentation any other questions
 
03:43:10.070 --> 03:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
from the committee represent
 
03:43:13.110 --> 03:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
C uh thank you for
 
03:43:16.030 --> 03:43:16.040 align:start position:0%
um um
 
03:43:18.189 --> 03:43:18.199 align:start position:0%
anyone any non-citizen who gets a
 
03:43:21.030 --> 03:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
driver's license what is the address
 
03:43:22.830 --> 03:43:22.840 align:start position:0%
that gets printed on that driver's
 
03:43:24.670 --> 03:43:24.680 align:start position:0%
license they have to have a New
 
03:43:26.750 --> 03:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residence
 
03:43:28.790 --> 03:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
address okay and they're showing proof
 
03:43:32.389 --> 03:43:32.399 align:start position:0%
of residency follow up yeah follow uh
 
03:43:34.070 --> 03:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's where I get concerned
 
03:43:37.269 --> 03:43:37.279 align:start position:0%
about people being able to go vote
 
03:43:39.189 --> 03:43:39.199 align:start position:0%
because it has a New Hampshire address
 
03:43:42.590 --> 03:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
on it so if it says they have an address
 
03:43:44.189 --> 03:43:44.199 align:start position:0%
here in conquered they can go to a
 
03:43:49.070 --> 03:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
conquered word whatever and and vote um
 
03:43:50.990 --> 03:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
I was wondering whether it would have
 
03:43:53.070 --> 03:43:53.080 align:start position:0%
their original home address in whatever
 
03:43:54.630 --> 03:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
country they came
 
03:43:57.189 --> 03:43:57.199 align:start position:0%
from no new Hamp we actually have
 
03:43:58.670 --> 03:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
statute that you have your license and
 
03:44:00.149 --> 03:44:00.159 align:start position:0%
only have your New Hampshire license on
 
03:44:03.070 --> 03:44:03.080 align:start position:0%
it anyways um but no they don't we don't
 
03:44:05.030 --> 03:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
even look for their home country address
 
03:44:08.070 --> 03:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
most of them are here for several years
 
03:44:10.469 --> 03:44:10.479 align:start position:0%
so they're providing utility bills they
 
03:44:11.990 --> 03:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
have lease agreements they're renting
 
03:44:14.429 --> 03:44:14.439 align:start position:0%
someplace or they're owning a home um
 
03:44:15.550 --> 03:44:15.560 align:start position:0%
staying with their friends they're
 
03:44:18.189 --> 03:44:18.199 align:start position:0%
providing us residency um for a New
 
03:44:18.199 --> 03:44:20.149 align:start position:0%
providing us residency um for a New
Hampshire

03:44:20.149 --> 03:44:20.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:44:22.710 --> 03:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
address representative
 
03:44:24.990 --> 03:44:25.000 align:start position:0%
Hill thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:44:28.750 --> 03:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
taking my questions um if someone
 
03:44:34.870 --> 03:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
applies um for Asylum and is not granted
 
03:44:38.269 --> 03:44:38.279 align:start position:0%
Asylum and yet New Hampshire has issued
 
03:44:41.229 --> 03:44:41.239 align:start position:0%
a driver's license are we able to get
 
03:44:43.590 --> 03:44:43.600 align:start position:0%
that back so if they're issued a
 
03:44:45.830 --> 03:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
driver's license it's going to be under
 
03:44:48.070 --> 03:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
what their previous status was and we
 
03:44:49.870 --> 03:44:49.880 align:start position:0%
only issue licenses based on the
 
03:44:51.590 --> 03:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
expiration data of your credentials from
 
03:44:53.429 --> 03:44:53.439 align:start position:0%
immigration so if you're issued a
 
03:44:56.309 --> 03:44:56.319 align:start position:0%
one-year work employment card and that's
 
03:44:58.550 --> 03:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
what you were given a license under then
 
03:45:00.389 --> 03:45:00.399 align:start position:0%
your license is going to expire at the
 
03:45:02.070 --> 03:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
end of that employment authorization
 
03:45:04.510 --> 03:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
card term thank you
 
03:45:08.670 --> 03:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
followup and if you were not granted a
 
03:45:11.950 --> 03:45:11.960 align:start position:0%
uh you were not here on a work visa um
 
03:45:15.910 --> 03:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
you were here because you felt you were
 
03:45:19.429 --> 03:45:19.439 align:start position:0%
in danger uh in your prior
 
03:45:24.510 --> 03:45:24.520 align:start position:0%
location um and you are requesting
 
03:45:27.510 --> 03:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
Asylum and it is not granted what
 
03:45:29.910 --> 03:45:29.920 align:start position:0%
happens to that license if you are only
 
03:45:32.149 --> 03:45:32.159 align:start position:0%
here as a pending Asylum status you had
 
03:45:34.149 --> 03:45:34.159 align:start position:0%
no legal status prior you're not getting
 
03:45:36.149 --> 03:45:36.159 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire license at all so we're
 
03:45:37.750 --> 03:45:37.760 align:start position:0%
not renewing there's nothing to renew
 
03:45:39.070 --> 03:45:39.080 align:start position:0%
you're not issued
 
03:45:41.269 --> 03:45:41.279 align:start position:0%
anything thank
 
03:45:43.309 --> 03:45:43.319 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
03:45:45.349 --> 03:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
Gorski thank you Mr chair chairman and
 
03:45:49.349 --> 03:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um on
 
03:45:53.670 --> 03:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
page two uh one of sentences that got my
 
03:45:55.790 --> 03:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
attention it says once licensed the
 
03:45:57.950 --> 03:45:57.960 align:start position:0%
individual shall be subject to the same
 
03:46:01.070 --> 03:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
provisions of the law as all other
 
03:46:03.990 --> 03:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
licenses can you explain to us what same
 
03:46:07.630 --> 03:46:07.640 align:start position:0%
provisions of the law
 
03:46:10.149 --> 03:46:10.159 align:start position:0%
means I don't know honestly I don't know
 
03:46:12.510 --> 03:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
what the intent of this is I my
 
03:46:14.670 --> 03:46:14.680 align:start position:0%
assumption of it was meaning following
 
03:46:16.309 --> 03:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
the law laws of the road that you're
 
03:46:18.110 --> 03:46:18.120 align:start position:0%
eligible to have your license suspended
 
03:46:24.510 --> 03:46:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:28.070 --> 03:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
were can you see how there could be some
 
03:46:31.189 --> 03:46:31.199 align:start position:0%
concerns there because if I have a
 
03:46:34.189 --> 03:46:34.199 align:start position:0%
license same provisions of the law could
 
03:46:36.950 --> 03:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
mean that that allows you to do certain
 
03:46:39.149 --> 03:46:39.159 align:start position:0%
things with a license that you can do
 
03:46:43.750 --> 03:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
AKA vote so that that right there that
 
03:46:46.830 --> 03:46:46.840 align:start position:0%
particular phrase can be quite concerned
 
03:46:48.389 --> 03:46:48.399 align:start position:0%
can you see how that might be I can't
 
03:46:49.550 --> 03:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
see that now that you're saying that way
 
03:46:51.950 --> 03:46:51.960 align:start position:0%
I wasn't thinking that
 
03:46:51.960 --> 03:46:53.750 align:start position:0%
I wasn't thinking that
way

03:46:53.750 --> 03:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
way
 
03:46:58.910 --> 03:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:01.750 --> 03:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
much next up chair recognizes uh

headed working permit and let me tell
 
03:47:35.309 --> 03:47:35.319 align:start position:0%
you the way it works it wasn't easy for
 
03:47:36.750 --> 03:47:36.760 align:start position:0%
me to get a driver's
 
03:47:40.110 --> 03:47:40.120 align:start position:0%
license I live at Milford but I I was
 
03:47:41.870 --> 03:47:41.880 align:start position:0%
told to come all the way to conquer to
 
03:47:44.349 --> 03:47:44.359 align:start position:0%
get a driver's license and the driver's
 
03:47:47.910 --> 03:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
license specifically had the day from my
 
03:47:50.830 --> 03:47:50.840 align:start position:0%
working permit until the day that my my
 
03:47:53.950 --> 03:47:53.960 align:start position:0%
working permit was expire and that was
 
03:47:56.750 --> 03:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
it if I if I didn't have a new one
 
03:48:00.070 --> 03:48:00.080 align:start position:0%
working permit or I didn't have a uh
 
03:48:02.910 --> 03:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
like um when I got my green car and I
 
03:48:05.830 --> 03:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
had a green car my driver license wasn't
 
03:48:08.630 --> 03:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
Renew at all and the other thing that
 
03:48:12.429 --> 03:48:12.439 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing here is like these type of
 
03:48:14.510 --> 03:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
uh driver's license is going to make it
 
03:48:18.229 --> 03:48:18.239 align:start position:0%
easy for people to vote let me tell you
 
03:48:22.229 --> 03:48:22.239 align:start position:0%
something it took me three times to go
 
03:48:24.710 --> 03:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
back to my house when I got my
 
03:48:26.950 --> 03:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
citizenship to be able to register to
 
03:48:29.189 --> 03:48:29.199 align:start position:0%
vote I was told that the driver's
 
03:48:31.229 --> 03:48:31.239 align:start position:0%
license was not good enough because I
 
03:48:32.750 --> 03:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't boarding
 
03:48:36.550 --> 03:48:36.560 align:start position:0%
here I was told to go back and get my
 
03:48:38.590 --> 03:48:38.600 align:start position:0%
citizenship I went back and got my
 
03:48:40.750 --> 03:48:40.760 align:start position:0%
citizenship and that was not good enough
 
03:48:45.189 --> 03:48:45.199 align:start position:0%
either I went back and got my us passort
 
03:48:47.550 --> 03:48:47.560 align:start position:0%
it's not as easy if you guys putting in
 
03:48:50.429 --> 03:48:50.439 align:start position:0%
here like people indument people or
 
03:48:53.630 --> 03:48:53.640 align:start position:0%
people with temporary status uh they
 
03:48:54.870 --> 03:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
they're going to have the right to vote
 
03:48:57.710 --> 03:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
or illegally going to try to register to
 
03:49:01.110 --> 03:49:01.120 align:start position:0%
vote or are we just hear the Polie and
 
03:49:02.630 --> 03:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
document the people that give a driver's
 
03:49:05.389 --> 03:49:05.399 align:start position:0%
license no it's not as easy that you
 
03:49:07.389 --> 03:49:07.399 align:start position:0%
guys is
 
03:49:10.229 --> 03:49:10.239 align:start position:0%
putting this is people who already have
 
03:49:12.790 --> 03:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
working permit and they have the right
 
03:49:13.710 --> 03:49:13.720 align:start position:0%
to be
 
03:49:16.389 --> 03:49:16.399 align:start position:0%
here and then the way it works when The
 
03:49:19.469 --> 03:49:19.479 align:start position:0%
aalum Seekers theal on Seekers don't get
 
03:49:22.950 --> 03:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
a free open door and then they say oh
 
03:49:24.790 --> 03:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
yeah you you welcome and then you can go
 
03:49:26.750 --> 03:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
and get dver license no that's not the
 
03:49:29.389 --> 03:49:29.399 align:start position:0%
way it works people has to go through
 
03:49:32.389 --> 03:49:32.399 align:start position:0%
the system they have to apply for the
 
03:49:33.429 --> 03:49:33.439 align:start position:0%
for the
 
03:49:36.550 --> 03:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
asilum and then they they can get a
 
03:49:38.429 --> 03:49:38.439 align:start position:0%
working permit and when they they get a
 
03:49:40.229 --> 03:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
working permit they can go and apply for
 
03:49:42.990 --> 03:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
the driver license it's not just like uh
 
03:49:46.630 --> 03:49:46.640 align:start position:0%
free for all oh masking here to just
 
03:49:48.630 --> 03:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
open the door wide open for anyone to
 
03:49:50.469 --> 03:49:50.479 align:start position:0%
get a driver's license no that's not the
 
03:49:51.710 --> 03:49:51.720 align:start position:0%
way it
 
03:49:55.189 --> 03:49:55.199 align:start position:0%
works but what I'm hearing here for over
 
03:49:58.309 --> 03:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
and over and over for many years that we
 
03:50:00.550 --> 03:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
heared asking to give indument the
 
03:50:03.070 --> 03:50:03.080 align:start position:0%
people the right to vote or we asking
 
03:50:06.309 --> 03:50:06.319 align:start position:0%
here to uh something doing illegally I'm
 
03:50:07.429 --> 03:50:07.439 align:start position:0%

03:50:11.670 --> 03:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
that as someone who has been here for 34
 
03:50:15.630 --> 03:50:15.640 align:start position:0%

and I'm here to represent the people
 
03:50:20.550 --> 03:50:20.560 align:start position:0%

03:50:22.870 --> 03:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
community they open the doors for me and
 
03:50:24.349 --> 03:50:24.359 align:start position:0%

03:50:28.389 --> 03:50:28.399 align:start position:0%

clemento you are seeing the combination
 
03:51:08.670 --> 03:51:08.680 align:start position:0%
of a long and unpronounced last name and
 
03:51:11.550 --> 03:51:11.560 align:start position:0%
terrible pentant ship so I apologize for
 
03:51:13.710 --> 03:51:13.720 align:start position:0%
that at least my name is Henry clemento
 
03:51:15.950 --> 03:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
I'm a senior sta me at the ACLU of New
 
03:51:18.750 --> 03:51:18.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I wasn't planning on
 
03:51:20.830 --> 03:51:20.840 align:start position:0%
speaking on this bill today because I'm
 
03:51:23.790 --> 03:51:23.800 align:start position:0%
not involved in our immigration work uh
 
03:51:25.750 --> 03:51:25.760 align:start position:0%
that's a another very capable lawyer in
 
03:51:28.590 --> 03:51:28.600 align:start position:0%
my office but I do handle um all of our
 
03:51:30.910 --> 03:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
elections and voting rights related work
 
03:51:32.510 --> 03:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
and I just happened to be here so I
 
03:51:34.349 --> 03:51:34.359 align:start position:0%
thought I might be able to elay perhaps
 
03:51:36.070 --> 03:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
some of Representative C's concerns
 
03:51:38.630 --> 03:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
about the registration process a person
 
03:51:39.990 --> 03:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
registering to vote in New Hampshire has
 
03:51:42.070 --> 03:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
to prove four qualifications their
 
03:51:44.030 --> 03:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
identity their age their domicile and
 
03:51:45.269 --> 03:51:45.279 align:start position:0%
their citizens
 
03:51:47.790 --> 03:51:47.800 align:start position:0%
ship the the New Hampshire driver's
 
03:51:50.750 --> 03:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
license can be proof of identity age and
 
03:51:52.670 --> 03:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
domicile but it's never proof of
 
03:51:56.269 --> 03:51:56.279 align:start position:0%
citizenship so when a non-citizen or
 
03:51:58.670 --> 03:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
anybody presents to register to vote
 
03:52:00.349 --> 03:52:00.359 align:start position:0%
with a New Hampshire driver's license
 
03:52:01.349 --> 03:52:01.359 align:start position:0%
they're going to be able to meet three
 
03:52:02.870 --> 03:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
of the four qualifications but not
 
03:52:04.750 --> 03:52:04.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily the fourth to prove
 
03:52:07.590 --> 03:52:07.600 align:start position:0%
citizenship you need a passport American
 
03:52:12.070 --> 03:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
birth certificate um uh naturalization
 
03:52:14.910 --> 03:52:14.920 align:start position:0%
papers or any other document deemed by
 
03:52:16.990 --> 03:52:17.000 align:start position:0%
the supervisors of the checklist to be
 
03:52:19.030 --> 03:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable proof of citizenship if you
 
03:52:20.510 --> 03:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
don't have those you can sign What's
 
03:52:22.030 --> 03:52:22.040 align:start position:0%
called the qualified voter affidavit
 
03:52:24.309 --> 03:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
where you attest penalties of voter
 
03:52:25.870 --> 03:52:25.880 align:start position:0%
fraud that you are a United States
 
03:52:27.910 --> 03:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
citizen typically we see that there's
 
03:52:30.990 --> 03:52:31.000 align:start position:0%
about six or 700 of those qualified
 
03:52:33.510 --> 03:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
voters application affidavits attested
 
03:52:35.910 --> 03:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
to every state general election for the
 
03:52:37.269 --> 03:52:37.279 align:start position:0%
purpose of proving
 
03:52:40.790 --> 03:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
citizenship um as far as I'm aware and I
 
03:52:42.590 --> 03:52:42.600 align:start position:0%
was looking into this for another bill
 
03:52:45.030 --> 03:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
that was being heard today but there are
 
03:52:46.870 --> 03:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
no states in the country that currently
 
03:52:49.990 --> 03:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
require documentary proof of
 
03:52:52.269 --> 03:52:52.279 align:start position:0%
citizenship there was one in Kansas but
 
03:52:53.710 --> 03:52:53.720 align:start position:0%
that law was struck down by the 10th
 
03:52:56.630 --> 03:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
circuit so a person who's presenting
 
03:52:58.710 --> 03:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire driver's license
 
03:53:01.189 --> 03:53:01.199 align:start position:0%
citizen or non this this has nothing to
 
03:53:02.510 --> 03:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
do with proving their citizenship their
 
03:53:04.070 --> 03:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
address will be used to prove the
 
03:53:05.750 --> 03:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
domicile which is a different
 
03:53:07.590 --> 03:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
qualification but not citizenship and
 
03:53:09.349 --> 03:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
the election officials are very well
 
03:53:10.670 --> 03:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
trained on that and it's pretty clear in
 
03:53:12.389 --> 03:53:12.399 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's election
 
03:53:14.510 --> 03:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
procedure manual that that then you have
 
03:53:15.910 --> 03:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
driver's license is not qualified to
 
03:53:18.269 --> 03:53:18.279 align:start position:0%
approve citizenship and then in addition
 
03:53:20.429 --> 03:53:20.439 align:start position:0%
that uh to what my colleague said about
 
03:53:22.309 --> 03:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
falsely claiming citizenship being a
 
03:53:25.269 --> 03:53:25.279 align:start position:0%
permanent bar on naturalization it's
 
03:53:26.389 --> 03:53:26.399 align:start position:0%
also under the New Hampshire
 
03:53:28.590 --> 03:53:28.600 align:start position:0%
Constitution a lifetime ban on voting in
 
03:53:30.790 --> 03:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
the state so if that person who falsely
 
03:53:33.630 --> 03:53:33.640 align:start position:0%
held themselves out to be a citizen some
 
03:53:35.189 --> 03:53:35.199 align:start position:0%
however did naturalize which it sounds
 
03:53:36.870 --> 03:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
like they never would they still would
 
03:53:39.189 --> 03:53:39.199 align:start position:0%
have their right uh to vote permanently
 
03:53:40.429 --> 03:53:40.439 align:start position:0%
removed and less restored by the
 
03:53:41.590 --> 03:53:41.600 align:start position:0%
attorney general and governor and
 
03:53:43.590 --> 03:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
counsel so I'm happy to take any
 
03:53:45.349 --> 03:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
questions on on the voting aspect which
 
03:53:47.349 --> 03:53:47.359 align:start position:0%
is really the only thing I know anything
 
03:53:49.870 --> 03:53:49.880 align:start position:0%
about thanks very much any questions
 
03:53:52.710 --> 03:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
from the committee representative Hill
 
03:53:54.070 --> 03:53:54.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:53:57.349 --> 03:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question does that apply also
 
03:54:00.910 --> 03:54:00.920 align:start position:0%
um to the ID as opposed to just the
 
03:54:03.309 --> 03:54:03.319 align:start position:0%
driver's license do that does that
 
03:54:05.550 --> 03:54:05.560 align:start position:0%
provide three of the four requirements
 
03:54:07.790 --> 03:54:07.800 align:start position:0%
as well so you're talking about the
 
03:54:10.269 --> 03:54:10.279 align:start position:0%
state issued non voter ID yes if it has
 
03:54:12.510 --> 03:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire address which is your
 
03:54:14.990 --> 03:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
current address so I think probably
 
03:54:16.030 --> 03:54:16.040 align:start position:0%
people in this committee know better
 
03:54:18.750 --> 03:54:18.760 align:start position:0%
than I do that when you move you have to
 
03:54:20.389 --> 03:54:20.399 align:start position:0%
update your address with TMV but you do
 
03:54:21.830 --> 03:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
not have to get a new license with your
 
03:54:23.750 --> 03:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
updated address so if you move and you
 
03:54:25.670 --> 03:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
don't get a new updated address you're
 
03:54:26.830 --> 03:54:26.840 align:start position:0%
supposed to tell the people that when
 
03:54:28.110 --> 03:54:28.120 align:start position:0%
you register because it's going to have
 
03:54:29.550 --> 03:54:29.560 align:start position:0%
the wrong address and now you're going
 
03:54:30.950 --> 03:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
to have to prove your correct address
 
03:54:32.429 --> 03:54:32.439 align:start position:0%
like when I moved to Portsmith when I
 
03:54:35.469 --> 03:54:35.479 align:start position:0%
was younger my license still said Nasha
 
03:54:37.030 --> 03:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
would not allow me to register to vote
 
03:54:39.870 --> 03:54:39.880 align:start position:0%
in Portsmith with the NASA address but
 
03:54:41.990 --> 03:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
other than that yes the non-voter the
 
03:54:44.070 --> 03:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses and non-d Driver IDs
 
03:54:46.110 --> 03:54:46.120 align:start position:0%
are operate identically to prove those
 
03:54:47.309 --> 03:54:47.319 align:start position:0%
same three
 
03:54:51.710 --> 03:54:51.720 align:start position:0%
qualifications okay represent s thank
 
03:54:54.510 --> 03:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you sir for taking
 
03:54:54.520 --> 03:54:58.030 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you sir for taking
my

03:54:58.030 --> 03:54:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:01.189 --> 03:55:01.199 align:start position:0%
question am I correct in understanding
 
03:55:03.229 --> 03:55:03.239 align:start position:0%
that many towns now have gone to a
 
03:55:04.870 --> 03:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
system where on the back of the driver's
 
03:55:07.710 --> 03:55:07.720 align:start position:0%
license there's a barcode that they can
 
03:55:12.269 --> 03:55:12.279 align:start position:0%
scan and it tells it only tells them the
 
03:55:14.030 --> 03:55:14.040 align:start position:0%
three criteria that the license is
 
03:55:16.950 --> 03:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
attend ended to approve which was that
 
03:55:20.910 --> 03:55:20.920 align:start position:0%
their name where they live and their
 
03:55:22.750 --> 03:55:22.760 align:start position:0%
age that's right you're talking about
 
03:55:25.910 --> 03:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
the pull pads process yes that's right
 
03:55:27.830 --> 03:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
and I think it's because the DMV person
 
03:55:30.429 --> 03:55:30.439 align:start position:0%
would probably tell you that our DMV
 
03:55:31.950 --> 03:55:31.960 align:start position:0%
database doesn't keep track of
 
03:55:34.670 --> 03:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
citizenship correct so I I just want to
 
03:55:37.309 --> 03:55:37.319 align:start position:0%
reaffirm that there are there's new
 
03:55:39.830 --> 03:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
technology it's my understanding and I'm
 
03:55:43.469 --> 03:55:43.479 align:start position:0%
looking for you to uh validate this if
 
03:55:46.630 --> 03:55:46.640 align:start position:0%
possible that the new technology allows
 
03:55:49.189 --> 03:55:49.199 align:start position:0%
an even more efficient use of trying to
 
03:55:50.870 --> 03:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
determine the thing the things that a
 
03:55:53.469 --> 03:55:53.479 align:start position:0%
driver's license should be used for and
 
03:55:54.950 --> 03:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
only those things that a driver's
 
03:55:58.910 --> 03:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:01.189 --> 03:56:01.199 align:start position:0%
right it was in use in ports withth and
 
03:56:03.070 --> 03:56:03.080 align:start position:0%
Manchester and maybe a few other towns
 
03:56:05.110 --> 03:56:05.120 align:start position:0%
last election and it's wonderful if you
 
03:56:06.910 --> 03:56:06.920 align:start position:0%
ever get a chance to vote there any
 
03:56:08.950 --> 03:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
other questions seeing none thank you
 
03:56:12.110 --> 03:56:12.120 align:start position:0%
very much uh I just got a late card is
 
03:56:15.910 --> 03:56:15.920 align:start position:0%
this the same Eva Castillo that
 
03:56:19.070 --> 03:56:19.080 align:start position:0%
one okay I thought I already got
 
03:56:21.149 --> 03:56:21.159 align:start position:0%
one I think somebody may have done it
 
03:56:21.159 --> 03:56:23.070 align:start position:0%
one I think somebody may have done it
for

03:56:23.070 --> 03:56:23.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:56:26.309 --> 03:56:26.319 align:start position:0%
you yeah somebody did I thought you
 
03:56:27.550 --> 03:56:27.560 align:start position:0%

03:56:31.070 --> 03:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
which I can't I can't let you do so so
 
03:56:32.550 --> 03:56:32.560 align:start position:0%
with that being said I have nobody else
 
03:56:33.830 --> 03:56:33.840 align:start position:0%

okay I'm going to open up the public
 
03:57:55.550 --> 03:57:55.560 align:start position:0%
hearing on Senate Bill 358 FN relative

to invalidating out ofst state driver's
 
03:57:59.309 --> 03:57:59.319 align:start position:0%
licenses issued to undocumented
 
03:58:02.189 --> 03:58:02.199 align:start position:0%
immigrants uh chair recognizes Senator
 
03:58:04.510 --> 03:58:04.520 align:start position:0%
Gan and Prime sponsor welcome sir thank
 
03:58:06.630 --> 03:58:06.640 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair how you doing um I hope you
 
03:58:09.030 --> 03:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
did I hope you saved the best for last s
 
03:58:12.830 --> 03:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
on your last bill um 358 is a bill
 
03:58:14.389 --> 03:58:14.399 align:start position:0%
codifying in statute that that New
 
03:58:16.990 --> 03:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does not validate driver's
 
03:58:18.950 --> 03:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
licenses from other states given
 
03:58:21.429 --> 03:58:21.439 align:start position:0%
exclusively to undocumented immigrants
 
03:58:23.710 --> 03:58:23.720 align:start position:0%
so very different from the last bill um
 
03:58:26.269 --> 03:58:26.279 align:start position:0%
I became a became aware of this um a
 
03:58:28.910 --> 03:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
year or two ago I was in Philadelphia
 
03:58:31.429 --> 03:58:31.439 align:start position:0%
I'm a proud father of a sun getting his
 
03:58:33.469 --> 03:58:33.479 align:start position:0%
Masters this month and I was reading in
 
03:58:35.590 --> 03:58:35.600 align:start position:0%
the Philly papers where they were
 
03:58:38.550 --> 03:58:38.560 align:start position:0%
issuing um licenses to illegal aliance
 
03:58:40.750 --> 03:58:40.760 align:start position:0%
in in in Pennsylvania that was also
 
03:58:42.110 --> 03:58:42.120 align:start position:0%
going to you're automatically then
 
03:58:44.630 --> 03:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
registered to vote so just Flags went
 
03:58:46.710 --> 03:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
off in my head then I started realizing
 
03:58:48.590 --> 03:58:48.600 align:start position:0%
other states were doing it Massachusetts
 
03:58:53.510 --> 03:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
is now giving uh out ofate un documented
 
03:58:56.189 --> 03:58:56.199 align:start position:0%
aliens licenses the problem is some
 
03:58:58.189 --> 03:58:58.199 align:start position:0%
states are
 
03:59:00.590 --> 03:59:00.600 align:start position:0%
putting notice on it so you can see
 
03:59:02.469 --> 03:59:02.479 align:start position:0%
they'll have some wording so you'll be
 
03:59:05.630 --> 03:59:05.640 align:start position:0%
aware that it's not a legal resident um
 
03:59:07.950 --> 03:59:07.960 align:start position:0%
other states now have for whatever be
 
03:59:09.870 --> 03:59:09.880 align:start position:0%
they good or nefarious reasons just
 
03:59:11.830 --> 03:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
decided to take that
 
03:59:14.349 --> 03:59:14.359 align:start position:0%
off um and so that is where we're got
 
03:59:15.830 --> 03:59:15.840 align:start position:0%
more concerned with it and why the
 
03:59:19.510 --> 03:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
Senate voted this bill through um
 
03:59:21.990 --> 03:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
current law already prohibits issuing a
 
03:59:23.790 --> 03:59:23.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire driver's license to an
 
03:59:26.550 --> 03:59:26.560 align:start position:0%
undocumented resident this legislation
 
03:59:28.070 --> 03:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
would just clarified that the same
 
03:59:30.149 --> 03:59:30.159 align:start position:0%
standard applies to licenses granted
 
03:59:32.750 --> 03:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
from other states validating a license
 
03:59:34.910 --> 03:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
for an undocumented resident causes an
 
03:59:37.550 --> 03:59:37.560 align:start position:0%
incentive for more illegal immigrations
 
03:59:39.469 --> 03:59:39.479 align:start position:0%
states are being forced to deal with the
 
03:59:42.750 --> 03:59:42.760 align:start position:0%
open immigration policies um and that's
 
03:59:44.550 --> 03:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
partially for many reasons
 
03:59:46.670 --> 03:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
um just in New Hampshire last year we
 
03:59:50.189 --> 03:59:50.199 align:start position:0%
had the mass murderer from Brazil we had
 
03:59:53.750 --> 03:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
um in again just last year in Manchester
 
03:59:55.670 --> 03:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
we had someone transporting illegal
 
03:59:57.110 --> 03:59:57.120 align:start position:0%
aliens we've had the same at the
 
03:59:59.830 --> 03:59:59.840 align:start position:0%
northern border we've had cases of rape
 
04:00:03.469 --> 04:00:03.479 align:start position:0%
we've have cases of assault and um as
 
04:00:05.710 --> 04:00:05.720 align:start position:0%
you all watch TV you see the same thing
 
04:00:07.670 --> 04:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
that I'm seeing that there are problems
 
04:00:09.990 --> 04:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
with the Border um partially because
 
04:00:12.030 --> 04:00:12.040 align:start position:0%
we're not betting people at the border
 
04:00:14.389 --> 04:00:14.399 align:start position:0%
and that's 8 to 10 million I won argue
 
04:00:17.070 --> 04:00:17.080 align:start position:0%
what the exact number is with anyone um
 
04:00:19.070 --> 04:00:19.080 align:start position:0%
but it's a large number and the problem
 
04:00:20.429 --> 04:00:20.439 align:start position:0%
is they're not being vetted at the
 
04:00:22.910 --> 04:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
border and that does not count which um
 
04:00:24.389 --> 04:00:24.399 align:start position:0%
border patrol is estimating there's
 
04:00:27.110 --> 04:00:27.120 align:start position:0%
another 10 or 15% of Goda aways who
 
04:00:29.030 --> 04:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
haven't even encountered anyone we have
 
04:00:32.309 --> 04:00:32.319 align:start position:0%
no idea they're even here um custom and
 
04:00:36.070 --> 04:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
border patrol last year had uh 169
 
04:00:38.110 --> 04:00:38.120 align:start position:0%
individual terrorists that were caught
 
04:00:40.189 --> 04:00:40.199 align:start position:0%
at the southern border um who are on
 
04:00:43.550 --> 04:00:43.560 align:start position:0%
this watch list um we had 36,000 with
 
04:00:45.790 --> 04:00:45.800 align:start position:0%
criminal convictions and again we don't
 
04:00:47.590 --> 04:00:47.600 align:start position:0%
know how many people were got aways that
 
04:00:50.349 --> 04:00:50.359 align:start position:0%
never were checked by anyone so it is a
 
04:00:53.389 --> 04:00:53.399 align:start position:0%
consideration and we in New Hampshire
 
04:00:56.110 --> 04:00:56.120 align:start position:0%
for several reasons want to we being the
 
04:00:59.229 --> 04:00:59.239 align:start position:0%
Senate want to look into who's here why
 
04:01:00.469 --> 04:01:00.479 align:start position:0%
they're here and if we're giving them a
 
04:01:04.950 --> 04:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
driver's license um 358 is a tool you
 
04:01:07.710 --> 04:01:07.720 align:start position:0%
know we're saying I come my grandparents
 
04:01:09.710 --> 04:01:09.720 align:start position:0%
are legal immigrants just like many
 
04:01:13.110 --> 04:01:13.120 align:start position:0%
people who went before me and we totally
 
04:01:13.120 --> 04:01:14.429 align:start position:0%
people who went before me and we totally
appreciate

04:01:14.429 --> 04:01:14.439 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
04:01:17.830 --> 04:01:17.840 align:start position:0%
and realize the necessary presence and
 
04:01:19.269 --> 04:01:19.279 align:start position:0%
they're doing good work in New Hampshire
 
04:01:21.149 --> 04:01:21.159 align:start position:0%
they're good people raising families but
 
04:01:22.790 --> 04:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
again we're not betting enough of the
 
04:01:24.790 --> 04:01:24.800 align:start position:0%
people so when other states are giving
 
04:01:27.469 --> 04:01:27.479 align:start position:0%
illegal aliens drivers licenses it's
 
04:01:30.710 --> 04:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
going to present many problems um and
 
04:01:32.670 --> 04:01:32.680 align:start position:0%
would rather them state if another state
 
04:01:35.630 --> 04:01:35.640 align:start position:0%
wants to give a resident a driver's
 
04:01:38.469 --> 04:01:38.479 align:start position:0%
license or then in like a sanctuary
 
04:01:40.710 --> 04:01:40.720 align:start position:0%
State like Massachusetts we're not one
 
04:01:43.469 --> 04:01:43.479 align:start position:0%
of them and we're not encouraging that
 
04:01:46.229 --> 04:01:46.239 align:start position:0%
um this bill invalidates licenses where
 
04:01:48.910 --> 04:01:48.920 align:start position:0%
the license is issued exclusively to
 
04:01:51.309 --> 04:01:51.319 align:start position:0%
undocumented immigrants or the license
 
04:01:53.550 --> 04:01:53.560 align:start position:0%
is substantially the same as licenses
 
04:01:56.429 --> 04:01:56.439 align:start position:0%
issued to Citizens residents or those
 
04:01:58.590 --> 04:01:58.600 align:start position:0%
lawfully present in the United States
 
04:02:00.510 --> 04:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
but has markings again we have two types
 
04:02:02.070 --> 04:02:02.080 align:start position:0%
some states are putting markings
 
04:02:05.149 --> 04:02:05.159 align:start position:0%
establishing that they're a non-citizen
 
04:02:06.910 --> 04:02:06.920 align:start position:0%
others are not and they're just giving
 
04:02:09.510 --> 04:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
regular drivers licenses of this bill
 
04:02:11.590 --> 04:02:11.600 align:start position:0%
does not invalidate licenses that are
 
04:02:13.950 --> 04:02:13.960 align:start position:0%
exactly the same as licenses issued by
 
04:02:16.750 --> 04:02:16.760 align:start position:0%
state to lawful pres citizens this bill
 
04:02:18.590 --> 04:02:18.600 align:start position:0%
does not require police officers to
 
04:02:20.750 --> 04:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
question anyone Whose license does not
 
04:02:22.710 --> 04:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
have identifiable markings or is
 
04:02:25.030 --> 04:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
indicating the person is undocumented
 
04:02:27.149 --> 04:02:27.159 align:start position:0%
there'll be no profiling here the New
 
04:02:28.750 --> 04:02:28.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire DMV has said the
 
04:02:30.990 --> 04:02:31.000 align:start position:0%
implementation of giving licenses to
 
04:02:32.710 --> 04:02:32.720 align:start position:0%
illegal aliens would increase the
 
04:02:34.590 --> 04:02:34.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity for fraudulent activities
 
04:02:36.990 --> 04:02:37.000 align:start position:0%
regarding identity documentation and
 
04:02:39.229 --> 04:02:39.239 align:start position:0%
documentation regarding residency
 
04:02:41.349 --> 04:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
assuming an ID like this would be the
 
04:02:43.790 --> 04:02:43.800 align:start position:0%
start of allowing access to Safe public
 
04:02:45.870 --> 04:02:45.880 align:start position:0%
Public Services needed by Lael New
 
04:02:47.550 --> 04:02:47.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens the state of
 
04:02:49.309 --> 04:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is paying a billion
 
04:02:52.389 --> 04:02:52.399 align:start position:0%
dollars now supporting their legal
 
04:02:54.710 --> 04:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
aliens we cannot follow the same we
 
04:02:57.110 --> 04:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
can't afford it in summary if you're in
 
04:02:59.229 --> 04:02:59.239 align:start position:0%
the United States illegally you should
 
04:03:01.790 --> 04:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
not pass or possess a state issue
 
04:03:05.870 --> 04:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
driver's license thank you Mr
 
04:03:07.910 --> 04:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you any questions from
 
04:03:11.309 --> 04:03:11.319 align:start position:0%
the committee represent Gorski thank you
 
04:03:12.750 --> 04:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you senator for
 
04:03:14.830 --> 04:03:14.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh we've been hearing
 
04:03:17.830 --> 04:03:17.840 align:start position:0%
the term lawful presence and um all
 
04:03:21.269 --> 04:03:21.279 align:start position:0%
pretty much today your bill says lawful
 
04:03:23.030 --> 04:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
presence what does lawful presence in
 
04:03:27.229 --> 04:03:27.239 align:start position:0%
your bill mean so and I was listening to
 
04:03:29.870 --> 04:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
your testimony before to me lawful
 
04:03:32.590 --> 04:03:32.600 align:start position:0%
presence if you have so we have groups
 
04:03:34.309 --> 04:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
of people who here who haven't gone they
 
04:03:36.070 --> 04:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
haven't their gotway or whatever you
 
04:03:38.189 --> 04:03:38.199 align:start position:0%
want to call them and so that's a big
 
04:03:40.389 --> 04:03:40.399 align:start position:0%
problem and it's of itself but if you
 
04:03:43.030 --> 04:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
have gone through as I understand I am
 
04:03:44.910 --> 04:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
an attorney but am not an immigration's
 
04:03:47.550 --> 04:03:47.560 align:start position:0%
attorney as I understand it once you've
 
04:03:51.790 --> 04:03:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:54.389 --> 04:03:54.399 align:start position:0%
technically are legally here you know
 
04:03:56.710 --> 04:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
you've gone through some I I I'm not
 
04:03:59.070 --> 04:03:59.080 align:start position:0%
sure anyway so that would be a good
 
04:04:01.510 --> 04:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
question for an immigration attorney to
 
04:04:03.030 --> 04:04:03.040 align:start position:0%
answer you
 
04:04:05.630 --> 04:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
specifically I'll avoid it any other
 
04:04:07.830 --> 04:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
questions representative St
 
04:04:10.630 --> 04:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
Clair thank you Mr
 
04:04:13.349 --> 04:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
chair and I would like one followup uh
 
04:04:17.950 --> 04:04:17.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chair chair in your in your speech I
 
04:04:22.309 --> 04:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
guess uh you talked about terrorists you
 
04:04:24.790 --> 04:04:24.800 align:start position:0%
talked about people coming I think from
 
04:04:26.950 --> 04:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
the southern border of the United States
 
04:04:29.229 --> 04:04:29.239 align:start position:0%
definitely from the northern border I'm
 
04:04:30.910 --> 04:04:30.920 align:start position:0%
just trying to wrap my head around what
 
04:04:33.830 --> 04:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
that has to do with driver's licenses
 
04:04:35.870 --> 04:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
that have been issued by Massachusetts
 
04:04:38.110 --> 04:04:38.120 align:start position:0%
or other states where people have
 
04:04:41.030 --> 04:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
identification granted by by that state
 
04:04:42.910 --> 04:04:42.920 align:start position:0%
but I I don't get what that has to do
 
04:04:44.670 --> 04:04:44.680 align:start position:0%
with the issue you talked about at the
 
04:04:47.110 --> 04:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
border they'll be driving in our state
 
04:04:49.550 --> 04:04:49.560 align:start position:0%
so you have S you have people from other
 
04:04:52.349 --> 04:04:52.359 align:start position:0%
countries who have not been vetted we do
 
04:04:53.830 --> 04:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
not know if they're criminals we don't
 
04:04:55.750 --> 04:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
know anything about their background and
 
04:04:57.429 --> 04:04:57.439 align:start position:0%
you're going to be allowing them into
 
04:04:59.269 --> 04:04:59.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire this bill would be saying
 
04:05:03.110 --> 04:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
that if you issue another state issues
 
04:05:05.950 --> 04:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
an illegal alien or undocumented citizen
 
04:05:07.550 --> 04:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
whatever you want to
 
04:05:09.910 --> 04:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
call we're we're saying we haven't beded
 
04:05:11.269 --> 04:05:11.279 align:start position:0%
those people we don't know want them
 
04:05:12.870 --> 04:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
driving on our streets they could come
 
04:05:14.550 --> 04:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire they couldn't get a
 
04:05:16.389 --> 04:05:16.399 align:start position:0%
driver's license in New Hampshire they
 
04:05:18.550 --> 04:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
don't meet the credentials that we have
 
04:05:21.870 --> 04:05:21.880 align:start position:0%
set up so just because another state has
 
04:05:23.670 --> 04:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
done that doesn't mean we want to accept
 
04:05:25.910 --> 04:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
what they've done so as far as
 
04:05:28.229 --> 04:05:28.239 align:start position:0%
reciprocity I have run this by our legal
 
04:05:30.309 --> 04:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
council and the Senate and they did not
 
04:05:33.070 --> 04:05:33.080 align:start position:0%
find a problem on this would follow up
 
04:05:36.389 --> 04:05:36.399 align:start position:0%
please thank you and you you said that
 
04:05:38.269 --> 04:05:38.279 align:start position:0%
some states have markings on the
 
04:05:40.510 --> 04:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
driver's license but other states don't
 
04:05:44.070 --> 04:05:44.080 align:start position:0%
yes so how do you expect law enforcement
 
04:05:46.910 --> 04:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
to tell the difference between these
 
04:05:48.590 --> 04:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
drivers that you want to ban from
 
04:05:52.309 --> 04:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
driving in the state of New Hampshire so
 
04:05:53.710 --> 04:05:53.720 align:start position:0%
just because there are enforcement
 
04:05:56.630 --> 04:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
issues here so the ones that say non you
 
04:05:58.229 --> 04:05:58.239 align:start position:0%
know if you I don't there's two or three
 
04:06:00.630 --> 04:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
states that put a recognition that
 
04:06:02.309 --> 04:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
you're not an American citizen they'll
 
04:06:04.030 --> 04:06:04.040 align:start position:0%
say non-citizen whatever they say on the
 
04:06:05.910 --> 04:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
license so when if someone pulls them
 
04:06:07.830 --> 04:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
over they will know right away the other
 
04:06:09.469 --> 04:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
ones just because there is an
 
04:06:11.910 --> 04:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement problem doesn't mean the
 
04:06:14.990 --> 04:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
policy is improper the policy here is we
 
04:06:16.990 --> 04:06:17.000 align:start position:0%
do not want to have people who haven't
 
04:06:20.269 --> 04:06:20.279 align:start position:0%
been vetted bringing be coming to New
 
04:06:22.269 --> 04:06:22.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and there is enforcement
 
04:06:24.149 --> 04:06:24.159 align:start position:0%
problems with the ones that don't say
 
04:06:26.510 --> 04:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
anything but where there's technically
 
04:06:28.590 --> 04:06:28.600 align:start position:0%
not going to be legal in New
 
04:06:32.389 --> 04:06:32.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you any other
 
04:06:35.429 --> 04:06:35.439 align:start position:0%
questions representative SES thank you
 
04:06:37.590 --> 04:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you senator for taking
 
04:06:40.309 --> 04:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
my question thank you did I understand
 
04:06:42.349 --> 04:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
you correctly to say
 
04:06:47.070 --> 04:06:47.080 align:start position:0%
that a person who is a uh non-citizen
 
04:06:49.189 --> 04:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
who achieves driving privileges in
 
04:06:52.110 --> 04:06:52.120 align:start position:0%
another state coming driving in this
 
04:06:54.590 --> 04:06:54.600 align:start position:0%
state would be potentially subject to
 
04:06:56.510 --> 04:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
further penalties for driving under that
 
04:06:57.950 --> 04:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
type of license that is
 
04:06:57.960 --> 04:07:01.389 align:start position:0%
type of license that is
correct

04:07:01.389 --> 04:07:01.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:05.630 --> 04:07:05.640 align:start position:0%
so a a followup thank you Mr chairman
 
04:07:08.990 --> 04:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
keep me on track here
 
04:07:12.149 --> 04:07:12.159 align:start position:0%
um I guess I'm struggling with with the
 
04:07:16.910 --> 04:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:18.950 --> 04:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
we give
 
04:07:21.710 --> 04:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
noncitizens drivers licenses here in New
 
04:07:25.630 --> 04:07:25.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire all the time and other states
 
04:07:28.950 --> 04:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
Give noncitizens driving privileges all
 
04:07:32.269 --> 04:07:32.279 align:start position:0%
the time and in fact many of those folks
 
04:07:36.590 --> 04:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
may actually live in Maine or wherever
 
04:07:38.790 --> 04:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
and drive over into the Hampshire to
 
04:07:41.790 --> 04:07:41.800 align:start position:0%
work and you're now saying no they can't
 
04:07:43.469 --> 04:07:43.479 align:start position:0%
do that no if you're here on a studio
 
04:07:46.429 --> 04:07:46.439 align:start position:0%
stud visa for instance or a J1 work visa
 
04:07:47.990 --> 04:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
you would certainly be able to have that
 
04:07:50.070 --> 04:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
license it's when you're an
 
04:07:52.830 --> 04:07:52.840 align:start position:0%
undocumented immigrant who hasn't gone
 
04:07:54.710 --> 04:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
through any vetting that we would not
 
04:07:57.189 --> 04:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
allow you to drive on our streets
 
04:07:59.590 --> 04:07:59.600 align:start position:0%
technically I have to follow I I I'll
 
04:08:02.309 --> 04:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
let me finish that part though so there
 
04:08:04.550 --> 04:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
is an enforcement it's easy to have the
 
04:08:07.030 --> 04:08:07.040 align:start position:0%
states that put non-citizen those ones
 
04:08:09.469 --> 04:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
will be easy the others we won't know if
 
04:08:11.269 --> 04:08:11.279 align:start position:0%
there's a driving an accident okay I'm
 
04:08:12.990 --> 04:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm not answering your question
 
04:08:15.070 --> 04:08:15.080 align:start position:0%
you're not that that's the problem I'm
 
04:08:17.830 --> 04:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
having EXC did you one more yes I'm
 
04:08:21.109 --> 04:08:21.119 align:start position:0%
sorry but I this
 
04:08:23.229 --> 04:08:23.239 align:start position:0%
is this is an
 
04:08:26.950 --> 04:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
important point that is trying to be uh
 
04:08:30.750 --> 04:08:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:33.429 --> 04:08:33.439 align:start position:0%
to so you you made the statement you
 
04:08:36.309 --> 04:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
made the statement Senator that states
 
04:08:39.229 --> 04:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
that put noncitizenship
 
04:08:41.790 --> 04:08:41.800 align:start position:0%
status on their driver's license that
 
04:08:44.109 --> 04:08:44.119 align:start position:0%
would be easy for us to follow follow
 
04:08:47.309 --> 04:08:47.319 align:start position:0%
yes and do what well you would not be
 
04:08:48.710 --> 04:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
legally driving on New Hampshire
 
04:08:51.510 --> 04:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
roadways if in that in your scenario if
 
04:08:54.510 --> 04:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
it was an undocumented immigrant driving
 
04:08:56.950 --> 04:08:56.960 align:start position:0%
on our roads and it's said non US
 
04:08:59.950 --> 04:08:59.960 align:start position:0%
citizen how do you how will you know
 
04:09:01.910 --> 04:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
which is which well I'll know on the
 
04:09:04.389 --> 04:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
ones that the ones that are stamped I
 
04:09:06.830 --> 04:09:06.840 align:start position:0%
will know you are correct in saying that
 
04:09:09.109 --> 04:09:09.119 align:start position:0%
they'll be in it is just because our
 
04:09:11.469 --> 04:09:11.479 align:start position:0%
policy is we do not in the Senate what
 
04:09:13.710 --> 04:09:13.720 align:start position:0%
we passed was we do not want people who
 
04:09:17.269 --> 04:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
haven't been vetted so when it says
 
04:09:19.269 --> 04:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
non-citizen you'll know right away it
 
04:09:20.790 --> 04:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
just because we have enforcement
 
04:09:22.550 --> 04:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
problems doesn't mean the policy is
 
04:09:24.870 --> 04:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
wrong I understand your enforcement
 
04:09:27.550 --> 04:09:27.560 align:start position:0%
policy in some situations with the ones
 
04:09:29.910 --> 04:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
that like in Massachusetts if they you
 
04:09:31.950 --> 04:09:31.960 align:start position:0%
come here tomorrow and they gave you as
 
04:09:35.229 --> 04:09:35.239 align:start position:0%
an undocumented immigrant they gave you
 
04:09:37.109 --> 04:09:37.119 align:start position:0%
a driver's license tomorrow after you
 
04:09:39.590 --> 04:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
just got here they know nothing about
 
04:09:42.670 --> 04:09:42.680 align:start position:0%
you and we think that that is going to
 
04:09:44.670 --> 04:09:44.680 align:start position:0%
be a magnet for
 
04:09:46.910 --> 04:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
problems you may not agree with that
 
04:09:49.830 --> 04:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
representative Hill thanks Mr chairman
 
04:09:49.840 --> 04:09:50.590 align:start position:0%
representative Hill thanks Mr chairman
yes

04:09:50.590 --> 04:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:09:53.830 --> 04:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for coming um
 
04:09:55.269 --> 04:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
I'll give this a shot and I think this
 
04:09:57.670 --> 04:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
is the question several of us have sure
 
04:10:01.790 --> 04:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
how would someone that received a
 
04:10:04.630 --> 04:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
driver's license that is a non US
 
04:10:08.149 --> 04:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
citizen but here on a green card um
 
04:10:11.269 --> 04:10:11.279 align:start position:0%
green card would be fine but how would
 
04:10:14.149 --> 04:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
the the but the license that that person
 
04:10:17.950 --> 04:10:17.960 align:start position:0%
receives in Indiana and comes here to
 
04:10:21.710 --> 04:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
drive wouldn't say here on a green card
 
04:10:24.590 --> 04:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
it would just say non US citizens so if
 
04:10:26.269 --> 04:10:26.279 align:start position:0%
we go to the bill itself I believe it'll
 
04:10:29.590 --> 04:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
answer our question okay um if they're
 
04:10:31.830 --> 04:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
unable to prove presence in the US when
 
04:10:33.429 --> 04:10:33.439 align:start position:0%
the license is issued the driver's
 
04:10:35.950 --> 04:10:35.960 align:start position:0%
license or permit reporting to authorize
 
04:10:38.830 --> 04:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
the holder of a motor vehicle on Pro
 
04:10:40.950 --> 04:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
public roadways it is valid invalid in
 
04:10:43.309 --> 04:10:43.319 align:start position:0%
the state does not authorize the holder
 
04:10:46.189 --> 04:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
to operate a motor vehicle in the state
 
04:10:49.229 --> 04:10:49.239 align:start position:0%
so it's when they have unable to prove
 
04:10:52.309 --> 04:10:52.319 align:start position:0%
lawful presence then they would not be
 
04:10:54.710 --> 04:10:54.720 align:start position:0%
validly driving in New Hampshire roads
 
04:10:57.229 --> 04:10:57.239 align:start position:0%
proving this will be very hard I will
 
04:10:59.109 --> 04:10:59.119 align:start position:0%
grant you that but doesn't mean the
 
04:11:01.910 --> 04:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
policy is bad it means falling through
 
04:11:04.510 --> 04:11:04.520 align:start position:0%
in the real world part is bad in that
 
04:11:10.750 --> 04:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:14.870 --> 04:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
Val so does this then become a papers
 
04:11:17.550 --> 04:11:17.560 align:start position:0%
please what a papers please law you have
 
04:11:19.790 --> 04:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
to prove that you're here legally no in
 
04:11:21.950 --> 04:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
order to to be here did not at all times
 
04:11:23.990 --> 04:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
when the police ask you if you were so
 
04:11:25.750 --> 04:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
if they pulled you over for speeding and
 
04:11:28.429 --> 04:11:28.439 align:start position:0%
you had one of the licenses from a state
 
04:11:30.990 --> 04:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
that tagged you noncitizen or they would
 
04:11:33.590 --> 04:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
tag you then we would know that but we
 
04:11:35.990 --> 04:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
would not know and we would only find
 
04:11:38.510 --> 04:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
out it one thing we don't want people to
 
04:11:40.070 --> 04:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
be issued out of if they come here with
 
04:11:42.030 --> 04:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
an out ofate license we think it's
 
04:11:43.590 --> 04:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
problematic that then they could go for
 
04:11:45.790 --> 04:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire state license and turn
 
04:11:47.429 --> 04:11:47.439 align:start position:0%
that state license in so we think that's
 
04:11:49.309 --> 04:11:49.319 align:start position:0%
a potential problem we think it's a
 
04:11:52.510 --> 04:11:52.520 align:start position:0%
potential problem for you know Aid which
 
04:11:55.309 --> 04:11:55.319 align:start position:0%
um if you have people here you're going
 
04:11:57.309 --> 04:11:57.319 align:start position:0%
to have to support and pay for some of
 
04:11:59.229 --> 04:11:59.239 align:start position:0%
these people who have no assets of their
 
04:12:02.149 --> 04:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
own so we think it it can lead to other
 
04:12:05.469 --> 04:12:05.479 align:start position:0%
problems besides the driving problems so
 
04:12:07.870 --> 04:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
there is Enforcement issue problems when
 
04:12:09.710 --> 04:12:09.720 align:start position:0%
people have a license that looks exactly
 
04:12:11.790 --> 04:12:11.800 align:start position:0%
the same as US citizens from
 
04:12:13.990 --> 04:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts coming here from other
 
04:12:16.750 --> 04:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
countries with that same license it will
 
04:12:19.750 --> 04:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
be problematic to enforce it and we will
 
04:12:23.070 --> 04:12:23.080 align:start position:0%
not profile they will not ask
 
04:12:27.870 --> 04:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
anyway you follow so in order to travel
 
04:12:29.269 --> 04:12:29.279 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire I would have to carry
 
04:12:32.510 --> 04:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
my passport if I'm not a US citizen so I
 
04:12:34.269 --> 04:12:34.279 align:start position:0%
have to IM immigrate into New Hampshire
 
04:12:36.109 --> 04:12:36.119 align:start position:0%
every time I come across the if you come
 
04:12:38.510 --> 04:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
if you're an undocumented immigrant with
 
04:12:40.590 --> 04:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
a Massachusetts license they pull you
 
04:12:43.550 --> 04:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
over for a traffic violation they're not
 
04:12:45.229 --> 04:12:45.239 align:start position:0%
going to ask you it's they're not
 
04:12:47.630 --> 04:12:47.640 align:start position:0%
allowed to profile you if there was a
 
04:12:50.309 --> 04:12:50.319 align:start position:0%
car accident you might have problems is
 
04:12:51.870 --> 04:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
an insurance company going to cover you
 
04:12:54.109 --> 04:12:54.119 align:start position:0%
have you do have insurance um so there
 
04:12:56.630 --> 04:12:56.640 align:start position:0%
are other potential problems
 
04:12:59.189 --> 04:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
but we couldn't prove it in that
 
04:13:00.750 --> 04:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
instance we can only prove it when it
 
04:13:05.510 --> 04:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:05.520 --> 04:13:07.030 align:start position:0%
 
non-citizen

04:13:07.030 --> 04:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
non-citizen
 
04:13:07.040 --> 04:13:09.229 align:start position:0%
non-citizen
anybody

04:13:09.229 --> 04:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
04:13:12.750 --> 04:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
new other questions seeing n thank you
 
04:13:18.910 --> 04:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:21.990 --> 04:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative okay the the pile
 
04:13:25.590 --> 04:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
continues to grow here with every
 
04:13:28.349 --> 04:13:28.359 align:start position:0%
minute so let's do
 
04:13:32.070 --> 04:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
this we are going to see most people are
 
04:13:34.389 --> 04:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
requesting three minutes so three
 
04:13:36.469 --> 04:13:36.479 align:start position:0%
minutes it will be and we will we will
 
04:13:36.479 --> 04:13:37.389 align:start position:0%
minutes it will be and we will we will
be

04:13:37.389 --> 04:13:37.399 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:13:40.189 --> 04:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
timing so we'll start with uh chair
 
04:13:42.189 --> 04:13:42.199 align:start position:0%
recognizing Christine Wellington in
 
04:13:45.550 --> 04:13:45.560 align:start position:0%
support no opposition to the bill sorry
 
04:13:51.590 --> 04:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:54.630 --> 04:13:54.640 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you chairman Walsh and
 
04:13:58.269 --> 04:13:58.279 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um just want to
 
04:14:00.870 --> 04:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
as briefly as possible just say that
 
04:14:04.510 --> 04:14:04.520 align:start position:0%
this um bill will cause more harm than
 
04:14:08.429 --> 04:14:08.439 align:start position:0%
it will do good um there's currently 21
 
04:14:10.910 --> 04:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions 19 States and two
 
04:14:13.070 --> 04:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
territories Puerto Rico and uh District
 
04:14:15.510 --> 04:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
District of col Columbia that allow
 
04:14:19.389 --> 04:14:19.399 align:start position:0%
driver licenses just to undocumented
 
04:14:21.229 --> 04:14:21.239 align:start position:0%
folks living within their
 
04:14:24.269 --> 04:14:24.279 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions um this bill is appears to
 
04:14:26.590 --> 04:14:26.600 align:start position:0%
be modeled after a Florida bill that was
 
04:14:29.790 --> 04:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
enacted and went into effect in July
 
04:14:33.750 --> 04:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
Florida um initially had five states
 
04:14:35.710 --> 04:14:35.720 align:start position:0%
five states only that they said they
 
04:14:39.429 --> 04:14:39.439 align:start position:0%
were not going to um honor uh those
 
04:14:42.309 --> 04:14:42.319 align:start position:0%
licenses and they had to um scale it
 
04:14:44.469 --> 04:14:44.479 align:start position:0%
back down to too so for all of this
 
04:14:46.750 --> 04:14:46.760 align:start position:0%
helloo there's two states that they're
 
04:14:50.070 --> 04:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
going to focus in on um these things are
 
04:14:52.710 --> 04:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
going to whether intended to do so or
 
04:14:55.950 --> 04:14:55.960 align:start position:0%
not um because of the fear-mongering
 
04:14:58.309 --> 04:14:58.319 align:start position:0%
that accompanies this kind of
 
04:15:01.469 --> 04:15:01.479 align:start position:0%
legislation is very much going to raise
 
04:15:05.149 --> 04:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
the risk of profiling and holding
 
04:15:07.710 --> 04:15:07.720 align:start position:0%
somebody on the side of the road for too
 
04:15:09.910 --> 04:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
long trying to figure out what the heck
 
04:15:13.349 --> 04:15:13.359 align:start position:0%
is lawful presence it's too confusing
 
04:15:16.109 --> 04:15:16.119 align:start position:0%
and it does not reflect I believe and
 
04:15:19.750 --> 04:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
many of us believe New Hampshire values
 
04:15:23.149 --> 04:15:23.159 align:start position:0%
um so I we it it and it's also if if we
 
04:15:24.510 --> 04:15:24.520 align:start position:0%
really did have a value that we want to
 
04:15:26.590 --> 04:15:26.600 align:start position:0%
stop everybody that's undocumented from
 
04:15:29.269 --> 04:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
coming into the state um then we are
 
04:15:31.630 --> 04:15:31.640 align:start position:0%
letting a whole bunch of folks um able
 
04:15:33.349 --> 04:15:33.359 align:start position:0%
to drive here with Massachusetts
 
04:15:35.710 --> 04:15:35.720 align:start position:0%
licenses and other licenses New
 
04:15:37.229 --> 04:15:37.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Maine I believe are the
 
04:15:39.710 --> 04:15:39.720 align:start position:0%
only two states right now that don't
 
04:15:43.189 --> 04:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
allow um undocumented people that meet
 
04:15:45.149 --> 04:15:45.159 align:start position:0%
certain benchmarks from being able to
 
04:15:49.550 --> 04:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
obtain a driver's license um there it's
 
04:15:51.550 --> 04:15:51.560 align:start position:0%
fundamentally unfair for somebody who
 
04:15:55.990 --> 04:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
has gone to their own State DMV and
 
04:15:57.630 --> 04:15:57.640 align:start position:0%
jumped through all the Hoops they have
 
04:15:59.189 --> 04:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
and yes if you're a Massachusetts
 
04:16:02.670 --> 04:16:02.680 align:start position:0%
resident You by law must have insurance
 
04:16:06.149 --> 04:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
to to unbeknown to them um be able to um
 
04:16:10.429 --> 04:16:10.439 align:start position:0%
be um penalized and um cited for driving
 
04:16:12.469 --> 04:16:12.479 align:start position:0%
without a license after you've done
 
04:16:14.429 --> 04:16:14.439 align:start position:0%
everything you could because the state
 
04:16:18.309 --> 04:16:18.319 align:start position:0%
you live in allows you to do that um it
 
04:16:20.429 --> 04:16:20.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't promote highway safety because
 
04:16:23.030 --> 04:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
people who have driver's licenses
 
04:16:25.950 --> 04:16:25.960 align:start position:0%
presumably are um trained and have to
 
04:16:28.429 --> 04:16:28.439 align:start position:0%
pass certain Benchmark tests it will
 
04:16:31.189 --> 04:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
also be a bureaucratic nightmare for the
 
04:16:34.309 --> 04:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
DMV to try to figure out as the laws EV
 
04:16:36.630 --> 04:16:36.640 align:start position:0%
flow throughout the United States who
 
04:16:39.550 --> 04:16:39.560 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to um declare our um
 
04:16:41.349 --> 04:16:41.359 align:start position:0%
holders of licenses that might be
 
04:16:43.790 --> 04:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
suspect I think that's all I have to say
 
04:16:46.229 --> 04:16:46.239 align:start position:0%
at this point in time thank you very
 
04:16:48.229 --> 04:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
much thank you any questions from the
 
04:16:50.990 --> 04:16:51.000 align:start position:0%

chairman and thank you for taking my
 
04:16:53.950 --> 04:16:53.960 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned there was 19
 
04:16:55.950 --> 04:16:55.960 align:start position:0%
states that give licenses to one
 
04:16:58.109 --> 04:16:58.119 align:start position:0%
documented immigrants from your
 
04:17:00.510 --> 04:17:00.520 align:start position:0%
knowledge do all 19 States use the same
 
04:17:00.520 --> 04:17:01.550 align:start position:0%
knowledge do all 19 States use the same
vetting

04:17:01.550 --> 04:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
vetting
 
04:17:05.469 --> 04:17:05.479 align:start position:0%
process they each state has their own as
 
04:17:08.510 --> 04:17:08.520 align:start position:0%
we do regulations Etc and I I I have not
 
04:17:10.229 --> 04:17:10.239 align:start position:0%
researched the vetting process for any
 
04:17:12.469 --> 04:17:12.479 align:start position:0%
of the states I would be happy and I can
 
04:17:15.109 --> 04:17:15.119 align:start position:0%

un documented people I can't
 
04:17:23.590 --> 04:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
specifically recall if there's
 
04:17:30.429 --> 04:17:30.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:34.189 --> 04:17:34.199 align:start position:0%

04:18:24.429 --> 04:18:24.439 align:start position:0%
of all we're not talking about
 
04:18:28.269 --> 04:18:28.279 align:start position:0%
animals we're not talking about people
 
04:18:32.229 --> 04:18:32.239 align:start position:0%
or things with two heads and two bodies
 
04:18:34.189 --> 04:18:34.199 align:start position:0%
we talking about
 
04:18:40.349 --> 04:18:40.359 align:start position:0%
humans their term illegal aliens is used
 
04:18:43.630 --> 04:18:43.640 align:start position:0%
over and over and over and
 
04:18:47.269 --> 04:18:47.279 align:start position:0%
over and the way people speaking about
 
04:18:50.349 --> 04:18:50.359 align:start position:0%
people who look like me and people who
 
04:18:53.990 --> 04:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
look like many of you and your community
 
04:18:54.000 --> 04:18:54.910 align:start position:0%
look like many of you and your community
is

04:18:54.910 --> 04:18:54.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:18:59.750 --> 04:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:02.630 --> 04:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
shameful shame on all the ones that they
 
04:19:07.790 --> 04:19:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:10.670 --> 04:19:10.680 align:start position:0%
aliens many of you probably coming from
 
04:19:12.229 --> 04:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
indument the families that you don't
 
04:19:16.630 --> 04:19:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:18.790 --> 04:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
is I'm here
 
04:19:23.670 --> 04:19:23.680 align:start position:0%
and speaking in opposition in this bill
 
04:19:27.149 --> 04:19:27.159 align:start position:0%
why if the other stays given driver
 
04:19:30.070 --> 04:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
license why are we going take advantage
 
04:19:32.950 --> 04:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
and then allow them not taking away the
 
04:19:34.550 --> 04:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
driver's license we want to keep in
 
04:19:35.910 --> 04:19:35.920 align:start position:0%
track of these people when they come
 
04:19:37.229 --> 04:19:37.239 align:start position:0%
into the
 
04:19:39.870 --> 04:19:39.880 align:start position:0%
state taking away the driver's license
 
04:19:42.070 --> 04:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
is taking away the way for you to know
 
04:19:45.229 --> 04:19:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:47.990 --> 04:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
it's a stupidity to think that by taking
 
04:19:49.750 --> 04:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
away the right for people to drive in
 
04:19:52.990 --> 04:19:53.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is going to help you to
 
04:19:56.710 --> 04:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
chase them away from the state
 
04:20:01.030 --> 04:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
no think P before you pass or like try
 
04:20:03.790 --> 04:20:03.800 align:start position:0%
to introduce this stupid stuff like this
 
04:20:06.349 --> 04:20:06.359 align:start position:0%
you're pushing me sorry would you like
 
04:20:09.349 --> 04:20:09.359 align:start position:0%
to speak yes about the Bill yes and I'm
 
04:20:11.950 --> 04:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
speaking about the bill one more insult
 
04:20:13.229 --> 04:20:13.239 align:start position:0%
about stupid
 
04:20:15.790 --> 04:20:15.800 align:start position:0%
or anything of the sort and you're
 
04:20:19.229 --> 04:20:19.239 align:start position:0%
done thank you thank you for remind me
 
04:20:21.309 --> 04:20:21.319 align:start position:0%
that others use the language and they
 
04:20:21.319 --> 04:20:22.469 align:start position:0%
that others use the language and they
don't

04:20:22.469 --> 04:20:22.479 align:start position:0%
don't
 
04:20:22.479 --> 04:20:24.590 align:start position:0%
don't
get

04:20:24.590 --> 04:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
get
 
04:20:26.830 --> 04:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
punished but I'm here to speak in
 
04:20:31.389 --> 04:20:31.399 align:start position:0%
because again my husband is a d as he's
 
04:20:33.910 --> 04:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
he's a license nutrician he looks like
 
04:20:36.870 --> 04:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
me he has a electrical license in
 
04:20:36.880 --> 04:20:38.510 align:start position:0%
me he has a electrical license in
massachusett

04:20:38.510 --> 04:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
massachusett
 
04:20:41.910 --> 04:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
Vermont New Hampshire so imagine my
 
04:20:44.269 --> 04:20:44.279 align:start position:0%
husband live in another state and have a
 
04:20:45.710 --> 04:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
driver license from another state and
 
04:20:48.269 --> 04:20:48.279 align:start position:0%
come in here to be an electrician that
 
04:20:51.710 --> 04:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
we we need the workers here and you talk
 
04:20:53.510 --> 04:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
you're going to tell an electrician for
 
04:20:56.149 --> 04:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
another state because they look like
 
04:20:58.630 --> 04:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
certain way that they has to prove that
 
04:21:00.670 --> 04:21:00.680 align:start position:0%
US citizen that has to carry the US
 
04:21:02.469 --> 04:21:02.479 align:start position:0%
passport in order to come in and work in
 
04:21:04.149 --> 04:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because otherwise you're
 
04:21:06.309 --> 04:21:06.319 align:start position:0%
going to be profiled this is what the
 
04:21:09.189 --> 04:21:09.199 align:start position:0%
bill is going to do that's why I'm not
 
04:21:11.309 --> 04:21:11.319 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill and I'm asking you
 
04:21:13.550 --> 04:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
not to support this bill thank
 
04:21:16.149 --> 04:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative any
 
04:21:22.149 --> 04:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:25.030 --> 04:21:25.040 align:start position:0%
much uh next up chff recognizes Eva
 
04:21:27.790 --> 04:21:27.800 align:start position:0%
Castillo Jon representing a opposition
 
04:21:40.950 --> 04:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:48.550 --> 04:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:51.189 --> 04:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
hatred does not grow in Granite it
 
04:21:53.590 --> 04:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
really is offensive diminishing to hear
 
04:21:56.550 --> 04:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
the war alien here alien there and to
 
04:21:59.109 --> 04:21:59.119 align:start position:0%
have somebody that to introduce a bill
 
04:22:01.469 --> 04:22:01.479 align:start position:0%
and just refer about criminals here
 
04:22:04.189 --> 04:22:04.199 align:start position:0%
criminal I counted seven aliens times
 
04:22:06.710 --> 04:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
illegals that's pretty sad this bill
 
04:22:08.830 --> 04:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any
 
04:22:12.790 --> 04:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
sense the only way to enforce this bill
 
04:22:15.910 --> 04:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
would be to establish profiling because
 
04:22:17.910 --> 04:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
you know what are we what message are we
 
04:22:19.870 --> 04:22:19.880 align:start position:0%
sending if you come from Massachusetts
 
04:22:21.830 --> 04:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
stay away because you know if if there's
 
04:22:24.389 --> 04:22:24.399 align:start position:0%
any issues there we do not we do not
 
04:22:27.189 --> 04:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
accept this is going to leave New
 
04:22:31.229 --> 04:22:31.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire isolated from the rest of the
 
04:22:33.630 --> 04:22:33.640 align:start position:0%
nation so many people come to New
 
04:22:35.030 --> 04:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for the New Hampshire
 
04:22:36.790 --> 04:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
advantage to come shopping to our
 
04:22:38.870 --> 04:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
beautiful mountains and tourists you
 
04:22:40.670 --> 04:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
think they're going to want to be coming
 
04:22:43.109 --> 04:22:43.119 align:start position:0%
here if they have if they have bills
 
04:22:45.349 --> 04:22:45.359 align:start position:0%
like this that don't even recognize what
 
04:22:48.149 --> 04:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
other states have in their laws it's bad
 
04:22:50.229 --> 04:22:50.239 align:start position:0%
enough that we do not license on
 
04:22:52.389 --> 04:22:52.399 align:start position:0%
documented people here and by the way no
 
04:22:54.030 --> 04:22:54.040 align:start position:0%
human being is
 
04:22:56.630 --> 04:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
illegal uh but
 
04:23:00.070 --> 04:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
why why who who are we to tell all the
 
04:23:02.510 --> 04:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
states what to do are we going to start
 
04:23:04.950 --> 04:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
just pulling out Massachusetts cars to
 
04:23:07.030 --> 04:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
see if they there's no way to enforce
 
04:23:10.750 --> 04:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
this this build makes no logic no sense
 
04:23:14.750 --> 04:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
whatsoever other than hatred and and
 
04:23:16.910 --> 04:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
misunderstandings and and you can tell
 
04:23:19.349 --> 04:23:19.359 align:start position:0%
that people don't quite understand the
 
04:23:22.269 --> 04:23:22.279 align:start position:0%
immigration system in this country it's
 
04:23:24.790 --> 04:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
so complicated so complex there's so

04:23:35.109 --> 04:23:35.119 align:start position:0%
wonderful job enforcing and making sure
 
04:23:37.870 --> 04:23:37.880 align:start position:0%

thank you sir um my name is Leo Vos I am
 
04:25:19.670 --> 04:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
a president of the New Hampshire

a president of the New Hampshire
resident

04:25:20.630 --> 04:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
resident
 
04:25:23.950 --> 04:25:23.960 align:start position:0%
Council uh down in nashille New
 
04:25:26.910 --> 04:25:26.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm opposing this bill uh
 
04:25:31.070 --> 04:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
because of some problems I see regarding
 
04:25:36.510 --> 04:25:36.520 align:start position:0%
the how would would be able uh to Ved
 
04:25:40.670 --> 04:25:40.680 align:start position:0%
the people who's driving with license
 
04:25:42.790 --> 04:25:42.800 align:start position:0%
from another state
 
04:25:45.229 --> 04:25:45.239 align:start position:0%
uh as the other person talked here all
 
04:25:48.469 --> 04:25:48.479 align:start position:0%
around us we already they other states
 
04:25:52.710 --> 04:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
already let immigrants without documents
 
04:25:55.469 --> 04:25:55.479 align:start position:0%
to have driver's license uh she said
 
04:25:57.990 --> 04:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
that Maine doesn't but Maine does too so
 
04:26:00.950 --> 04:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
Maine Vermont and Massachusetts so the
 
04:26:04.429 --> 04:26:04.439 align:start position:0%
only state up here that doesn't is New
 
04:26:07.229 --> 04:26:07.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm opposing this bill not
 
04:26:09.269 --> 04:26:09.279 align:start position:0%
because of other states are doing
 
04:26:12.510 --> 04:26:12.520 align:start position:0%
something else it it is because an
 
04:26:15.229 --> 04:26:15.239 align:start position:0%
immigrant I know a lot of immigrants
 
04:26:18.469 --> 04:26:18.479 align:start position:0%
that lives outside of New Hampshire
 
04:26:21.349 --> 04:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
including my mother in-law and a couple
 
04:26:23.510 --> 04:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
friends of mine that always come into my
 
04:26:27.870 --> 04:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
house they are some of them uh are
 
04:26:30.109 --> 04:26:30.119 align:start position:0%
citizens some of them they are in work
 
04:26:34.630 --> 04:26:34.640 align:start position:0%
visas some of them are with green
 
04:26:37.550 --> 04:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
cards and I don't want
 
04:26:41.030 --> 04:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
to be chaotic but let's put it this way
 
04:26:43.389 --> 04:26:43.399 align:start position:0%
if they been
 
04:26:46.229 --> 04:26:46.239 align:start position:0%
stopped they'll be the cops will be
 
04:26:47.630 --> 04:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
asking them if
 
04:26:52.189 --> 04:26:52.199 align:start position:0%
they they have status or not if that
 
04:26:56.269 --> 04:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
would be the case would be something but
 
04:26:58.830 --> 04:26:58.840 align:start position:0%
by this bill it says that the the
 
04:27:01.469 --> 04:27:01.479 align:start position:0%
policemen won't be able to do that
 
04:27:05.550 --> 04:27:05.560 align:start position:0%
because if there is no uh signs if there
 
04:27:09.590 --> 04:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
is nothing different on the license they
 
04:27:12.229 --> 04:27:12.239 align:start position:0%
won't be able to ask therefore none of
 
04:27:14.990 --> 04:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
the states that I just mentioned has any
 
04:27:18.189 --> 04:27:18.199 align:start position:0%
markings saying that the person does not
 
04:27:20.830 --> 04:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
have status here
 
04:27:24.590 --> 04:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
so my my problem with this bill is what
 
04:27:27.790 --> 04:27:27.800 align:start position:0%
is this bill doing other than just uh
 
04:27:30.870 --> 04:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
making people afraid of coming here even
 
04:27:32.830 --> 04:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
though they have license from other
 
04:27:37.630 --> 04:27:37.640 align:start position:0%
state so uh I always like to say that we
 
04:27:41.109 --> 04:27:41.119 align:start position:0%
always react um for the stuff that we
 
04:27:42.910 --> 04:27:42.920 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
04:27:45.790 --> 04:27:45.800 align:start position:0%
and that and this is one thing that we
 
04:27:48.630 --> 04:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
don't know the immigrants when I say
 
04:27:52.830 --> 04:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
that of we are just afraid to to come
 
04:27:57.630 --> 04:27:57.640 align:start position:0%
here and be pulled over or not not get
 
04:27:59.870 --> 04:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
deported because the people already has
 
04:28:04.830 --> 04:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
uh status but to have persecution
 
04:28:09.030 --> 04:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
or stuff like that so uh that's why I
 
04:28:11.590 --> 04:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
came here today to out of my time to
 
04:28:15.189 --> 04:28:15.199 align:start position:0%
please see if we can uh take a look at
 
04:28:19.750 --> 04:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
the legal part of this because the way
 
04:28:23.349 --> 04:28:23.359 align:start position:0%
it it is it has a lot of holes for us to
 
04:28:27.070 --> 04:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
to put it as a Bill thank you thank you
 
04:28:28.990 --> 04:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
very much questions from the
 
04:28:39.670 --> 04:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:43.149 --> 04:28:43.159 align:start position:0%
you chair recognizes and you're you're
 
04:28:44.870 --> 04:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
going to be upset with me I forgot your
 
04:28:47.950 --> 04:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
last name pronunciation Henry from the
 
04:28:50.950 --> 04:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
ACLU New
 
04:28:52.750 --> 04:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire please state your name when
 
04:28:57.950 --> 04:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:00.790 --> 04:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
here hi thank you again my name is Henry
 
04:29:02.309 --> 04:29:02.319 align:start position:0%
Clement toich I'm a senior staff
 
04:29:05.109 --> 04:29:05.119 align:start position:0%
attorney at the ACLU of New Hampshire I
 
04:29:07.590 --> 04:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
think others have spoken compellingly
 
04:29:09.269 --> 04:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
about how this bill is an invitation to
 
04:29:11.229 --> 04:29:11.239 align:start position:0%
racial profiling and probably impossible
 
04:29:12.790 --> 04:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
to enforce
 
04:29:14.550 --> 04:29:14.560 align:start position:0%
um but there's one other thing that I
 
04:29:15.790 --> 04:29:15.800 align:start position:0%
haven't yet heard that I just wanted to
 
04:29:17.710 --> 04:29:17.720 align:start position:0%
mention which is about the breakdown of
 
04:29:20.429 --> 04:29:20.439 align:start position:0%
the interstate compact so Driver's
 
04:29:22.269 --> 04:29:22.279 align:start position:0%
Licensing in New Hampshire is based on
 
04:29:24.630 --> 04:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
the idea that a driver's license issued
 
04:29:26.030 --> 04:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
in one state is going to be valid in the
 
04:29:28.950 --> 04:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
other 49 states because as soon as you
 
04:29:30.990 --> 04:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
start shipping away at that the whole
 
04:29:33.269 --> 04:29:33.279 align:start position:0%
system of interstate commerce can like
 
04:29:35.349 --> 04:29:35.359 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly come crumbling down so
 
04:29:39.189 --> 04:29:39.199 align:start position:0%
what do I mean by that well imagine if
 
04:29:40.910 --> 04:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
uh in response to this another state
 
04:29:44.030 --> 04:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
said yeah well you don't like our policy
 
04:29:45.550 --> 04:29:45.560 align:start position:0%
of giving driver's licenses to
 
04:29:47.149 --> 04:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
undocumented folks and we don't like
 
04:29:49.349 --> 04:29:49.359 align:start position:0%
your policy of giving driver licenses to
 
04:29:51.950 --> 04:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
16-year-old so we're not going to allow
 
04:29:53.910 --> 04:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
any New Hampshire driver under the age
 
04:29:56.349 --> 04:29:56.359 align:start position:0%
of 18 to drive on the roadways in our
 
04:29:59.429 --> 04:29:59.439 align:start position:0%
state or another state that says you
 
04:30:01.349 --> 04:30:01.359 align:start position:0%
don't like our policy about giving
 
04:30:03.269 --> 04:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
driver licenses to undocumented folks we
 
04:30:05.309 --> 04:30:05.319 align:start position:0%
don't like your policy about uh not
 
04:30:07.510 --> 04:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
using real ID so any New Hampshire
 
04:30:09.630 --> 04:30:09.640 align:start position:0%
driver's license that's not real ID
 
04:30:12.710 --> 04:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't count in our state as soon as we
 
04:30:14.229 --> 04:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
start pulling out the threads of the
 
04:30:16.670 --> 04:30:16.680 align:start position:0%
interstate driving compact it becomes a
 
04:30:18.590 --> 04:30:18.600 align:start position:0%
nightmare for New Hampshire operators
 
04:30:20.070 --> 04:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
because now everyone's got to keep a
 
04:30:21.590 --> 04:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
list in their head of I know I have a
 
04:30:24.030 --> 04:30:24.040 align:start position:0%
driver's license but what states am I
 
04:30:25.950 --> 04:30:25.960 align:start position:0%
actually allowed to drive in again and
 
04:30:27.630 --> 04:30:27.640 align:start position:0%
that can change there's no Central list
 
04:30:31.630 --> 04:30:31.640 align:start position:0%
anywhere I just think it would be
 
04:30:34.710 --> 04:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
um chaotic to say the least if people
 
04:30:37.590 --> 04:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
had to start worrying about you know if
 
04:30:38.950 --> 04:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
States had to worry that other states
 
04:30:42.990 --> 04:30:43.000 align:start position:0%
were targeting their licenses so um
 
04:30:44.309 --> 04:30:44.319 align:start position:0%
I think we can all agree that the
 
04:30:46.109 --> 04:30:46.119 align:start position:0%
roadways are safer when more people who
 
04:30:47.830 --> 04:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
are driving have licenses they're more
 
04:30:49.510 --> 04:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
likely to have insurance they're more
 
04:30:51.109 --> 04:30:51.119 align:start position:0%
likely to have gone through driver head
 
04:30:52.670 --> 04:30:52.680 align:start position:0%
they're more likely to stop and wait for
 
04:30:54.910 --> 04:30:54.920 align:start position:0%
the police if there's a fender bender
 
04:30:58.750 --> 04:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
and just as a blanket reason pulling
 
04:31:00.469 --> 04:31:00.479 align:start position:0%
away people's driver's licenses that
 
04:31:02.189 --> 04:31:02.199 align:start position:0%
have nothing really to do with roadway
 
04:31:03.750 --> 04:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
safety is only going to lead to bigger
 
04:31:06.030 --> 04:31:06.040 align:start position:0%
issues on the roadway so for those
 
04:31:08.830 --> 04:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
reasons uh ACU of New Hampshire opposes
 
04:31:10.830 --> 04:31:10.840 align:start position:0%
this bill and hopes that you'll itl it
 
04:31:13.309 --> 04:31:13.319 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take any questions
 
04:31:15.109 --> 04:31:15.119 align:start position:0%
thank you any questionss from the
 
04:31:17.309 --> 04:31:17.319 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
04:31:22.389 --> 04:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
SE thank you Mr chairman thank you sir
 
04:31:25.910 --> 04:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
um is there any aspect to this that
 
04:31:28.870 --> 04:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
would fall under the concern that it is
 
04:31:35.070 --> 04:31:35.080 align:start position:0%
an undo undue process or um that would
 
04:31:38.269 --> 04:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
violate rights otherwise
 
04:31:41.149 --> 04:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm concerned about that and I'm
 
04:31:44.030 --> 04:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
not loyal so I don't know the answer so
 
04:31:47.269 --> 04:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah it's a great question and um I
 
04:31:48.830 --> 04:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
have to apologize to the committee in
 
04:31:50.149 --> 04:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
that my boss was supposed to be
 
04:31:51.590 --> 04:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
testifying on this bill but he ended up
 
04:31:53.950 --> 04:31:53.960 align:start position:0%
in Portugal and I ended up with you all
 
04:31:56.870 --> 04:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
so is he is he surfing yeah so everyone
 
04:31:58.469 --> 04:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
should feel really bad for me and really
 
04:32:01.109 --> 04:32:01.119 align:start position:0%
good for him um so I only got a chance
 
04:32:02.429 --> 04:32:02.439 align:start position:0%
to sort of think about this starting
 
04:32:03.830 --> 04:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
yesterday but there's a provision of the
 
04:32:05.870 --> 04:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
Constitution that says that states are
 
04:32:07.670 --> 04:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
to give the full faith and credit to
 
04:32:10.630 --> 04:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
documents of other states you know we've
 
04:32:12.910 --> 04:32:12.920 align:start position:0%
seen that in the context um of marriage
 
04:32:14.910 --> 04:32:14.920 align:start position:0%
equality where some states were you know
 
04:32:17.309 --> 04:32:17.319 align:start position:0%
issuing marriage licenses to other
 
04:32:19.469 --> 04:32:19.479 align:start position:0%
states or to same-sex couples and other
 
04:32:21.149 --> 04:32:21.159 align:start position:0%
states were not accepting that and it
 
04:32:23.750 --> 04:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
became like this total hodg podge and a
 
04:32:26.149 --> 04:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
real mess and um I think there there is
 
04:32:28.510 --> 04:32:28.520 align:start position:0%
a Doctrine and I'm I'm not an expert on
 
04:32:29.830 --> 04:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
it so I don't know exactly how it would
 
04:32:31.229 --> 04:32:31.239 align:start position:0%
shake out here but the words that come
 
04:32:32.910 --> 04:32:32.920 align:start position:0%
to mind more than due process are full
 
04:32:35.109 --> 04:32:35.119 align:start position:0%
faith and credit maybe that's the answer
 
04:32:36.750 --> 04:32:36.760 align:start position:0%
I wish I had I wish I had a better
 
04:32:38.630 --> 04:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
answer for you but I I am concerned that
 
04:32:41.309 --> 04:32:41.319 align:start position:0%
there's a constitutional problem yep
 
04:32:41.319 --> 04:32:43.189 align:start position:0%
there's a constitutional problem yep
well

04:32:43.189 --> 04:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:32:46.750 --> 04:32:46.760 align:start position:0%
okay yeah so I want to try and summarize
 
04:32:46.760 --> 04:32:47.790 align:start position:0%
okay yeah so I want to try and summarize
that

04:32:47.790 --> 04:32:47.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:32:50.510 --> 04:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
so um you
 
04:32:53.550 --> 04:32:53.560 align:start position:0%
there there may in fact be a problem
 
04:32:55.950 --> 04:32:55.960 align:start position:0%
with due process but it would take
 
04:32:58.389 --> 04:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
further investigation to know
 
04:33:01.670 --> 04:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
that yeah I I'm not aware so this is a
 
04:33:04.310 --> 04:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
new this has happened in one other state
 
04:33:06.910 --> 04:33:06.920 align:start position:0%
I don't think that there's been any um
 
04:33:09.510 --> 04:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
Court decisions yet involving this
 
04:33:11.789 --> 04:33:11.799 align:start position:0%
whether this is constitutional or not
 
04:33:13.551 --> 04:33:13.561 align:start position:0%
but anytime you do some sort of Cutting
 
04:33:14.830 --> 04:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
Edge thing like this where you start
 
04:33:16.590 --> 04:33:16.600 align:start position:0%
taking away people's rights you know
 
04:33:18.789 --> 04:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
following a path that hasn't been
 
04:33:20.269 --> 04:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
explicitly blessed by the courts you do
 
04:33:22.150 --> 04:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
run that risk and so I think the answer
 
04:33:23.709 --> 04:33:23.719 align:start position:0%
is we don't yet
 
04:33:25.670 --> 04:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
know whether you know what the courts
 
04:33:27.990 --> 04:33:28.000 align:start position:0%
would do something with something like
 
04:33:30.109 --> 04:33:30.119 align:start position:0%
this I don't know if we were talking
 
04:33:32.109 --> 04:33:32.119 align:start position:0%
about rights or are we talking about the
 
04:33:34.349 --> 04:33:34.359 align:start position:0%
privilege of driving but representative
 
04:33:36.670 --> 04:33:36.680 align:start position:0%
Hill thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
04:33:39.510 --> 04:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question um wouldn't it be
 
04:33:43.709 --> 04:33:43.719 align:start position:0%
somewhat analogous to uh a a a gun owner
 
04:33:45.670 --> 04:33:45.680 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire trying to drive to
 
04:33:49.510 --> 04:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
Florida and having difficulty navigating
 
04:33:51.869 --> 04:33:51.879 align:start position:0%
um I think as far as I know New
 
04:33:55.551 --> 04:33:55.561 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is isolated as well um and
 
04:33:57.390 --> 04:33:57.400 align:start position:0%
having a difficult time driving through
 
04:34:01.470 --> 04:34:01.480 align:start position:0%
massachusett to Vermont and New York um
 
04:34:04.230 --> 04:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
so would would that not be somewhat
 
04:34:06.629 --> 04:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
similar to the current situation that
 
04:34:08.189 --> 04:34:08.199 align:start position:0%
this bill would
 
04:34:10.670 --> 04:34:10.680 align:start position:0%
Envision it's a great question and this
 
04:34:12.390 --> 04:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
hearing I'm I'm afraid is rapidly
 
04:34:13.869 --> 04:34:13.879 align:start position:0%
becoming just a list of things that I'm
 
04:34:16.629 --> 04:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
not an expert in and and gun law is one
 
04:34:18.230 --> 04:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
of them but it's a little bit different
 
04:34:20.750 --> 04:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
we make our living on talking about
 
04:34:22.670 --> 04:34:22.680 align:start position:0%
things that we don't know much about I
 
04:34:26.789 --> 04:34:26.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:29.750 --> 04:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
um um I guess what I'll say is U and you
 
04:34:31.230 --> 04:34:31.240 align:start position:0%
may you're probably right that there's
 
04:34:33.070 --> 04:34:33.080 align:start position:0%
an issue with States not recognizing
 
04:34:35.349 --> 04:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
other States Concealed Carry Permits or
 
04:34:37.189 --> 04:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
whatever they are but it is a little bit
 
04:34:41.910 --> 04:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
different I think in that driving on the
 
04:34:44.429 --> 04:34:44.439 align:start position:0%
roadways is sort of like the backbone of
 
04:34:46.830 --> 04:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
Interstate Commerce in the way that like
 
04:34:49.551 --> 04:34:49.561 align:start position:0%
traveling with a gun and using a gun you
 
04:34:53.869 --> 04:34:53.879 align:start position:0%
know is is not and I'm not really a gun
 
04:34:55.551 --> 04:34:55.561 align:start position:0%
person so maybe people will disagree
 
04:34:56.990 --> 04:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
with me on that and maybe I'm totally
 
04:34:58.510 --> 04:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
wrong but I do think that there's a
 
04:35:00.709 --> 04:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
distinction in that like when we drive
 
04:35:03.150 --> 04:35:03.160 align:start position:0%
from one state to another you know we we
 
04:35:04.709 --> 04:35:04.719 align:start position:0%
expect all the signs to be the same
 
04:35:06.390 --> 04:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
color we expect the speed limits to be
 
04:35:07.709 --> 04:35:07.719 align:start position:0%
on the right side of the road no states
 
04:35:09.349 --> 04:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
are like switching from the right side
 
04:35:10.551 --> 04:35:10.561 align:start position:0%
of the road to the left side of the road
 
04:35:11.949 --> 04:35:11.959 align:start position:0%
we're sort of expecting that everything
 
04:35:13.750 --> 04:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
that works in one state is more or less
 
04:35:14.869 --> 04:35:14.879 align:start position:0%
going to work in the other state and
 
04:35:16.750 --> 04:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
that's like why the interstate system
 
04:35:18.750 --> 04:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
works so well and as soon as we start
 
04:35:20.150 --> 04:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
monking with that I think that's when
 
04:35:22.869 --> 04:35:22.879 align:start position:0%
you're going to end up with
 
04:35:25.590 --> 04:35:25.600 align:start position:0%
problems and I think your right and
 
04:35:27.590 --> 04:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
privileges question was rhetorical but
 
04:35:30.269 --> 04:35:30.279 align:start position:0%
but from a legal perspective when well
 
04:35:32.949 --> 04:35:32.959 align:start position:0%
it is a privilege to drive it becomes a
 
04:35:35.150 --> 04:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
vested interest once you get a driver's
 
04:35:36.709 --> 04:35:36.719 align:start position:0%
license and you do end up actually
 
04:35:39.150 --> 04:35:39.160 align:start position:0%
having some due process rights before
 
04:35:42.269 --> 04:35:42.279 align:start position:0%
that can be taken away because
 
04:35:43.590 --> 04:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
just because something is a privilege
 
04:35:44.830 --> 04:35:44.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean the government can
 
04:35:47.070 --> 04:35:47.080 align:start position:0%
arbitrarily take it away so but I
 
04:35:48.551 --> 04:35:48.561 align:start position:0%
understand you two have been making your
 
04:35:50.029 --> 04:35:50.039 align:start position:0%
point thanks for getting I know you had
 
04:35:52.789 --> 04:35:52.799 align:start position:0%
to get the last word in but just lawyer
 
04:35:55.070 --> 04:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
just as a reminder and as a reminder to
 
04:35:56.949 --> 04:35:56.959 align:start position:0%
the committee too the prime sponsor did
 
04:35:58.990 --> 04:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
testify that he ran this through the
 
04:36:01.590 --> 04:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
Senate legal and they had no issues with
 
04:36:03.789 --> 04:36:03.799 align:start position:0%
it constitutionally so thank you very
 
04:36:05.551 --> 04:36:05.561 align:start position:0%
much thank
 
04:36:08.750 --> 04:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
you our next step chair recognizes it's
 
04:36:12.310 --> 04:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
been a long time Bruno de

remind you I've been timing everybody
 
04:36:22.349 --> 04:36:22.359 align:start position:0%
out three minutes all right no sound I'm
 
04:36:25.789 --> 04:36:25.799 align:start position:0%
going to to be brief uh good afternoon
 
04:36:28.390 --> 04:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chair and members of the committee
 
04:36:30.070 --> 04:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Vern de Brito I'm
 
04:36:31.551 --> 04:36:31.561 align:start position:0%
executive director of the New Hampshire
 
04:36:33.789 --> 04:36:33.799 align:start position:0%
Brazilian Council and an immigration
 
04:36:36.709 --> 04:36:36.719 align:start position:0%
lawyer and I'm here today in speaking
 
04:36:40.349 --> 04:36:40.359 align:start position:0%
opposition of this bill um it is my my
 
04:36:42.109 --> 04:36:42.119 align:start position:0%
opinion though that
 
04:36:44.949 --> 04:36:44.959 align:start position:0%
this bill will be a kind of warms of
 
04:36:47.789 --> 04:36:47.799 align:start position:0%
lawsuits potential lawsuits and the
 
04:36:50.390 --> 04:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
reason being is under the 10th Amendment
 
04:36:53.750 --> 04:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
the states do have the power to pass
 
04:36:57.629 --> 04:36:57.639 align:start position:0%
laws pertaining to the police power and
 
04:37:00.349 --> 04:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
licenses uh is part of the the policing
 
04:37:03.390 --> 04:37:03.400 align:start position:0%
power that are reserved to to the
 
04:37:06.390 --> 04:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
states however uh some of the the
 
04:37:10.830 --> 04:37:10.840 align:start position:0%
provisions of um this bill um it is my
 
04:37:14.949 --> 04:37:14.959 align:start position:0%
opinion that it may be some violation of
 
04:37:18.390 --> 04:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
a due process because in order to to
 
04:37:21.629 --> 04:37:21.639 align:start position:0%
determine that someone is here
 
04:37:24.310 --> 04:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
undocumented you will have to ask
 
04:37:26.910 --> 04:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
additional documentations besides the
 
04:37:29.629 --> 04:37:29.639 align:start position:0%
driver's license and at the moment that
 
04:37:32.990 --> 04:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
you ask someone to issue to present
 
04:37:37.789 --> 04:37:37.799 align:start position:0%
their Visa or passport or a state in the
 
04:37:40.990 --> 04:37:41.000 align:start position:0%
United States then you are stepping on
 
04:37:44.830 --> 04:37:44.840 align:start position:0%
to the federal government uh Power which
 
04:37:47.390 --> 04:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
is immigration enforcing immigration
 
04:37:51.109 --> 04:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
laws uh we have had uh this issue
 
04:37:54.189 --> 04:37:54.199 align:start position:0%
already ruled by the Supreme Court in
 
04:37:58.310 --> 04:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
2012 us V Arizona and recently most
 
04:38:01.349 --> 04:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
recently I'm sure uh most if not all of
 
04:38:06.070 --> 04:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
you have followed uh USV Taxas and it's
 
04:38:08.390 --> 04:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
a very uh difficult
 
04:38:12.349 --> 04:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
situation um as my colleague mentioned
 
04:38:15.109 --> 04:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
the the Full Faith and Credit Clause
 
04:38:18.590 --> 04:38:18.600 align:start position:0%
must be abided by uh the Constitution
 
04:38:21.990 --> 04:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
it's under article 4 section 1 and the
 
04:38:25.269 --> 04:38:25.279 align:start position:0%
states must respect the court orders and
 
04:38:28.789 --> 04:38:28.799 align:start position:0%
laws from other states if other states
 
04:38:33.551 --> 04:38:33.561 align:start position:0%
decide that uh same-sex marriage is um
 
04:38:36.029 --> 04:38:36.039 align:start position:0%
is valid New Hampshire cannot come in

and say we're not going to accept it it
 
04:38:41.029 --> 04:38:41.039 align:start position:0%
just doesn't fly and because of those
 
04:38:43.349 --> 04:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
reasons it is my opinion that New
 
04:38:45.629 --> 04:38:45.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is going to be sued if this
 
04:38:49.551 --> 04:38:49.561 align:start position:0%

prefects P pastor sir thank you sir
 
04:39:16.789 --> 04:39:16.799 align:start position:0%
welcome good afternoon my name is uh
 
04:39:19.349 --> 04:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
aloise yosta I'm a pastor of the
 
04:39:22.189 --> 04:39:22.199 align:start position:0%
Assembly of God bth in Nashua so I'm
 
04:39:24.990 --> 04:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
here to oppose this bill and I will try
 
04:39:28.349 --> 04:39:28.359 align:start position:0%
to explain my reasons I'm also
 
04:39:32.230 --> 04:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
representing the churches around uh
 
04:39:32.240 --> 04:39:33.990 align:start position:0%
representing the churches around uh
Nashua

04:39:33.990 --> 04:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
Nashua
 
04:39:36.788 --> 04:39:36.798 align:start position:0%
Manchester um in the
 
04:39:40.270 --> 04:39:40.280 align:start position:0%
areas uh I'm very concerned about this
 
04:39:44.670 --> 04:39:44.680 align:start position:0%
bill because because I have kids behind
 
04:39:47.868 --> 04:39:47.878 align:start position:0%
me they're all from my church and they
 
04:39:50.030 --> 04:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
are they all born here but if you look
 
04:39:53.910 --> 04:39:53.920 align:start position:0%
at their faces they don't look
 
04:39:55.910 --> 04:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
Americans but they are
 
04:39:58.830 --> 04:39:58.840 align:start position:0%
Americans how my three kids are born
 
04:40:01.270 --> 04:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
here and they have my
 
04:40:04.350 --> 04:40:04.360 align:start position:0%
face so how how we going to identify
 
04:40:08.788 --> 04:40:08.798 align:start position:0%
this people how we going to find out the
 
04:40:12.430 --> 04:40:12.440 align:start position:0%
American and the one that we think there
 
04:40:15.070 --> 04:40:15.080 align:start position:0%
have no right to be
 
04:40:19.110 --> 04:40:19.120 align:start position:0%
here uh also I think this bill is going
 
04:40:22.350 --> 04:40:22.360 align:start position:0%
to work against the state of New
 
04:40:22.360 --> 04:40:23.990 align:start position:0%
to work against the state of New
Hampshire

04:40:23.990 --> 04:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
04:40:27.110 --> 04:40:27.120 align:start position:0%
because everywhere I go I try to
 
04:40:30.350 --> 04:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
advocate for the New Hampshire State
 
04:40:32.070 --> 04:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
because people say that New Hampshire is
 
04:40:34.990 --> 04:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
a discrimin
 
04:40:38.510 --> 04:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
discriminatory State and I always say no
 
04:40:42.550 --> 04:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
this is all a met it's not true
 
04:40:44.948 --> 04:40:44.958 align:start position:0%
I live there and I know the
 
04:40:47.590 --> 04:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
people I'm always involved with the
 
04:40:49.750 --> 04:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
meetings and stuff and I don't see
 
04:40:53.070 --> 04:40:53.080 align:start position:0%
difference between New Hampshire and
 
04:40:56.510 --> 04:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts or other states but with
 
04:41:00.190 --> 04:41:00.200 align:start position:0%
this it's going to be impossible for me
 
04:41:03.110 --> 04:41:03.120 align:start position:0%
to defend the the state of New Hampshire
 
04:41:04.910 --> 04:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
in that
 
04:41:07.910 --> 04:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
aspect and and I think the reason why I
 
04:41:09.708 --> 04:41:09.718 align:start position:0%
think it's going to work against the
 
04:41:12.270 --> 04:41:12.280 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire I mean the uh
 
04:41:15.470 --> 04:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
Bruno was saying about the lawsuits but
 
04:41:18.030 --> 04:41:18.040 align:start position:0%
also uh for the
 
04:41:22.150 --> 04:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
businesses uh for example my church we
 
04:41:27.070 --> 04:41:27.080 align:start position:0%
rent the space for 16 years already we
 
04:41:30.230 --> 04:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
about to buy a piece of land and build a
 
04:41:34.470 --> 04:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
church guess what I'm not going to look
 
04:41:37.310 --> 04:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
up piece of land in New Hampshire you
 
04:41:39.670 --> 04:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
might not care about it but I'm not here
 
04:41:42.628 --> 04:41:42.638 align:start position:0%
by myself I represent many
 
04:41:46.430 --> 04:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
people uh my in my inclination is going
 
04:41:46.440 --> 04:41:47.190 align:start position:0%
people uh my in my inclination is going
to

04:41:47.190 --> 04:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:41:49.430 --> 04:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
be look somewhere
 
04:41:53.270 --> 04:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
else and not not only a church but
 
04:41:56.470 --> 04:41:56.480 align:start position:0%
businesses Leo is a
 
04:41:59.670 --> 04:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
businessman he deals with New Hampshire
 
04:42:02.750 --> 04:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Maine he's got work in
 
04:42:04.830 --> 04:42:04.840 align:start position:0%
Maine work in
 
04:42:07.590 --> 04:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts he's got people that come
 
04:42:09.868 --> 04:42:09.878 align:start position:0%
from Massachusetts to work for him or
 
04:42:11.990 --> 04:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
vice and verse
 
04:42:13.628 --> 04:42:13.638 align:start position:0%
what's going to be we're going to have
 
04:42:15.990 --> 04:42:16.000 align:start position:0%

folks it's beautiful

afternoon I will open up the I reopen
 
05:05:34.590 --> 05:05:34.600 align:start position:0%
the executive session on Senate Bill 471
 
05:05:36.548 --> 05:05:36.558 align:start position:0%
FN relative to adding a speed limit of
 
05:05:39.990 --> 05:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
45 miles hour on Rural highways chair
 
05:05:42.030 --> 05:05:42.040 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Gorski for a
 
05:05:44.470 --> 05:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chair I make a
 
05:05:48.030 --> 05:05:48.040 align:start position:0%
motion for itl on
 
05:05:50.868 --> 05:05:50.878 align:start position:0%
s471 motion is inexpedient to legislate
 
05:05:52.830 --> 05:05:52.840 align:start position:0%
is there a second seconded by
 
05:05:54.788 --> 05:05:54.798 align:start position:0%
representative foot you to speak to your
 
05:05:57.868 --> 05:05:57.878 align:start position:0%
motion sir I do thank you um you know
 
05:05:59.670 --> 05:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
although there was some uh testimony
 
05:06:01.670 --> 05:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
about some of the uh troubled rows that
 
05:06:02.948 --> 05:06:02.958 align:start position:0%
they mentioned one of the things that
 
05:06:05.510 --> 05:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
just kind of came glaring out to me is
 
05:06:08.628 --> 05:06:08.638 align:start position:0%
that the dot has the ability to do what
 
05:06:12.230 --> 05:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
this bill attends to do and um I think
 
05:06:13.430 --> 05:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
what they're just looking for is
 
05:06:16.470 --> 05:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
something in statute and to me I think
 
05:06:17.910 --> 05:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
since they already have the ability to
 
05:06:19.430 --> 05:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
do this there's no need for this bill
 
05:06:22.990 --> 05:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
and that's why I I'm voting for
 
05:06:25.910 --> 05:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
itl anybody else from the committee
 
05:06:28.350 --> 05:06:28.360 align:start position:0%
representative St
 
05:06:31.470 --> 05:06:31.480 align:start position:0%
Clair yes thank you I have a question
 
05:06:33.628 --> 05:06:33.638 align:start position:0%
that representative you can help me with
 
05:06:36.430 --> 05:06:36.440 align:start position:0%
you said that um they already have the
 
05:06:39.830 --> 05:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
statute to do this this is just
 
05:06:43.548 --> 05:06:43.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:45.910 --> 05:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
them what I said is they had the ability
 
05:06:48.750 --> 05:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
to do what this bill intended to do and
 
05:06:50.350 --> 05:06:50.360 align:start position:0%
all they wanted to do was put something
 
05:06:52.830 --> 05:06:52.840 align:start position:0%
in statute so my question to you is what
 
05:06:55.150 --> 05:06:55.160 align:start position:0%
is the harm then of the bill there's no
 
05:06:58.510 --> 05:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:02.750 --> 05:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:05.830 --> 05:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
right representes
 
05:07:10.628 --> 05:07:10.638 align:start position:0%
thank so um
 
05:07:12.830 --> 05:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
one piece of data that I that is missing
 
05:07:15.868 --> 05:07:15.878 align:start position:0%
but I think is was in this case we'll
 
05:07:19.788 --> 05:07:19.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:22.510 --> 05:07:22.520 align:start position:0%
um notes from people who live in the
 
05:07:24.510 --> 05:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
near these roads is that what are the
 
05:07:26.350 --> 05:07:26.360 align:start position:0%
numbers of fatalities that are occurring
 
05:07:28.788 --> 05:07:28.798 align:start position:0%
in these these gra these types of roads
 
05:07:30.948 --> 05:07:30.958 align:start position:0%
and because we don't have that data it's
 
05:07:35.110 --> 05:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
an unfortunate aspect of it but I I do
 
05:07:37.270 --> 05:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
believe that the anecdotal evidence that
 
05:07:39.590 --> 05:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
was given to us that lots of fatalities
 
05:07:44.110 --> 05:07:44.120 align:start position:0%
are occurring on these roads is a huge
 
05:07:46.750 --> 05:07:46.760 align:start position:0%
cause of concern for me in addition to
 
05:07:48.948 --> 05:07:48.958 align:start position:0%
that I don't believe that the the
 
05:07:51.150 --> 05:07:51.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire do is going around trying to
 
05:07:53.990 --> 05:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
introduce bills and opening up those
 
05:07:55.670 --> 05:07:55.680 align:start position:0%
kinds of questions for things that they
 
05:07:58.470 --> 05:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
don't feel that they need they obviously
 
05:08:00.350 --> 05:08:00.360 align:start position:0%
did this because they felt there was a
 
05:08:00.360 --> 05:08:05.948 align:start position:0%
did this because they felt there was a
need

05:08:05.948 --> 05:08:05.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:09.590 --> 05:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
um Mr Lambert from the New Hampshire do
 
05:08:11.990 --> 05:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
spoke in favor of the bill and he did so
 
05:08:15.310 --> 05:08:15.320 align:start position:0%
because he wanted to remind us
 
05:08:19.310 --> 05:08:19.320 align:start position:0%
that many of the states roads and that's
 
05:08:22.270 --> 05:08:22.280 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about fall between
 
05:08:25.948 --> 05:08:25.958 align:start position:0%
the 35 and the 55 mile per hour and
 
05:08:28.110 --> 05:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's inappropriate to be 35
 
05:08:29.948 --> 05:08:29.958 align:start position:0%
and sometimes it's inappropriate to be
 
05:08:32.230 --> 05:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
55 and they were looking for another
 
05:08:35.708 --> 05:08:35.718 align:start position:0%
tool in their tool box and I can't think
 
05:08:38.670 --> 05:08:38.680 align:start position:0%
of any good reason why we wouldn't
 
05:08:41.230 --> 05:08:41.240 align:start position:0%
provide the tools necessary for them to
 
05:08:43.070 --> 05:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
do their jobs and to keep the motoring
 
05:08:43.080 --> 05:08:43.948 align:start position:0%
do their jobs and to keep the motoring
public

05:08:43.948 --> 05:08:43.958 align:start position:0%
public
 
05:08:47.830 --> 05:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
safer we all know
 
05:08:51.190 --> 05:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
that many many roads in New Hampshire
 
05:08:55.030 --> 05:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
have gone from a nice quiet byway that
 
05:08:56.750 --> 05:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
you drove down and you looked at the
 
05:08:58.910 --> 05:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
scenery and you enjoyed yourself and you
 
05:09:01.830 --> 05:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
had fun maybe took the family to a
 
05:09:04.030 --> 05:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
destination where you'd have a picnic or
 
05:09:04.040 --> 05:09:05.548 align:start position:0%
destination where you'd have a picnic or
whatever

05:09:05.548 --> 05:09:05.558 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
05:09:09.628 --> 05:09:09.638 align:start position:0%
to curb Cuts everywhere cars come coming
 
05:09:13.390 --> 05:09:13.400 align:start position:0%
out everywhere very few
 
05:09:18.628 --> 05:09:18.638 align:start position:0%
uh mechan um uh intersections that had
 
05:09:19.990 --> 05:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh light
 
05:09:23.948 --> 05:09:23.958 align:start position:0%
control um and it's always
 
05:09:28.510 --> 05:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
better quite frankly when this
 
05:09:33.548 --> 05:09:33.558 align:start position:0%
legislature takes up and takes action on
 
05:09:35.590 --> 05:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
things that are within its
 
05:09:39.110 --> 05:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
purview state speed limits are within
 
05:09:42.150 --> 05:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
our purview we are the ones who can
 
05:09:45.270 --> 05:09:45.280 align:start position:0%
choose to make those changes I believe
 
05:09:47.070 --> 05:09:47.080 align:start position:0%
that we should make those changes in
 
05:09:49.830 --> 05:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
this instance thank
 
05:09:52.430 --> 05:09:52.440 align:start position:0%
you anybody else from the
 
05:09:55.230 --> 05:09:55.240 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
05:09:58.430 --> 05:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr chair um kind of to
 
05:10:00.510 --> 05:10:00.520 align:start position:0%
bolster up what representative Gorski
 
05:10:03.070 --> 05:10:03.080 align:start position:0%
said this is a blanket solution how many
 
05:10:04.868 --> 05:10:04.878 align:start position:0%
roads will be affected by this I don't
 
05:10:06.470 --> 05:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
know I reviewed the testimony and I
 
05:10:08.948 --> 05:10:08.958 align:start position:0%
didn't see that data are we going to
 
05:10:10.310 --> 05:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
have a bunch of bunch of roads that need
 
05:10:13.750 --> 05:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
to immediately go from 55 to 45 because
 
05:10:16.910 --> 05:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
we change the standard is that going to
 
05:10:19.070 --> 05:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
affect in that case the tickets that are
 
05:10:21.948 --> 05:10:21.958 align:start position:0%
written because the posted speed limit
 
05:10:23.830 --> 05:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
we know the signs are to let the public
 
05:10:26.110 --> 05:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
know about the statute but the statute
 
05:10:28.310 --> 05:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
much like much like a stop sign or a
 
05:10:30.910 --> 05:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
missing one is the guiding rule of law
 
05:10:32.788 --> 05:10:32.798 align:start position:0%
what happens then that seems like it's a
 
05:10:36.390 --> 05:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
mess signs are expensive there's no cost
 
05:10:38.750 --> 05:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
on this bill for that reason alone I
 
05:10:41.990 --> 05:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
can't report it obviously if the Bill's
 
05:10:43.230 --> 05:10:43.240 align:start position:0%
effective and it's going to go out and
 
05:10:44.830 --> 05:10:44.840 align:start position:0%
change a bunch of speed limits then
 
05:10:46.510 --> 05:10:46.520 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a cost and I'm
 
05:10:47.830 --> 05:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
pretty sure it's going to be more than
 
05:10:50.628 --> 05:10:50.638 align:start position:0%
the 10 grand we let go so without
 
05:10:53.230 --> 05:10:53.240 align:start position:0%
knowing the cost and it being a blanket
 
05:10:55.070 --> 05:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
solution where maybe some of these roads
 
05:10:57.990 --> 05:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
are no problem I can't support
 
05:11:00.868 --> 05:11:00.878 align:start position:0%
it anybody else from the
 
05:11:03.708 --> 05:11:03.718 align:start position:0%
committee represent foot thank you Mr
 
05:11:05.948 --> 05:11:05.958 align:start position:0%
chair uh I could be mistaken I didn't
 
05:11:07.708 --> 05:11:07.718 align:start position:0%
get a chance to look at it in detail
 
05:11:09.628 --> 05:11:09.638 align:start position:0%
with that study that was passed around
 
05:11:11.430 --> 05:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
previously when the presentation was
 
05:11:14.510 --> 05:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
given I believe that um speed was not a
 
05:11:17.110 --> 05:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
a contributing factor to a lot of those
 
05:11:19.628 --> 05:11:19.638 align:start position:0%
accidents so I just for the record
 
05:11:21.510 --> 05:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's not the only Factor
 
05:11:24.750 --> 05:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
involving many of these fatalities so
 
05:11:27.470 --> 05:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
that would have no effect on
 
05:11:30.430 --> 05:11:30.440 align:start position:0%
this or minimal like
 
05:11:34.590 --> 05:11:34.600 align:start position:0%
that representative St Clair thank you
 
05:11:36.670 --> 05:11:36.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chair you're right because I pointed
 
05:11:40.430 --> 05:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
it out to you yeah as I as I pointed out
 
05:11:44.070 --> 05:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
to a lot of people and and I
 
05:11:48.430 --> 05:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
um I would probably disagree with what
 
05:11:49.990 --> 05:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative Sykes brought up about
 
05:11:51.510 --> 05:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
the fatalities and all that stuff
 
05:11:53.910 --> 05:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
because I don't I don't necessarily
 
05:11:55.470 --> 05:11:55.480 align:start position:0%
think that that's really what we should
 
05:11:57.190 --> 05:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
be talking about here what we're talking
 
05:11:59.430 --> 05:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
about is the
 
05:12:01.948 --> 05:12:01.958 align:start position:0%
dot and maybe it isn't they can do it
 
05:12:03.430 --> 05:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
now they want to be able to make this
 
05:12:06.430 --> 05:12:06.440 align:start position:0%
easier form but they can lower the speed
 
05:12:09.750 --> 05:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
limit not to 35 but to 40
 
05:12:10.868 --> 05:12:10.878 align:start position:0%
which we I guess would be more
 
05:12:12.590 --> 05:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable for them or they can raise it
 
05:12:12.600 --> 05:12:13.430 align:start position:0%
reasonable for them or they can raise it
from

05:12:13.430 --> 05:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:12:19.190 --> 05:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
35 to 40 versus to 55 and I can speak
 
05:12:19.200 --> 05:12:20.430 align:start position:0%
35 to 40 versus to 55 and I can speak
from

05:12:20.430 --> 05:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:12:24.070 --> 05:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
experience uh at least with Mr Lambert
 
05:12:27.030 --> 05:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
how we got something fixed in my well
 
05:12:28.708 --> 05:12:28.718 align:start position:0%
right outside of my district in the town
 
05:12:32.430 --> 05:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
of Guilford where we had a literally a
 
05:12:34.270 --> 05:12:34.280 align:start position:0%
speed trap which I've spoken to some of
 
05:12:36.868 --> 05:12:36.878 align:start position:0%
you about where I got them to move the
 
05:12:40.190 --> 05:12:40.200 align:start position:0%
35 M hour sign
 
05:12:42.590 --> 05:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
down the road a bit because it wasn't
 
05:12:44.470 --> 05:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
logical where it was it had been for
 
05:12:47.510 --> 05:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
years stupid so
 
05:12:50.230 --> 05:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
um I just tend to think that if this is
 
05:12:52.910 --> 05:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
going to if they're asking us to do this
 
05:12:54.868 --> 05:12:54.878 align:start position:0%
it's logical that because there's no
 
05:12:57.070 --> 05:12:57.080 align:start position:0%
reason not to and I understand about the
 
05:12:58.830 --> 05:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
cost of signs but I've never thought
 
05:13:02.110 --> 05:13:02.120 align:start position:0%
that that hell I can give him some signs
 
05:13:04.548 --> 05:13:04.558 align:start position:0%
it's not a big deal thank you you
 
05:13:05.868 --> 05:13:05.878 align:start position:0%
apparently haven't seen the price of
 
05:13:10.510 --> 05:13:10.520 align:start position:0%
them but anybody else from the committee
 
05:13:10.520 --> 05:13:11.990 align:start position:0%
them but anybody else from the committee
represent

05:13:11.990 --> 05:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
represent
 
05:13:15.270 --> 05:13:15.280 align:start position:0%
Jones Thank you Mr chair um yeah I will
 
05:13:19.030 --> 05:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
be opposing the itl um simply because
 
05:13:21.390 --> 05:13:21.400 align:start position:0%
this came from the dot they asked for
 
05:13:23.548 --> 05:13:23.558 align:start position:0%
this it's another tool they can use it
 
05:13:24.750 --> 05:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean we're going to go around
 
05:13:26.830 --> 05:13:26.840 align:start position:0%
changing the speed limits all over and
 
05:13:28.830 --> 05:13:28.840 align:start position:0%
there is protections it has to be
 
05:13:31.430 --> 05:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
approved by the municipality before it
 
05:13:34.390 --> 05:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
can happen so uh I think there is enough
 
05:13:36.190 --> 05:13:36.200 align:start position:0%
protections that we're not going to go
 
05:13:39.110 --> 05:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
changing everything uh willy-nilly so uh
 
05:13:42.510 --> 05:13:42.520 align:start position:0%
I'll be opposing the IDE thank you
 
05:13:45.270 --> 05:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
anybody else I'm going to give you one
 
05:13:48.510 --> 05:13:48.520 align:start position:0%
more rep St Clair and a good you know
 
05:13:52.990 --> 05:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate that um I believe that
 
05:13:55.430 --> 05:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
the municipalities or the locals would
 
05:13:58.110 --> 05:13:58.120 align:start position:0%
be the ones that would go to Dot and ask
 
05:13:59.510 --> 05:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
for this change wasn't that the
 
05:14:02.190 --> 05:14:02.200 align:start position:0%
testimony we
 
05:14:05.470 --> 05:14:05.480 align:start position:0%
had some of the testimony we heard today
 
05:14:07.548 --> 05:14:07.558 align:start position:0%
was from town from people in towns that
 
05:14:09.670 --> 05:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
had requested the change had not gotten
 
05:14:12.670 --> 05:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
it okay because the traffic study did
 
05:14:15.190 --> 05:14:15.200 align:start position:0%
not support it they didn't support what
 
05:14:15.200 --> 05:14:15.910 align:start position:0%
not support it they didn't support what
they

05:14:15.910 --> 05:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:14:19.110 --> 05:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
wanted right but somebody said that they
 
05:14:21.590 --> 05:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
would have be happy with this bill they
 
05:14:24.590 --> 05:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
requested 40 wasn't it and this would be
 
05:14:26.990 --> 05:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
45 and they and they requested they said
 
05:14:28.190 --> 05:14:28.200 align:start position:0%
that would be a good compromise
 
05:14:30.470 --> 05:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
something along no they they asked 35 I
 
05:14:33.390 --> 05:14:33.400 align:start position:0%
think they wanted 35 no they wanted 40
 
05:14:36.190 --> 05:14:36.200 align:start position:0%
the traffic survey said 50 was what the
 
05:14:38.510 --> 05:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
what the road could support um that's
 
05:14:40.350 --> 05:14:40.360 align:start position:0%
why the deal didn't recommend the change
 
05:14:42.190 --> 05:14:42.200 align:start position:0%
or make the change and and that's part
 
05:14:44.910 --> 05:14:44.920 align:start position:0%
of my issue when you're done with with
 
05:14:47.470 --> 05:14:47.480 align:start position:0%
what this bill does so okay thank
 
05:14:50.190 --> 05:14:50.200 align:start position:0%
you anybody else from the
 
05:14:53.030 --> 05:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none I'll be opposing
 
05:14:56.628 --> 05:14:56.638 align:start position:0%
it also uh for a couple of reasons a I
 
05:14:58.830 --> 05:14:58.840 align:start position:0%
agree with representative Sykes i' like
 
05:15:00.670 --> 05:15:00.680 align:start position:0%
to see a little B more data when we make
 
05:15:03.110 --> 05:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
changes like this uh we don't have any
 
05:15:04.910 --> 05:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
data on the on the crashes the reasons
 
05:15:07.750 --> 05:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
for the crashes and and their frequency
 
05:15:09.948 --> 05:15:09.958 align:start position:0%
uh actually to the contrary about data I
 
05:15:12.990 --> 05:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
saw more politics in our hearing today
 
05:15:15.070 --> 05:15:15.080 align:start position:0%
uh doing exactly what it was just
 
05:15:16.990 --> 05:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned towns that were unsuccessful
 
05:15:18.868 --> 05:15:18.878 align:start position:0%
getting a lowering of the speed limit
 
05:15:20.830 --> 05:15:20.840 align:start position:0%
that they want without having any
 
05:15:22.830 --> 05:15:22.840 align:start position:0%
factual reasoning and science from the
 
05:15:25.110 --> 05:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
Department to to justify it and that's
 
05:15:27.030 --> 05:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
what scares me because as soon as you
 
05:15:30.190 --> 05:15:30.200 align:start position:0%
introduce a blanket definition of an
 
05:15:33.190 --> 05:15:33.200 align:start position:0%
unimproved rural Highway technically
 
05:15:34.350 --> 05:15:34.360 align:start position:0%
these roads are going to have to be
 
05:15:36.948 --> 05:15:36.958 align:start position:0%
reduced to 45 miles an hour in a lot of
 
05:15:39.150 --> 05:15:39.160 align:start position:0%
cases you're not going to want to see 45
 
05:15:40.548 --> 05:15:40.558 align:start position:0%
milph there you're going to prefer the
 
05:15:43.110 --> 05:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
55 that used to be there once again
 
05:15:44.910 --> 05:15:44.920 align:start position:0%
you've heard me say it sometimes one
 
05:15:47.708 --> 05:15:47.718 align:start position:0%
size fits all does not work and that's
 
05:15:50.310 --> 05:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
what I don't like about this um I could
 
05:15:51.990 --> 05:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
continue but I think the point's been
 
05:15:54.430 --> 05:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
made uh if nobody else has anything to
 
05:15:56.390 --> 05:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
speak I will ask the clerk to call the
 
05:15:58.150 --> 05:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
rule when she is
 
05:16:02.070 --> 05:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
ready and you are okay so the motion on
 
05:16:05.030 --> 05:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
the floor is in expedient to legislate
 
05:16:07.910 --> 05:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:11.548 --> 05:16:11.558 align:start position:0%

yes 10 to 10 the motion of inexpedient
 
05:17:01.510 --> 05:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
to legislate fails is there another
 
05:17:04.628 --> 05:17:04.638 align:start position:0%

a sequence to you care to speak to your
 
05:18:40.948 --> 05:18:40.958 align:start position:0%
motion sir I I would Mr chair thank you
 
05:18:43.830 --> 05:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
um as to rehash some of the comments
 
05:18:45.190 --> 05:18:45.200 align:start position:0%
were already made but I want to just
 
05:18:45.200 --> 05:18:46.110 align:start position:0%
were already made but I want to just
make

05:18:46.110 --> 05:18:46.120 align:start position:0%
make
 
05:18:48.590 --> 05:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
emphasis this is requested we had a lot
 
05:18:51.628 --> 05:18:51.638 align:start position:0%
of testimony in favor it was requested
 
05:18:54.310 --> 05:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
by the do primarily as an additional
 
05:18:58.390 --> 05:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
tool in their toolbox for our
 
05:19:01.470 --> 05:19:01.480 align:start position:0%
roads it isn't strictly just a do the
 
05:19:04.830 --> 05:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities are an initial key player
 
05:19:06.948 --> 05:19:06.958 align:start position:0%
in this legislation as well in many
 
05:19:08.430 --> 05:19:08.440 align:start position:0%
communities the regional Planning
 
05:19:08.440 --> 05:19:09.628 align:start position:0%
communities the regional Planning
Commission

05:19:09.628 --> 05:19:09.638 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
05:19:11.910 --> 05:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
so this isn't done Podge Podge
 
05:19:13.548 --> 05:19:13.558 align:start position:0%
willy-nilly throughout the state there
 
05:19:15.910 --> 05:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
is a lot of oversight that will allow
 
05:19:18.190 --> 05:19:18.200 align:start position:0%
this additional tool in the areas where
 
05:19:18.200 --> 05:19:19.070 align:start position:0%
this additional tool in the areas where
it's

05:19:19.070 --> 05:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:19:22.510 --> 05:19:22.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate um as testified I would make
 
05:19:25.830 --> 05:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
our roads safer uh by either reducing
 
05:19:28.708 --> 05:19:28.718 align:start position:0%
the speed to 45 where it's currently 55
 
05:19:29.868 --> 05:19:29.878 align:start position:0%
because they don't have any other
 
05:19:33.270 --> 05:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
leverage unless they go to 35 or in some
 
05:19:37.548 --> 05:19:37.558 align:start position:0%
cases increasing the speed uh to 45 in
 
05:19:41.750 --> 05:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
un making the roads uniform I believe uh
 
05:19:44.628 --> 05:19:44.638 align:start position:0%
like Route 112 was one of the examples
 
05:19:46.350 --> 05:19:46.360 align:start position:0%
where the speed constantly goes up and
 
05:19:49.350 --> 05:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
down up and down up and down where all
 
05:19:51.910 --> 05:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
we really need is Unified speed and in
 
05:19:55.110 --> 05:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
areas where there's shot curves we post
 
05:19:57.310 --> 05:19:57.320 align:start position:0%
this the warning signs of curve ahead
 
05:19:59.868 --> 05:19:59.878 align:start position:0%
and to reduce speed we do it now
 
05:20:01.590 --> 05:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
throughout the states those signs are
 
05:20:05.590 --> 05:20:05.600 align:start position:0%
readily available uh regarding cost we
 
05:20:08.190 --> 05:20:08.200 align:start position:0%
manufacture our signs now whether it's
 
05:20:14.110 --> 05:20:14.120 align:start position:0%
20 M an hour 25 30 35 55 65 70 miles an
 
05:20:18.150 --> 05:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
hour it's NE it's it's negligible we
 
05:20:19.708 --> 05:20:19.718 align:start position:0%
make these signs
 
05:20:22.788 --> 05:20:22.798 align:start position:0%
anyways we still make them it's just you
 
05:20:25.470 --> 05:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
know these are additional signs for an
 
05:20:25.480 --> 05:20:26.788 align:start position:0%
know these are additional signs for an
additional

05:20:26.788 --> 05:20:26.798 align:start position:0%
additional
 
05:20:26.798 --> 05:20:28.628 align:start position:0%
additional
tool

05:20:28.628 --> 05:20:28.638 align:start position:0%
tool
 
05:20:31.708 --> 05:20:31.718 align:start position:0%
um I did not write down all the roots
 
05:20:35.948 --> 05:20:35.958 align:start position:0%
but I know rout 112 the can and 102 with
 
05:20:38.628 --> 05:20:38.638 align:start position:0%
two key roots that were mentioned and
 
05:20:41.548 --> 05:20:41.558 align:start position:0%
and I know for one that route 102
 
05:20:45.030 --> 05:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
through Hudson uh London Dairy and dairy
 
05:20:49.030 --> 05:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
are extremely high accident counts um
 
05:20:50.708 --> 05:20:50.718 align:start position:0%
and that's a road that really needs to
 
05:20:52.670 --> 05:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
be looked at and I would concur with the
 
05:20:54.590 --> 05:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
other roads that were mentioned I think
 
05:20:56.750 --> 05:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
there were probably seven or eight that
 
05:20:59.510 --> 05:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
were that were pointed to but on those
 
05:21:02.910 --> 05:21:02.920 align:start position:0%
points but especially giving our
 
05:21:05.868 --> 05:21:05.878 align:start position:0%
doot a tool to work with to make our
 
05:21:09.670 --> 05:21:09.680 align:start position:0%
roads safer I think it's uh uh this has
 
05:21:13.430 --> 05:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
should have an OP to pass and give do
 
05:21:16.548 --> 05:21:16.558 align:start position:0%
the uh freedom to use the tool at their
 
05:21:19.190 --> 05:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
disposal thank you Mr
 
05:21:22.750 --> 05:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
chair represent Smith thank you as to
 
05:21:26.310 --> 05:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
the cost they're not free if you recall
 
05:21:28.628 --> 05:21:28.638 align:start position:0%
well you might not but when we had the
 
05:21:31.110 --> 05:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
bill to add the move over signs to the
 
05:21:32.868 --> 05:21:32.878 align:start position:0%
highways we were shocked to find out
 
05:21:34.190 --> 05:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
that they were
 
05:21:37.390 --> 05:21:37.400 align:start position:0%
$16,000 each the cost includes not only
 
05:21:39.030 --> 05:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
the posts and materials we don't make
 
05:21:41.470 --> 05:21:41.480 align:start position:0%
the posts we do buy the posts but then
 
05:21:43.628 --> 05:21:43.638 align:start position:0%
also the crew to put it in any site work
 
05:21:45.510 --> 05:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
that needs to be done is not free
 
05:21:48.230 --> 05:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
there's a lot involved how much is it my
 
05:21:51.110 --> 05:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
point is I don't know and you don't
 
05:21:52.590 --> 05:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
either and that's why you should not
 
05:21:54.270 --> 05:21:54.280 align:start position:0%
vote for this bill you should never vote
 
05:21:56.628 --> 05:21:56.638 align:start position:0%
for something that has a wide open price
 
05:21:59.868 --> 05:21:59.878 align:start position:0%
tag another tragic flaw in the bill is
 
05:22:02.590 --> 05:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
who they ask about the cost the judicial
 
05:22:04.470 --> 05:22:04.480 align:start position:0%
branch the judicial counsel the
 
05:22:06.548 --> 05:22:06.558 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice the Department of
 
05:22:09.628 --> 05:22:09.638 align:start position:0%
Corrections whatever the association of
 
05:22:11.350 --> 05:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
counties and the New Hampshire Municipal
 
05:22:13.230 --> 05:22:13.240 align:start position:0%
Association I'm not really sure what
 
05:22:15.030 --> 05:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
help those two groups could possibly
 
05:22:17.788 --> 05:22:17.798 align:start position:0%
have been but they did not bother to ask
 
05:22:20.670 --> 05:22:20.680 align:start position:0%
a do to pull a simple query from their
 
05:22:22.990 --> 05:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
database how many miles a road are
 
05:22:24.830 --> 05:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
affected how many signs are on those
 
05:22:27.150 --> 05:22:27.160 align:start position:0%
roads what's the price tag it isn't
 
05:22:29.430 --> 05:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
indeterminable it's that nobody bothered
 
05:22:32.230 --> 05:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
to determine it for that reason alone if
 
05:22:33.750 --> 05:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
this thing was going to bring sunshine
 
05:22:35.708 --> 05:22:35.718 align:start position:0%
and butterflies to every little child in
 
05:22:38.030 --> 05:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
the state I would still vote against it
 
05:22:39.910 --> 05:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
without knowing the price tag thank you
 
05:22:39.920 --> 05:22:41.430 align:start position:0%
without knowing the price tag thank you
Mr

05:22:41.430 --> 05:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
05:22:43.750 --> 05:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
chair anybody else from the
 
05:22:47.150 --> 05:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
committee I'll finish up with this to
 
05:22:50.350 --> 05:22:50.360 align:start position:0%
respond to representative pondon I agree
 
05:22:51.990 --> 05:22:52.000 align:start position:0%
the Department of Transportation does
 
05:22:53.590 --> 05:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
have the authority to customize the
 
05:22:55.270 --> 05:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
speed limits when we have hazardous
 
05:22:57.990 --> 05:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
situations curves windy roads big big
 
05:22:59.788 --> 05:22:59.798 align:start position:0%
humps that aren't as common as they used
 
05:23:01.708 --> 05:23:01.718 align:start position:0%
to be they used to be a lot of fun but
 
05:23:03.230 --> 05:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
the problem with this bill is it sets
 
05:23:05.708 --> 05:23:05.718 align:start position:0%
the bar at a different place so right
 
05:23:08.548 --> 05:23:08.558 align:start position:0%
now the bar for Rural highways is $55
 
05:23:10.230 --> 05:23:10.240 align:start position:0%
miles an hour they can make the
 
05:23:12.590 --> 05:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
exceptions for safety and for the road
 
05:23:14.590 --> 05:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
conditions at a lower speed they can do
 
05:23:17.390 --> 05:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
that now currently my problem is on
 
05:23:20.510 --> 05:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
those roads that they now with statute
 
05:23:22.510 --> 05:23:22.520 align:start position:0%
and a definition of what a rural
 
05:23:24.470 --> 05:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
unapproved interstate I mean a state
 
05:23:26.750 --> 05:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
road is technically the way this is
 
05:23:29.548 --> 05:23:29.558 align:start position:0%
written they all have to go to 45 is The
 
05:23:32.628 --> 05:23:32.638 align:start position:0%
Benchmark there's no going back up to 55
 
05:23:35.110 --> 05:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
and as you heard from Mr Lambert that
 
05:23:37.470 --> 05:23:37.480 align:start position:0%
most of the roads that we have well I
 
05:23:40.910 --> 05:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
won't say most many uh still using the
 
05:23:44.310 --> 05:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
85 percentile and doing a traffic survey
 
05:23:47.548 --> 05:23:47.558 align:start position:0%
or study still puts those roads at above
 
05:23:51.470 --> 05:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
50 to 55 miles an hour and I'm sorry I
 
05:23:53.628 --> 05:23:53.638 align:start position:0%
our state law still says that you're
 
05:23:55.270 --> 05:23:55.280 align:start position:0%
responsible basically for what's in
 
05:23:56.708 --> 05:23:56.718 align:start position:0%
front of you and you're you're
 
05:23:58.350 --> 05:23:58.360 align:start position:0%
responsible to lower your speed limits
 
05:23:59.948 --> 05:23:59.958 align:start position:0%
based on the conditions and the hazards
 
05:24:02.590 --> 05:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
in front of you to just blanketly lower
 
05:24:04.590 --> 05:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
speed limits uh that you're going to
 
05:24:07.470 --> 05:24:07.480 align:start position:0%
have to stick with 24/7 whether they're
 
05:24:09.590 --> 05:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
it's sunny and dry and no humans in
 
05:24:12.030 --> 05:24:12.040 align:start position:0%
front of you or not I think it's the
 
05:24:15.350 --> 05:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
wrong direction so for that I will be
 
05:24:16.990 --> 05:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
voting against the opop
 
05:24:20.708 --> 05:24:20.718 align:start position:0%
pass seeing nobody else I will ask the
 
05:24:23.430 --> 05:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the RO on the motion of a
 
05:24:23.440 --> 05:24:24.628 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the RO on the motion of a
to

05:24:24.628 --> 05:24:24.638 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:24:28.270 --> 05:24:28.280 align:start position:0%
pass Vice chairman Gorski no
 
05:24:31.150 --> 05:24:31.160 align:start position:0%
representative Smith no clerk votes no
 
05:24:34.430 --> 05:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
representative Hill no representative de
 
05:24:37.150 --> 05:24:37.160 align:start position:0%
no representative foot no representative
 
05:24:40.070 --> 05:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
C no representative Lynn no
 
05:24:42.670 --> 05:24:42.680 align:start position:0%
representative Coker no representative
 
05:24:46.030 --> 05:24:46.040 align:start position:0%
Sykes yes representative Rich yes
 
05:24:47.708 --> 05:24:47.718 align:start position:0%
representative Sinclair yes
 
05:24:51.070 --> 05:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
representative Fox yes representative
 
05:24:54.110 --> 05:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
Gera yes representative AO yes
 
05:24:56.910 --> 05:24:56.920 align:start position:0%
representative Jones yes representative
 
05:25:02.070 --> 05:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
pondan yes representative Calabro yes
 
05:25:06.670 --> 05:25:06.680 align:start position:0%
represent Johnson yes and chairman wall
 
05:25:09.910 --> 05:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
no 10 to 10
 
05:25:11.910 --> 05:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
okay so the motion about the pass fails
 
05:25:14.110 --> 05:25:14.120 align:start position:0%
as well so here we are I just spoke with
 
05:25:16.868 --> 05:25:16.878 align:start position:0%
the ranking member offering an interim
 
05:25:18.830 --> 05:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
study I guess we're not going anywhere
 
05:25:18.840 --> 05:25:19.590 align:start position:0%
study I guess we're not going anywhere
with

05:25:19.590 --> 05:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:25:23.070 --> 05:25:23.080 align:start position:0%
that um with are there any other motions
 
05:25:24.430 --> 05:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
I'll put it to the floor I don't have
 
05:25:26.310 --> 05:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
complete control of this
 
05:25:28.990 --> 05:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
place seeing no other motions I guess
 
05:25:30.868 --> 05:25:30.878 align:start position:0%
we're going to move this to the calendar
 
05:25:33.628 --> 05:25:33.638 align:start position:0%
is no recommendation when it gets as you
 
05:25:36.150 --> 05:25:36.160 align:start position:0%
know uh to the floor the uh the
 
05:25:38.310 --> 05:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation will be out the pass and
 
05:25:41.350 --> 05:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
will take it from there in the full
 
05:25:43.868 --> 05:25:43.878 align:start position:0%
house uh so that being said I will close
 
05:25:47.030 --> 05:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
the executive session on Senate Bill
 
05:25:50.150 --> 05:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
471 in terms of reports what's that are
 
05:25:52.510 --> 05:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
we doing any reports um The Minority
 
05:25:55.430 --> 05:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
Report anybody do well actually you're
 
05:25:58.910 --> 05:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
going to be doing the the pass motion
 
05:26:02.470 --> 05:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
somebody somebody over here will do a
 
05:26:05.990 --> 05:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so do that is that the
 
05:26:09.190 --> 05:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
majority report no no just with the way
 
05:26:11.030 --> 05:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
this works we're going to
 
05:26:14.390 --> 05:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
have a motion I mean a report in favor
 
05:26:16.708 --> 05:26:16.718 align:start position:0%
about the pass and a report supporting
 
05:26:17.628 --> 05:26:17.638 align:start position:0%
okay so I don't
 
05:26:20.030 --> 05:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
need got
 
05:26:20.040 --> 05:26:23.030 align:start position:0%
need got
it

05:26:23.030 --> 05:26:23.040 align:start position:0%

05:26:46.350 --> 05:26:46.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:54.708 --> 05:26:54.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:57.510 --> 05:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
home I wanted to do that I don't know if
 
05:26:57.520 --> 05:26:58.590 align:start position:0%
home I wanted to do that I don't know if
I

05:26:58.590 --> 05:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:27:01.270 --> 05:27:01.280 align:start position:0%
will no
 
05:27:04.270 --> 05:27:04.280 align:start position:0%

05:27:09.670 --> 05:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
deadline for uh reporting on all house
 
05:27:11.910 --> 05:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
bills Senate
 
05:27:19.190 --> 05:27:19.200 align:start position:0%

can you read
 
05:27:43.788 --> 05:27:43.798 align:start position:0%
that house deadlines
 
05:27:48.110 --> 05:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
2024 last day uh to act on Senate Bills
