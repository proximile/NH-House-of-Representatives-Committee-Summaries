Services representative f is recognized
 
00:11:35.069 --> 00:11:35.079 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you Mr chair thank
 
00:11:37.829 --> 00:11:37.839 align:start position:0%
you all for being here so I wonder if
 
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
you could just tell me a little bit
 
00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
about what the newborn Navigator program
 
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
is you indicated that it's not a federal
 
00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
program so there's no federal law behind
 
00:11:47.949 --> 00:11:47.959 align:start position:0%
it and also and yet it talks about
 
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:49.240 align:start position:0%
source of funds or at least it talks
 
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
about Tana funds which is a federal
 
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:54.200 align:start position:0%
program so maybe just to discuss that
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
and then let me know how the funding is
 
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
working and what the program itself is
 
00:11:58.829 --> 00:11:58.839 align:start position:0%
and what where where it's based in law
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
or whatever sure so the the funding
 
00:12:03.509 --> 00:12:03.519 align:start position:0%
source is is T if is a federal funding
 
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:05.680 align:start position:0%
uh Source the program itself is is a
 
00:12:08.069 --> 00:12:08.079 align:start position:0%
service of best practice services for uh
 
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
newborn support So supporting families
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
with supportive care services uh to
 
00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
ensure uh the perpetuation of two parent
 
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
families Ure safe safe practice with
 
00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
your families and ensure the family is
 
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
well supported by Community Resources so
 
00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
a either birthing hospital or healthc
 
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
care provider May refer uh a child into
 
00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
uh home visiting Services through the uh
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
the newborn navigation program uh
 
00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
newborn Navigator would then work with
 
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
the family to ensure that they have
 
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:38.120 align:start position:0%
knowledge of safe safe sleep or lead
 
00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
prevention uh programs may be nutrition
 
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
services it may be a referral to other
 
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:45.800 align:start position:0%

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:48.040 align:start position:0%
practice in Family Care and and newborn
 
00:12:50.350 --> 00:12:50.360 align:start position:0%

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
specified follow follow up is there any
 
00:12:59.189 --> 00:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
place on on the DJ's website that talks
 
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
but I tried to Google it and I found
 
00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
some information about it but not
 
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
specifically related to the state uh so
 
00:13:06.629 --> 00:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
I am happy to to follow up with some
 
00:13:08.990 --> 00:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
resources on it I don't have uh off hand
 
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
I don't know if there's anything
 
00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:11.560 align:start position:0%
specifically on newborn navigator on our
 
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
website uh but I'm happy to follow up
 
00:13:14.189 --> 00:13:14.199 align:start position:0%
with some resources and links would be
 
00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
great thank you very
 
00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
much representative Edwards for a
 
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:23.160 align:start position:0%
question uh thank you Mr chair um is is
 
00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
is there a differential in eligibility
 
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:30.680 align:start position:0%
for this to where um two parent families
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
are as easily made eligible as single
 
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
family single parent families I I'm
 
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
curious um about what we're going to be
 
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
doing in the future supporting two
 
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
parent families more yep uh families in
 
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
both of those scenarios would be
 
00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:47.240 align:start position:0%
supported eligible and could you get
 
00:13:49.069 --> 00:13:49.079 align:start position:0%
closer to the mic I'm I'm just really
 
00:13:51.389 --> 00:13:51.399 align:start position:0%
deaf and I and I talk softly so maybe
 
00:13:52.629 --> 00:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
we're a bad
 
00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
combination the uh both of those
 
00:13:56.749 --> 00:13:56.759 align:start position:0%
scenarios families with two parents as
 
00:13:58.350 --> 00:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
well as single parent families would be
 
00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
eligible so for services and there would
 
00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:02.040 align:start position:0%
certainly be no no bias or or edging
 
00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
towards either both would be available
 
00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:06.959 align:start position:0%
if if referred by providers or their
 
00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
Hospital further
 
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
questions saying none I'll entertain a
 
00:14:15.749 --> 00:14:15.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:19.629 --> 00:14:19.639 align:start position:0%
2415 was that whoever represent walner
 
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
moved I I did but you pick represent
 
00:14:24.509 --> 00:14:24.519 align:start position:0%
Earth moved represent Edward second to
 
00:14:24.519 --> 00:14:26.189 align:start position:0%
Earth moved represent Edward second to
adopt

00:14:26.189 --> 00:14:26.199 align:start position:0%
adopt
 
00:14:29.749 --> 00:14:29.759 align:start position:0%
24154 further discussion seeing none all
 
00:14:33.189 --> 00:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
in favor say I I oppose
 
00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:35.519 align:start position:0%
no okay thank
 
00:14:39.189 --> 00:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
you next item will be
 
00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:42.680 align:start position:0%
from Department of Natural cultural
 
00:14:46.710 --> 00:14:46.720 align:start position:0%
resources um Trails Bureau I guess
 
00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:49.720 align:start position:0%
anybody here from that department would
 
00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:01.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:03.320 align:start position:0%
make sure when you get close to the mic
 
00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
push the red button so we know it's
 
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
go Alexis rugco deputy chief for the
 
00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
Bureau of trails uh Chris Marino Chief
 
00:15:19.389 --> 00:15:19.399 align:start position:0%
Administration Senator rosenal had a
 
00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
question I do thank you very much for
 
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
being here
 
00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:27.880 align:start position:0%
um I know these are these monies are to
 
00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
build new trip and our state parks and
 
00:15:35.749 --> 00:15:35.759 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering why there's not a
 
00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
requirement that new trails be
 
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
accessible to people with
 
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
walking problems IE
 
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
wheelchairs why are we making not making
 
00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:54.040 align:start position:0%
it so that all of our residents have
 
00:15:57.509 --> 00:15:57.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:00.680 align:start position:0%
parks so that that's a good question
 
00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:02.600 align:start position:0%
many of our trails that are built
 
00:16:04.829 --> 00:16:04.839 align:start position:0%
there's different types there's ohrv
 
00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:07.240 align:start position:0%
Trails snowmobile trails hiking trails
 
00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
and such many of the trails that are
 
00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:11.560 align:start position:0%
built especially ones in City centers
 
00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:14.120 align:start position:0%
are accessible and we do look for that
 
00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:16.720 align:start position:0%
in applications some Trails like a
 
00:16:18.269 --> 00:16:18.279 align:start position:0%
hiking trail up the side of Mount
 
00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
Washington isn't technically accessible
 
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
without an Adaptive
 
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
wheelchair follow follow up so
 
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
but to just
 
00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
contain accessible trails to
 
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
cities doesn't really include all of our
 
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
residents in the great beautiful New
 
00:16:43.309 --> 00:16:43.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire outdoors and I'm sure there's
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
a middle ground between a city
 
00:16:48.509 --> 00:16:48.519 align:start position:0%
street and Mount
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
Washington are these
 
00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:55.480 align:start position:0%
Trails going to be at such a pitch that
 
00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
accessible many trails would be built to
 
00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:07.160 align:start position:0%
be accessible the the the money is for
 
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
every single type of Trail in the entire
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
state so if somebody applied and wanted
 
00:17:14.110 --> 00:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
to build an accessible Trail they can
 
00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:15.720 align:start position:0%
build it there's nothing preventing them
 
00:17:18.549 --> 00:17:18.559 align:start position:0%
from doing so it's just that not every
 
00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:21.160 align:start position:0%
single Trail in the state is capable of
 
00:17:23.549 --> 00:17:23.559 align:start position:0%
being an accessible Trail without
 
00:17:23.559 --> 00:17:25.110 align:start position:0%
being an accessible Trail without
adaptive

00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
adaptive
 
00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:28.240 align:start position:0%
equipment final question final question
 
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
what why why is the department not
 
00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
requiring from the biders that where
 
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
appropriate the trails
 
00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:44.360 align:start position:0%
be uh built in such a way to be
 
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
accessible to all of our
 
00:17:50.669 --> 00:17:50.679 align:start position:0%
residents we actually do on the
 
00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
application we have a whole section that
 
00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
talks about um accessibility and
 
00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
Community Partners that they work with
 
00:17:59.190 --> 00:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
in order to build these trails we just
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
can't limit that that requirement to
 
00:18:03.549 --> 00:18:03.559 align:start position:0%
every single Trail in the state cuz it
 
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
would exclude many of our OHV and
 
00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:07.480 align:start position:0%
snowmobile trails throughout the state
 
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
as well as the more difficult hiking
 
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
trails that still need funds in order to
 
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
be maintained and upgraded These funds
 
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:15.400 align:start position:0%
are not limited to just new Trail
 
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
building it is for um maintaining
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
existing Trails as well and nobody is
 
00:18:23.549 --> 00:18:23.559 align:start position:0%
restricted from those
 
00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039 align:start position:0%
Trails for applying I'm sorry I thought
 
00:18:29.149 --> 00:18:29.159 align:start position:0%
it was a last question but if I get one
 
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
more so is the department going to
 
00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
require that new trails be accessible or
 
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
just score them more highly on an
 
00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
application it depends on where they
 
00:18:47.430 --> 00:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
want to put the trail for example if
 
00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:49.400 align:start position:0%
they want to build a new hiking trail up
 
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
the side of a mountain we can't require
 
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
them to make it accessible because it
 
00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't fit the location and the type
 
00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
of trail that you're looking for many um
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
organizations like that that provide
 
00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
accessible devices to users they can use
 
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
that to get up the trail they just
 
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to do it with a
 
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:10.400 align:start position:0%
motorized wheelchair because of the
 
00:19:13.390 --> 00:19:13.400 align:start position:0%
terrain but when there are applications
 
00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
where it would make sense and my example
 
00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:17.240 align:start position:0%
of like a city center that's where we
 
00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:19.360 align:start position:0%
would look for it we have denied some
 
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:21.640 align:start position:0%
applications in the past where it was a
 
00:19:24.549 --> 00:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
location perfectly fit for an accessible
 
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
Trail the the town did not want to put
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
one in and it didn't score for high
 
00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
enough against other Trail applications
 
00:19:33.549 --> 00:19:33.559 align:start position:0%
that had that accessibility
 
00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
component thank you do you have on your
 
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:43.789 --> 00:19:43.799 align:start position:0%
Trails I don't believe so under the
 
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
Bureau of trails but there are external
 
00:19:49.029 --> 00:19:49.039 align:start position:0%
organizations that do provide lists of
 
00:19:50.549 --> 00:19:50.559 align:start position:0%
websites that oh sorry lists of
 
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
locations where accessible trails are
 
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
available for the wheelchair bound that
 
00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:56.600 align:start position:0%
might be a good thing to have on your
 
00:19:58.270 --> 00:19:58.280 align:start position:0%
website at least the link to those
 
00:20:00.669 --> 00:20:00.679 align:start position:0%
places that have the list excellent
 
00:20:00.679 --> 00:20:02.510 align:start position:0%
places that have the list excellent
suggestion

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
suggestion
 
00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
okay Senator dallesandro thank thank you
 
00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
Mr chair but is it the
 
00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:12.280 align:start position:0%
goal to to make Trails
 
00:20:15.549 --> 00:20:15.559 align:start position:0%
available to the greatest amount of
 
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
people in the state and and and visitors
 
00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
so that they can enjoy them and they're
 
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
accessible is is that our goal in in
 
00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
terms of when we when we offer these uh
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
what we offer grits so okay is is
 
00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:35.080 align:start position:0%
specifically the
 
00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
grit to take care of as many people as
 
00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:39.919 align:start position:0%
possible to
 
00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
provide the ability to use these
 
00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
facilities that is exactly correct so we
 
00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:48.360 align:start position:0%
look for applications specifically if
 
00:20:49.789 --> 00:20:49.799 align:start position:0%
they are going to upgrade an existing
 
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
Trail to be accessible as well as if
 
00:20:53.789 --> 00:20:53.799 align:start position:0%
they are going to build a new one to be
 
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
accessible those are the ones that we
 
00:20:59.149 --> 00:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
score the highest so it is our goal okay
 
00:21:02.149 --> 00:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chair further
 
00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Edwards thank
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair I I I'd like to think that
 
00:21:11.549 --> 00:21:11.559 align:start position:0%
what I've heard you say is that the
 
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
policy on using these Trail monies uh
 
00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
includes a very wide diversity of Trail
 
00:21:21.669 --> 00:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
access and that way by having the
 
00:21:24.909 --> 00:21:24.919 align:start position:0%
diversity we're probably able to satisfy
 
00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
the interests and needs of pretty much
 
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
all of our citizens
 
00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:31.640 align:start position:0%
that not everything has to be for
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
everybody but the it's in the diversity
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
and the wide
 
00:21:38.510 --> 00:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
availability uh that is sort of the
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
beauty of our trail
 
00:21:43.029 --> 00:21:43.039 align:start position:0%
system that is certainly correct and
 
00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:45.880 align:start position:0%
many of our residents who um do
 
00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
participate in ohrv writing say that
 
00:21:50.830 --> 00:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
it's a it's wonderful because they can
 
00:21:54.149 --> 00:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
use the ohrv as their adaptive device so
 
00:21:55.789 --> 00:21:55.799 align:start position:0%
they get to go to some of these more
 
00:21:57.269 --> 00:21:57.279 align:start position:0%
difficult locations that they wouldn't

rosenwall for a question senator rosenal
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
for thank you very much good morning um
 
00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:57.480 align:start position:0%
I notice um in this item that there's
 
00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:58.990 align:start position:0%
I notice um in this item that there's
50,000

00:22:58.990 --> 00:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
50,000
 
00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
for out ofate travel and we asked you
 
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
about it in Pre pref
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
fiscal um but the response was that
 
00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:14.799 align:start position:0%
17 APS staff are going to go to a
 
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
three-day conference in
 
00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
Albuquerque that works out to almost
 
00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:24.200 align:start position:0%
$3,000 a person that just seems
 
00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
like pretty high rate for travel costs
 
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
and I wonder if you could
 
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:34.720 align:start position:0%
elaborate on why it's so expensive to
 
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
get to Albuquerque and stay there for
 
00:23:38.510 --> 00:23:38.520 align:start position:0%
three days yeah thank you for the
 
00:23:40.269 --> 00:23:40.279 align:start position:0%
question um Melissa Hardy division
 
00:23:42.269 --> 00:23:42.279 align:start position:0%
director for long-term supports and
 
00:23:45.549 --> 00:23:45.559 align:start position:0%
services so the 17 staff from EPS would
 
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
be traveling on a Sunday so we still
 
00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:50.360 align:start position:0%
have to um incur those costs for
 
00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
Staffing from Sunday and then they would
 
00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:55.880 align:start position:0%
return on Wednesday evening so it is
 
00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
only three nights but it is a a long
 
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
extended period of time for 17 of our
 
00:24:02.710 --> 00:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
staff that would need to be um
 
00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:06.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:09.880 align:start position:0%
that further question and there's also
 
00:24:13.149 --> 00:24:13.159 align:start position:0%
in that 50,000 there's um we might have
 
00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
the opportunity if that cost does come
 
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
down per person for additional staff to
 
00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
attend training um for financial
 
00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
exploitation there's a training that we
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
want to send staff to but all depends on
 
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
you know the cost of per person for that
 
00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:34.960 align:start position:0%

ready for the question all in favor say
 
00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
I I oppose no the item is adopted moving
 
00:24:58.870 --> 00:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
on to item 24183
 
00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:13.480 align:start position:0%
Services hi I'm Charlie Arling housee
 
00:25:14.789 --> 00:25:14.799 align:start position:0%
I'm the commissioner of administrative
 
00:25:16.389 --> 00:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
services and we're in charge of
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
bathrooms thank you for coming
 
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
representative see Lehman for a question
 
00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thanks for
 
00:25:28.269 --> 00:25:28.279 align:start position:0%
taking my question Commission
 
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner I see you're looking to get
 
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
at least a million dollars of arper
 
00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:35.240 align:start position:0%
funds and the total projects about 2.1
 
00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
million just to question why not ask for
 
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
additional arer funds because I guess
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
the rest of the money would have to come
 
00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:44.120 align:start position:0%
from General funds if you don't have
 
00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
another source of funds for the
 
00:25:48.149 --> 00:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
renovation of the bathroom so this this
 
00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:50.120 align:start position:0%
is a project that we're doing uh in
 
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
cooperation with the general court as
 
00:25:55.350 --> 00:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
you might imagine and my understanding
 
00:25:59.470 --> 00:25:59.480 align:start position:0%
is that the the request for funds came
 
00:26:02.669 --> 00:26:02.679 align:start position:0%
directly from the uh members of the
 
00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
general court or its staff to um gopher
 
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
and that um I don't know if they
 
00:26:10.029 --> 00:26:10.039 align:start position:0%
requested the whole amount I suspect
 
00:26:13.149 --> 00:26:13.159 align:start position:0%
they did and that um gopher must have
 
00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
said we've got about a million bucks so
 
00:26:18.830 --> 00:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
take it or leave it um it's my hunch
 
00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:20.799 align:start position:0%
right and I didn't ask questions I just
 
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%
said you know it's 2.1 million right
 
00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah and and a guy named Terry said
 
00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:31.360 align:start position:0%
um yeah that's how much we have and so I
 
00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
think what we're plan on doing is
 
00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
bathrooms are
 
00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:37.039 align:start position:0%
scalable um yeah there are lots of
 
00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
bathrooms we'll do as many as we can
 
00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
it's that kind of thing and you have a
 
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
deadline that these funds must be or the
 
00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:49.480 align:start position:0%
the construction must be finished by we
 
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
have to encumber we have to encumber the
 
00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
money fully including a GNC contract by
 
00:26:57.909 --> 00:26:57.919 align:start position:0%
the end of the calendar year um and I as
 
00:27:00.430 --> 00:27:00.440 align:start position:0%
you might guess uh I have regular
 
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
updates with public works on all of the
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
construction projects and are we going
 
00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:08.360 align:start position:0%
to make it or not and um I would say
 
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:10.240 align:start position:0%
that if you line line these up like the
 
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
trains on a car this is the Caboose but
 
00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:15.000 align:start position:0%
I think the Caboose is going to make it
 
00:27:18.269 --> 00:27:18.279 align:start position:0%
too thank you so just to followup if I
 
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
could Mr chairman seeing commissioner
 
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
Caswell in the audience maybe he could
 
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
answer why maybe they couldn't get the
 
00:27:27.669 --> 00:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
total amount or whether that request was
 
00:27:30.669 --> 00:27:30.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
forward director Caswell thank you for
 
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:36.880 align:start position:0%

have set in the back
 
00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:42.440 align:start position:0%
um good morning so the request that we
 
00:27:44.549 --> 00:27:44.559 align:start position:0%
received was actually $4 million it was
 
00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
not for the $2.1 million that we
 
00:27:49.070 --> 00:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
approved we what we received from the
 
00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.750 align:start position:0%

about the source of funds General funds
 
00:30:00.029 --> 00:30:00.039 align:start position:0%
and I was Wonder wondering whether arpa
 
00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
funds would have been usable and whether
 
00:30:08.549 --> 00:30:08.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
request um the uh the statute that um
 
00:30:14.549 --> 00:30:14.559 align:start position:0%
funds the SEC um provides for the
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
general funds in case that the SEC funds
 
00:30:19.549 --> 00:30:19.559 align:start position:0%
are insufficient um it was never
 
00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:22.240 align:start position:0%

Affairs any questions on this
 
00:31:09.629 --> 00:31:09.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:12.549 --> 00:31:12.559 align:start position:0%
lean we have director

business and economic
 
00:31:19.909 --> 00:31:19.919 align:start position:0%
Affairs so I guess just to get it out
 
00:31:21.389 --> 00:31:21.399 align:start position:0%
there because you've heard rumors that
 
00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:23.840 align:start position:0%
we've heard about the status of the mill
 
00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
in gorum which I guess can be dispelled
 
00:31:28.789 --> 00:31:28.799 align:start position:0%
by what you have to offer for and I just
 
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
was glad to see manad Papermill was also
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
being a successful recipient of these
 
00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:35.720 align:start position:0%
funds but if you could just tell us a
 
00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
status and get rid of that rumor that's
 
00:31:40.029 --> 00:31:40.039 align:start position:0%
been circulating about the mill up north
 
00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
yes I'd be happy to uh representative
 
00:31:43.509 --> 00:31:43.519 align:start position:0%
thank you so white mountain paper
 
00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:45.720 align:start position:0%
company uh we did uh we've worked with
 
00:31:48.190 --> 00:31:48.200 align:start position:0%
them very closely through this process
 
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
um I think at this point they're
 
00:31:54.269 --> 00:31:54.279 align:start position:0%
employing around uh 73 individuals uh
 
00:31:57.269 --> 00:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
they have uh just this year they expect
 
00:31:59.870 --> 00:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
to begin operating in the black which
 
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
has been something they've struggled
 
00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
with for a few years given the age of
 
00:32:04.629 --> 00:32:04.639 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure and so on and that
 
00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
they do intend this calendar year to add
 
00:32:10.230 --> 00:32:10.240 align:start position:0%
another another line of paper
 
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
manufacturing at that facility so uh in
 
00:32:15.149 --> 00:32:15.159 align:start position:0%
speaking with the with the ownership
 
00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:17.960 align:start position:0%
yesterday just to confirm these figures
 
00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:21.080 align:start position:0%
um they had um the owners themselves in
 
00:32:22.669 --> 00:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
addition to the acquisition costs have
 
00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
invested $9 million into this into their
 
00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:28.440 align:start position:0%
uh revitalization project so that's
 
00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:30.440 align:start position:0%
going quite well and I would say that if
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
you happen to be in the gorm area area
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
it would be worth asking to come by and
 
00:32:36.629 --> 00:32:36.639 align:start position:0%
take a look they've done some
 
00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
significant work there uh and that place
 
00:32:41.509 --> 00:32:41.519 align:start position:0%
is probably looking about as good as it
 
00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
has over the last 15 or 20 years in my
 
00:32:46.110 --> 00:32:46.120 align:start position:0%
view very good thank you Mr chairman
 
00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:50.070 align:start position:0%

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
has some history that I observed
 
00:33:39.029 --> 00:33:39.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:39.039 --> 00:33:40.669 align:start position:0%
 
meeting

00:33:40.669 --> 00:33:40.679 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:43.720 align:start position:0%
so the one of the items was withdrawn
 
00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
but this one Still Remains this deals
 
00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:48.360 align:start position:0%

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:06.590 align:start position:0%
 
questions

00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:09.240 align:start position:0%

alandro thank you Mr chairman um U my
 
00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:17.960 align:start position:0%
question really isn't about why we're
 
00:34:20.950 --> 00:34:20.960 align:start position:0%
switching providers
 
00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:24.839 align:start position:0%
I understand that I think it's great uh
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
my question is why was item 198
 
00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:33.399 align:start position:0%
withdrawn which would have repaid
 
00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:36.200 align:start position:0%
Hampton for some Hampstead for some
 
00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
extra cost and secondly when does the
 
00:34:43.069 --> 00:34:43.079 align:start position:0%
department plan to bring that item
 
00:34:46.990 --> 00:34:47.000 align:start position:0%

$178,000 to the town of Hamstead for
 
00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
payment and L of taxes um currently SB
 
00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:09.040 align:start position:0%

equivalent amount of
 
00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:18.359 align:start position:0%

or 191 um the reason for that being
 
00:35:25.829 --> 00:35:25.839 align:start position:0%
essentially the equivalent amount of tax
 
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
loss to the town
 
00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:30.280 align:start position:0%

00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
item in June um from a process
 
00:35:37.109 --> 00:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
perspective there is no impact because
 
00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
no payment would be made in still the
 
00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:42.760 align:start position:0%

thank

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:44.240 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
you repres representative Edwards for a
 
00:35:50.589 --> 00:35:50.599 align:start position:0%
question um thank you I I participated
 
00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:54.040 align:start position:0%
in the passing of SP 311 uh the question
 
00:35:55.990 --> 00:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
that was brought up that I was not able
 
00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
to answer while we were talking about it
 
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
is is what is the Department's long-term
 
00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
Vision on continuing that uh that
 
00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
payment in Li of property taxes is this
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
something we expect to do forever do we
 
00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:11.720 align:start position:0%
expect a five-year transition what what
 
00:36:13.589 --> 00:36:13.599 align:start position:0%
are we what are we wanting to do with
 
00:36:17.630 --> 00:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
this sure and and I I I think I would um
 
00:36:20.069 --> 00:36:20.079 align:start position:0%
just call back to the conversation that
 
00:36:21.990 --> 00:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
that we had I believe during the public
 
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
hearing with the Full House Finance as
 
00:36:25.589 --> 00:36:25.599 align:start position:0%
well as the the work session with
 
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
division 3 in the sense that um I think
 
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
that's a larger policy discussion uh for
 
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
the next budget process um because uh
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
what occurred during this budget process
 
00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
was during the Senate phase the Senate
 
00:36:41.309 --> 00:36:41.319 align:start position:0%
appropriated and directed the department
 
00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
to um to make payments to the town of
 
00:36:47.349 --> 00:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
Hamstead uh that particular provision
 
00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
didn't make it to the final budget there
 
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
was no commed a conference so there was
 
00:36:52.589 --> 00:36:52.599 align:start position:0%
never a discussion between the house and
 
00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
the Senate relative to that topic in
 
00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
question um so I would anticipate that
 
00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
we would need to have a more longer term
 
00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
discussion relative to the long-term
 
00:37:02.589 --> 00:37:02.599 align:start position:0%
implications and direction of the state
 
00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:06.440 align:start position:0%
on that front follow up um with us just
 
00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
starting the governor's budget process
 
00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:10.280 align:start position:0%
here in the next few weeks if you
 
00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:12.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mind keeping a Post-It note to
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
ask the governor's office what they
 
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
think they we ought to be doing from a
 
00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:19.960 align:start position:0%
policy perspective long term I'd like to
 
00:37:21.910 --> 00:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
you know figure out what we need to do
 
00:37:25.069 --> 00:37:25.079 align:start position:0%
to you know support the the best policy
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
or or or or not but thanks of
 
00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:32.040 align:start position:0%

in terms of the people the people that
 
00:38:01.069 --> 00:38:01.079 align:start position:0%
are involved how many will reate how
 
00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:04.160 align:start position:0%
many are be let go the story
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
there and and and the service because as
 
00:38:09.990 --> 00:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
we know the town has been
 
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
uh let's say quite vociferous in in
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
entity good morning Lori Weaver
 
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner Health and Human Services
 
00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
um in regards to uh the transition um it
 
00:38:28.309 --> 00:38:28.319 align:start position:0%
is a short period of time to transition
 
00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:31.160 align:start position:0%
a hospital uh Nathan is and team are
 
00:38:34.829 --> 00:38:34.839 align:start position:0%
working fastidiously to uh tie up all
 
00:38:37.589 --> 00:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
those details um 7:30 this morning I
 
00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
went met with the Hamstead staff I'll be
 
00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:41.560 align:start position:0%
down there this afternoon as well for
 
00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:43.480 align:start position:0%
two sessions with the staff as well to
 
00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:44.920 align:start position:0%
talk about what it means and what it
 
00:38:47.309 --> 00:38:47.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean um but the main message is
 
00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:49.400 align:start position:0%
to keep doing the good with the work
 
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
that they're doing and staying focused
 
00:38:53.230 --> 00:38:53.240 align:start position:0%
on running the hospital um hospitals in
 
00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
running is in good shape under the
 
00:38:58.430 --> 00:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
leadership of Justin luier who has been
 
00:39:01.109 --> 00:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
um tremendous since he came on board so
 
00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
leaning a lot on him for that transition
 
00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:05.240 align:start position:0%
I would like to think that for patient
 
00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
care it's a seamless transition um and
 
00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
that the staff don't know any different
 
00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:11.240 align:start position:0%
even though there's a lot of moving
 
00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:13.720 align:start position:0%
Parts okay just one further question
 
00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
further question and and Have you
 
00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
communicated with the town about the
 
00:39:21.790 --> 00:39:21.800 align:start position:0%
about the the uh about the transition
 
00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
and sort of some in some way allayed
 
00:39:26.829 --> 00:39:26.839 align:start position:0%
their fears or that seemed to have
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
manifested themselves at that meeting
 
00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:29.960 align:start position:0%
that took place at
 
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
hiet I will be 100% honest and say we
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
did try to communicate with the town we
 
00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
have communicated with the town um I
 
00:39:38.349 --> 00:39:38.359 align:start position:0%
think Wednesday night was a little
 
00:39:40.109 --> 00:39:40.119 align:start position:0%
difficult because we weren't given or
 
00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
afforded a lot of opportunity to speak
 
00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:43.640 align:start position:0%
we were asked to listen and I think we
 
00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
did do a lot of listening um we've done
 
00:39:47.550 --> 00:39:47.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of listening we'll continue to do
 
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of listening um the the town
 
00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
meeting was really to be focused on the
 
00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:55.880 align:start position:0%
new YDC build um and I think uh often we
 
00:39:58.510 --> 00:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
heard about issues uh or concerns about
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
the hospital but uh and those questions
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
are answered but uh there's ongoing
 
00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:05.720 align:start position:0%
communication with Town officials um on
 
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
a regular basis from Justin from Team
 
00:40:09.349 --> 00:40:09.359 align:start position:0%
from my department from myself from
 
00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:12.680 align:start position:0%
Marissa hen um so I feel that yes we are
 
00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
open we are listening and we're trying
 
00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
to be heard as well okay thank you thank
 
00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:20.200 align:start position:0%
you Mr CH Senator rosenal thank you Mr
 
00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
chair can you tell us when the perimeter
 
00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:27.800 align:start position:0%
fence will be installed
 
00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
as soon as all it's state government and
 
00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
paperwork right we have the funding
 
00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:35.960 align:start position:0%
we're putting forth the um uh Justin
 
00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:38.079 align:start position:0%
putting forth the estimates if you will
 
00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
so what we attempted to present to the
 
00:40:42.349 --> 00:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
town on Wednesday night was the the
 
00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:44.079 align:start position:0%
diagram of what the perimeter fence
 
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:45.480 align:start position:0%
would look like and what the actual
 
00:40:46.990 --> 00:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
fence would look like so that people
 
00:40:48.109 --> 00:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
could see what it would look like we
 
00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:49.240 align:start position:0%
didn't unfortunately have the
 
00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do that so I think we're
 
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
expecting um probably within the next 3
 
00:40:55.829 --> 00:40:55.839 align:start position:0%
to 6 months it's getting the bids and
 
00:40:57.069 --> 00:40:57.079 align:start position:0%
going through the process that we have
 
00:40:58.829 --> 00:40:58.839 align:start position:0%
to go through but we're working on that
 
00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:01.359 align:start position:0%
as soon as possible thank
 
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
you a question about the transition are
 
00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
you just matching the pay that the
 
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
people are presently getting are you
 
00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
fitting them into a state system are you
 
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
how how are you doing this is there a
 
00:41:17.710 --> 00:41:17.720 align:start position:0%
pay raise a pay loss or equal pay it
 
00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:19.400 align:start position:0%
would be equal pay we're not looking to
 
00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:21.800 align:start position:0%
raise their pay or or harm them by
 
00:41:24.069 --> 00:41:24.079 align:start position:0%
having pay loss so we're trying to do
 
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
comparable pay um and benefits um
 
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
package for them which is what we're
 
00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:30.200 align:start position:0%
working on right now will it become
 
00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
problematic if someone that's say an irn
 
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
with three years experience ends up with
 
00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
more money on this deal than an irn with
 
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
three years experience somewhere else in
 
00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:41.400 align:start position:0%
the state those are the bumps that we're
 
00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
trying to uh smooth out right now they
 
00:41:46.829 --> 00:41:46.839 align:start position:0%
are a represented environment so we will
 
00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
be looking at uh their bargaining pieces
 
00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:51.640 align:start position:0%
with that as well and where that falls
 
00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
in um but we have to outweigh weigh all
 
00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:55.160 align:start position:0%
of that but like I said it's a quick
 
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
transition so we need we need a minute
 
00:41:59.069 --> 00:41:59.079 align:start position:0%
to smooth that out I don't have all the
 
00:42:02.069 --> 00:42:02.079 align:start position:0%
answers of what what it is at this time
 
00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
all right we're pleased that it's moving
 
00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:07.880 align:start position:0%

dallesandro thank you uh uh here we have
 
00:46:57.630 --> 00:46:57.640 align:start position:0%
a situation where money is coming to
 
00:47:00.109 --> 00:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
Manchester for homeless which is very
 
00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
important yet uh this we needed this
 
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
money uh long to have before today what
 
00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
what what took it so long to get
 
00:47:14.069 --> 00:47:14.079 align:start position:0%
here so good morning for the record I'm
 
00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:16.280 align:start position:0%
Kya Fox I am the director of the
 
00:47:21.030 --> 00:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
division for Behavioral Health this um
 
00:47:25.230 --> 00:47:25.240 align:start position:0%
uh particular request is coupled with SB
 
00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:27.069 align:start position:0%
uh particular request is coupled with SB
406

00:47:27.069 --> 00:47:27.079 align:start position:0%
406
 
00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
um which was introduced and has gone
 
00:47:31.710 --> 00:47:31.720 align:start position:0%
through the legislative process which
 
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:36.559 align:start position:0%
was to increase the rates for shelters
 
00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:39.160 align:start position:0%
the legislature and Governor um did
 
00:47:42.589 --> 00:47:42.599 align:start position:0%
appropriate an increase for shelter bed
 
00:47:46.549 --> 00:47:46.559 align:start position:0%
rates through this uh banial budget this
 
00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
will further that rate increase this
 
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
additional amount it was identified
 
00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:54.200 align:start position:0%
through the legislative process for SB
 
00:47:56.990 --> 00:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
406 that these funds could be made
 
00:47:59.309 --> 00:47:59.319 align:start position:0%
available to further increase those
 
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
rates and that is what is before you
 
00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:07.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:11.549 --> 00:48:11.559 align:start position:0%
you Senator Bradley then Senator Rosal
 
00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
so miss Fox is absolutely correct the
 
00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:16.200 align:start position:0%
bed rate
 
00:48:20.069 --> 00:48:20.079 align:start position:0%
was uh I think about $8 we increased it
 
00:48:23.349 --> 00:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
to $20 in the budget last year there was
 
00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
testimony that came in in the hearing
 
00:48:27.549 --> 00:48:27.559 align:start position:0%
process on Senate bill
 
00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:30.520 align:start position:0%
406 um from different shelters that
 
00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
absent a second rate increase to about
 
00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
$27 that shelters would have to close
 
00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:42.040 align:start position:0%
during the summer months um problematic
 
00:48:45.670 --> 00:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
so we in the Senate process and we were
 
00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
all involved in this um amended Senate
 
00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
Bill 406 to um change from a new program
 
00:48:58.950 --> 00:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
to enhanced rates for for uh these beds
 
00:49:01.069 --> 00:49:01.079 align:start position:0%
and in discussion with the governor he
 
00:49:04.069 --> 00:49:04.079 align:start position:0%
thought it was um a good way to fund
 
00:49:06.829 --> 00:49:06.839 align:start position:0%
this and it can be done uh sooner with
 
00:49:08.910 --> 00:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
more certainty through this process
 
00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
which is why I commend uh the department
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
for bringing this forward thank
 
00:49:17.950 --> 00:49:17.960 align:start position:0%
you Senator rosemal thank you Mr
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
chairman um so I sometimes hear rumors
 
00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
about what's going on in
 
00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
Manchester but I think I heard that the
 
00:49:30.510 --> 00:49:30.520 align:start position:0%
city of Manchester
 
00:49:34.309 --> 00:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
decreased its own funding for
 
00:49:38.190 --> 00:49:38.200 align:start position:0%
shelters so could you please tell us to
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
what extent this money is actually
 
00:49:44.430 --> 00:49:44.440 align:start position:0%
increasing shelter
 
00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:47.200 align:start position:0%
funding in Manchester because I also
 
00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
heard that one of the that one of the
 
00:49:52.549 --> 00:49:52.559 align:start position:0%
shelters maybe the biggest one might
 
00:49:54.870 --> 00:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
have to close during this
 
00:49:58.789 --> 00:49:58.799 align:start position:0%
summer so thank for the questions which
 
00:50:01.549 --> 00:50:01.559 align:start position:0%
um I can't answer specifically about the
 
00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
city of Manchester and the level of
 
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
funding that they currently have in any
 
00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:07.640 align:start position:0%
contemplation of a decrease in that
 
00:50:11.109 --> 00:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
amount we do know that Manchester um
 
00:50:13.549 --> 00:50:13.559 align:start position:0%
does have um
 
00:50:18.270 --> 00:50:18.280 align:start position:0%
an burden of many people who are in
 
00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
their City who are um Without Shelter
 
00:50:25.349 --> 00:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
and uh as far as closures go there has
 
00:50:27.030 --> 00:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
been no direct contact with the
 
00:50:30.069 --> 00:50:30.079 align:start position:0%
Department about a potential closure um
 
00:50:32.430 --> 00:50:32.440 align:start position:0%
however we did hear from the shelters
 
00:50:35.309 --> 00:50:35.319 align:start position:0%
through the hearing processes that
 
00:50:38.470 --> 00:50:38.480 align:start position:0%
they're are very they're very concerned
 
00:50:40.789 --> 00:50:40.799 align:start position:0%
about their ability to continue to serve
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
the people that present before them and
 
00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
that they are at capacity in the middle
 
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
of right now they're at capacity uh so
 
00:50:51.789 --> 00:50:51.799 align:start position:0%
this will help uh one of the areas that
 
00:50:54.589 --> 00:50:54.599 align:start position:0%
they have concerns about is to be able
 
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
to maintain staff um um so that they can
 
00:50:59.870 --> 00:50:59.880 align:start position:0%
keep the capacity that they have and
 
00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:03.160 align:start position:0%
have that utilization stay where it's at
 
00:51:05.670 --> 00:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up follow of question
 
00:51:08.430 --> 00:51:08.440 align:start position:0%
um it's really more for commissioner
 
00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:11.630 align:start position:0%
um it's really more for commissioner
Caswell

00:51:11.630 --> 00:51:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:16.109 --> 00:51:16.119 align:start position:0%
um I see that the explanation says if
 
00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
arpa funds are not available General
 
00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:20.720 align:start position:0%
funds will be
 
00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
requested and so my question is will
 
00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
arpa funds be available
 
00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
or are we going to be appropriating
 
00:51:35.589 --> 00:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
General funds I don't have sorry uh I
 
00:51:37.470 --> 00:51:37.480 align:start position:0%
don't have the the item right in front
 
00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
of me um but for these items here we did
 
00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
um ad language that referred to the
 
00:51:48.069 --> 00:51:48.079 align:start position:0%
availability of funding to be
 
00:51:54.030 --> 00:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
reallocated from um oh here we go
 
00:51:57.069 --> 00:51:57.079 align:start position:0%
uh so uh this item and some of the
 
00:51:58.710 --> 00:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
others do have a line there at the
 
00:52:00.589 --> 00:52:00.599 align:start position:0%
beginning that refers to the
 
00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
availability of funding under the arpa
 
00:52:06.349 --> 00:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
sfrf program for reallocation so we are
 
00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:08.440 align:start position:0%
at a point right now where we don't have
 
00:52:11.069 --> 00:52:11.079 align:start position:0%
all the reallocations to be able to fund
 
00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
these projects uh right out of the box
 
00:52:16.630 --> 00:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
but what's happening right now is that
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
um one of the items either you've
 
00:52:22.789 --> 00:52:22.799 align:start position:0%
already approved or um or is coming up
 
00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
extends the spending authorization for a
 
00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
large number of projects that are being
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
funded using arpa dollars there are some
 
00:52:33.470 --> 00:52:33.480 align:start position:0%
other projects that are not going to be
 
00:52:35.349 --> 00:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
extended and at that point those
 
00:52:37.549 --> 00:52:37.559 align:start position:0%
projects and those funds will lapse back
 
00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
to gopher and that's when we'll be able
 
00:52:43.589 --> 00:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
to uh have an idea as to exactly how
 
00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
much funding will be available and then
 
00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
that that would fund these items several
 
00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
of these items that are on this list
 
00:52:53.789 --> 00:52:53.799 align:start position:0%
today follow so I mean we basically are
 
00:52:57.910 --> 00:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
at the point where we're making vending
 
00:53:01.630 --> 00:53:01.640 align:start position:0%
decisions in committee do you know when
 
00:53:05.109 --> 00:53:05.119 align:start position:0%
you will know if oura funds will be
 
00:53:09.870 --> 00:53:09.880 align:start position:0%
available to cover this and there's a I
 
00:53:13.069 --> 00:53:13.079 align:start position:0%
think another item that's larger that
 
00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
yes I could say that we would know uh
 
00:53:18.109 --> 00:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
once we pass the end of the fiscal year
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
exactly which of those uh how much of
 
00:53:21.710 --> 00:53:21.720 align:start position:0%
those funds will be able to be
 
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
reallocated the reason is that the
 
00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
projects that are not going to be
 
00:53:28.109 --> 00:53:28.119 align:start position:0%
extended with their spending Authority
 
00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:29.640 align:start position:0%
and we did this quite deliberately to be
 
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
able to have this room to be able to
 
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:34.720 align:start position:0%
maneuver once before we get to the um
 
00:53:36.349 --> 00:53:36.359 align:start position:0%
the obligation deadline at the end of
 
00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
this year um the uh once we uh those
 
00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
programs will lose their spending
 
00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
Authority but they have between now and
 
00:53:48.589 --> 00:53:48.599 align:start position:0%
then to continue to spend those funds so
 
00:53:51.309 --> 00:53:51.319 align:start position:0%
we don't know exactly what that amount
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
will be until we reach June 30th thank
 
00:53:58.390 --> 00:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
you representative ER for question thank
 
00:54:01.750 --> 00:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair a couple of questions so is
 
00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:04.640 align:start position:0%
this $25 million of ARA funding in
 
00:54:06.829 --> 00:54:06.839 align:start position:0%
addition to the $25 million of ARA
 
00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:14.950 --> 00:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
406 the uh 2.5 million um authorization
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
request here would fund s SP 406 so it's
 
00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:21.720 align:start position:0%
not an addition to it would support that
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
bill follow up and a separate question
 
00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
I assume you have to basically enter
 
00:54:30.309 --> 00:54:30.319 align:start position:0%
into agreements with the various
 
00:54:32.670 --> 00:54:32.680 align:start position:0%
communities that would receive this this
 
00:54:34.990 --> 00:54:35.000 align:start position:0%
boost in the in the funding do you
 
00:54:38.230 --> 00:54:38.240 align:start position:0%
anticipate those being one-time boosts
 
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
in in in the agreements that that's a
 
00:54:44.829 --> 00:54:44.839 align:start position:0%
really good question we do anticipate uh
 
00:54:47.710 --> 00:54:47.720 align:start position:0%
funding providing the funding to the
 
00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
current um contracted shelters and then
 
00:54:55.109 --> 00:54:55.119 align:start position:0%
would um need to through the budget
 
00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
process to maintain those rates need to
 
00:54:59.670 --> 00:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
be request those
 
00:55:02.670 --> 00:55:02.680 align:start position:0%
funds represent Edwards for a question
 
00:55:04.750 --> 00:55:04.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair
 
00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
um I've been generally sympathetic to
 
00:55:10.549 --> 00:55:10.559 align:start position:0%
the request to uh increase funding uh
 
00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
for our homeless shelters and um and
 
00:55:17.309 --> 00:55:17.319 align:start position:0%
I've been doing it on the hope that uh
 
00:55:19.230 --> 00:55:19.240 align:start position:0%
the homeless shelters will be able to
 
00:55:22.029 --> 00:55:22.039 align:start position:0%
continue the transition services that
 
00:55:24.630 --> 00:55:24.640 align:start position:0%
they've been offering during the daytime
 
00:55:26.950 --> 00:55:26.960 align:start position:0%
and uh I had I was concerned concerned
 
00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
when we were told that if they didn't
 
00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
get the money um they one of the things
 
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
that they would ask would be the
 
00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
transition Support Services during the
 
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
day and to me that's sort of the magic
 
00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
sauce of converting a a cot at night to
 
00:55:48.029 --> 00:55:48.039 align:start position:0%
a transition program which would be
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
better so having said all of that now
 
00:55:52.990 --> 00:55:53.000 align:start position:0%
that we're giving the money do we have
 
00:55:57.109 --> 00:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
any um expectations do we have anything
 
00:55:59.870 --> 00:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
uh any assurances really that these
 
00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
transition services are going to remain
 
00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:04.349 align:start position:0%
transition services are going to remain
in

00:56:04.349 --> 00:56:04.359 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
effect again a great question case
 
00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
management is such a key component to
 
00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
this because we want uh people to be
 
00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
engag in services and have these be just
 
00:56:19.789 --> 00:56:19.799 align:start position:0%
very short stays the uh contractors are
 
00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
required to provide those Case
 
00:56:23.829 --> 00:56:23.839 align:start position:0%
Management Services so any contemplation
 
00:56:25.750 --> 00:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
of ending those Services would need to
 
00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
go through through the department and um
 
00:56:33.670 --> 00:56:33.680 align:start position:0%
any negotiation or um for us to take
 
00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:36.510 align:start position:0%
any negotiation or um for us to take
action

00:56:36.510 --> 00:56:36.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
on representative Lehman for a question
 
00:56:41.309 --> 00:56:41.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for taking
 
00:56:45.430 --> 00:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
my question so it says that about 940
 
00:56:48.589 --> 00:56:48.599 align:start position:0%
beds would be uh paid for through these
 
00:56:48.599 --> 00:56:49.710 align:start position:0%
beds would be uh paid for through these
existing

00:56:49.710 --> 00:56:49.720 align:start position:0%
existing
 
00:56:53.390 --> 00:56:53.400 align:start position:0%
contracts how many more do we need I
 
00:56:55.349 --> 00:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
gathered from your response earlier that
 
00:56:57.789 --> 00:56:57.799 align:start position:0%
this is a a shortfall for what's needed
 
00:56:59.829 --> 00:56:59.839 align:start position:0%
out there so I'm just curious if you the
 
00:57:02.670 --> 00:57:02.680 align:start position:0%
department has any idea of the number of
 
00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
shelters beds that are needed for those
 
00:57:06.109 --> 00:57:06.119 align:start position:0%
that are
 
00:57:09.069 --> 00:57:09.079 align:start position:0%
homeless I do not actually have a number
 
00:57:11.309 --> 00:57:11.319 align:start position:0%
to be able to give to you we do know
 
00:57:15.150 --> 00:57:15.160 align:start position:0%
that um capacity is a significant issue
 
00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
across the state but in some communities
 
00:57:21.750 --> 00:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
more so than others um and that
 
00:57:25.309 --> 00:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
typically we have um had to back into
 
00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:28.640 align:start position:0%
the number that we are provided to
 
00:57:30.750 --> 00:57:30.760 align:start position:0%
support these shelters and for the
 
00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
systems to be able to respond to uh
 
00:57:36.910 --> 00:57:36.920 align:start position:0%
requests for proposals uh based on what
 
00:57:39.750 --> 00:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
they think is uh adequate to be able to
 
00:57:42.549 --> 00:57:42.559 align:start position:0%
stand up and maintain those services so
 
00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:46.160 align:start position:0%
I do not have a number um of of what is
 
00:57:48.069 --> 00:57:48.079 align:start position:0%
needed but I know that we're currently
 
00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
at capacity pretty much across the state
 
00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
every day just phip do you have any just
 
00:57:58.950 --> 00:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
a guess I know you you're always very uh
 
00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:01.760 align:start position:0%
tactful as far as your responses but do
 
00:58:04.510 --> 00:58:04.520 align:start position:0%
you have like a a guess that I'll short
 
00:58:08.349 --> 00:58:08.359 align:start position:0%
we are as far as providing shelters well
 
00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:10.200 align:start position:0%
the applications that towns and cities
 
00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
put in there must be a number out there
 
00:58:17.109 --> 00:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
that we do have our um point in time
 
00:58:20.829 --> 00:58:20.839 align:start position:0%
counts and that uh determines how many
 
00:58:23.510 --> 00:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh people who are sheltered um
 
00:58:26.109 --> 00:58:26.119 align:start position:0%
unsheltered Etc and I'd be happy to Prov
 
00:58:27.589 --> 00:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
provide those numbers and then we can
 
00:58:29.630 --> 00:58:29.640 align:start position:0%
see where those match up but there still
 
00:58:32.670 --> 00:58:32.680 align:start position:0%
is a Delta um and as we know right now
 
00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire with housing being so
 
00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
tight it is really difficult um so what
 
00:58:40.510 --> 00:58:40.520 align:start position:0%
our needs are today may be different in
 
00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
a different um economic situation thank
 
00:58:46.029 --> 00:58:46.039 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman further
 
00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:49.880 align:start position:0%
discussion Senator Rosal thank you so
 
00:58:52.270 --> 00:58:52.280 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to get clarity on this
 
00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
we go out of session on June 13th
 
00:58:59.870 --> 00:58:59.880 align:start position:0%
the commissioner um told us that he
 
00:59:01.710 --> 00:59:01.720 align:start position:0%
won't know
 
00:59:05.390 --> 00:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
until after the end of the fiscal year
 
00:59:09.549 --> 00:59:09.559 align:start position:0%
if those arpa funds are available so if
 
00:59:13.870 --> 00:59:13.880 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 406 goes forward and
 
00:59:17.829 --> 00:59:17.839 align:start position:0%
appropriates $2.5 million of General
 
00:59:21.589 --> 00:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
funds and we also
 
00:59:26.190 --> 00:59:26.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate $2.5 million today of arpa
 
00:59:28.510 --> 00:59:28.520 align:start position:0%
and or general
 
00:59:31.589 --> 00:59:31.599 align:start position:0%
funds what would happen is the
 
00:59:37.150 --> 00:59:37.160 align:start position:0%
Department's plan to spend $5 million
 
00:59:40.670 --> 00:59:40.680 align:start position:0%
extra on homeless services
 
00:59:43.510 --> 00:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
or what would happen given the
 
00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:47.230 align:start position:0%
or what would happen given the
legislative

00:59:47.230 --> 00:59:47.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
calendar I can comment if you want
 
00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
Nathan I can sure um so Mike Michael
 
00:59:55.309 --> 00:59:55.319 align:start position:0%
Kane legislative budget assistant so
 
00:59:57.870 --> 00:59:57.880 align:start position:0%
senator rosem sener Bill 406 as it's
 
00:59:59.950 --> 00:59:59.960 align:start position:0%
passed uh is being proposed by house
 
01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
finance uh has an appropriation language
 
01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
in in tiers so first it would be arpa
 
01:00:07.390 --> 01:00:07.400 align:start position:0%
fund $25 million so the governor is
 
01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
first directed to look at arpa funds and
 
01:00:11.510 --> 01:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
then any remainder would be General
 
01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
funds it's not going to be in addition
 
01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:16.280 align:start position:0%
to whatever is approved here if it is
 
01:00:18.829 --> 01:00:18.839 align:start position:0%
approved it will be um that will take
 
01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
the place of that in the event that um
 
01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:24.480 align:start position:0%
this is not approved that and that bill
 
01:00:26.589 --> 01:00:26.599 align:start position:0%
still goes forward there's option at the
 
01:00:28.589 --> 01:00:28.599 align:start position:0%
governor at that point to identify ARA
 
01:00:31.549 --> 01:00:31.559 align:start position:0%
funds or to appropriate General funds so
 
01:00:33.549 --> 01:00:33.559 align:start position:0%
uh how that language is drafted is to
 
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
for 2 and a half million for this entire
 
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
problem total
 
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
yes further
 
01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:43.069 align:start position:0%
yes further

01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
believe moving on to the informational
 
01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
item are there any
 
01:01:39.150 --> 01:01:39.160 align:start position:0%
questions I I'd like to ask one on um
 
01:01:42.270 --> 01:01:42.280 align:start position:0%
the statistics page when we get to that
 
01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
okay is that can you refer I I think
 
01:01:50.589 --> 01:01:50.599 align:start position:0%
it's uh 160 okay 24 160 that'd be the uh
 
01:01:53.349 --> 01:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
operating the dashboard yes
 
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to continue um a theme and
 
01:02:07.589 --> 01:02:07.599 align:start position:0%
that is uh my concern over the sizing of
 
01:02:10.109 --> 01:02:10.119 align:start position:0%
this new new use Services Center
 
01:02:12.870 --> 01:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
replacement we put it at 12 with a
 
01:02:16.269 --> 01:02:16.279 align:start position:0%
maximum capacity at 18 and as I'm
 
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
looking at the average daily
 
01:02:23.029 --> 01:02:23.039 align:start position:0%
sentences uh we are running um 3/4 of a
 
01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:26.520 align:start position:0%
year at 18 or above
 
01:02:28.829 --> 01:02:28.839 align:start position:0%
uh even on those 18 months we had to
 
01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:31.480 align:start position:0%
have days where we were over 18 to in
 
01:02:36.029 --> 01:02:36.039 align:start position:0%
order to average out to be 18 so so so
 
01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
fundamentally I think we have to ask a
 
01:02:42.829 --> 01:02:42.839 align:start position:0%
strategic question did did we under
 
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
siize underestimate the capacity of the
 
01:02:48.829 --> 01:02:48.839 align:start position:0%
replacement Center and if so what's the
 
01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
smartest thing to do about
 
01:02:56.510 --> 01:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
that hello again uh just for the record
 
01:02:58.910 --> 01:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
the census this week is
 
01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:01.720 align:start position:0%
14 just for the record as of yesterday
 
01:03:05.109 --> 01:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
the census was 14 at at at sunon Center
 
01:03:07.470 --> 01:03:07.480 align:start position:0%
so um you know we're looking at the
 
01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
averages uh in the report here and we
 
01:03:13.029 --> 01:03:13.039 align:start position:0%
have seen an increase particularly in uh
 
01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
23 which is different than when you're
 
01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:18.680 align:start position:0%
looking at anything um in 22 and and
 
01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:21.720 align:start position:0%
earlier than that um I think you know we
 
01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
based at the time that we had the
 
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
legislation on what the average was and
 
01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:27.400 align:start position:0%
the aage was around 12 knowing that we
 
01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:29.960 align:start position:0%
could Flex up to 18 we are seeing an
 
01:03:32.109 --> 01:03:32.119 align:start position:0%
increase in the amount of committed
 
01:03:34.349 --> 01:03:34.359 align:start position:0%
children versus detained children there
 
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
so right now more than 50% of that 14 is
 
01:03:40.910 --> 01:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
committed so those kids are there longer
 
01:03:43.269 --> 01:03:43.279 align:start position:0%
so we are working on the system on the
 
01:03:45.910 --> 01:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
back end right now um with all of our
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
stakeholders including the courts to
 
01:03:49.510 --> 01:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
look at why why is that happening why
 
01:03:51.589 --> 01:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
are more kids being committed and and
 
01:03:53.430 --> 01:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
are there other ways to divert them from
 
01:03:56.549 --> 01:03:56.559 align:start position:0%
the system uh rather than the Comm or is
 
01:03:58.829 --> 01:03:58.839 align:start position:0%
it more that more detained and less
 
01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
committed so we're actively engaged
 
01:04:04.269 --> 01:04:04.279 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes to try to systemically
 
01:04:06.029 --> 01:04:06.039 align:start position:0%
look at what's happening there and Trend
 
01:04:08.069 --> 01:04:08.079 align:start position:0%
that in a different direction so it's
 
01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
hard to say did we under bed or over bed
 
01:04:12.109 --> 01:04:12.119 align:start position:0%
we we can only go with the numbers that
 
01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
we've had we know that over the last two
 
01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
years we've had a 50% decrease in kids
 
01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
coming into the system overall in the
 
01:04:22.309 --> 01:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice system not just YDC so
 
01:04:23.549 --> 01:04:23.559 align:start position:0%
we know we're trending in the right
 
01:04:25.470 --> 01:04:25.480 align:start position:0%
direction for that but yet we have seen
 
01:04:28.109 --> 01:04:28.119 align:start position:0%
it increase here so that's you know
 
01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
that's what we're trying to to work at
 
01:04:32.230 --> 01:04:32.240 align:start position:0%
right now and get our hands
 
01:04:37.190 --> 01:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
on followup um so so what I think I just
 
01:04:42.069 --> 01:04:42.079 align:start position:0%
heard you say is that we don't yet think
 
01:04:44.789 --> 01:04:44.799 align:start position:0%
and we may not ever think that we've
 
01:04:48.829 --> 01:04:48.839 align:start position:0%
made a strategic error in uh undersizing
 
01:04:53.069 --> 01:04:53.079 align:start position:0%
the capacity that that we don't know yet
 
01:04:58.109 --> 01:04:58.119 align:start position:0%
uh in if it becomes possible that did um
 
01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
I would encourage you to try to engage
 
01:05:04.349 --> 01:05:04.359 align:start position:0%
the legislature earlier rather than
 
01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:07.079 align:start position:0%
later and to um that that's sort of my
 
01:05:09.589 --> 01:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
concern I I'm as accountable as almost
 
01:05:13.190 --> 01:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
anyone for the sizing of 12 to 18 and so
 
01:05:15.950 --> 01:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
I I'm willing to own it if we undersized
 
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
it but uh I need I need you all to give
 
01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
us the red flashing light if it happens
 
01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:31.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:34.710 --> 01:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
yes did you want to reply oh my reply
 
01:05:37.789 --> 01:05:37.799 align:start position:0%
was will do I'm sorry okay I missed it
 
01:05:40.349 --> 01:05:40.359 align:start position:0%
thank you further further
 
01:05:44.910 --> 01:05:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
dashboard seeing none what other items
 
01:05:49.950 --> 01:05:49.960 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:05:52.190 --> 01:05:52.200 align:start position:0%
information groupings would people like
 
01:05:59.029 --> 01:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:10.230 --> 01:06:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:13.349 --> 01:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
meeting I have a
 
01:06:17.269 --> 01:06:17.279 align:start position:0%
uh I have a county meeting in
 
01:06:21.630 --> 01:06:21.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:27.829 --> 01:06:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:30.589 --> 01:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
however the backup date if we don't get
 
01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
a quorum is the 21st in the morning
 
01:06:37.230 --> 01:06:37.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
Friday that that may never happen but I
 
01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:42.760 align:start position:0%
have to be ready to have it happen if if
 
01:06:44.549 --> 01:06:44.559 align:start position:0%
I don't have a quorum on the
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
19th which is
 
01:06:51.150 --> 01:06:51.160 align:start position:0%
46 State reps so is there any objection
 
01:06:55.789 --> 01:06:55.799 align:start position:0%
to moving it to Thursday the 20th
 
01:06:57.990 --> 01:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
is that a problem for
 
01:07:00.910 --> 01:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
anybody Mr
 
01:07:04.029 --> 01:07:04.039 align:start position:0%
