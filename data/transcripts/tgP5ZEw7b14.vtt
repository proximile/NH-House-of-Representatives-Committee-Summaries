00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:01.839 align:start position:0%
for next week unless your subcommittee
 
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
decides to meet
 
00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm planning
 
00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:14.559 align:start position:0%
an exec for the remaining bills
 
00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
on march 7th which is the monday before
 
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 align:start position:0%
election day
 
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
and the monday before the deadline which
 
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.630 align:start position:0%
and the monday before the deadline which
is

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
all the bills that are in subcommittee
 
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 align:start position:0%
need to be out and ready to go that day
 
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.950 align:start position:0%
need to be out and ready to go that day
so

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 align:start position:0%
get your work done that's it
 
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know how many
 
00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
um senate bills or second committee
 
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
bills will be getting
 
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.389 align:start position:0%
bills will be getting
until

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 align:start position:0%
until
 
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.789 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 align:start position:0%
monday is the state house is closed for
 
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
the holiday
 
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
not unless we don't get very far on
 
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
these two days and they decide at the
 
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
spur of the moment to have one but
 
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 align:start position:0%
i haven't heard anything certainly
 
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 align:start position:0%
no but i would lay money it's going to
 
00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.510 align:start position:0%
no but i would lay money it's going to
be

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 align:start position:0%
the week after the 10th
 
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
i think we'll be on
 
00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
it being one o'clock welcome to edna and
 
00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
i'm opening the public hearing on house
 
00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 align:start position:0%
bill 1135 and call the sponsor
 
00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i'm representative
 
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
sally fellowes from holderness and i'm
 
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
here to introduce hb
 
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.030 align:start position:0%
here to introduce hb
111

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
111
 
00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 align:start position:0%
requiring an audit of education freedom
 
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.790 align:start position:0%
requiring an audit of education freedom
accounts

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
for 30 years i worked at the department
 
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
of education i was involved with audits
 
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
of both federal and state funding
 
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.670 align:start position:0%
of both federal and state funding
programs

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.630 align:start position:0%
programs
and

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 align:start position:0%
this included an lba
 
00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
performance audit of adequacy aid of
 
00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
school districts right after the state
 
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.869 align:start position:0%
school districts right after the state
increased

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 align:start position:0%
increased
 
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
funding and changed the allocation
 
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
formula in response to the claremont
 
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.509 align:start position:0%
formula in response to the claremont
lawsuit

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 align:start position:0%
lawsuit
 
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
so why did i file this bill
 
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
it warrants lba
 
00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
the program warrants lba review because
 
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 align:start position:0%
it is unlike any previous state school
 
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
aid program
 
00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 align:start position:0%
and i've just identified five five ways
 
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
that that it's different and not that
 
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
those are the only way but just to give
 
00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
you a a general overview for those that
 
00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 align:start position:0%
are not
 
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:04.959 align:start position:0%
the state department of education is not
 
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
managing this program it is contracted
 
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 align:start position:0%
out to a private entity the contractor
 
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
keeps 10 percent of each student's
 
00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.390 align:start position:0%
keeps 10 percent of each student's
allocation

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
allocation
 
00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 align:start position:0%
and parents can utilize ninety percent
 
00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:19.759 align:start position:0%
the more students that sign up the more
 
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
money the contractor will make
 
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 align:start position:0%
school districts expend a hundred
 
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
percent of their adequacy aid in the
 
00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 align:start position:0%
year they receive it
 
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
with efas education freedom accounts
 
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 align:start position:0%
the full
 
00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:37.759 align:start position:0%
allocation goes to the contractor
 
00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 align:start position:0%
in payments for payments throughout the
 
00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:41.670 align:start position:0%
in payments for payments throughout the
year

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
but parents need not expend their share
 
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
each year
 
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
they can delay spending any of
 
00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
the their allocation for years and let
 
00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
it accumulate in their account
 
00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
so it's important to understand how the
 
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
cash will be managed by the contractor
 
00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
will the contractor keep it in banks
 
00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:03.670 align:start position:0%
will the contractor keep it in banks
stock

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 align:start position:0%

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:10.150 align:start position:0%

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 align:start position:0%
the payouts for this program
 
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 align:start position:0%
range between approximately four hundred
 
00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
four thousand and eight thousand dollars
 
00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 align:start position:0%
per student each year
 
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
this is a significant amount of money
 
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
and can be an enticement for fraudulent
 
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.110 align:start position:0%
and can be an enticement for fraudulent
claims

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
claims
 
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
does nhdoe or the contractor have
 
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
sufficient safeguards in place to
 
00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:34.639 align:start position:0%
prevent fraud
 
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
i think it's it will be very important
 
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
and also very difficult to verify that
 
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
all recipients are and continue to be
 
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
while some of the efa efa students will
 
00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 align:start position:0%
be attending private schools many will
 
00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:53.830 align:start position:0%
be attending private schools many will
not

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
parents are required to provide annual
 
00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
test results
 
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
of a test of their
 
00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319 align:start position:0%
choosing they can
 
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
select from a list that has several
 
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.469 align:start position:0%
select from a list that has several
options

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
options
 
00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
or a statement that a teacher has
 
00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
reviewed a student portfolio
 
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
but there are no benchmarks or minimum
 
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
report performance requirements for
 
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
continued funding
 
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
so how will the contractor verify that
 
00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:28.639 align:start position:0%
maybe the most important reason
 
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 align:start position:0%
for this audit is that we have no idea
 
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
how much this program will cost going
 
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.670 align:start position:0%
how much this program will cost going
forward

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
we don't even have a good idea of who is
 
00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:41.759 align:start position:0%
participating in the program
 
00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
nhdoe the
 
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
state department of education estimated
 
00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
before the
 
00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
this legislation was passed that 50
 
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
students would participate less than 50
 
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
students would participate in the first
 
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.070 align:start position:0%
students would participate in the first
year

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
but as of last new november enrollment
 
00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
was over 1600 and i believe that there
 
00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
have been several hundred more students
 
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
that have enrolled since then
 
00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
to understand future costs we need to
 
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
understand who is participating
 
00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
that's why i included
 
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
in the bill
 
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
an analysis of the demographic data of
 
00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
the students that are participating in
 
00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
the program
 
00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
so we need this performance audit to
 
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
ensure that state funds are being
 
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
appropriately managed because because
 
00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:32.479 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a potential we're
 
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
talking about eight million dollars
 
00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
already for this current year and it
 
00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
could well be a lot more in the future
 
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
so um i'll answer any questions you have
 
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
i am chris shea who is the deputy lba
 
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
the deputy legislative budget assistant
 
00:07:54.869 --> 00:07:54.879 align:start position:0%
is also here and he can
 
00:07:57.029 --> 00:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
answer questions for you about the
 
00:07:59.670 --> 00:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
particulars of how a performance audit
 
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
functions but if you have any questions
 
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lackas has a
 
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
question thank you um
 
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:16.790 --> 00:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
there was created as part of it a
 
00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:18.879 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
which is supposed to monitor what's
 
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
going on with the program is that
 
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
you know how would that interact with
 
00:08:25.589 --> 00:08:25.599 align:start position:0%
this plus i think there may have been an
 
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
auditing requirement
 
00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:29.919 align:start position:0%
in the original uh bill as well although
 
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know the details are you
 
00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
familiar with that
 
00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
so the original bill did not have any
 
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
requirement for an lba audit i don't
 
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
think i don't think ever
 
00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:43.519 align:start position:0%
does a bill
 
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
you know yeah i didn't say lba so well
 
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
this is an lba audit
 
00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.870 align:start position:0%
this is an lba audit
so

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
it can cover the things that are
 
00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:54.959 align:start position:0%
addressed in this bill and and
 
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
potentially other things
 
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
there the bill does specify that the
 
00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
report goes to i think it says finance
 
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
it goes to that oversight committee that
 
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
you're talking about department of
 
00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
education but
 
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
but audits are
 
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.230 align:start position:0%
but audits are
also

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
after they're reviewed well i'll let
 
00:09:19.269 --> 00:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
um okay thank you chris shea
 
00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:20.150 align:start position:0%
um okay thank you chris shea
just

00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
tell you what happens with the audits
 
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
i will mention that edna
 
00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
normal always gets performance audits
 
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:32.720 align:start position:0%
and it is part of our duty to
 
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
look at them and see if they need
 
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
further action by the legislature
 
00:09:39.269 --> 00:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
sometimes they do sometimes they don't
 
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
we haven't done very many in the last
 
00:09:46.389 --> 00:09:46.399 align:start position:0%
few years kovan being one reason
 
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
but we are also
 
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
in the people that read and
 
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
review if not approved performance
 
00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
audits representative had a question no
 
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
okay representative scitec
 
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
hi hi representative fellows i'm
 
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
interested in your point four and your
 
00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh handout and you say that many will
 
00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:09.839 align:start position:0%
attend private schools many will not
 
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
where are they where are those people
 
00:10:13.269 --> 00:10:13.279 align:start position:0%
are they home schools is that what that
 
00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:14.389 align:start position:0%
are they home schools is that what that
means

00:10:14.389 --> 00:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
means
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
so that that's one of the questions so
 
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
if you look at if you turn your page
 
00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:19.990 align:start position:0%
if you look at if you turn your page
over

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
you'll see
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
this report so this is this is the first
 
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
page of a report that was produced in
 
00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:29.839 align:start position:0%
november about the program um there are
 
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
a couple more pages that i didn't bring
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
the the other the pages that i did not
 
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
include are tells you exactly what town
 
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
the students live in
 
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
but this is a summary and if you look at
 
00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:47.839 align:start position:0%
the block that's right here
 
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
this this tells you that
 
00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:51.590 align:start position:0%
this this tells you that
they

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
the department of education knows where
 
00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
came from and from came from i mean did
 
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
they come from
 
00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:06.399 align:start position:0%
public schools or did they
 
00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:08.320 align:start position:0%
were they ever in public schools that's
 
00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
what it tells you
 
00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:10.790 align:start position:0%
what it tells you
so

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
it tells us this tells us that 57
 
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
percent of the students
 
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.150 align:start position:0%
percent of the students
that

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.350 align:start position:0%
that
that

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
signed up at the beginning of the 1600
 
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
that 70 percent of them have never been
 
00:11:27.509 --> 00:11:27.519 align:start position:0%
enrolled in public schools in new
 
00:11:27.519 --> 00:11:28.389 align:start position:0%
enrolled in public schools in new
hampshire

00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
so who so where are they they could be
 
00:11:33.269 --> 00:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
home school students
 
00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
they could be private school students
 
00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:38.240 align:start position:0%
they could be a few of them can be
 
00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
kindergartners but not very many because
 
00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
there's a block down here that tells you
 
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
how many students from each grade
 
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
so that's one of the one of the issues
 
00:11:50.069 --> 00:11:50.079 align:start position:0%
did people
 
00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
you know just think of what could be
 
00:11:54.629 --> 00:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
happening did people move from out of
 
00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
state in new ham into new hampshire
 
00:11:59.750 --> 00:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
so they could utilize this program
 
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
where they're people who
 
00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of potential fraud
 
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
there are plenty of people who own
 
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:14.949 --> 00:12:14.959 align:start position:0%
change their residency to say we'll call
 
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
this our regular home so we can
 
00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
get you know
 
00:12:21.829 --> 00:12:21.839 align:start position:0%
you know four six eight thousand dollars
 
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
a year to send our kid to a private
 
00:12:25.269 --> 00:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
school who's
 
00:12:27.190 --> 00:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
maybe they're already going to that
 
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
private school so that's that's why we
 
00:12:33.509 --> 00:12:33.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:35.839 align:start position:0%
thank you is that a follow-up yeah
 
00:12:37.509 --> 00:12:37.519 align:start position:0%
we're getting dangerously close to the
 
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
weeds so i'll stop here thank you
 
00:12:41.910 --> 00:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
other questions for representative
 
00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.230 align:start position:0%
other questions for representative
fellows

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
fellows
 
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
okay not seeing any thank you
 
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.030 align:start position:0%
okay not seeing any thank you
um

um
 
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
you'll need a pink card representing
 
00:12:54.880 --> 00:13:04.230 align:start position:0%
you'll need a pink card representing
fellows

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:06.959 align:start position:0%

deputy legislative budget assistant um
 
00:13:47.189 --> 00:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
i've worked for the lba for since 1996
 
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
the first 10 years of working with the
 
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
lba i was working in performance audits
 
00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
since then i've come over to the budget
 
00:13:55.189 --> 00:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
side and have worked on the budget and
 
00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
financial issues as it relates to
 
00:13:59.750 --> 00:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
legislation and other issues within the
 
00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.350 align:start position:0%
legislation and other issues within the
branch

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
branch
 
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
so today i was asked to come and just
 
00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
speak with you at a high level as to
 
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
what a performance audit is and how it
 
00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:09.519 align:start position:0%
kind of comes to be
 
00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
performance audits are
 
00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
the the topic matter is controlled or
 
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
com is provided by the legislative
 
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
performance audit oversight committee
 
00:14:20.069 --> 00:14:20.079 align:start position:0%
that's a 10 person committee it's five
 
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
house members and five senators
 
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
they will come up with a topic
 
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
discuss it with our audit group
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
our audit group will take that topic
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
and they will scope it and scope it just
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
basically means they're going to take a
 
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
look at what information might be out
 
00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
there related to the area that the
 
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:40.240 align:start position:0%
committee would like to have audited and
 
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
they come back with a report to the
 
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
legislative performance audit committee
 
00:14:46.629 --> 00:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
to indicate what they believe an audit
 
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
could accomplish for that particular
 
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
topic area if the committee agrees with
 
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
you know what the scope statement is or
 
00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
or what the question is
 
00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
then they move forward if they need to
 
00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
refine it then our auditors would work
 
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
with them and refine the question to
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
make sure they can get at a
 
00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
good audit essentially once the
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
legislative performance audit site
 
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
committee agrees on the question they
 
00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
need to present it to the fiscal
 
00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
committee for approval
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
so fiscal committee will approve the
 
00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:13.509 align:start position:0%
so fiscal committee will approve the
topic

00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:13.519 align:start position:0%
topic
 
00:15:15.189 --> 00:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
and once that's approved our auditors
 
00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
will go out and conduct the audit
 
00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
audits can take
 
00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
several months to half a year
 
00:15:23.509 --> 00:15:23.519 align:start position:0%
depending on the size and scope of a
 
00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
performance audit
 
00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes they might be you know review
 
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
a division for efficiency and
 
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
effectiveness which is typically the
 
00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
the words that we associate with a
 
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:34.160 align:start position:0%
performance audit
 
00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:37.279 align:start position:0%
we can also do compliance as well
 
00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
our auditors follow
 
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
government auditing standards
 
00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
you may have heard if you're familiar
 
00:15:43.829 --> 00:15:43.839 align:start position:0%
with auditing at all you may have heard
 
00:15:46.389 --> 00:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
the term yellow book which is the
 
00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
book put out that they follow
 
00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:51.440 align:start position:0%
once the auditors finish their report
 
00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:52.959 align:start position:0%
they bring it back to the fiscal
 
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
committee who will accept the report and
 
00:15:57.269 --> 00:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
it will be distributed and as the chair
 
00:15:59.670 --> 00:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
indicated many times performance audit
 
00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
reports will come back before the edna
 
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
committee in the house
 
00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839 align:start position:0%
with a presentation from our audit staff
 
00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
to just let you know what they had done
 
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
and what their conclusions were as a
 
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
result of the audit
 
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
so that's a kind of a high level
 
00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:14.959 align:start position:0%
um indication of what occurs with the
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
audit there's recommendations it's very
 
00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:18.310 align:start position:0%
audit there's recommendations it's very
um

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:20.720 align:start position:0%
involved with the agencies you know
 
00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of interviews um there may
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
be surveys there will be data reviews
 
00:16:26.079 --> 00:16:27.269 align:start position:0%
be surveys there will be data reviews
um

00:16:27.269 --> 00:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
collaborative with the agency but we do
 
00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
control the audit
 
00:16:32.399 --> 00:16:35.110 align:start position:0%
control the audit
um

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:37.749 --> 00:16:37.759 align:start position:0%
and just if if i can take a step back
 
00:16:39.269 --> 00:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
representative lucas had a question
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
about how our auditors might
 
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
interact or associate with a the
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
advisory commission that's in the bill
 
00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh the original bill that set up the
 
00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.430 align:start position:0%
uh the original bill that set up the
efas

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
efas
 
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
they would they would have um interviews
 
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
and and and probably consult with them
 
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
to see what that commission has done and
 
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
are they meeting what the um
 
00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
the function or charge was for that
 
00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.670 align:start position:0%
the function or charge was for that
group

00:16:59.670 --> 00:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
group
 
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
at this point um
 
00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
this is a fairly new program um
 
00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
our auditors would probably look at more
 
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
of a compliance aspect at this point you
 
00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
know did the program get implemented as
 
00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:13.839 align:start position:0%
the law had indicated and probably less
 
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
on efficiency and effectiveness just
 
00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:16.959 align:start position:0%
because there wouldn't be a lot of data
 
00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.079 align:start position:0%
related to that at this time
 
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
so happy to try to field any questions
 
00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:25.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
representative shut and then psychic
 
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr shea thank you for
 
00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
coming to edna
 
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll get to see you again
 
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
you kind of
 
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
quickly glanced over the topic that the
 
00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
commission or committee that
 
00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
works with you
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
comes up with a topic
 
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
how does that work how do they get
 
00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:51.750 align:start position:0%
how does that work how do they get
topics

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
topics
 
00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
the legislative performance audit and
 
00:17:54.789 --> 00:17:54.799 align:start position:0%
oversight committee
 
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
may come in the members may come in with
 
00:17:58.710 --> 00:17:58.720 align:start position:0%
their own ideas
 
00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
you as members of the house and senate
 
00:18:02.789 --> 00:18:02.799 align:start position:0%
could also come and present an idea to
 
00:18:03.909 --> 00:18:03.919 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:18:06.070 --> 00:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
um our auditors may come forward with
 
00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
suggestions if directed by the chair of
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
that committee
 
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.190 align:start position:0%
that committee
um

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:12.549 --> 00:18:12.559 align:start position:0%
you know it
 
00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:13.919 align:start position:0%
there's a variety of ways that they can
 
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
come forward and what the committee
 
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
would do is debate the topics and and
 
00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
rank as to what they feel are the most
 
00:18:21.909 --> 00:18:21.919 align:start position:0%
important ideas that they'd want to have
 
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
audited typically they give our audit
 
00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:25.590 align:start position:0%
audited typically they give our audit
shop

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
shop
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
two three four topics to kind of have in
 
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
the queue
 
00:18:30.470 --> 00:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
and then when we come back and meet with
 
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.430 align:start position:0%
and then when we come back and meet with
them

00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
you know they might adjust the order of
 
00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
those audits that they the priority
 
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
might change or maybe something new has
 
00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
has come up in discussions through
 
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
committee's work or uh you know through
 
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799 align:start position:0%
the press that's maybe there's a topic
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
matter like we really need to look at
 
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
this agency because there's a lot of
 
00:18:47.510 --> 00:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
things going on
 
00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
um so so there's some fluidity to it but
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
our auditors will start an audit and
 
00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:52.799 align:start position:0%
work it through to the end unless
 
00:18:55.669 --> 00:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
directed to stop it um and that's not
 
00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
that doesn't happen very often
 
00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
that's a more of a
 
00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:03.830 align:start position:0%
that's a more of a
representative

00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr shea i don't know why i
 
00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:11.669 --> 00:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
representative excuse me mr shea have
 
00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
you looked at the uh
 
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
representative fellow's list of uh her
 
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
five uh
 
00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
i i hadn't before this moment no i she
 
00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
handed it to me i didn't look at it i
 
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
was listening to when she read it well
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
if you had my question would have been
 
00:19:35.909 --> 00:19:35.919 align:start position:0%
are they fit top would they be addressed
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
by an lba audit
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
if i had i would have answered they may
 
00:19:42.549 --> 00:19:42.559 align:start position:0%
or may not be depending on if the
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
information is available thanks so at
 
00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
this point as i stated that um our
 
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
auditors would scope
 
00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
the topic matter
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
um you know in the bill itself there's
 
00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
um eight seven points that are being
 
00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
asked to be addressed we may not be able
 
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
to address all of those in an audit at
 
00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
this point because there just may not be
 
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
information i think what reps and
 
00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
fellows is uh indicated in her five
 
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
points or some some potential risk areas
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
our auditors might come back and
 
00:20:11.590 --> 00:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
indicate there may be there may be a
 
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
need for more controls or discussion for
 
00:20:15.669 --> 00:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
controls in certain areas but i'm not
 
00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
sure at this point they'd have a lot of
 
00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
data to say that it's occurring or not
 
00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.070 align:start position:0%
data to say that it's occurring or not
occurring

00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
occurring
 
00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative leckus
 
00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
this is kind of a a process question i
 
00:20:29.029 --> 00:20:29.039 align:start position:0%
don't know if you'd be better or the
 
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
chair would be better to answer it
 
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
and you mentioned that you get your
 
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
the audits that you do from um the audit
 
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
committee and then finance reviews them
 
00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
um so i guess the question is if we were
 
00:20:44.549 --> 00:20:44.559 align:start position:0%
to pass this bill what would it really
 
00:20:44.559 --> 00:20:45.830 align:start position:0%
to pass this bill what would it really
do

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
so it's just a hint to the audit
 
00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:48.559 align:start position:0%
committee or
 
00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
uh so if you pass this bill it would be
 
00:20:51.669 --> 00:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
in legislation that we would do this
 
00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
audit okay so that
 
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
um at this point there's not a time
 
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
associated with it so i would
 
00:20:59.830 --> 00:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
suggest that our auditors would complete
 
00:21:01.029 --> 00:21:01.039 align:start position:0%
audits that are in the queue at the
 
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
moment and put this
 
00:21:04.149 --> 00:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
you know in the list of audits to
 
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
complete but it wouldn't be up for
 
00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
discussion necessarily because the full
 
00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
body has passed it
 
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
um so it it removes the
 
00:21:14.149 --> 00:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
the legislative performance audit
 
00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
oversight's ability to set the topics
 
00:21:18.630 --> 00:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
though it does ask the
 
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
audit group to come back and present the
 
00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:22.640 align:start position:0%
scope to them so that they can at least
 
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
review whatever
 
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
direction we might be headed with an
 
00:21:27.909 --> 00:21:27.919 align:start position:0%
audit okay thank you
 
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we cover the points
 
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
that are maybe contained in the bill
 
00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other questions
 
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:21:40.149 --> 00:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
i've now you said that i just was
 
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
looking at the bottom the effective date
 
00:21:45.669 --> 00:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
shall take effect july 1st 2022.
 
00:21:45.679 --> 00:21:46.470 align:start position:0%
shall take effect july 1st 2022.
so

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
anything that's in the queue as of that
 
00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
date forward you would
 
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
put it in from there
 
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
correct yes i so
 
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
this bill would take effect then it
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that the audit needs to take
 
00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
happen at that point so i would suggest
 
00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:01.830 align:start position:0%
happen at that point so i would suggest
and

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
having not talked to the director of
 
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
audits about this but i would suggest
 
00:22:06.549 --> 00:22:06.559 align:start position:0%
that they would probably add it to the
 
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
queue that the performance audit
 
00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:09.039 align:start position:0%
oversight has already given them a
 
00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
couple of topics to work on they would
 
00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
add this this to it the other thing is
 
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
they probably wouldn't want to engage in
 
00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:15.510 align:start position:0%
they probably wouldn't want to engage in
this

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh before at least the full year has has
 
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
gone by
 
00:22:20.070 --> 00:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
so it probably wouldn't be before the
 
00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
fall before they would even consider the
 
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
topic to give it a full year that's
 
00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
where i was going with that so it'd be
 
00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
another full year in the uh so you'd
 
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
have the first
 
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
you'd have since last
 
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
fall through this upcoming fall
 
00:22:33.590 --> 00:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
potentially to look at so one
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
one year 12 months
 
00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
we typically like to look at it in in
 
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal years
 
00:22:41.270 --> 00:22:41.280 align:start position:0%
but we it doesn't necessarily have to be
 
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
that way we would give a time frame for
 
00:22:44.789 --> 00:22:44.799 align:start position:0%
what we were looking at
 
00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
representative allegra
 
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
thank you so i uh
 
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
that was a good description of procedure
 
00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
but i'm still not clear on what a
 
00:22:58.149 --> 00:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
performance audit is
 
00:22:59.909 --> 00:22:59.919 align:start position:0%
is it just a uh
 
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
a financial and procedural audit or is
 
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
it actually auditing
 
00:23:07.029 --> 00:23:07.039 align:start position:0%
uh the performance that the institution
 
00:23:10.149 --> 00:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
is intended to uh to undertake
 
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
it would be more of the latter so the
 
00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
performance audit typically looks at
 
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
efficiency and effectiveness of a
 
00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
program or a
 
00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:18.470 align:start position:0%
program or a
process

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
we would look to make sure that statutes
 
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
best practices things like that are
 
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
being followed and have been implemented
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
we would make suggestions on how to
 
00:23:30.149 --> 00:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
maybe make improvements around that
 
00:23:31.909 --> 00:23:31.919 align:start position:0%
we would include
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
maybe budgetary numbers but they
 
00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be audited financials and we
 
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
have a finance side that does the
 
00:23:39.029 --> 00:23:39.039 align:start position:0%
financials for
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
state agencies follow-up
 
00:23:44.070 --> 00:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
so there are performance audience
 
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
currently being performed for the public
 
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
school system is that the case and
 
00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:50.000 align:start position:0%
how are they measuring up are they
 
00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
meeting performance standards
 
00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:54.559 align:start position:0%
so i'm sorry repeat that first part i i
 
00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
assume there are performance uh audits
 
00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh taking place with public schools
 
00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
and if so
 
00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
are they measuring up to performance
 
00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:04.710 align:start position:0%
are they measuring up to performance
standards

00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:05.430 align:start position:0%
standards
um

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
just some background information yeah so
 
00:24:07.279 --> 00:24:07.909 align:start position:0%
just some background information yeah so
i

00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:07.919 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
we we audit state agencies so we
 
00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily go into the public
 
00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.390 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily go into the public
schools

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:12.400 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
if they are having audits typically
 
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
their financial audits they may have
 
00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
other types of reviews but we're
 
00:24:18.789 --> 00:24:18.799 align:start position:0%
typically auditing state agencies and
 
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
the implementation of programs that
 
00:24:21.669 --> 00:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
they're charged with
 
00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
we have the ability to audit um
 
00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
entities that receive state funds
 
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
but we're limited in the in the number
 
00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
of those that we can do in a five-year
 
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
period and it's five so we don't
 
00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
typically go outside of the state
 
00:24:36.549 --> 00:24:36.559 align:start position:0%
agencies because we can
 
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
we have more than enough work with the
 
00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:39.190 align:start position:0%
we have more than enough work with the
audits

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
audits
 
00:24:40.789 --> 00:24:40.799 align:start position:0%
group that we have trying to get those
 
00:24:40.799 --> 00:24:41.990 align:start position:0%
group that we have trying to get those
done

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
so this bill i'm sorry one more
 
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up so this bill would actually
 
00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.269 align:start position:0%
follow-up so this bill would actually
require

00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
require
 
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
an additional or higher standard
 
00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
than what the public schools are
 
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
undergoing is that the case if they're
 
00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:54.799 align:start position:0%
not undergoing performance standards
 
00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
like this um i can't speak to public
 
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
schools and and what they might be
 
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
well educated in i guess and or have a
 
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
good handle on
 
00:25:07.830 --> 00:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
what i would say is that what we would
 
00:25:09.909 --> 00:25:09.919 align:start position:0%
be doing is going into
 
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
the department of education and
 
00:25:13.269 --> 00:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
determining how they've implemented this
 
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
program in determining whether it was
 
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
done as the law directed
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
were there some things that maybe
 
00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
didn't happen or could be happening that
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
would make it better and we would
 
00:25:25.029 --> 00:25:25.039 align:start position:0%
comment on that the agency would have an
 
00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide a response to
 
00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:28.240 align:start position:0%
that and then the report would be issued
 
00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
to the fiscal committee and then
 
00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
disseminated to the members
 
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:34.870 --> 00:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
if anyone is not familiar with
 
00:25:37.430 --> 00:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
performance audits there's a nice stack
 
00:25:38.789 --> 00:25:38.799 align:start position:0%
of of them
 
00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
on my desk in outside room 306 you're
 
00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
more than welcome to rummage through and
 
00:25:46.870 --> 00:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
and pick some out there's also financial
 
00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
audits there too which are
 
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
which are which are totally different
 
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
and everything can be found on our
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
website as well so if you're interested
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
in an audit or see if an agency's had
 
00:25:58.710 --> 00:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
any financial and or performance audit
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
conducted you would find it on our
 
00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:04.310 align:start position:0%
conducted you would find it on our
website

00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien
 
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam sheriff
 
00:26:11.350 --> 00:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
i thank representative allegro because
 
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
it got me thinking i mean the big
 
00:26:15.430 --> 00:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
difference here from what i understand
 
00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
this is going to make sure on a vulture
 
00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
type of program where the individual the
 
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
money is going to go to the individual
 
00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:22.470 align:start position:0%
money is going to go to the individual
student

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
student
 
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
whereas let's say in the example of
 
00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.549 align:start position:0%
whereas let's say in the example of
municipality

00:26:26.549 --> 00:26:26.559 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
debt is figured by a municipal budget
 
00:26:31.269 --> 00:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
superseded by their particular governing
 
00:26:33.909 --> 00:26:33.919 align:start position:0%
board of that particular community uh
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
watching so there's a great difference
 
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
in other words there's nobody watching
 
00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
the hen house and this is probably
 
00:26:41.909 --> 00:26:41.919 align:start position:0%
what's the nexus of this
 
00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
particular uh asking you to look at this
 
00:26:46.789 --> 00:26:46.799 align:start position:0%
particular audit correct
 
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
this would just be another look at the
 
00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
hen house i think that in the bill
 
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
itself there was a an advisory
 
00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:54.799 align:start position:0%
commission set up to review
 
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
um one issue report once a year in
 
00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
review of the program but i think what
 
00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:00.799 align:start position:0%
represent fellows has indicated in her
 
00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
five points is that there there may be
 
00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:03.830 align:start position:0%
five points is that there there may be
some

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
potential for things to happen if we
 
00:27:07.510 --> 00:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
don't keep an eye on it in terms of
 
00:27:09.029 --> 00:27:09.039 align:start position:0%
fraud or some other
 
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
issues with the money but we can't say
 
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
that at this time and and without having
 
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
conducted an audit but again an audit at
 
00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
this point would be
 
00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:19.919 align:start position:0%
limited to you know a period of of a
 
00:27:21.669 --> 00:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
year or less and we probably would be
 
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
limited to really looking at um
 
00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
compliance you know was the program set
 
00:27:27.669 --> 00:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
up the way the legislature intended did
 
00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
the department of education
 
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
do the pieces that they were required to
 
00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:32.389 align:start position:0%
do the pieces that they were required to
do

00:27:32.389 --> 00:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
and is there elements of it that are
 
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
related to the scholarship organization
 
00:27:38.789 --> 00:27:38.799 align:start position:0%
that's running the program or they have
 
00:27:40.549 --> 00:27:40.559 align:start position:0%
they done what they should do as it
 
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
relates to the law but it may not
 
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily be an audit of the detail
 
00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
behind that at this point just because
 
00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
of timing but again that would be up to
 
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
our auditors to assess when they get
 
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
into it i would say this is
 
00:27:54.549 --> 00:27:54.559 align:start position:0%
intended to be more an audit of the
 
00:27:56.789 --> 00:27:56.799 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization than of
 
00:27:58.149 --> 00:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
00:27:59.909 --> 00:27:59.919 align:start position:0%
would that be a correct assumption of
 
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
how it operates and what and what it
 
00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:07.669 align:start position:0%
how it operates and what and what it
produces

00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:09.110 --> 00:28:09.120 align:start position:0%
i mean you're the only one who could
 
00:28:11.909 --> 00:28:11.919 align:start position:0%
speak is too intense yeah so i think the
 
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
part that's
 
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
that's so different about this program
 
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
compared to
 
00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
other education funding
 
00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
strategies that we've had is that it's
 
00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
being done by a contractor
 
00:28:28.149 --> 00:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
so you don't have the same kind of you
 
00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
know when i was at the department of
 
00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:30.789 align:start position:0%
know when i was at the department of
education

00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:30.799 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:28:32.549 --> 00:28:32.559 align:start position:0%
multiple people
 
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
could see what everyone else was doing
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
and and we had a pretty good sense of
 
00:28:39.269 --> 00:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
like what kind of controls that we had
 
00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
but this is different
 
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
and so we want to make sure we're not
 
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
the oba doesn't look for fraud what
 
00:28:50.789 --> 00:28:50.799 align:start position:0%
they're looking for is procedures
 
00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
that will prevent that from happening
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
and so that's what thank you i think i
 
00:28:57.510 --> 00:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
think that's that's the answer to my
 
00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:59.750 align:start position:0%
think that's that's the answer to my
question

00:28:59.750 --> 00:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:08.320 align:start position:0%
i don't see any thank you for for uh
 
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
coming to talk to us well you're welcome
 
00:29:11.669 --> 00:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
and if anybody you know thinks of
 
00:29:13.350 --> 00:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
anything after this meeting and would
 
00:29:15.029 --> 00:29:15.039 align:start position:0%
like to contact me at my office feel
 
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
free to do so
 
00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:18.230 align:start position:0%
free to do so
okay

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
is there any other member of the public
 
00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:25.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
all right not seeing any i will close
 
00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
the public hearing
 
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.350 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
and we have 20 minutes before our
 
00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:40.720 align:start position:0%
next hearing
 
00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
and if someone if we want to go into
 
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
executive session
 
00:29:47.669 --> 00:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
is that agreeable
 
00:29:47.679 --> 00:29:49.510 align:start position:0%
is that agreeable
okay

00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:52.870 align:start position:0%
okay
representative

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:55.909 --> 00:29:55.919 align:start position:0%
goalie i think you had a comment on a
 
00:29:58.549 --> 00:29:58.559 align:start position:0%
motion on house bill 1287 sleep
 
00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:08.789 --> 00:30:08.799 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:30:12.149 --> 00:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
i will move inexpedient to legislate
 
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
is there a second second
 
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
okay representative goalie moves in
 
00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate
 
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
and represent grodus seconds it
 
00:30:24.149 --> 00:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
would you care to speak to your motion
 
00:30:24.159 --> 00:30:25.269 align:start position:0%
would you care to speak to your motion
yes

00:30:25.269 --> 00:30:25.279 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:31.669 align:start position:0%
 
putting

00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
putting
 
00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
naming months days weeks into statute
 
00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
i i don't think
 
00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
a purpose is served by putting it in one
 
00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
time and then having it in there
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
perpetually without
 
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
having an organization coming forward
 
00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:49.269 align:start position:0%
having an organization coming forward
and

00:30:49.269 --> 00:30:49.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
fighting for their cause on an annual
 
00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.149 align:start position:0%
fighting for their cause on an annual
basis

00:30:52.149 --> 00:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
basis
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
and i think it's
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
more effective having those groups
 
00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
go to the governor
 
00:30:59.830 --> 00:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
for a proclamation
 
00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
on a yearly basis for what they truly
 
00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
feel is worthy of being observed
 
00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
so for that reason i move in expedient
 
00:31:10.149 --> 00:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
to legislate thank you representative
 
00:31:10.159 --> 00:31:11.509 align:start position:0%
to legislate thank you representative
perrotta

00:31:11.509 --> 00:31:11.519 align:start position:0%
perrotta
 
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
00:31:16.549 --> 00:31:16.559 align:start position:0%
succinctly and thoroughly explained the
 
00:31:16.559 --> 00:31:18.230 align:start position:0%
succinctly and thoroughly explained the
position

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:19.760 align:start position:0%

yes representative schuett i have an
amendment

00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
to house bill 1330 if you think we have
 
00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
time no
 
00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
no 1330 is going to be more contentious
 
00:33:16.149 --> 00:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
we don't have a full house i only want
 
00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
to do bills that are going to go on
 
00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.269 align:start position:0%
to do bills that are going to go on
consent

00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
consent
 
00:33:21.029 --> 00:33:21.039 align:start position:0%
all right um
 
00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
how about house bill 1446
 
00:33:37.909 --> 00:33:37.919 align:start position:0%
uh the governing board of recreational
 
00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:40.559 align:start position:0%
therapists and uh respiratory care
 
00:33:40.559 --> 00:33:43.509 align:start position:0%
therapists and uh respiratory care
practitioners

00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:46.310 --> 00:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
okay i'll i'll second that
 
00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
that's ought to pass
 
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
ought to pass yes okay
 
00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
this is house bill 1446 the governoring
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
board of recreational therapists and
 
00:34:00.389 --> 00:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
uh respiratory respiratory therapists
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
yes it's uh this this again was um i'm
 
00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
hoping you recognize me to speak to my
 
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
motion please speak to your motion
 
00:34:13.349 --> 00:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
this again was making these two builds
 
00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
two boards
 
00:34:17.030 --> 00:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
advisory only
 
00:34:20.069 --> 00:34:20.079 align:start position:0%
and i did go through
 
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
what the executive director of oplc had
 
00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
originally drafted
 
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
and included my favorite phrase in
 
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
consultation with the advisory board
 
00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
at all aspects
 
00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.270 align:start position:0%
at all aspects
that

00:34:33.270 --> 00:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
would involve
 
00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
expertise from the board members
 
00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
and that leaves her to just take care of
 
00:34:42.790 --> 00:34:42.800 align:start position:0%
the administrative duties
 
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
i think if you look through the bill you
 
00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
will see
 
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
those that phrase added where i felt it
 
00:34:51.829 --> 00:34:51.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
madam chair was a second yes i seconded
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
okay i think this this was a bill that
 
00:34:59.430 --> 00:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
actually came out of two separate bills
 
00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
that we started into the process and
 
00:35:03.430 --> 00:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
then discovered they were in the same
 
00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:05.440 align:start position:0%
statute so we
 
00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:06.960 align:start position:0%
saved the committee the trouble and
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
combined them before it got to us
 
00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:12.710 align:start position:0%
combined them before it got to us
it's

00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
it is just one of my favorite terms
 
00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
housekeeping it does make it an advisory
 
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
board but these two boards are
 
00:35:25.349 --> 00:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
relatively small and don't have issues
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
with this
 
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
so i think it's
 
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
it is acceptable to them and and uh
 
00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
initiated by the oplc
 
00:35:35.589 --> 00:35:35.599 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien you have a
 
00:35:35.599 --> 00:35:36.470 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien you have a
question

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh would the chair
 
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
be so kind
 
00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh to explain to you maybe i missed it
 
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
but when we heard testimony from
 
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
director courtney uh
 
00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
if the question was brought up to her
 
00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
that this may be a need of a transition
 
00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:53.430 align:start position:0%
that this may be a need of a transition
amendment

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
into this do i have that correct
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
i don't recall it specifically but
 
00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
representative schuett i think has a
 
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:04.720 align:start position:0%
better answer than i would
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
that was a different bill we we did
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
work on several different boards i did
 
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
talk to
 
00:36:17.829 --> 00:36:17.839 align:start position:0%
the executive director about this bill
 
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
and she felt that these two were pretty
 
00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:20.950 align:start position:0%
and she felt that these two were pretty
simple

00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
simple
 
00:36:23.349 --> 00:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
and therefore could go forward with the
 
00:36:26.069 --> 00:36:26.079 align:start position:0%
i believe it's 60-day
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
transition period
 
00:36:30.150 --> 00:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
the assumption would be exist
 
00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
the assumption would be that the
 
00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
director would appoint to the advisory
 
00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
board the people who are on the current
 
00:36:38.310 --> 00:36:38.320 align:start position:0%
regulatory board
 
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
and that would simplify the transition
 
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
you don't have also don't have to worry
 
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
about licenses
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
being invalid because it's the same
 
00:36:47.829 --> 00:36:47.839 align:start position:0%
organization yep
 
00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
think about scitec actually that would
 
00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
apply to the other bills too
 
00:36:53.349 --> 00:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
in that the
 
00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:54.720 align:start position:0%
executive director can make those
 
00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:56.069 align:start position:0%
executive director can make those
appointments

00:36:56.069 --> 00:36:56.079 align:start position:0%
appointments
 
00:36:59.349 --> 00:36:59.359 align:start position:0%
but a couple the difference was with the
 
00:36:59.359 --> 00:37:00.310 align:start position:0%
but a couple the difference was with the
uh

00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
assessors board because that moved from
 
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
dra to oplc but go on representative
 
00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
okay um first uh
 
00:37:12.069 --> 00:37:12.079 align:start position:0%
if a board has
 
00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
i had mentioned this i called it voting
 
00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
with their feet if a board can't if
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
these boards that can't get quorums as
 
00:37:20.069 --> 00:37:20.079 align:start position:0%
far as i'm concerned they shouldn't even
 
00:37:23.430 --> 00:37:23.440 align:start position:0%
be licensed at all leave that my
 
00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
my petulance aside for a moment and
 
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
let's try to do it right if we're going
 
00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
to do this
 
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
and we were talking with an unnamed
 
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
representative over there
 
00:37:33.839 --> 00:37:34.790 align:start position:0%
representative over there
that

00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
i think we have not looked at this
 
00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
carefully enough the whole situation i
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
don't like the word advisory
 
00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
i mean who has the last call
 
00:37:46.390 --> 00:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
i think the answer to this
 
00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
quorum issue should have been handled
 
00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
this way and the horse has sort of left
 
00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
the barn i think it should be
 
00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
we should allow for alternates
 
00:37:59.670 --> 00:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh we should allow for virtual meetings
 
00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:01.839 align:start position:0%
and i don't like it being advisory i
 
00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
think if it's if it's to be done right
 
00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be in consultation they the
 
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
board should have the last word
 
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
and so i'll go along with this but i
 
00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:13.750 align:start position:0%
and so i'll go along with this but i
was

00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
i wish i had thought of this when the
 
00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
first issue when it first surfaced
 
00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
because i think that would be the better
 
00:38:23.349 --> 00:38:23.359 align:start position:0%
way to handle it and i don't know how
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:30.069 --> 00:38:30.079 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to simply repeal the
 
00:38:31.990 --> 00:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
requirement to license these people but
 
00:38:34.829 --> 00:38:34.839 align:start position:0%
i don't think that would go very far
 
00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and i just want to
 
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
let uh represent scitec know that one of
 
00:38:44.310 --> 00:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
those solutions is headed our way i
 
00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
believe and that is to allow them to
 
00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
meet virtually so we will have that
 
00:38:49.829 --> 00:38:49.839 align:start position:0%
option to give them hopefully
 
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
yes and i as i recall the
 
00:38:58.870 --> 00:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
it wasn't so much that the board wasn't
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
meeting it's just that they kept getting
 
00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
swamped by administrative tasks
 
00:39:03.359 --> 00:39:04.710 align:start position:0%
swamped by administrative tasks
which

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
if they have the full authority to do
 
00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
all that then
 
00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
they also got the responsibility in
 
00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:12.230 align:start position:0%
they also got the responsibility in
there

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
they didn't have they had trouble
 
00:39:15.910 --> 00:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
meeting those representatives psychic
 
00:39:18.069 --> 00:39:18.079 align:start position:0%
and then allegra that's good to hear i'm
 
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
glad but they're still holes and i just
 
00:39:26.829 --> 00:39:26.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
representative yeah uh representative
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
scitec actually beat me to the punch i
 
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
just wanted to express that his
 
00:39:34.069 --> 00:39:34.079 align:start position:0%
sentiment he's not the only one with
 
00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
is there
 
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:42.240 align:start position:0%

practices i guess i'll say
 
00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
who was present did speak in favor of
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:03.430 --> 00:40:03.440 align:start position:0%

seconds what number was that bill
1443

00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:56.000 align:start position:0%

i think this bill falls in line with the
 
00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
other bills that we've had commemorating
 
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
different events
 
00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
and this is a um an event that i think
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
is worthy of recognition but it could be
 
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
done in a different way more productive
 
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
map way thank you okay representative

seeing no other comments
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
the motion is an experience to legislate
 
00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
on house bill 1443
 
00:42:40.950 --> 00:42:40.960 align:start position:0%

00:43:24.829 --> 00:43:24.839 align:start position:0%
14
 
00:43:24.839 --> 00:43:26.550 align:start position:0%
14
1.

00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:26.560 align:start position:0%

00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:29.920 align:start position:0%
do you object to consent no okay
 
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
if there's no other objection we'll put
 
00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
this on consent the mo the motion passes
 
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
14 to 1.
 
00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:45.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
that may be all we can do today but uh
 
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
what yes representative i don't have a
 
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
motion but i'd like to address
 
00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
representative fellows and i think i'm
 
00:44:02.390 --> 00:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
in very much in favor of the audit
 
00:44:04.309 --> 00:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
but it sounds like they want to do it on
 
00:44:06.069 --> 00:44:06.079 align:start position:0%
a fiscal year basis they'd like to have
 
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
a year behind them uh so this your bill
 
00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:44:14.069 --> 00:44:14.079 align:start position:0%
i'm in favor of the the idea but it may
 
00:44:15.589 --> 00:44:15.599 align:start position:0%
be premature
 
00:44:15.599 --> 00:44:16.790 align:start position:0%
be premature
so

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
by the time they get to it like around
 
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
october it would be a whole fiscal year
 
00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
and it would be a whole year of the
 
00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:26.470 align:start position:0%
and it would be a whole year of the
program

00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
okay we're out of executive session
 
00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.069 align:start position:0%
okay we're out of executive session
we'll

00:44:30.069 --> 00:44:30.079 align:start position:0%
we'll
 
00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
get a couple of minutes before the next
 
00:44:31.760 --> 00:48:47.829 align:start position:0%
get a couple of minutes before the next
hearing

00:48:47.829 --> 00:48:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:49.520 align:start position:0%

00:49:13.109 --> 00:49:13.119 align:start position:0%
i always tell everyone the word of the
 
00:49:17.109 --> 00:49:17.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:18.549 --> 00:49:18.559 align:start position:0%
i represent
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
manchester ward six
 
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm here to introduce
 
00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
house bill 1510 the prime sponsor
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
representative attitude was unable to
 
00:49:29.270 --> 00:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
make it here today so i agreed
 
00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
when representative addison contacted me
 
00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
you know in september and asked me if i
 
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
would agree to sponsor the bill this is
 
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
normally something i wouldn't really be
 
00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:42.870 --> 00:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
but when you explain to me some of the
 
00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
time delays that occur in the state
 
00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:46.870 align:start position:0%
time delays that occur in the state
process

00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:49:49.349 --> 00:49:49.359 align:start position:0%
that's when i agreed to
 
00:49:51.190 --> 00:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
come on board
 
00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
we do have issues with how the state
 
00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
hires folks
 
00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
i know that specifically because in the
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
last two months since i agreed to
 
00:50:01.190 --> 00:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor this bill
 
00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
head inspector has left
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
the electrician's board and gone to the
 
00:50:09.119 --> 00:50:10.870 align:start position:0%
the electrician's board and gone to the
dra

00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
dra
 
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
an employee of 25 years from the
 
00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
insurance department has now left and
 
00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
gone to
 
00:50:18.549 --> 00:50:18.559 align:start position:0%
fish and game
 
00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
so it seems like we have a process which
 
00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:23.280 align:start position:0%
allows our good employees within the
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
state to move into other positions but
 
00:50:27.589 --> 00:50:27.599 align:start position:0%
we seem to have a hard time hiring
 
00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
individuals and the circumstance seems
 
00:50:31.349 --> 00:50:31.359 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
once you start once you apply
 
00:50:35.589 --> 00:50:35.599 align:start position:0%
other people who are really looking if
 
00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
you all know if you're looking for a job
 
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
you look for multiple jobs you're going
 
00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
to look to see what is out there what
 
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
kind of offers you get
 
00:50:44.790 --> 00:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
and if if you're really looking for a
 
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
job because you've made a mental
 
00:50:49.109 --> 00:50:49.119 align:start position:0%
decision to leave the job you're in
 
00:50:51.190 --> 00:50:51.200 align:start position:0%
and you find a job possibly with a state
 
00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
that you think appeals to you but it
 
00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
takes three or four months to get hired
 
00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
more often than not the state goes
 
00:50:58.790 --> 00:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
through that process point i'm told i
 
00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
don't work within the state so i don't
 
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
know so this is anecdotal
 
00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
that by the time they make a decision 90
 
00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
120 days later the candidates are gone
 
00:51:09.190 --> 00:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
they've gone somewhere else so are we
 
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
doing ourselves a favor
 
00:51:13.109 --> 00:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
uh by taking so long
 
00:51:14.950 --> 00:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
now madam chairman woman i was in the
 
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
same meeting with you where we were told
 
00:51:20.549 --> 00:51:20.559 align:start position:0%
this is not the kind of the year to have
 
00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:22.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of study committees and i and i
 
00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
get that
 
00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:25.109 align:start position:0%
get that
um

00:51:25.109 --> 00:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
so i respect the position we're in um
 
00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
with the pandemic and people not wanting
 
00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
to meet and not being able to get
 
00:51:37.990 --> 00:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:38.790 align:start position:0%
 
but

00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:51:40.710 --> 00:51:40.720 align:start position:0%
and we've all been here long enough to
 
00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
know that certain study committees
 
00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
have an outward agenda
 
00:51:47.109 --> 00:51:47.119 align:start position:0%
we know the person submitting it
 
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes wants to know
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
already knows what they want out of it
 
00:51:52.549 --> 00:51:52.559 align:start position:0%
so it can be used for future possible
 
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
legislations this is about as innocuous
 
00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
as possible it's about as clean as i can
 
00:51:59.109 --> 00:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
see there's no agenda no one's looking
 
00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
for anything
 
00:52:02.549 --> 00:52:02.559 align:start position:0%
but maybe we can do a better job hiring
 
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
folks by shorting the process
 
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairwoman thank you
 
00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
representative are there questions from
 
00:52:11.829 --> 00:52:11.839 align:start position:0%
the committee representative laccas
 
00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
do you know if the uh
 
00:52:18.309 --> 00:52:18.319 align:start position:0%
the long time involved in the hiring
 
00:52:20.790 --> 00:52:20.800 align:start position:0%
process is related to statute that we
 
00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
need to change or is it something the
 
00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
departments could just change fix on
 
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:26.240 align:start position:0%
their own
 
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry with all due respect i don't
 
00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that question thank
 
00:52:31.829 --> 00:52:31.839 align:start position:0%
you maybe someone behind me will have a
 
00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
better ability to answer that
 
00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:36.309 align:start position:0%
better ability to answer that
president

00:52:36.309 --> 00:52:36.319 align:start position:0%
president
 
00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
um do you know how many openings we have
 
00:52:46.870 --> 00:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
i figured this question was going to
 
00:52:50.069 --> 00:52:50.079 align:start position:0%
come up and i would be careful how i
 
00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
answer it
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
there are
 
00:52:55.349 --> 00:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
a significant amount of
 
00:52:58.150 --> 00:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
of job openings some feel that's okay
 
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
because we had too many openings and our
 
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
budget may be a little too heavy so it's
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
okay to have some of those openings but
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
i can tell you alone i'm aware of issues
 
00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:06.950 align:start position:0%
i can tell you alone i'm aware of issues
with

00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:08.069 align:start position:0%
with
getting

00:53:08.069 --> 00:53:08.079 align:start position:0%
getting
 
00:53:08.079 --> 00:53:09.349 align:start position:0%
getting
permits

00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
permits
 
00:53:11.589 --> 00:53:11.599 align:start position:0%
through the des for new residential
 
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
subdivisions and apartment buildings
 
00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
because they just don't have the staff i
 
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
know the deep department of
 
00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
transportation is down a number of
 
00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:20.069 align:start position:0%
transportation is down a number of
engineers

00:53:20.069 --> 00:53:20.079 align:start position:0%
engineers
 
00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
and they're not to be able to get as
 
00:53:23.109 --> 00:53:23.119 align:start position:0%
much work out as they have in the past
 
00:53:24.309 --> 00:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
and let alone we all know the story
 
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
about uh plowed
 
00:53:27.910 --> 00:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
truck drivers in the state of new
 
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire so i don't have the exact
 
00:53:31.910 --> 00:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
number but just information from
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
individual departments where they're
 
00:53:38.470 --> 00:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
so the lack of these employees lack of
 
00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
our inability to fill these positions
 
00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:45.910 align:start position:0%
our inability to fill these positions
is

00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
having an effect on the performance of
 
00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
the agencies
 
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
that is my understanding and again this
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
is just a study committee there's no
 
00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
indictment of any system or procedure
 
00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
that we're utilizing but to review it
 
00:53:58.950 --> 00:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
and to see if we can make it better
 
00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much
 
00:54:20.710 --> 00:54:20.720 align:start position:0%

00:55:01.829 --> 00:55:01.839 align:start position:0%
application to the start date and see if
 
00:55:03.829 --> 00:55:03.839 align:start position:0%
these various aspects of the hiring
 
00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
process impact the state's ability to
 
00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
fill vacant job positions
 
00:55:10.789 --> 00:55:10.799 align:start position:0%
in a job market as competitive as the
 
00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
one we're in today the hiring process
 
00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
can be the difference between
 
00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
filling a position
 
00:55:18.549 --> 00:55:18.559 align:start position:0%
and losing qualified applicants
 
00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:20.400 align:start position:0%
several mid-level managers at various
 
00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:22.079 align:start position:0%
state agencies communicated to the prime
 
00:55:24.710 --> 00:55:24.720 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative adjutant that the
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
archaic nature of the application
 
00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
process and
 
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
onboarding process made it difficult to
 
00:55:32.789 --> 00:55:32.799 align:start position:0%
get qualified people on the door
 
00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
as one person put it
 
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
between how long it takes to apply and
 
00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
how long it takes to onboard someone by
 
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
the time we call them for a start date
 
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
they've taken a new position somewhere
 
00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:42.150 align:start position:0%
they've taken a new position somewhere
else

00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
else
 
00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
and the state finds itself down
 
00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
qualified applicants that could have
 
00:55:46.549 --> 00:55:46.559 align:start position:0%
helped out
 
00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:48.160 align:start position:0%
delivering vital services to our
 
00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:51.109 align:start position:0%
delivering vital services to our
constituents

00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
in this economy with people living
 
00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
paycheck to paycheck they often don't
 
00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
have time to wait
 
00:55:57.030 --> 00:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
weeks and weeks for an employer to get
 
00:55:58.470 --> 00:55:58.480 align:start position:0%
back to them and it's causing us to lose
 
00:56:01.030 --> 00:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
qualified applicants
 
00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
i firmly believe we ought to study
 
00:56:05.589 --> 00:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
uh this problem uh to see if we can
 
00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
relieve state agencies and uh get the
 
00:56:09.910 --> 00:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
vital services that our constituents
 
00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:10.710 align:start position:0%
vital services that our constituents
need

00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:56:13.349 --> 00:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
uh in a timely fashion so i urge you to
 
00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
support this bipartisan bill
 
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
and thank you i'll take questions if you
 
00:56:18.789 --> 00:56:18.799 align:start position:0%
have any
 
00:56:22.789 --> 00:56:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
this is not a facetious question i'm
 
00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:26.720 align:start position:0%
just wondering why is it that state
 
00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:28.870 align:start position:0%
just wondering why is it that state
agencies

00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:56:31.109 --> 00:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
do they not have the flexibility to
 
00:56:32.950 --> 00:56:32.960 align:start position:0%
change their hiring process to become
 
00:56:35.109 --> 00:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
more competitive
 
00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
representative i think that's one thing
 
00:56:38.069 --> 00:56:38.079 align:start position:0%
that the study committee would be
 
00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
looking at okay yeah i mean i think as
 
00:56:42.549 --> 00:56:42.559 align:start position:0%
the previous person testified i don't
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
really know the answer to that but that
 
00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
would be the purpose of the committee to
 
00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
get to the bottom of what is impact
 
00:56:51.030 --> 00:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:53.270 --> 00:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
thank you representative kaplan thank
 
00:57:04.870 --> 00:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:07.349 --> 00:57:07.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you to the committee for hearing
 
00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
i think any time um
 
00:57:16.309 --> 00:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
the chair of the labor committee and the
 
00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
ranking member of the labor committee
 
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
can testify in the same bill
 
00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
both in support um
 
00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:23.349 align:start position:0%
both in support um
it

00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
emphasizes the fact that we are indeed
 
00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
looking at a a bipartisan issue here
 
00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
um i don't think there's anything
 
00:57:30.789 --> 00:57:30.799 align:start position:0%
partisan about
 
00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
the state needing to hire
 
00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
qualified quality individuals
 
00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
and get them on board as quickly as
 
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:39.589 align:start position:0%
and get them on board as quickly as
possible

00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
it seems like that's just something that
 
00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
benefits the state and all the
 
00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:44.710 align:start position:0%
benefits the state and all the
departments

00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
departments
 
00:57:46.069 --> 00:57:46.079 align:start position:0%
in general
 
00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:48.640 align:start position:0%
i myself don't know why there's a delay
 
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
like this i know it's not unique to new
 
00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:51.829 align:start position:0%
like this i know it's not unique to new
hampshire

00:57:51.829 --> 00:57:51.839 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
one of our representative colleagues
 
00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:55.589 align:start position:0%
one of our representative colleagues
son

00:57:55.589 --> 00:57:55.599 align:start position:0%
son
 
00:57:57.109 --> 00:57:57.119 align:start position:0%
just got hired into one of the
 
00:57:59.750 --> 00:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
departments in new jersey and i think
 
00:58:02.069 --> 00:58:02.079 align:start position:0%
it's taken six months for him to
 
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
actually get on board
 
00:58:07.829 --> 00:58:07.839 align:start position:0%
so it happens in other states as well
 
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
but i'd like to see new hampshire be
 
00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
better than other states and if there
 
00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
are ways that we can streamline the
 
00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
uh the process get people on board
 
00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
quicker and get the best candidates
 
00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
before they go somewhere else
 
00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
i think that's a good thing and i don't
 
00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
think we know the answer to exactly why
 
00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
this is an issue
 
00:58:30.309 --> 00:58:30.319 align:start position:0%
so this study committee can very much
 
00:58:32.230 --> 00:58:32.240 align:start position:0%
provide answers to that
 
00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
whether we need
 
00:58:36.309 --> 00:58:36.319 align:start position:0%
new legislation or not is unknown it may
 
00:58:37.510 --> 00:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
be that
 
00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
the departments can simply get some
 
00:58:43.589 --> 00:58:43.599 align:start position:0%
some guidance from the study committee
 
00:58:45.190 --> 00:58:45.200 align:start position:0%
as to how to go about
 
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
streamlining their hiring process
 
00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:50.720 align:start position:0%
so with that i won't repeat what's been
 
00:58:52.390 --> 00:58:52.400 align:start position:0%
said earlier thank you
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
thank you will you take questions yes
 
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
00:58:58.390 --> 00:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i'm not trying
 
00:59:00.309 --> 00:59:00.319 align:start position:0%
to put you on the spot but you said you
 
00:59:02.069 --> 00:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
were on the labor committee so i thought
 
00:59:04.150 --> 00:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
maybe you'd have some insight in this
 
00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:05.670 align:start position:0%
maybe you'd have some insight in this
direction

00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
direction
 
00:59:07.109 --> 00:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
would you agree
 
00:59:07.119 --> 00:59:07.990 align:start position:0%
would you agree
that

00:59:07.990 --> 00:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:10.789 --> 00:59:10.799 align:start position:0%
the process for a private company to
 
00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
hire an individual
 
00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
is fundamentally different from
 
00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:17.109 align:start position:0%
is fundamentally different from
a

00:59:17.109 --> 00:59:17.119 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
government entity which could be you
 
00:59:21.270 --> 00:59:21.280 align:start position:0%
know a school district or town or the
 
00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:22.150 align:start position:0%
know a school district or town or the
state

00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:23.750 align:start position:0%
state
because

00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:59:26.549 --> 00:59:26.559 align:start position:0%
the private agency has the private
 
00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
company has the ability to just like say
 
00:59:32.230 --> 00:59:32.240 align:start position:0%
i want somebody right away so i'm going
 
00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
to just take the first person who you
 
00:59:36.789 --> 00:59:36.799 align:start position:0%
know is well qualified that comes
 
00:59:38.069 --> 00:59:38.079 align:start position:0%
through the door
 
00:59:39.030 --> 00:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
but this
 
00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
the government entity
 
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
has to deal with all kinds of issues
 
00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:45.430 align:start position:0%
has to deal with all kinds of issues
like

00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:59:49.190 --> 00:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
fairness in terms of um that everybody
 
00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
gets a chance to apply for that job
 
00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:54.640 align:start position:0%
and concerns about
 
00:59:57.030 --> 00:59:57.040 align:start position:0%
that a person doesn't get the job just
 
00:59:59.030 --> 00:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
because you know their friend works in
 
01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
that department and they hear about it
 
01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
so it's only open in the you know so if
 
01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
you get in quick you can get hired in a
 
01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:06.309 align:start position:0%
you get in quick you can get hired in a
week

01:00:06.309 --> 01:00:06.319 align:start position:0%
week
 
01:00:08.309 --> 01:00:08.319 align:start position:0%
but and your question representative
 
01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
fellow yeah about the difference do you
 
01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
know i haven't heard anybody say that
 
01:00:14.950 --> 01:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
they understand that this
 
01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:17.190 align:start position:0%
they understand that this
public

01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:00:18.630 --> 01:00:18.640 align:start position:0%
entity has
 
01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
different responsibilities in terms of
 
01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:22.710 align:start position:0%
different responsibilities in terms of
hiring

01:00:22.710 --> 01:00:22.720 align:start position:0%
hiring
 
01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
i think that's probably true to some
 
01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.549 align:start position:0%
i think that's probably true to some
extent

01:00:26.549 --> 01:00:26.559 align:start position:0%
extent
 
01:00:28.309 --> 01:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
which i think is why we need the study
 
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
committee to
 
01:00:31.750 --> 01:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
streamline our process as much as
 
01:00:33.349 --> 01:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
possible so that we can
 
01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
speed it up while still getting quality
 
01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
candidates doing background checks and
 
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
everything that's needed for a
 
01:00:40.309 --> 01:00:40.319 align:start position:0%
particular position
 
01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:42.640 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
trying to compete with the private
 
01:00:46.789 --> 01:00:46.799 align:start position:0%
sector that's able to move quickly i
 
01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
think you're right but um
 
01:00:53.829 --> 01:00:53.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:57.349 --> 01:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
01:00:58.789 --> 01:00:58.799 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none thank you
 
01:00:58.799 --> 01:01:00.710 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none thank you

01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
do we have anybody from the division of
 
01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:20.069 --> 01:01:20.079 align:start position:0%

would you care to step up introduce
 
01:01:27.430 --> 01:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
yourself and perhaps answer some
 
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
questions obviously the division of
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
personnel is deeply involved in the
 
01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:40.069 --> 01:01:40.079 align:start position:0%

of administrative services and i've been
 
01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
embedded within the division of
 
01:02:13.750 --> 01:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
personnel for two and a half years
 
01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
working with them on their modernization
 
01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
efforts and streamlining of their
 
01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
processes and procedures
 
01:02:23.190 --> 01:02:23.200 align:start position:0%
thank you do you have anything to say
 
01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
about this study committee or the state
 
01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
agency hiring process that will
 
01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
enlighten us it is an issue that the
 
01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:30.799 align:start position:0%
department of the division of personnel
 
01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
is working on
 
01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:33.829 align:start position:0%
is working on
actively

01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:33.839 align:start position:0%
actively
 
01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
because we recognize the need for
 
01:02:38.950 --> 01:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
streamlined processes for recruitment
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
and hiring
 
01:02:41.829 --> 01:02:41.839 align:start position:0%
we have been training
 
01:02:41.839 --> 01:02:42.789 align:start position:0%
we have been training
state

01:02:42.789 --> 01:02:42.799 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
hr professionals on procedures and
 
01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
hiring managers on procedures for hiring
 
01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
to try and facilitate and expedite those
 
01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:51.589 align:start position:0%
to try and facilitate and expedite those
procedures

01:02:51.589 --> 01:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
one of the challenges we have in the
 
01:02:55.109 --> 01:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
state is
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
is the time that folks have available
 
01:02:59.029 --> 01:02:59.039 align:start position:0%
because of the staffing issues we
 
01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
currently have 19 vacancy rate and we
 
01:03:03.349 --> 01:03:03.359 align:start position:0%
are competing in the labor market where
 
01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:05.920 align:start position:0%
it is necessary to act quickly excuse me
 
01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
you said 19
 
01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
yes we currently have a vacancy rate of
 
01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
19 statewide
 
01:03:12.549 --> 01:03:12.559 align:start position:0%
matter of fact i calculated that this
 
01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
morning thank you
 
01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.240 align:start position:0%

i i think my quest thank you i think my
 
01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
questions have just been answered the 90
 
01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
is across all departments the whole
 
01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:25.430 align:start position:0%
is across all departments the whole
state

01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:03:27.430 --> 01:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
across statewide for classified
 
01:03:29.270 --> 01:03:29.280 align:start position:0%

01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair

schmidt
 
01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
if this study goes forward
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
would your department welcome the
 
01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to work with them
 
01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely the division would be
 
01:03:48.069 --> 01:03:48.079 align:start position:0%
providing i would imagine provide much
 
01:03:49.270 --> 01:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
of the information required for the
 
01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:52.069 align:start position:0%
of the information required for the
committee

01:03:52.069 --> 01:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
 
01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:55.270 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative
fellows

01:03:55.270 --> 01:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
fellows
 
01:03:57.029 --> 01:03:57.039 align:start position:0%
so if you've been working on this for a
 
01:03:58.870 --> 01:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
while can you
 
01:04:00.190 --> 01:04:00.200 align:start position:0%
i mean i
 
01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
the vacancy rate in terms of eight well
 
01:04:08.309 --> 01:04:08.319 align:start position:0%
some of them are obviously hr positions
 
01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
i i understand that but i think the
 
01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
even if you were fully staffed it would
 
01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
seem like a slow operation have you
 
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
identified any
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
changes other than
 
01:04:23.589 --> 01:04:23.599 align:start position:0%
training that
 
01:04:25.990 --> 01:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
might help with the situation that might
 
01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
make it faster
 
01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
one of the proposals the department put
 
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
forward recently for use of some of the
 
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
recovery funds from the federal monies
 
01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
is actually to
 
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:40.880 align:start position:0%
hire three dedicated hiring managers who
 
01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
will sit in the division of personnel
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
who will be focused exclusively on
 
01:04:47.829 --> 01:04:47.839 align:start position:0%
hiring for critical need positions
 
01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
positions where we actually have higher
 
01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
than the average vacancy rate we have
 
01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:54.720 align:start position:0%
vacancy rates up in 20 and 30 percent in
 
01:04:56.789 --> 01:04:56.799 align:start position:0%
some areas of our state government
 
01:04:58.950 --> 01:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
and having dedicated hiring managers is
 
01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
one of the solutions we're going to be
 
01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
exploring exploring
 
01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
to see if
 
01:05:04.870 --> 01:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
because right now most of our hiring
 
01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
managers in the state are also managers
 
01:05:08.549 --> 01:05:08.559 align:start position:0%
of programs and operations
 
01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
they're not fully dedicated to hiring
 
01:05:12.789 --> 01:05:12.799 align:start position:0%
and so in addition to hiring trying to
 
01:05:14.789 --> 01:05:14.799 align:start position:0%
hire and fill positions they're trying
 
01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
to manage their programs and their
 
01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
operations at the same time
 
01:05:20.789 --> 01:05:20.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:22.630 --> 01:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
thank you are there other questions from
 
01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
okay yes representative grota
 
01:05:30.549 --> 01:05:30.559 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i just want to
 
01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
clarify what you just said so you're
 
01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:35.440 align:start position:0%
saying that we don't we don't have
 
01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
any hiring managers that are 100
 
01:05:39.990 --> 01:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
dedicated to hiring
 
01:05:41.910 --> 01:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
they're just they have other functions
 
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
of other job requirements as well
 
01:05:46.150 --> 01:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
most of our hiring managers across the
 
01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
state have other job functions
 
01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:50.640 align:start position:0%
responsibilities there are some human
 
01:05:52.309 --> 01:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
resource staff in some of the larger
 
01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
agencies who are dedicated to supporting
 
01:05:56.789 --> 01:05:56.799 align:start position:0%
recruitment but that is not the normal
 
01:05:56.799 --> 01:05:57.990 align:start position:0%
recruitment but that is not the normal
situation

01:05:57.990 --> 01:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:05:59.829 --> 01:05:59.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
representative fellow
 
01:06:04.470 --> 01:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
so maybe i'm misunderstanding it almost
 
01:06:06.150 --> 01:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
sounds like you're saying
 
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
that the the person who is hiring
 
01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
somebody that they are going to
 
01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:12.870 align:start position:0%
somebody that they are going to
supervise

01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
supervise
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
is holding up the process because
 
01:06:17.029 --> 01:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
they're too busy
 
01:06:19.270 --> 01:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes that is the case they because
 
01:06:21.270 --> 01:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
it falls to them the prior process in
 
01:06:23.430 --> 01:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
the state is that application a job is
 
01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:24.390 align:start position:0%
the state is that application a job is
posted

01:06:24.390 --> 01:06:24.400 align:start position:0%
posted
 
01:06:25.829 --> 01:06:25.839 align:start position:0%
applicants apply
 
01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
jobs are posted internally for five days
 
01:06:29.510 --> 01:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
we have to review our internal
 
01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
applicants before we can
 
01:06:33.510 --> 01:06:33.520 align:start position:0%

today i am here

on behalf of the house majority office
to

01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:09:09.669 --> 01:09:09.679 align:start position:0%
give our support
 
01:09:11.349 --> 01:09:11.359 align:start position:0%
of improved accountability in the
 
01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process we are in favor of
 
01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
reforming this process and the general
 
01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
concept of the bill
 
01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
but possibly we believe there are some
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
improvements or other change we would
 
01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
like to be considered
 
01:09:29.110 --> 01:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
rulemaking is our dele is our
 
01:09:31.349 --> 01:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
delegation of legislative authority to
 
01:09:34.309 --> 01:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
the executive this bill requires formal
 
01:09:36.390 --> 01:09:36.400 align:start position:0%
explicit approvals for rules rather than
 
01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
review by a committee
 
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
and assumed approval with the
 
01:09:41.990 --> 01:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
legislative disapproval only on an
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
exception basis we've all seen that the
 
01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
legislator no longer really has control
 
01:09:48.789 --> 01:09:48.799 align:start position:0%
on many occasions of the rule-making
 
01:09:51.349 --> 01:09:51.359 align:start position:0%
process and we know that the rules have
 
01:09:53.829 --> 01:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
the same impact on invid individ
 
01:09:57.189 --> 01:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
individuals and businesses as laws do
 
01:09:59.189 --> 01:09:59.199 align:start position:0%
on a global basis the intent is to
 
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
restore the legislative authority on
 
01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
policy procedure matters affecting the
 
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
people of new hampshire
 
01:10:07.510 --> 01:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
agencies are occasionally writing rules
 
01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
that clearly go beyond the scope and
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
intent of the legislator writing the
 
01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
bill and the legislative body passing it
 
01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
overall we believe it's time to amend
 
01:10:19.510 --> 01:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
rsa 541a to ensure that unelected
 
01:10:20.709 --> 01:10:20.719 align:start position:0%
government employees are not
 
01:10:22.870 --> 01:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
policymakers and no longer have the
 
01:10:25.510 --> 01:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
ability to effectively create law
 
01:10:27.189 --> 01:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
through rules
 
01:10:28.950 --> 01:10:28.960 align:start position:0%
some ideas the house majority office
 
01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
would like to see discussed and
 
01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:31.830 align:start position:0%
would like to see discussed and
considered

01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
considered
 
01:10:33.590 --> 01:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
jalcar should be empowered with the
 
01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
authority of no means no meaning that
 
01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
rules shall not move forward at the
 
01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
outset prior to the express affirmative
 
01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:42.630 align:start position:0%
outset prior to the express affirmative
vote

01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:44.960 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
we believe providing gel car with the
 
01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
authority to compel responsive uh
 
01:10:52.470 --> 01:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
responses from agencies in timely manner
 
01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
um this is another item suggested by uh
 
01:10:59.189 --> 01:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
members of the house majority office
 
01:11:01.510 --> 01:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
we'd also like to see improving
 
01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
public and business input on
 
01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
proposed rulemaking before the vote
 
01:11:09.270 --> 01:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
and we'd also like to the possibility of
 
01:11:11.430 --> 01:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
having the policy committee chairs vice
 
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
chair sponsor specifically involved with
 
01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
the proposed rule
 
01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
prior to the vote by jalcar
 
01:11:19.679 --> 01:11:20.870 align:start position:0%
prior to the vote by jalcar
finally

01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
finally
 
01:11:22.709 --> 01:11:22.719 align:start position:0%
having just come from the speaker's
 
01:11:22.719 --> 01:11:23.750 align:start position:0%
having just come from the speaker's
office

01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:11:25.110 --> 01:11:25.120 align:start position:0%
like i said i'm here representing the
 
01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
house majority office but
 
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
the other side of house leadership
 
01:11:31.669 --> 01:11:31.679 align:start position:0%
we believe that it would be
 
01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
to the benefit if a subcommittee
 
01:11:36.550 --> 01:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
could be formed
 
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
on this bill so the bill itself could be
 
01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
utilized as a vehicle for other needed
 
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
improvements that other people
 
01:11:46.149 --> 01:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
in leadership have uh
 
01:11:48.229 --> 01:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
relayed to me
 
01:11:49.990 --> 01:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh with that
 
01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not here to take questions this is
 
01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
not my
 
01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:54.550 align:start position:0%
not my
wheelhouse

01:11:54.550 --> 01:11:54.560 align:start position:0%
wheelhouse
 
01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
if it's a simple question i guess i
 
01:11:57.750 --> 01:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
could take it other than that
 
01:12:00.950 --> 01:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
i'll conclude my testimony
 
01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative trick out
 
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
representative blackis has a question
 
01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
hope it's simple enough yeah i think it
 
01:12:08.470 --> 01:12:08.480 align:start position:0%
is um if you could just email a copy of
 
01:12:09.910 --> 01:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
what you read there to the committee
 
01:12:11.590 --> 01:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate it i will be happy to do that
 
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
representative schuett
 
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:12:23.189 --> 01:12:23.199 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that you
 
01:12:25.110 --> 01:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
particularly raised or the majority
 
01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
office raised was the amount of time
 
01:12:30.390 --> 01:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
that it takes for rules to come into
 
01:12:32.709 --> 01:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
effect and i agree that in some
 
01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
instances it is quite lengthy
 
01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
i'm serving on gel car myself
 
01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:40.470 align:start position:0%
i'm serving on gel car myself
however

01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
some of these things that you're talking
 
01:12:45.030 --> 01:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
about instituting seems like it could
 
01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
even possibly lengthen the amount of
