00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
so before we get up to becky i'm just
 
00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 align:start position:0%
going to share my screen and give you a
 
00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
going to share my screen and give you a
quick

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:27.250 align:start position:0%
quick
 
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:28.710 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
synopsis of our presentation today um so
 
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
these are the funds that we're going to
 
00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
be talking about
 
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
so this is the information from the
 
00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
budget you have the appropriations from
 
00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:39.199 align:start position:0%
the last two years
 
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
as well as the appropriation that is in
 
00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget
 
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:46.720 align:start position:0%
these funds are now in the
 
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
education trust fund with exception of
 
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
one small one the public school lease
 
00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
aid fund
 
00:06:53.189 --> 00:06:53.199 align:start position:0%
but historically some of these funds
 
00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
have been in the general funds
 
00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:56.479 align:start position:0%
in the general fund and then some of
 
00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
them have been in the education trust
 
00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.629 align:start position:0%
them have been in the education trust
fund

00:06:58.629 --> 00:06:58.639 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919 align:start position:0%
as of fiscal year 20 and 21 at building
 
00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:02.469 align:start position:0%
as of fiscal year 20 and 21 at building
a

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
tuition and transportation and special
 
00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:05.919 align:start position:0%
education aid we're all moved into the
 
00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:06.629 align:start position:0%
education aid we're all moved into the
education

00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:06.639 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
trust fund so the lines that you would
 
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
follow in the budget
 
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:13.840 align:start position:0%
may not be the exact lines that we've
 
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
seen in the past
 
00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:17.759 align:start position:0%
the accounting units have changed but we
 
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
for historical purposes we have included
 
00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
them here so you can kind of follow
 
00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:23.919 align:start position:0%
the history so each one of these funds
 
00:07:25.589 --> 00:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
we're going to talk about today
 
00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:27.759 align:start position:0%
i'm just a reminder that these funds are
 
00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:29.759 align:start position:0%
now paid out of the education trust fund
 
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund is established
 
00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:33.759 align:start position:0%
in law under rsa 198
 
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
39 and that has a variety of dedicated
 
00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:38.240 align:start position:0%
revenue sources that goes to the
 
00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:39.919 align:start position:0%
education trust fund for the purpose of
 
00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
distributing these grants each year
 
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
these grants go to publix public schools
 
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
and public charter schools
 
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
they equate to about a billion dollars
 
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
of state aid dispersed across the state
 
00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:50.639 align:start position:0%
every single year
 
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
um and i just want to remind the
 
00:07:53.749 --> 00:07:53.759 align:start position:0%
committee that
 
00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
um these funds that you're seeing here
 
00:07:57.029 --> 00:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
in front of you are 100
 
00:07:58.629 --> 00:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
flow through that means they go directly
 
00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
to the schools and none of it is
 
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
maintained by the department of
 
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.309 align:start position:0%
maintained by the department of
education

00:08:02.309 --> 00:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of staff and whatnot
 
00:08:05.909 --> 00:08:05.919 align:start position:0%
those are funded in various other areas
 
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
of our budget that will be covered
 
00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
by tammy vallencourt at a different time
 
00:08:11.909 --> 00:08:11.919 align:start position:0%
so with that introduction i'm going to
 
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
hand the mic over to
 
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
rebecca ferdet who will be talking about
 
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you caitlin um as
 
00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:23.039 align:start position:0%
caitlin said i'm rebecca ferdinand i'm
 
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
the state director of special education
 
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:26.240 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to
 
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
review for you special education aid
 
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to share my screen with
 
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.550 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to share my screen with
you

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:38.149 --> 00:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
special education oh hold on
 
00:08:40.149 --> 00:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
special education aid formerly known as
 
00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
catastrophic aid is
 
00:08:44.949 --> 00:08:44.959 align:start position:0%
funds that offer us financial assistance
 
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
to defray the costs for special
 
00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.030 align:start position:0%
to defray the costs for special
education

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
um distributed under rsa 186 c 18
 
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
3 to a responsible school district the
 
00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
school district may be eligible for
 
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:56.790 align:start position:0%
school district may be eligible for
reimbursement

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
only for those direct costs which are
 
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
included in the iep of a child with a
 
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:01.670 align:start position:0%
included in the iep of a child with a
disability

00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
disability
 
00:09:03.829 --> 00:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
and which qualify as special education
 
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
and related services
 
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
districts submit invoices for payments
 
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
made for the cost of special education
 
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.230 align:start position:0%
made for the cost of special education
services

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
and the state reimburses for the
 
00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
allowable costs based on the previous
 
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.350 align:start position:0%
allowable costs based on the previous
year

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
so rsa 186 c18 requires the state to be
 
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
level for 80 percent
 
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
of the cost above the three and a half
 
00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
times the estimated state average
 
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
expenditure per pupil and the school
 
00:09:28.389 --> 00:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
year preceding the year of the
 
00:09:28.399 --> 00:09:29.910 align:start position:0%
year preceding the year of the
distribution

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
distribution
 
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
up to 10 times the estimated state
 
00:09:34.389 --> 00:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
average expenditure per pupil
 
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
for the school year preceding the year
 
00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:37.519 align:start position:0%
of distribution
 
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
we are liable for all costs in excess of
 
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
10 times the estimated state average
 
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:42.790 align:start position:0%
10 times the estimated state average
expenditure

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
expenditure
 
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
per pupil for the school year precede
 
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
preceding the year of distribution
 
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
if in any year the amount appropriated
 
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:52.480 align:start position:0%
for distribution as special education
 
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
aid exceeds the allotted
 
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
um allocated amount excuse me the
 
00:09:58.710 --> 00:09:58.720 align:start position:0%
district's reimbursement shall be
 
00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.750 align:start position:0%
district's reimbursement shall be
prorated

00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
prorated
 
00:10:01.269 --> 00:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
and so there are times that we have had
 
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
to prorate so the school district is
 
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
liable for the three and
 
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
a half times the cost per pupil
 
00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:09.839 align:start position:0%
plus 20 of the additional cost the state
 
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
is responsible for 80
 
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
and there are not enough if there are
 
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839 align:start position:0%
not enough funds to cover the 80
 
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
the cost will be prorated so we have an
 
00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.670 align:start position:0%
the cost will be prorated so we have an
example

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:10:22.710 --> 00:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
so if the estimated state average
 
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
expenditure per pupil is around 16 000
 
00:10:28.389 --> 00:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
and then three and a half times that
 
00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:30.839 align:start position:0%
would be the 59
 
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
217. the total allowable special
 
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
education cost is the 99
 
00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:39.839 align:start position:0%
845. that's what
 
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
they have spent on the student the cap
 
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
is going to cover
 
00:10:46.069 --> 00:10:46.079 align:start position:0%
the 59 000 which the district pays and
 
00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
then that cost of four that
 
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
forty thousand six hundred and twenty
 
00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:51.519 align:start position:0%
seven is above the cap
 
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
we then take that and we would cover
 
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
eighty percent which is thirty five
 
00:10:58.710 --> 00:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
thirty two thousand five hundred and one
 
00:10:59.590 --> 00:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
sorry my
 
00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
numbers are and then if you were able to
 
00:11:04.069 --> 00:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
give them the hundred percent
 
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:05.440 align:start position:0%
we would give them the thirty two
 
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
thousand five hundred and one
 
00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
and the district would still be
 
00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
responsible for sixty seven
 
00:11:12.389 --> 00:11:12.399 align:start position:0%
thousand three hundred and forty three
 
00:11:13.829 --> 00:11:13.839 align:start position:0%
that's when we're able to pay the
 
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
hundred percent
 
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
um from the state aid i will say that
 
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
this year was the first time since 2008
 
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
we have been able to pay that hundred
 
00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.269 align:start position:0%
we have been able to pay that hundred
percent

00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
um typically we have to prorate it so we
 
00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
do have another example that shows
 
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
um what the cost could be going forward
 
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
so if we take the same numbers but we
 
00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
have to prorate that cost here
 
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
um at 70 percent the districts our share
 
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
goes down to
 
00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
hundred 22 one and the district
 
00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
responsibility goes up to seventy seven
 
00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.350 align:start position:0%
responsibility goes up to seventy seven
thousand

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
ninety three dollars excuse me
 
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
four yes um when you said this year
 
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
were you talking about 2021 when
 
00:11:59.590 --> 00:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
we had the 80 percent so um
 
00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
it would have been for let me get my
 
00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:04.240 align:start position:0%
dates right
 
00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to make sure i get the
 
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
right dates i want to make sure at least
 
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
it would have been for the 1920 school
 
00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:09.990 align:start position:0%
it would have been for the 1920 school
year

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
we were able to provide the 80 and 100
 
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
um and we didn't have to prorate the
 
00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
hundred percent we never prorate the 80
 
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
but we do at times have to prorate that
 
00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
but that 100
 
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
if we don't have enough funds so this
 
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
year which
 
00:12:28.949 --> 00:12:28.959 align:start position:0%
we we get all of our documentation in
 
00:12:28.959 --> 00:12:29.590 align:start position:0%
we we get all of our documentation in
july

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
july
 
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
and we review all of those that's why it
 
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
kind of gets in my head as this year
 
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
but it is for the previous year yeah and
 
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:38.320 align:start position:0%
then it's paid out by december so
 
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
we just finished that in december and we
 
00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
were able to pay it out at
 
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
the 100 that we um that is required
 
00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:47.839 align:start position:0%
uh representative lynn you had a
 
00:12:47.839 --> 00:12:50.790 align:start position:0%
uh representative lynn you had a
question

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh just a quick question
 
00:12:54.389 --> 00:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
when you say if there are not enough
 
00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
funds it has to be prorated
 
00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
could you just um explain what what the
 
00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.310 align:start position:0%
could you just um explain what what the
formula

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
formula
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
is for the proration how does that work
 
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
sorry i have somebody in my ear telling
 
00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
me what i meant to do
 
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
so that's someone you just went so go to
 
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
the next one that's just like that
 
00:13:15.829 --> 00:13:15.839 align:start position:0%
right there that explains the probation
 
00:13:15.839 --> 00:13:16.150 align:start position:0%
right there that explains the probation
so

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:16.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
it what would happen is we would so if
 
00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
we take the same student that i had
 
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
talked about with the hundred percent um
 
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
we would still pay the 80
 
00:13:26.069 --> 00:13:26.079 align:start position:0%
which is here which is the 35. but then
 
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
it once that gets over the cap
 
00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
we can't pay am i saying this right
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
no i'm not saying this right sorry
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
so let me just clarify that this is my
 
00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
first time doing this
 
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
so i'm still learning all of this as we
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
go that's why there are two people
 
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
sitting behind me
 
00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
oh you're doing fine don't worry you're
 
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
doing fine yeah so we take in all of the
 
00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
special education
 
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
and we look at everything that is um
 
00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
pros we process it we look through
 
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
make sure that everything is accurate
 
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
everything is appropriate
 
00:13:57.110 --> 00:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
um that they've spent their money on
 
00:13:58.629 --> 00:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
funds that they're supposed to and then
 
00:13:59.430 --> 00:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
we look at
 
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
how much that will be so we say you know
 
00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
say that um everything that's turned
 
00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:04.550 align:start position:0%
say that um everything that's turned
under

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
into us comes up to 10 million dollars i
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
know that's not the number it's just a
 
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
bigger number than that and i'm gonna
 
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
work with a smaller one
 
00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
say that it's 10 million dollars but
 
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
we've only been allocated through this
 
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
fund eight million dollars
 
00:14:18.949 --> 00:14:18.959 align:start position:0%
so then we would prorate everybody to
 
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
only spend
 
00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
the eight million dollars because i'm
 
00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
not able to do the 10 million dollars so
 
00:14:24.079 --> 00:14:24.629 align:start position:0%
not able to do the 10 million dollars so
if

00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
so once we've gone through everything
 
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
we've looked at everything that's
 
00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
submitted to us
 
00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
we make a determination as to whether we
 
00:14:33.269 --> 00:14:33.279 align:start position:0%
can pay it at a hundred percent
 
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
or if we would need to um prorate it so
 
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
that it's at a lower rate than that
 
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
hundred percent
 
00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:43.519 align:start position:0%
okay can i just ask a follow-up
 
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
certainly so so you just understand when
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
when you say like you use the 10 million
 
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
dollars as just as an example i
 
00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:51.110 align:start position:0%
dollars as just as an example i
understand

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
so am i understanding that the way the
 
00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
proration works then
 
00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
is you let's say that that 10 million
 
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
dollars just as an example
 
00:15:03.189 --> 00:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
represented 100 students who were
 
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
getting special education
 
00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:08.959 align:start position:0%
um uh aid so you would then
 
00:15:11.189 --> 00:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
you would it would be on that basis
 
00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
you'd say okay
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
we only have we don't have 10 we only
 
00:15:16.629 --> 00:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
have um
 
00:15:20.069 --> 00:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
uh 10 we've the total expenditure has
 
00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
been 10 million dollars for special
 
00:15:21.839 --> 00:15:22.710 align:start position:0%
been 10 million dollars for special
education

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
that's over the you know it's over the
 
00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
limit where we start to pay
 
00:15:28.389 --> 00:15:28.399 align:start position:0%
but we only have eight million dollars
 
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
to pay
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
um we're gonna divide that eight million
 
00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
dollars by a hundred
 
00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
and figure out how much each of those
 
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
hundred students that are getting
 
00:15:38.069 --> 00:15:38.079 align:start position:0%
special education would get
 
00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
is that that's that kind of the way it
 
00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
works representative flynn i believe the
 
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
next slide that becky's going to
 
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
present is actually going to help
 
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
explain exactly what that question is so
 
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
it might make it a little bit more clear
 
00:15:50.389 --> 00:15:50.399 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm probably way ahead of
 
00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:51.910 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i'm probably way ahead of
myself

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
myself
 
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
no it's great it means you're
 
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
understanding it so representative heath
 
00:15:58.389 --> 00:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
i'll hold my question until they finish
 
00:16:01.829 --> 00:16:01.839 align:start position:0%
the next slide
 
00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so this this
 
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
um so this i didn't realize i was going
 
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
on to this side thank you caitlyn
 
00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:11.519 align:start position:0%
so this slide is going to show you what
 
00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
we've done for each year and it gives
 
00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
you that
 
00:16:15.749 --> 00:16:15.759 align:start position:0%
this each fiscal year it gives you the
 
00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
count for students that we
 
00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
have um had apply for special education
 
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839 align:start position:0%
aid because not everybody will apply for
 
00:16:23.430 --> 00:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
special education aid unless they meet
 
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
the cap
 
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
it gives you what the districts have
 
00:16:28.949 --> 00:16:28.959 align:start position:0%
expended it tells you what the full
 
00:16:28.959 --> 00:16:29.829 align:start position:0%
expended it tells you what the full
entitlement

00:16:29.829 --> 00:16:29.839 align:start position:0%
entitlement
 
00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:32.800 align:start position:0%
would have been owed by the state and
 
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
then it tells you what we paid
 
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:37.360 align:start position:0%
so if you look at um 2003 it said that
 
00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
our entitlement was
 
00:16:42.629 --> 00:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
22 276 but we were only able to pay
 
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
17 561.
 
00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
um no that's not right because it says
 
00:16:51.189 --> 00:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
we paid 100
 
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
you need to come over here you need to
 
00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
come over here
 
00:16:58.389 --> 00:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
i'm going to have lisa talk really quick
 
00:16:59.910 --> 00:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
so i'll let me
 
00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
i'll take over for just a second and
 
00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
lisa can correct me um so in 2003 there
 
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
was a the formula worked a little bit
 
00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:06.069 align:start position:0%
was a the formula worked a little bit
different

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:06.079 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
um so but let's look at 2018 for example
 
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
so in 2018 which is like online 22
 
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
um there were 822 kids that were
 
00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:16.949 align:start position:0%
um there were 822 kids that were
determined

00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:16.959 align:start position:0%
determined
 
00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
eligible for catastrophic aid by the
 
00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.079 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
meaning school districts submitted all
 
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
of the expenses with the associated kids
 
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
we reviewed the expenses and determined
 
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
that those kids had expenses over three
 
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
and a half times the average cost per
 
00:17:32.630 --> 00:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
pupil and we could
 
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
then begin to reimburse the school
 
00:17:36.789 --> 00:17:36.799 align:start position:0%
district so the school district expended
 
00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
80 that 80 million dollars of allowable
 
00:17:41.669 --> 00:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
expenses associated with
 
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
those 822 kids i just want to point out
 
00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:45.039 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
80 million dollars of allowable special
 
00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
education expenses so there may have
 
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
been other expenses associated with
 
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
those kids
 
00:17:52.950 --> 00:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
but they were not special education
 
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
specific kids
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
um so of that 80 million and they may
 
00:17:58.630 --> 00:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
have had other expenses but they may
 
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
have not been determined but allowable
 
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
by the departure department
 
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
there are some expenses that are not
 
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
allowable for reimbursement under
 
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
catastrophic stats
 
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
slash state special education aid so
 
00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
the state determined that out of the 80
 
00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
million dollars their proportional
 
00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
share so the amount above the three and
 
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
a half times
 
00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
and then the amount um at 80 should have
 
00:18:20.559 --> 00:18:21.350 align:start position:0%
and then the amount um at 80 should have
been

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
30 million dollars 30 million 800 000
 
00:18:26.549 --> 00:18:26.559 align:start position:0%
that's what the department should have
 
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
paid if we had the full appropriated
 
00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:29.110 align:start position:0%
paid if we had the full appropriated
amount

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
amount
 
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
however that specific year with the
 
00:18:32.789 --> 00:18:32.799 align:start position:0%
department was appropriated in our state
 
00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
budget 22 million dollars
 
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
meaning that we could only pay 22
 
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
22 million dollars divided by 30 million
 
00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:42.960 align:start position:0%
dollars is 72 percent
 
00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
meaning every single school district
 
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
received a proration of 72
 
00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
of the full catastrophic aid bill that
 
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
they would have received
 
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
so had we had the full appropriation
 
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
that specific year
 
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
we would have paid 38 30 million dollars
 
00:18:58.310 --> 00:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
but we only paid 22 million dollars to
 
00:18:59.830 --> 00:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
the school districts
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 21 is the first year in
 
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
very recent memory since
 
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
it looks like 2008 in the spreadsheet
 
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
here that we had enough appropriation to
 
00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:10.799 align:start position:0%
fully fund all of our kids in the state
 
00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:12.440 align:start position:0%
meaning that school districts submitted
 
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
742 eligible kids with 79 million
 
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
dollars of expenses occurred at the
 
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
local level
 
00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
29 million dollars of that was owed to
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
them for the state formula and we had 30
 
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars in appropriation so we
 
00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:27.039 align:start position:0%
do have excess appropriation
 
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
that we um will end up lapsing or
 
00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
paying for or or giving to 402 pla
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
court-ordered placements depending on
 
00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:37.039 align:start position:0%
the available approach
 
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
appropriation in that line so the last
 
00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:40.400 align:start position:0%
two years um
 
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
so those of you that were working on the
 
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
budget in the last two years we were
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
prorated at 94
 
00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:54.559 align:start position:0%
excuse me is it lisa yes okay
 
00:19:57.669 --> 00:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
just just for clarity the school
 
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
districts has to pay
 
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
the 3.5 percent
 
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
the three 3.5 times yes correct so they
 
00:20:13.909 --> 00:20:13.919 align:start position:0%
pay all of the all of their invoices
 
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
to reach cap and above so for the whole
 
00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
year from july 1st to june 30th
 
00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
they pay all their expenses and then
 
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
come july 1st we um
 
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
we review those they submit those to us
 
00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:27.990 align:start position:0%
we review those they submit those to us
by

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
july august and then we review them
 
00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative lynn did that
 
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:50.240 align:start position:0%
grand mute sorry i think it did you um
 
00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
so the i i i as i understand it then the
 
00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:56.799 align:start position:0%
the the allocation if you don't have if
 
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
you can't
 
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
fund 100 it's based on
 
00:21:05.029 --> 00:21:05.039 align:start position:0%
the s on how on the school districts
 
00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
as opposed to the individual
 
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
the individual uh children is
 
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
is that correct yes okay thank you thank
 
00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.789 align:start position:0%
is that correct yes okay thank you thank
you

00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:16.799 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
representative peace thank you madam
 
00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
chair um
 
00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
we tried real hard to fully fund last
 
00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.549 align:start position:0%
we tried real hard to fully fund last
year

00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:26.559 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:21:29.669 --> 00:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at your numbers i see a
 
00:21:29.679 --> 00:21:30.870 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at your numbers i see a
trend

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
trend
 
00:21:33.909 --> 00:21:33.919 align:start position:0%
that though across the state our
 
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
student numbers are decreasing
 
00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:40.400 align:start position:0%
in some places significantly i see a
 
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.190 align:start position:0%
in some places significantly i see a
continued

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
continued
 
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
increase in the numbers of students
 
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
eligible for catastrophic aid and that's
 
00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:49.039 align:start position:0%
just my first
 
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
question is do we know why secondly
 
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i've always been
 
00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
concerned about catastrophic aid
 
00:22:01.029 --> 00:22:01.039 align:start position:0%
or that or special ed aid we call it now
 
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
the manner in which it's paid out now
 
00:22:06.549 --> 00:22:06.559 align:start position:0%
it's paid out
 
00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:09.039 align:start position:0%
and and school districts get a check in
 
00:22:09.039 --> 00:22:09.590 align:start position:0%
and and school districts get a check in
december

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
december
 
00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:12.799 align:start position:0%
of the following year and it comes into
 
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities of school districts as
 
00:22:18.470 --> 00:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
usually they consider it revenue so when
 
00:22:20.789 --> 00:22:20.799 align:start position:0%
you're doing your budget process
 
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
for the year to come
 
00:22:26.549 --> 00:22:26.559 align:start position:0%
if you have students that you had not
 
00:22:26.559 --> 00:22:27.590 align:start position:0%
if you have students that you had not
anticipated

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
anticipated
 
00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:29.919 align:start position:0%
it can throw off your whole budget and
 
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
it's really a hardship
 
00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:34.799 align:start position:0%
for school districts and sometimes
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
they find themselves especially our
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
little school districts
 
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
in a difficult situation has
 
00:22:44.789 --> 00:22:44.799 align:start position:0%
there ever been consideration given
 
00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
to collecting the information um because
 
00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
i know it's it's uploaded
 
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
in in your special ed system
 
00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
is there ever been consideration given
 
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:55.830 align:start position:0%
is there ever been consideration given
to

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:22:59.270 --> 00:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
um payments to payments
 
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
so that school districts would be made
 
00:23:03.029 --> 00:23:03.039 align:start position:0%
more whole
 
00:23:06.549 --> 00:23:06.559 align:start position:0%
during the course of the school year
 
00:23:09.909 --> 00:23:09.919 align:start position:0%
and not have to anticipate um
 
00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
what um the catastrophic aid
 
00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:16.720 align:start position:0%
payment coming to them might be um
 
00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
can you respond i'll let thank you
 
00:23:20.630 --> 00:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
respond a little bit but
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
the first is is it's that's challenging
 
00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
for the department because of the way
 
00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:24.789 align:start position:0%
for the department because of the way
that

00:23:24.789 --> 00:23:24.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:28.400 align:start position:0%
the grant works um if their
 
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
the legislation said to make the payment
 
00:23:33.190 --> 00:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
no matter what the appropriation was
 
00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
um then we would be able to do that but
 
00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:36.710 align:start position:0%
um then we would be able to do that but
because

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:23:38.789 --> 00:23:38.799 align:start position:0%
it has historically been up until this
 
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
year prorated the department of
 
00:23:42.149 --> 00:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
education needs to know the total amount
 
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
of expenses
 
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
before we can reimburse the school
 
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
district so we make sure that we have an
 
00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
even proration across the board um in
 
00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:49.430 align:start position:0%
even proration across the board um in
schools

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
occur different expenses at a different
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
time so they may have a kid that starts
 
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
out for the year for example then they
 
00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:56.630 align:start position:0%
out for the year for example then they
wouldn't

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
submit the catastrophic the kid in in
 
00:24:01.029 --> 00:24:01.039 align:start position:0%
this catastrophic aid pool
 
00:24:02.789 --> 00:24:02.799 align:start position:0%
because they think that you know their
 
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
expenses are not going to be
 
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
the three and a half times because
 
00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:07.120 align:start position:0%
remember three and a half times is about
 
00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:09.440 align:start position:0%
sixty thousand dollars per kid
 
00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:11.919 align:start position:0%
um and then it gets to the point that oh
 
00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
this kid needed
 
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
you know a few additional services or
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
maybe we actually do feel that the best
 
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
the best thing for this child is an
 
00:24:21.269 --> 00:24:21.279 align:start position:0%
out-of-district placement and this kid
 
00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:22.480 align:start position:0%
is now all of a sudden
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
has a higher cost than his original
 
00:24:26.149 --> 00:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
originally anticipated
 
00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
so those costs are not necessarily
 
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
evenly spread out through the year
 
00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:32.240 align:start position:0%
so unless the legislation specifically
 
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
said to pay this
 
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
catastrophic aid bill no matter what it
 
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
was without the proration it wouldn't
 
00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
make sense to do that for the department
 
00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:39.269 align:start position:0%
make sense to do that for the department
so

00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
we would need to change um how the
 
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
actual pool works
 
00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
mary you you were breaking up just a
 
00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
little bit because i was interrupting
 
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
you i'm sorry
 
00:24:59.190 --> 00:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry just um my second question
 
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
about the um
 
00:25:02.549 --> 00:25:02.559 align:start position:0%
it seems like there's a trend that the
 
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
numbers are going up and these are
 
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
significantly disabled children
 
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
um do we have any indication is it being
 
00:25:11.909 --> 00:25:11.919 align:start position:0%
the autism numbers that are increasing
 
00:25:13.029 --> 00:25:13.039 align:start position:0%
so quickly or
 
00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
so the numbers of students that are um
 
00:25:23.669 --> 00:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
being submitted for
 
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
special education aid have decreased but
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
it i believe it's the costs of the um if
 
00:25:30.549 --> 00:25:30.559 align:start position:0%
you look at the numbers for 2021 we're
 
00:25:32.149 --> 00:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
at 742.
 
00:25:34.149 --> 00:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
so those numbers kind of stayed it looks
 
00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
like they stayed somewhat in the same
 
00:25:35.679 --> 00:25:37.190 align:start position:0%
like they stayed somewhat in the same
way

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry that's okay
 
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
i i think the other uh other problem
 
00:25:46.149 --> 00:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
of trying to pay more often is
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
when does a student meet the three
 
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:56.799 align:start position:0%
uh the 3.5 times and so you
 
00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know they they may meet it in the
 
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
first six months or they
 
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
may not meet it until the last two
 
00:26:05.669 --> 00:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
months so
 
00:26:09.029 --> 00:26:09.039 align:start position:0%
it would be um i think it would be very
 
00:26:09.039 --> 00:26:10.390 align:start position:0%
it would be um i think it would be very
difficult

00:26:10.390 --> 00:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
difficult
 
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
to try to
 
00:26:18.149 --> 00:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
try to do something but i think that the
 
00:26:20.710 --> 00:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
most school districts or maybe i don't
 
00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:21.190 align:start position:0%
most school districts or maybe i don't
know

00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
everything but a lot of the school
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
districts do
 
00:26:27.909 --> 00:26:27.919 align:start position:0%
have a reserve fund
 
00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
that they put aside just for
 
00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
uh special education needs for
 
00:26:38.549 --> 00:26:38.559 align:start position:0%
you know to to support it until such
 
00:26:38.559 --> 00:26:39.510 align:start position:0%
you know to to support it until such
time

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:26:42.789 --> 00:26:42.799 align:start position:0%
as they um as they get the uh the money
 
00:26:42.799 --> 00:26:43.269 align:start position:0%
as they um as they get the uh the money
from

00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh from the state for for uh
 
00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
special education aid
 
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
yes there are many districts that will
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%
develop their own special education
 
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
trust funds
 
00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
for situations just as you mentioned
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
okay i don't see any further questions
 
00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:03.909 align:start position:0%
okay i don't see any further questions
so

00:27:03.909 --> 00:27:03.919 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
if you wouldn't mind we'll ask you to go
 
00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:07.590 align:start position:0%
if you wouldn't mind we'll ask you to go
ahead

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
00:27:11.029 --> 00:27:11.039 align:start position:0%
all right um so i don't think
 
00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
i i'm the last part of this section
 
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
shows you
 
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
um by town how much was put out for
 
00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
um special education aid and the totals
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
for those each district that put in for
 
00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
special education aid
 
00:27:27.029 --> 00:27:27.039 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to go through each one for
 
00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
you but and there's two pages of those
 
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
and did you have any other questions i
 
00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
have something to do
 
00:27:40.149 --> 00:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
lisa would like to add something lisa
 
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
moody was our fiscal person and um has
 
00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
moved to a different job
 
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
she's been assisting us as we work on
 
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
these physical pieces so if you wanted
 
00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
to add something
 
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
right so um so i just text caitlyn and
 
00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
asks as a reminder so we
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
also use um
 
00:27:58.549 --> 00:27:58.559 align:start position:0%
the um i keep on call it cat aids so i
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
apologize the special education aid
 
00:28:03.669 --> 00:28:03.679 align:start position:0%
for the budget we use that budgeted
 
00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
amount to meet
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
our um our fiscal our maintenance fiscal
 
00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
support that we need for our ida grant
 
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
which is a grant that we give out to
 
00:28:16.149 --> 00:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
it's a 40 i think 47 million
 
00:28:17.669 --> 00:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
grand that we give out to the school
 
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
districts we use
 
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
the spend aid amount on budget amount to
 
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
help meet
 
00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
our state fiscal support
 
00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
so it's important that we keep that
 
00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
budgeted amount and not
 
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
lower it because if we lower it then we
 
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:34.310 align:start position:0%
lower it because if we lower it then we
could

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
any questions on that yes representative
 
00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:43.990 align:start position:0%
any questions on that yes representative
heath

00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
heath
 
00:28:46.389 --> 00:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
oh thank you you know that was a really
 
00:28:46.399 --> 00:28:47.110 align:start position:0%
oh thank you you know that was a really
critically

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
critically
 
00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
important point um in terms of
 
00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort
 
00:28:55.029 --> 00:28:55.039 align:start position:0%
for those we get a pretty sizable
 
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
amount of special ed federal funding
 
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
um not exactly what we'd like to have of
 
00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:01.830 align:start position:0%
um not exactly what we'd like to have of
course

00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
course
 
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
but um what is the level of maintenance
 
00:29:08.149 --> 00:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
of effort that you need to see
 
00:29:12.149 --> 00:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
um from the general fund budget that is
 
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
a great
 
00:29:15.269 --> 00:29:15.279 align:start position:0%
question i do not have the answer off
 
00:29:16.389 --> 00:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
the top of my head
 
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
bridget and i are working on that
 
00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
tomorrow um
 
00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:23.039 align:start position:0%
but we use the budgeted amount for um
 
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
that we have for our for the
 
00:29:26.549 --> 00:29:26.559 align:start position:0%
court-ordered students
 
00:29:28.470 --> 00:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
and we also use a portion of the
 
00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:29.909 align:start position:0%
and we also use a portion of the
adequacy

00:29:29.909 --> 00:29:29.919 align:start position:0%
adequacy
 
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
funds and you should probably mention
 
00:29:35.110 --> 00:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
colvid for this year
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
representative uh lynn
 
00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
yes i you know i'm sorry i could you i i
 
00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
i don't think i really did
 
00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
understand that last part that you that
 
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
if i was understanding you you're what
 
00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
you're saying is that you use
 
00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
some part of the special education
 
00:29:56.789 --> 00:29:56.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:58.789 --> 00:29:58.799 align:start position:0%
for something beyond what has been shown
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
on the on the
 
00:30:03.269 --> 00:30:03.279 align:start position:0%
on the on the formula of the 3.5 over
 
00:30:05.669 --> 00:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
3.5 times
 
00:30:08.549 --> 00:30:08.559 align:start position:0%
times 80 is that correct no for our
 
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort that we
 
00:30:12.149 --> 00:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
um have with the federal government for
 
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
our idea grant we
 
00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
list she was just stating that we list
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
special education aid
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
and we list the 402 costs that go
 
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
forward so both of those go into
 
00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
the the um and the maintenance of effort
 
00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:27.520 align:start position:0%
that we have to file with them so
 
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
it wasn't that we used the funds it was
 
00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:30.799 align:start position:0%
just i see
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
that we list the budgeted amounts yeah i
 
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
see okay no i now i understand thank you
 
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
representative pucco oh thank you madam
 
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:40.630 align:start position:0%
representative pucco oh thank you madam
chair

00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
um can i can we go back one slide to the
 
00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:44.630 align:start position:0%
um can i can we go back one slide to the
formula

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
formula
 
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
please and um
 
00:30:52.149 --> 00:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
that's that's fine right there this is
 
00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
probably right over my head but
 
00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
how do we determine that the total 99
 
00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:57.990 align:start position:0%
how do we determine that the total 99
000

00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
000
 
00:31:00.549 --> 00:31:00.559 align:start position:0%
how do we arrive at that figure that's
 
00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
what that is um
 
00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:03.519 align:start position:0%
that's what we're saying that the
 
00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
district spent on the student they spent
 
00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
the ninety nine thousand four eight
 
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
hundred and forty five dollars on the
 
00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:10.310 align:start position:0%
hundred and forty five dollars on the
students

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
example in this example so that was just
 
00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
so we just
 
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
took an example of what a district could
 
00:31:17.509 --> 00:31:17.519 align:start position:0%
have okay
 
00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
if that student incurred those costs of
 
00:31:20.159 --> 00:31:20.950 align:start position:0%
if that student incurred those costs of
98

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
98
 
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
99 845 what it would look like as it
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
played out
 
00:31:27.029 --> 00:31:27.039 align:start position:0%
through the formula oh okay thank you i
 
00:31:28.389 --> 00:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
thought that was something
 
00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:29.919 align:start position:0%
a formula that was in statute or
 
00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
something nope so
 
00:31:33.509 --> 00:31:33.519 align:start position:0%
it just shows how that formula plays out
 
00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
with these numbers
 
00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
right representative bucco so how it
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
works for is so a school district will
 
00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:39.519 align:start position:0%
go through
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
a year knowing a kid has an iep and
 
00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
knowing what is in the kids iep
 
00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
and recording the different expenses
 
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
that they are occurring associated with
 
00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
that kid
 
00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
so at the end of the year they have
 
00:31:51.509 --> 00:31:51.519 align:start position:0%
caitlyn davis's iep
 
00:31:53.029 --> 00:31:53.039 align:start position:0%
and it says all of the services that
 
00:31:54.549 --> 00:31:54.559 align:start position:0%
caitlin davis received
 
00:31:57.509 --> 00:31:57.519 align:start position:0%
and it has um the costs associated with
 
00:31:58.710 --> 00:31:58.720 align:start position:0%
those services
 
00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
that is submitted to the department of
 
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
education with a very thick stack of
 
00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
invoices that
 
00:32:05.669 --> 00:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
show that all of those services were
 
00:32:07.509 --> 00:32:07.519 align:start position:0%
paid for and then
 
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
um becky and lisa and and bridget have a
 
00:32:12.549 --> 00:32:12.559 align:start position:0%
whole team of staff that review
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
all of those invoices for the different
 
00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
districts and determined that those
 
00:32:18.789 --> 00:32:18.799 align:start position:0%
expenses were allowable and appropriate
 
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
for the child's iep
 
00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
and they come up with a total determined
 
00:32:24.789 --> 00:32:24.799 align:start position:0%
amount that is an allowable amount
 
00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:26.559 align:start position:0%
that the state of new hampshire agrees
 
00:32:28.549 --> 00:32:28.559 align:start position:0%
that was appropriate for that kid
 
00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
so in this for this specific example
 
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
caitlyn davis may have had 120
 
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
20 120 000 worth of expenses associated
 
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
with her
 
00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
some of them might be just related to
 
00:32:41.509 --> 00:32:41.519 align:start position:0%
regular education so that would not be
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
allowable for submission and then maybe
 
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
caitlyn davis had reimbursement for a
 
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
service that the department of education
 
00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow
 
00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
maybe they reimburse the school had a
 
00:32:52.789 --> 00:32:52.799 align:start position:0%
cost associated with me that maybe
 
00:32:54.549 --> 00:32:54.559 align:start position:0%
wasn't my iep
 
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
as provided it but if it wasn't not in
 
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
my iep it's not eligible for
 
00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:59.029 align:start position:0%
my iep it's not eligible for
reimbursement

00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
reimbursement
 
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
so at the end of the day per the review
 
00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
of becky and her team they've decided
 
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
that caitlyn davis has 99
 
00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
000 worth of expenses associated with me
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
then they say all right well how much
 
00:33:11.909 --> 00:33:11.919 align:start position:0%
was the cap and they take the cap
 
00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
which was fifty nine thousand dollars
 
00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
three and a half times the average cost
 
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
for people and saying
 
00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
the district would be responsible for
 
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
that forty thousand dollars and then we
 
00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
put it through the formula that is
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
the statutory formula okay
 
00:33:27.669 --> 00:33:27.679 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much i i i was just i
 
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
i did um i didn't know if that 99 was
 
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
um an imposed cap or something but it's
 
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
new yeah this is
 
00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
an example thank you
 
00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:40.559 align:start position:0%
petry you have a question yes madam
 
00:33:41.350 --> 00:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
chair thank you
 
00:33:44.549 --> 00:33:44.559 align:start position:0%
uh i just i heard uh 402 mention that's
 
00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
court appointed uh
 
00:33:49.029 --> 00:33:49.039 align:start position:0%
placements uh could you explain that a
 
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:57.990 --> 00:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
say i don't want to say something wrong
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
now i'm a little gun-shy
 
00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:05.669 --> 00:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
so court order works a little bit
 
00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
different than special education aid so
 
00:34:08.950 --> 00:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
a court order
 
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
is um three times the estimated cost per
 
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:12.869 align:start position:0%
is um three times the estimated cost per
pupil

00:34:12.869 --> 00:34:12.879 align:start position:0%
pupil
 
00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
and and it works again it works
 
00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
different so
 
00:34:19.990 --> 00:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
once the student reached cap then the
 
00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
district submits invoices to us and then
 
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
and we pay however much is submitted to
 
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
us there's no cap
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
on how much we paid to the district for
 
00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
court ordered placements
 
00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
there's no timeline so they could submit
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
a student
 
00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
from the previous year or two years ago
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
and we would still pay it and it's in
 
00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
oh so and so if there's it's there's an
 
00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
rsa that if they're
 
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
left over on special education aid funds
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
that it gets put into um the court order
 
00:34:57.119 --> 00:34:57.990 align:start position:0%
that it gets put into um the court order
funds

00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
to be paid out each year each year
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
yes thank you can i just ask can you
 
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
just tell us
 
00:35:15.589 --> 00:35:15.599 align:start position:0%
generally is is the
 
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
is the issue of you know is this is this
 
00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.030 align:start position:0%
is the issue of you know is this is this
a

00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:22.160 align:start position:0%
has has the law as the local district
 
00:35:25.510 --> 00:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
properly categorized um
 
00:35:27.589 --> 00:35:27.599 align:start position:0%
special education expenses or not
 
00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
properly categorize them
 
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
is that something that you know is sort
 
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
of a
 
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
an ongoing issue of contention between
 
00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
the state department and districts or
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
or is that run sort of pretty smoothly
 
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
um i would say that it's pretty smooth
 
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
that's the process that we talked about
 
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
where caitlin mentioned we have a team
 
00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:45.430 align:start position:0%
where caitlin mentioned we have a team
of

00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
um people who come in and they review
 
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
all of the invoices
 
00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
um and then what happens yep and they
 
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
they look at the invoices that are sent
 
00:35:55.109 --> 00:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
to us and they look at the iep
 
00:35:57.109 --> 00:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
and they if there are questions we
 
00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
always seek um clarification from the
 
00:35:59.910 --> 00:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
district but the
 
00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
the invoices need to match up with what
 
00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
is in the iep and what the team has
 
00:36:03.359 --> 00:36:04.150 align:start position:0%
is in the iep and what the team has
determined

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:04.160 align:start position:0%
determined
 
00:36:07.349 --> 00:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh could you give us an example if um
 
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
let's say i i have um a severe
 
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
speech problem okay and uh
 
00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:25.680 align:start position:0%
could you give us an example of and
 
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
that's what my iep is for
 
00:36:31.349 --> 00:36:31.359 align:start position:0%
could you give an example of what
 
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:34.720 align:start position:0%
might not be
 
00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
agreeable in that case so the only
 
00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
things that would not be
 
00:36:41.190 --> 00:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
um approved allowable are things that
 
00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:42.640 align:start position:0%
are not within the iep
 
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
so if you had a speech person and and
 
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
and they submitted for
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
um something that was not listed in the
 
00:36:51.510 --> 00:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
iep say they listed three services per
 
00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:52.069 align:start position:0%
iep say they listed three services per
week

00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
week
 
00:36:53.589 --> 00:36:53.599 align:start position:0%
for that speech person and then they
 
00:36:55.349 --> 00:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
asked us for reimbursement for five
 
00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
services a week
 
00:36:58.390 --> 00:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
we would say no because it doesn't align
 
00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
with what the iep states
 
00:37:01.349 --> 00:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
it states that you're gonna provide
 
00:37:03.270 --> 00:37:03.280 align:start position:0%
three we're going to reimburse you for
 
00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
those three
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
um that might be an example typically
 
00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:10.160 align:start position:0%
they don't ask for anything really
 
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:12.160 align:start position:0%
extraneous but it but it does need to
 
00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other questions
 
00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none i'm sure that everyone will
 
00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
pour through how much
 
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:30.560 align:start position:0%

yes we are wonderful thank you uh
 
00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:55.200 align:start position:0%
all right so as part of uh our funding
 
00:39:57.349 --> 00:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
for career and tech education
 
00:39:59.750 --> 00:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh there is a line item referred to as
 
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
uh tuition and transportation
 
00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:05.480 align:start position:0%
and this tuition and transportation is
 
00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:06.710 align:start position:0%
and this tuition and transportation is
exclusively

00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:06.720 align:start position:0%
exclusively
 
00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for uh cte
 
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
students who are attending programs
 
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
outside of their district
 
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
uh so i need to make sure that's very
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
clear that for example manchester
 
00:40:21.589 --> 00:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
has multiple high schools and if
 
00:40:23.349 --> 00:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
students are attending
 
00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
manchester west but then travel to mst
 
00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
for cte
 
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
that those costs are not included as
 
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
part of this those are completely
 
00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:33.910 align:start position:0%
part of this those are completely
locally

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
locally
 
00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh subsidized uh transportation costs
 
00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
so it is only for students sending
 
00:40:42.069 --> 00:40:42.079 align:start position:0%
schools sending students to out of
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
district korean tech education centers
 
00:40:47.829 --> 00:40:47.839 align:start position:0%
the transportation portion is reimbursed
 
00:40:49.829 --> 00:40:49.839 align:start position:0%
to the sending school
 
00:40:51.589 --> 00:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
they outlay the money for transportation
 
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
and they are reimbursed
 
00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
the tuition portion is reimbursed
 
00:40:58.630 --> 00:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
directly to the cte center
 
00:40:59.829 --> 00:40:59.839 align:start position:0%
so the money goes from two different
 
00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:03.440 align:start position:0%
places it is reimbursed each year
 
00:41:05.349 --> 00:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
on or before december 1st for the
 
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
previous year
 
00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:09.839 align:start position:0%
so this past december we just reimbursed
 
00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
the schools
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
for the previous year's tuition
 
00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
as detailed in ed rule 1305
 
00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
the transportation portion is reimbursed
 
00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:24.950 align:start position:0%
the transportation portion is reimbursed
first

00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
from the fund and then the remaining
 
00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:28.630 align:start position:0%
from the fund and then the remaining
dollars

00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:28.640 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:31.599 align:start position:0%
are utilized to reimburse up to 75
 
00:41:31.599 --> 00:41:32.630 align:start position:0%
are utilized to reimburse up to 75
percent

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:41:35.990 --> 00:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
of the tuition cost if
 
00:41:37.589 --> 00:41:37.599 align:start position:0%
there is not sufficient funds to
 
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
reimburse the full 75 percent of the
 
00:41:41.829 --> 00:41:41.839 align:start position:0%
tuition cost
 
00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
then the total remaining is divided by
 
00:41:47.109 --> 00:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
the number of eligible students
 
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
and a set amount per student is sent to
 
00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
the schools
 
00:41:55.910 --> 00:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
prior to 2014 it was done proportionally
 
00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
but the rule was changed in 2014 so it
 
00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
is just a flat amount per student
 
00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
that is then distributed to each of the
 
00:42:08.309 --> 00:42:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:11.589 --> 00:42:11.599 align:start position:0%
so excuse me before you go on absolutely
 
00:42:14.790 --> 00:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
is the is the school dist is the sending
 
00:42:17.349 --> 00:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
school district then responsible
 
00:42:19.589 --> 00:42:19.599 align:start position:0%
for the difference between what the
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
state provides
 
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
and what they have identified as the
 
00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:24.230 align:start position:0%
and what they have identified as the
cost

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
yes so uh the initially the school the
 
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
sending school district
 
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
will pay 25 with the state paying up to
 
00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:33.190 align:start position:0%
will pay 25 with the state paying up to
75

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
75
 
00:42:35.829 --> 00:42:35.839 align:start position:0%
once the full cycle comes through if the
 
00:42:35.839 --> 00:42:36.630 align:start position:0%
once the full cycle comes through if the
75

00:42:36.630 --> 00:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
75
 
00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
is not available the sending school
 
00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you you're very welcome
 
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh so the next few slides are for uh
 
00:42:50.630 --> 00:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
more for informational purposes for you
 
00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:51.839 align:start position:0%
that you'll see when you have the
 
00:42:51.839 --> 00:42:52.630 align:start position:0%
that you'll see when you have the
packets

00:42:52.630 --> 00:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
packets
 
00:42:55.109 --> 00:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
uh we've included a map to show where
 
00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
all of the schools are
 
00:42:59.589 --> 00:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
and this map includes not only our cte
 
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
centers but also the community colleges
 
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
that are affiliated with career and tech
 
00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:06.870 align:start position:0%
that are affiliated with career and tech
programs

00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:43:09.030 --> 00:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
so the different colors are the regions
 
00:43:09.910 --> 00:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
so each
 
00:43:12.309 --> 00:43:12.319 align:start position:0%
high school in a region is assigned to a
 
00:43:13.349 --> 00:43:13.359 align:start position:0%
cte center
 
00:43:15.750 --> 00:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
so you can see how the distribution is
 
00:43:17.829 --> 00:43:17.839 align:start position:0%
amongst our 20 regions
 
00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
five of those regions are in vermont
 
00:43:22.309 --> 00:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
because our high schools are actually
 
00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
closer to vermont cte centers
 
00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
than they are to new hampshire-based
 
00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:27.990 align:start position:0%
than they are to new hampshire-based
ones

00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
ones
 
00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
so our students travel over to vermont
 
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
for their cte programs
 
00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:34.960 align:start position:0%
and in that case the new hampshire
 
00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:35.829 align:start position:0%
and in that case the new hampshire
school

00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:43:38.550 --> 00:43:38.560 align:start position:0%
pays the full tuition and then they are
 
00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
reimbursed from the state so those are
 
00:43:41.910 --> 00:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
the only instances where
 
00:43:43.589 --> 00:43:43.599 align:start position:0%
the sending school is reimbursed for the
 
00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
tuition from the state because we do not
 
00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
send our
 
00:43:49.589 --> 00:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:51.589 --> 00:43:51.599 align:start position:0%
uh representative heath you had a
 
00:43:52.870 --> 00:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
question i'm sorry
 
00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
that's okay i do indeed um cte
 
00:43:59.190 --> 00:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
is such a magnificent program um
 
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm happy to hear that um we did
 
00:44:02.319 --> 00:44:02.710 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm happy to hear that um we did
try

00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
try
 
00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
and increase the funding during the last
 
00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:06.790 align:start position:0%
and increase the funding during the last
session

00:44:06.790 --> 00:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
but it still troubles me that we did not
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
we weren't able to fully
 
00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
fund the tuition and transportation
 
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
so the school districts didn't get that
 
00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
full amount um
 
00:44:21.109 --> 00:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
tell me about your numbers i'm on an
 
00:44:21.119 --> 00:44:21.990 align:start position:0%
tell me about your numbers i'm on an
international

00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
international
 
00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
committee with ncsl and we're really
 
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
talking about the importance and the
 
00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
need to really fully expand
 
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
cte programs how are our numbers
 
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
enrollments across the state are they
 
00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:36.790 align:start position:0%
enrollments across the state are they
increasing

00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
increasing
 
00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
are we seeing more students or just
 
00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
what's happening sure no thank you for
 
00:44:43.589 --> 00:44:43.599 align:start position:0%
asking uh and yes
 
00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
um although as you're probably aware our
 
00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
high school population numbers are
 
00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:49.589 align:start position:0%
high school population numbers are
decreasing

00:44:49.589 --> 00:44:49.599 align:start position:0%
decreasing
 
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
our cte numbers are actually increasing
 
00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:52.870 align:start position:0%
our cte numbers are actually increasing
um

00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:55.349 --> 00:44:55.359 align:start position:0%
we're close to a total of about 10 000
 
00:44:58.710 --> 00:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
students participating in cte each year
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
um and and so that number you know this
 
00:45:03.829 --> 00:45:03.839 align:start position:0%
this year is a little strange
 
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
for a variety of reasons but we
 
00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
we have been watching our cte numbers
 
00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:11.589 align:start position:0%
we have been watching our cte numbers
increase

00:45:11.589 --> 00:45:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
and we are still we are attempting to
 
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
continue that increase
 
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
actively uh trying to find ways to
 
00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
increase those numbers
 
00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:20.960 align:start position:0%
madam chair if i could just ask a
 
00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up please certainly
 
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
um that was great um that and that's
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
good news um
 
00:45:30.309 --> 00:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
tell me about kyle perkins funding has
 
00:45:30.319 --> 00:45:31.270 align:start position:0%
tell me about kyle perkins funding has
that

00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
risen um and is it helping you in your
 
00:45:34.319 --> 00:45:34.950 align:start position:0%
risen um and is it helping you in your
efforts

00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
efforts
 
00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
or where are we now in terms of federal
 
00:45:38.390 --> 00:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
funding for
 
00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
c c t e centers yes so
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh that also is rising so we're very
 
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
happy with that as well
 
00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
in our our current year's allocation is
 
00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:49.510 align:start position:0%
in our our current year's allocation is
uh

00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
just over 6.1 million dollars and we
 
00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
just received our estimate for next year
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
which will be 6.5 million
 
00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh so federally uh they are working on
 
00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
increasing it
 
00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
um there is a push to double it
 
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
at the federal level um we're very
 
00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
hopeful because our new
 
00:46:13.349 --> 00:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
um newly added secretary of education
 
00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
is a cte graduate great uh
 
00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:18.160 align:start position:0%
so we are very excited and he is a
 
00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
community college graduate as well so
 
00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
we're very excited about the opportunity
 
00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:21.750 align:start position:0%
we're very excited about the opportunity
that

00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh he might increase that funding uh but
 
00:46:25.349 --> 00:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
so it is 6.5 million dollars that is
 
00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
allocated to our schools
 
00:46:33.349 --> 00:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
that provide a large supplement and
 
00:46:35.910 --> 00:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
that's what the intention is
 
00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
if on the off chance perkins disappeared
 
00:46:41.589 --> 00:46:41.599 align:start position:0%
the intent is that our cte program
 
00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
should still be able to maintain
 
00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:46.000 align:start position:0%
and continue so the perkins is used for
 
00:46:50.069 --> 00:46:50.079 align:start position:0%
add-ons new additional equipment etc
 
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah um i i
 
00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate the fact that um
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
cte student enrollment is increasing
 
00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
but i am very distressed
 
00:47:07.349 --> 00:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
about the fact that the sending school
 
00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
enrollment is not
 
00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
necessarily doing as well as
 
00:47:18.550 --> 00:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
i think it should and so
 
00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:22.400 align:start position:0%
um what what are
 
00:47:25.589 --> 00:47:25.599 align:start position:0%
is the state doing anything to
 
00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
help that uh
 
00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for asking we we are actively
 
00:47:34.870 --> 00:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
working on this uh we have just come we
 
00:47:36.390 --> 00:47:36.400 align:start position:0%
had hired last year
 
00:47:38.549 --> 00:47:38.559 align:start position:0%
a consultant to work with us to dig deep
 
00:47:40.549 --> 00:47:40.559 align:start position:0%
into that question
 
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
they've just finished their report
 
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
there were a couple of typos that were
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
being fixed and it will be published
 
00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
this week actually
 
00:47:51.829 --> 00:47:51.839 align:start position:0%
up on our website and distributed uh
 
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
through a press release
 
00:47:56.790 --> 00:47:56.800 align:start position:0%
we found that about 75 of the students
 
00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
participating in cte are from the host
 
00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:00.640 align:start position:0%
high schools
 
00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
um now the fact that they're only there
 
00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
are 28 host high schools
 
00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
and well over a hundred school districts
 
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
00:48:10.309 --> 00:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
there you can obviously there's a
 
00:48:12.069 --> 00:48:12.079 align:start position:0%
disconnect there somewhere
 
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
and so we are uh part of the
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
the consultant's work was to now go okay
 
00:48:20.549 --> 00:48:20.559 align:start position:0%
what were the issues why are students
 
00:48:22.790 --> 00:48:22.800 align:start position:0%
from sending schools not participating
 
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
and start working with our regional cte
 
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
centers and our school districts
 
00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
to combat those issues and find out
 
00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
what's the best way to get more students
 
00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:32.230 align:start position:0%
what's the best way to get more students
enrolled

00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
enrolled
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
we have multiple options um based on the
 
00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:35.750 align:start position:0%
we have multiple options um based on the
challenges

00:48:35.750 --> 00:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
challenges
 
00:48:38.069 --> 00:48:38.079 align:start position:0%
and we're about to start working with
 
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
some of our cte districts to figure it
 
00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:41.750 align:start position:0%
some of our cte districts to figure it
out

00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:48:45.349 --> 00:48:45.359 align:start position:0%
um would you mind
 
00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh sending that or sending that study to
 
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
mickey so that we
 
00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
he can forward it to us because
 
00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:55.589 align:start position:0%
he can forward it to us because
absolutely

00:48:55.589 --> 00:48:55.599 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:48:59.670 --> 00:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
for i live in a
 
00:49:03.030 --> 00:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
area where we don't have any sending
 
00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:04.230 align:start position:0%
area where we don't have any sending
students

00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:49:07.829 --> 00:49:07.839 align:start position:0%
and everyone that attends our
 
00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
high school has the opportunity to
 
00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:15.200 align:start position:0%
to participate in cte but that's
 
00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
not the norm and uh
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
so i just i just need to i need to dig
 
00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
into this a little bit more because it
 
00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
it may be
 
00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
maybe you know obviously not for this
 
00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
year but maybe for next year
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
we might need to change some
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
legislation to uh to try to
 
00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
even out the um
 
00:49:45.589 --> 00:49:45.599 align:start position:0%
attendance at ctes
 
00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm happy to provide whatever
 
00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
information i can as part of that
 
00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:50.390 align:start position:0%
information i can as part of that
conversation

00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative murray
 
00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and apologies for
 
00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
being late that bill went way longer
 
00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
than it should have especially since it
 
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
passed unanimously
 
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
but everyone has to talk um i'm maybe
 
00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
jumping the gun
 
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
with all your students will you be going
 
00:50:09.030 --> 00:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
over areas of study you know areas that
 
00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
are particularly appealing to
 
00:50:12.309 --> 00:50:12.319 align:start position:0%
the different students that are coming
 
00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
to you thank you
 
00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
coming along so thank you uh i can
 
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
certainly talk about that and actually
 
00:50:18.069 --> 00:50:18.079 align:start position:0%
the next
 
00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
two pages in my presentation and that
 
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
you'll have in your packet
 
00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh is the grid uh that we publish it's
 
00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
also on our website
 
00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
that will it lists across the top let me
 
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
shrink this just a little tiny bit
 
00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh it lists across the top all of our
 
00:50:35.349 --> 00:50:35.359 align:start position:0%
sending all of our centers
 
00:50:38.390 --> 00:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
and then down the left hand side uh it
 
00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
lists all of our programs of study
 
00:50:44.309 --> 00:50:44.319 align:start position:0%
uh and they're broken into 16
 
00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:46.960 align:start position:0%
large categories so for example in the
 
00:50:49.349 --> 00:50:49.359 align:start position:0%
agriculture food and natural resources
 
00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
we have assorted agricultural programs
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
environmental studies
 
00:50:55.670 --> 00:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
forestry animal sciences all fit in that
 
00:50:57.750 --> 00:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
large broad category
 
00:51:00.549 --> 00:51:00.559 align:start position:0%
uh and then uh and then it just works
 
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
its way down
 
00:51:05.829 --> 00:51:05.839 align:start position:0%
our construction arts and technology
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
business education finance
 
00:51:12.069 --> 00:51:12.079 align:start position:0%
government health science hospitality
 
00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
human services
 
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
which in new hampshire is strictly
 
00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:17.190 align:start position:0%
which in new hampshire is strictly
cosmetology

00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
cosmetology
 
00:51:20.309 --> 00:51:20.319 align:start position:0%
i.t law public policy
 
00:51:24.309 --> 00:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
security manufacturing marketing stem
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
and transportation uh and so
 
00:51:29.829 --> 00:51:29.839 align:start position:0%
each of our centers has a different mix
 
00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
of programs
 
00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
those programs are locally based so
 
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
each for every four years a school must
 
00:51:40.069 --> 00:51:40.079 align:start position:0%
conduct a local needs assessment
 
00:51:43.349 --> 00:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
uh where it is determined what uh
 
00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:46.720 align:start position:0%
the needs of that local community are
 
00:51:49.589 --> 00:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
to that could support the cte programs
 
00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
the perkins funds
 
00:51:54.150 --> 00:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
are very specific in that they are only
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
eligible for programs
 
00:51:59.670 --> 00:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
that are high skill high need
 
00:52:03.109 --> 00:52:03.119 align:start position:0%
high wage and so programs must fit into
 
00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
one of those categories
 
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh and i hate to use the example because
 
00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
i do come
 
00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
from a from an art artsy background a
 
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
theater program for example
 
00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
in new york city would be eligible for
 
00:52:19.270 --> 00:52:19.280 align:start position:0%
cte funds because
 
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:21.440 align:start position:0%
there's obviously a community for it in
 
00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:23.359 align:start position:0%
new hampshire we have a couple of them
 
00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
but we cannot add additional programs
 
00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
because new hampshire as a community
 
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
will not support 75 graduates every year
 
00:52:32.069 --> 00:52:32.079 align:start position:0%
in theater arts
 
00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:34.000 align:start position:0%
we just don't have the economy to
 
00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
support that
 
00:52:37.829 --> 00:52:37.839 align:start position:0%
so that's part of the local needs
 
00:52:39.109 --> 00:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
assessment to make sure that we can
 
00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturing health science
 
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
auto tech are very popular programs in
 
00:52:49.109 --> 00:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:52:50.630 --> 00:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
they're very well supported by the
 
00:52:53.589 --> 00:52:53.599 align:start position:0%
industries in new hampshire
 
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
we could theoretically open a health
 
00:52:57.910 --> 00:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
science program at every center
 
00:53:00.150 --> 00:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
and not produce enough graduates to meet
 
00:53:01.589 --> 00:53:01.599 align:start position:0%
the health industry needs
 
00:53:05.589 --> 00:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
our auto programs similarly fill up
 
00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:09.670 align:start position:0%
our auto programs similarly fill up
consistently

00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
consistently
 
00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
our students work hand in hand with the
 
00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
local dealership associations and all
 
00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
walk right into
 
00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
jobs or they can then continue on to the
 
00:53:19.109 --> 00:53:19.119 align:start position:0%
community college
 
00:53:22.470 --> 00:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:24.230 --> 00:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh representative murray you have a
 
00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:26.950 align:start position:0%
uh representative murray you have a
question

00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
no i'm so sorry just distracted forgot
 
00:53:31.829 --> 00:53:31.839 align:start position:0%
put my hand down so sorry apologies
 
00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:34.880 align:start position:0%
you don't you don't have to apologize
 
00:53:37.670 --> 00:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
we all have these problems okay i do
 
00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
have a couple of
 
00:53:42.069 --> 00:53:42.079 align:start position:0%
questions um on the
 
00:53:45.829 --> 00:53:45.839 align:start position:0%
careertech advisory boards for
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
schools that receive students from other
 
00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
areas are there
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
advisory board members from the
 
00:53:58.470 --> 00:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
sending schools uh
 
00:54:01.349 --> 00:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
yes so each uh there are two separate
 
00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
types of advisory boards at the cte
 
00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:03.670 align:start position:0%
types of advisory boards at the cte
centers

00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
centers
 
00:54:05.829 --> 00:54:05.839 align:start position:0%
there's the regional advisory board
 
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
which is at the center level and that is
 
00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
made up of representatives from all of
 
00:54:11.349 --> 00:54:11.359 align:start position:0%
the sending districts
 
00:54:14.549 --> 00:54:14.559 align:start position:0%
so it uh ideally is somebody from
 
00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:16.640 align:start position:0%
the school as well as somebody from the
 
00:54:18.790 --> 00:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
school board
 
00:54:21.910 --> 00:54:21.920 align:start position:0%
and then large employers from the entire
 
00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:22.710 align:start position:0%
and then large employers from the entire
region

00:54:22.710 --> 00:54:22.720 align:start position:0%
region
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
and that is the group that looks at the
 
00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:26.240 align:start position:0%
school as a whole
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
talks about what types of programs
 
00:54:30.549 --> 00:54:30.559 align:start position:0%
should be offered at the school
 
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
as well as works on recruitment
 
00:54:35.030 --> 00:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
opportunities for the students from the
 
00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
sending schools
 
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
each of the programs then also has an
 
00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
advisory board
 
00:54:42.549 --> 00:54:42.559 align:start position:0%
made up of industry industry people from
 
00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
the entire region
 
00:54:49.030 --> 00:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
okay so the sending schools are in fact
 
00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
represented on the regional board
 
00:54:55.589 --> 00:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
they are okay thank you
 
00:54:59.430 --> 00:54:59.440 align:start position:0%
and when the four-year study is done
 
00:55:02.789 --> 00:55:02.799 align:start position:0%
um do they look at communities
 
00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:06.079 align:start position:0%
outside of where the career tech center
 
00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
is located
 
00:55:10.069 --> 00:55:10.079 align:start position:0%
uh in other words out to the sending
 
00:55:10.079 --> 00:55:11.349 align:start position:0%
uh in other words out to the sending
schools

00:55:11.349 --> 00:55:11.359 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:55:14.069 --> 00:55:14.079 align:start position:0%
yes the local needs assessment is for
 
00:55:15.910 --> 00:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
their entire catchment region
 
00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:20.559 align:start position:0%
so as you saw on that map
 
00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
uh so for example this this is concord's
 
00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:26.000 align:start position:0%
region they have sent they have students
 
00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
coming from high schools in all of these
 
00:55:30.069 --> 00:55:30.079 align:start position:0%
towns so their regional advisory board
 
00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
is made up of
 
00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
representatives from all of those
 
00:55:34.470 --> 00:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
sending communities and their local
 
00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:35.030 align:start position:0%
sending communities and their local
needs

00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
needs
 
00:55:37.109 --> 00:55:37.119 align:start position:0%
assessment is because that's where those
 
00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:39.280 align:start position:0%
students will be going back to work
 
00:55:42.710 --> 00:55:42.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much yes um
 
00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
and and they may also extend beyond that
 
00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:46.240 align:start position:0%
you know we
 
00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
we look at depending on the region
 
00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
if they're looking for a new program we
 
00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
we can take into account
 
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
average drive time if somebody is you
 
00:55:57.910 --> 00:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
know averaging 20 to 30 minute drive
 
00:55:57.920 --> 00:55:58.870 align:start position:0%
know averaging 20 to 30 minute drive
time

00:55:58.870 --> 00:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
what are the job opportunities within
 
00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
that catchment area to offer
 
00:56:05.589 --> 00:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
a program thank you
 
00:56:09.109 --> 00:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
yes and so for example our newest
 
00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
program that we
 
00:56:13.349 --> 00:56:13.359 align:start position:0%
just launched is aviation um and that is
 
00:56:14.549 --> 00:56:14.559 align:start position:0%
because the faa
 
00:56:17.030 --> 00:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
actually approached us that they have a
 
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
large need over the next 10 years for
 
00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:21.030 align:start position:0%
large need over the next 10 years for
employees

00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
and so we have launched this year one
 
00:56:27.109 --> 00:56:27.119 align:start position:0%
we will have possibly two additionals
 
00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
that add next year
 
00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
and we have three more schools backing
 
00:56:33.030 --> 00:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
up beyond that to add aviation
 
00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh and then we will be working on i will
 
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
i recreation management as the next one
 
00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
yeah i will say that the uh aviation
 
00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:41.589 align:start position:0%
yeah i will say that the uh aviation
program

00:56:41.589 --> 00:56:41.599 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
that we have here in in conway
 
00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
has been extremely popular
 
00:56:52.549 --> 00:56:52.559 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure that it as it is brought
 
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
online in other areas that
 
00:56:59.030 --> 00:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
um that it will be as popular so
 
00:57:01.190 --> 00:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
it's a good thing you you are that your
 
00:57:03.030 --> 00:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
school is the lead they uh
 
00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
they hit the ground running um and uh so
 
00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:06.470 align:start position:0%
they hit the ground running um and uh so
they

00:57:06.470 --> 00:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:57:07.990 --> 00:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
they've become the sort of the gold
 
00:57:12.630 --> 00:57:12.640 align:start position:0%
standard for our programs uh but you are
 
00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
yes you you have no sending students so
 
00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
your students are eligible
 
00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
everyone in the building learns about
 
00:57:20.630 --> 00:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:24.069 --> 00:57:24.079 align:start position:0%
okay so uh the next chart in here
 
00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:28.160 align:start position:0%
uh goes back um just over 10 years i
 
00:57:29.829 --> 00:57:29.839 align:start position:0%
guess to 11 12 years
 
00:57:33.270 --> 00:57:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh it lists each town
 
00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
that has received tran travel uh tuition
 
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
or transportation money
 
00:57:39.829 --> 00:57:39.839 align:start position:0%
so as you go through the list at home
 
00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
you may find that there are completely
 
00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:41.750 align:start position:0%
you may find that there are completely
missing

00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
missing
 
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
towns and that could be because
 
00:57:47.109 --> 00:57:47.119 align:start position:0%
uh even if they obviously have students
 
00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:48.160 align:start position:0%
from there they may not have a high
 
00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:49.109 align:start position:0%
from there they may not have a high
school

00:57:49.109 --> 00:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:57:50.789 --> 00:57:50.799 align:start position:0%
so therefore their students are
 
00:57:52.789 --> 00:57:52.799 align:start position:0%
attending a different town's high school
 
00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
so that town's high school is the one
 
00:57:56.069 --> 00:57:56.079 align:start position:0%
that is receiving the reimbursement for
 
00:57:58.390 --> 00:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
the travel
 
00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
um and so it just
 
00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:04.400 align:start position:0%
lists all the way down of for each each
 
00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:05.430 align:start position:0%
lists all the way down of for each each
town

00:58:05.430 --> 00:58:05.440 align:start position:0%
town
 
00:58:08.470 --> 00:58:08.480 align:start position:0%
what their the amount is and all the way
 
00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
down at the bottom you'll see it totals
 
00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
down to the nine million dollars
 
00:58:17.589 --> 00:58:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:19.349 --> 00:58:19.359 align:start position:0%
and then the following chart is the
 
00:58:22.069 --> 00:58:22.079 align:start position:0%
breakdown of each town and whether
 
00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
they have a tuition payment
 
00:58:30.549 --> 00:58:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
and some will have both um any school
 
00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
that sends to vermont
 
00:58:37.109 --> 00:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
will have both again because they they
 
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
pay the tuition full tuition and have
 
00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:40.069 align:start position:0%
pay the tuition full tuition and have
reimbursed

00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
reimbursed
 
00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
but then also several of our towns like
 
00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:43.910 align:start position:0%
but then also several of our towns like
claremont

00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
claremont
 
00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
claremont is in a region where there are
 
00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
two cte centers
 
00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
one in claremont and one in newport and
 
00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:50.230 align:start position:0%
one in claremont and one in newport and
so

00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:58:52.069 --> 00:58:52.079 align:start position:0%
claremont could be ascending school if
 
00:58:53.109 --> 00:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
they're sending students to the
 
00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
cosmetology program
 
00:58:57.430 --> 00:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
in newport and they are also a receiving
 
00:58:57.440 --> 00:58:57.990 align:start position:0%
in newport and they are also a receiving
school

00:58:57.990 --> 00:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:59:01.349 --> 00:59:01.359 align:start position:0%
that students from
 
00:59:03.270 --> 00:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
newport and the other surrounding towns
 
00:59:04.789 --> 00:59:04.799 align:start position:0%
send students to claremont so they will
 
00:59:06.309 --> 00:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
receive tuition
 
00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
and so this just shows how the money was
 
00:59:22.230 --> 00:59:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:29.109 --> 00:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:33.030 --> 00:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
each year the cte centers will provide
 
00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
to our office the cost of a cte
 
00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:37.349 align:start position:0%
to our office the cost of a cte
education

00:59:37.349 --> 00:59:37.359 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
so it is a percentage of the total
 
00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
student cost for education
 
00:59:45.109 --> 00:59:45.119 align:start position:0%
it ranges between 20 and 40 percent uh
 
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
many centers just pick one as an
 
00:59:49.349 --> 00:59:49.359 align:start position:0%
all-encompassing comprehensive
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
but schools like dover you can see they
 
00:59:52.319 --> 00:59:52.630 align:start position:0%
but schools like dover you can see they
have

00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:52.640 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
a very wide variety of programs they
 
00:59:59.190 --> 00:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
again it is between 20 and 40 percent uh
 
01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
so that is the tuition number that
 
01:00:05.589 --> 01:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
they'll put on the av-1 form
 
01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:08.240 align:start position:0%
that they submit to us per semester
 
01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
comes up with what the total
 
01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:13.119 align:start position:0%
tuition will be for the year and then
 
01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:20.069 --> 01:00:20.079 align:start position:0%
there's then the number of students that
 
01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
attended cte for the year
 
01:00:25.030 --> 01:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
and uh you will notice that we do have
 
01:00:27.349 --> 01:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
percentage of students
 
01:00:30.069 --> 01:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
uh because the stude if a student only
 
01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
attends for part of the year we only pay
 
01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:34.000 align:start position:0%
for that part of the tuition
 
01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
so they report attendance three times
 
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
over the course of the semester
 
01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:40.480 align:start position:0%
so if a student only tends for for a
 
01:00:42.069 --> 01:00:42.079 align:start position:0%
part of that semester
 
01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
then we won't pay the full tuition for
 
01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
the full semester they didn't attend
 
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
so we do have partial students
 
01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh multiplies across um and
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
so theoretically berlin um
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
would have received for 75 tuition
 
01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
reimbursement of 115
 
01:01:05.109 --> 01:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
962 however
 
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
um based on the the amount available
 
01:01:10.309 --> 01:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
there was only 77 000 available
 
01:01:13.510 --> 01:01:13.520 align:start position:0%
so that 38 000
 
01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
was short and they would then be sending
 
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
bills out to their sending schools to
 
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
make up that difference so the sending
 
01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
school will get a secondary
 
01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
uh you will notice there are some
 
01:01:24.789 --> 01:01:24.799 align:start position:0%
positive numbers
 
01:01:26.069 --> 01:01:26.079 align:start position:0%
because of the way the formula
 
01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
allocation happens
 
01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
conval for example 75
 
01:01:36.309 --> 01:01:36.319 align:start position:0%
of their tuition cost is 2 800
 
01:01:39.030 --> 01:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
the tuition payment based on the formula
 
01:01:40.789 --> 01:01:40.799 align:start position:0%
allocation was just over three thousand
 
01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:42.240 align:start position:0%
dollars per student
 
01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
so they actually came into black
 
01:01:47.589 --> 01:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars at the end of the
 
01:01:47.599 --> 01:01:49.910 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars at the end of the
year

01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
uh it's the rare occasion uh several
 
01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
schools like you'll see exeter
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
with short 382 thousand dollars i'll say
 
01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:56.710 align:start position:0%
with short 382 thousand dollars i'll say
they

01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:01:58.230 --> 01:01:58.240 align:start position:0%
had to go back to their school districts
 
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me uh representative murray you
 
01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
yep i do just clarification so the
 
01:02:11.589 --> 01:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
request for funds that goes back to the
 
01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
community um
 
01:02:15.109 --> 01:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
is that something that would eventually
 
01:02:17.589 --> 01:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
be paid for with an increase in property
 
01:02:17.599 --> 01:02:19.190 align:start position:0%
be paid for with an increase in property
taxes

01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
uh i won't talk to that i don't know
 
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
where that
 
01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
might come from uh school districts
 
01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
typically have a line item in their
 
01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:28.710 align:start position:0%
typically have a line item in their
budget

01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:02:30.309 --> 01:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
uh that are sending schools that they've
 
01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
allocated a specific amount of money
 
01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
from their school budget
 
01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
to send to the cte centers for tuition
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
01:02:41.349 --> 01:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
yes representative heath you have a
 
01:02:41.359 --> 01:02:42.069 align:start position:0%
yes representative heath you have a
question

01:02:42.069 --> 01:02:42.079 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just a quick one
 
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
do you think
 
01:02:49.589 --> 01:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
eric that the cost to the sending
 
01:02:49.599 --> 01:02:50.390 align:start position:0%
eric that the cost to the sending
schools

01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
in their budget is ever a deterrent
 
01:02:58.230 --> 01:02:58.240 align:start position:0%
to attending the regional center
 
01:03:00.549 --> 01:03:00.559 align:start position:0%
we have heard it i do not have
 
01:03:01.990 --> 01:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
definitive fact but from
 
01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
the um consultants that did come up
 
01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
that school districts it's a
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
conversation school districts have
 
01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
i will tell you that um we're happy to
 
01:03:14.829 --> 01:03:14.839 align:start position:0%
fight that conversation anytime because
 
01:03:14.839 --> 01:03:15.990 align:start position:0%
fight that conversation anytime because
legislatively

01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
legislatively
 
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
the law states that any student who
 
01:03:20.069 --> 01:03:20.079 align:start position:0%
wants to go can attend
 
01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
so if a student applies and is accepted
 
01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
into a cte center
 
01:03:26.230 --> 01:03:26.240 align:start position:0%
the school district under the law cannot
 
01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:32.069 --> 01:03:32.079 align:start position:0%
we've never heard somebody say no i've
 
01:03:33.349 --> 01:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
never heard of a school district you
 
01:03:34.789 --> 01:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
know a student saying i wanted to go and
 
01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't let me
 
01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
but conversations with our consultants
 
01:03:39.190 --> 01:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
were that
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
um the cost does come up as part of
 
01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
school district budget conversation for
 
01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.470 align:start position:0%
school district budget conversation for
sure

01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:03:50.309 --> 01:03:50.319 align:start position:0%
uh mary i i think the the bigger problem
 
01:03:53.589 --> 01:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
is not is not the cost but the fact that
 
01:03:57.430 --> 01:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
the children that are going
 
01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
to the consolidated cte centers
 
01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
are losing out on some amount
 
01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
of educational
 
01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:09.839 align:start position:0%
whatever every day that they're
 
01:04:12.549 --> 01:04:12.559 align:start position:0%
attending the cte and
 
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know how we um i know we can't
 
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
crack that in the budget
 
01:04:20.789 --> 01:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
but we may be able to um
 
01:04:24.069 --> 01:04:24.079 align:start position:0%
work on something that
 
01:04:26.789 --> 01:04:26.799 align:start position:0%
i i don't know but it that's always been
 
01:04:27.430 --> 01:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
the big
 
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh the big problem with uh with
 
01:04:34.789 --> 01:04:34.799 align:start position:0%
people kids going to uh to the ctes
 
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
around the states we'll see
 
01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
madam chair if i may please
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
i agree with you and um it's the lost
 
01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:45.029 align:start position:0%
i agree with you and um it's the lost
time

01:04:45.029 --> 01:04:45.039 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
that kids have when they have to ride
 
01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
the buses but i really hope that we can
 
01:04:51.109 --> 01:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
figure out something because i think
 
01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
it's a loss
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
and we need those areas desperately
 
01:04:59.670 --> 01:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
in our employment environment
 
01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
so i hope we can do something thank you
 
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
representative murray you still had your
 
01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
hand up
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
mistake again i'm sorry i'm still
 
01:05:10.390 --> 01:05:10.400 align:start position:0%
distracted i'll do better
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
i promise don't don't worry about it
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you and uh yes uh in our study
 
01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
that that was a big piece is the travel
 
01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:19.670 align:start position:0%
that that was a big piece is the travel
time

01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
and the lost um or the schedule conflict
 
01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
that a student is in
 
01:05:25.349 --> 01:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
you know ap english at nine in the
 
01:05:26.549 --> 01:05:26.559 align:start position:0%
morning and it's the only time their
 
01:05:28.230 --> 01:05:28.240 align:start position:0%
school offers it and so they cannot take
 
01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
the bus
 
01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
to go to the cte center at the same time
 
01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
we part of our conversations with our
 
01:05:36.950 --> 01:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
cte centers and our sending schools will
 
01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
be around embedded credits
 
01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
to find out if there are opportunities
 
01:05:42.390 --> 01:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
that the students can earn those
 
01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
other credits while they are taking
 
01:05:46.069 --> 01:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
their cte classes to eliminate some of
 
01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
that missed class time
 
01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
but that is a a very complicated
 
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
conversation amongst nine sending school
 
01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh so with the with this tuition um
 
01:06:02.789 --> 01:06:02.799 align:start position:0%
if the state would have fully funded the
 
01:06:04.549 --> 01:06:04.559 align:start position:0%
75 percent
 
01:06:08.069 --> 01:06:08.079 align:start position:0%
um including uh plus the alt-ed tuition
 
01:06:09.829 --> 01:06:09.839 align:start position:0%
which is also a small amount included in
 
01:06:09.839 --> 01:06:10.470 align:start position:0%
which is also a small amount included in
here

01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
and the transportation uh would have
 
01:06:14.390 --> 01:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
been a total of almost 12 million
 
01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:15.829 align:start position:0%
been a total of almost 12 million
dollars

01:06:15.829 --> 01:06:15.839 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh which would would be a shortfall of
 
01:06:20.150 --> 01:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh just shy of three million dollars if
 
01:06:23.910 --> 01:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
um and that's based on the current
 
01:06:30.069 --> 01:06:30.079 align:start position:0%
transportation formula which is what i
 
01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
will talk about next
 
01:06:35.829 --> 01:06:35.839 align:start position:0%
oh so i'm sorry so the um this past year
 
01:06:35.839 --> 01:06:36.390 align:start position:0%
oh so i'm sorry so the um this past year
the

01:06:36.390 --> 01:06:36.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
tuition rate was three thousand six
 
01:06:39.349 --> 01:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
hundred and seventeen dollars per
 
01:06:39.359 --> 01:06:40.069 align:start position:0%
hundred and seventeen dollars per
student

01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
student
 
01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
was what was uh when it was divided by
 
01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
the twenty
 
01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
500 students that are taking part in cte
 
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
so the transportation cost per
 
01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:00.559 align:start position:0%
um education rules for transportation
 
01:07:02.789 --> 01:07:02.799 align:start position:0%
the schools are reimbursed
 
01:07:08.230 --> 01:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:11.109 --> 01:07:11.119 align:start position:0%
which you'll note the bus cost the same
 
01:07:12.549 --> 01:07:12.559 align:start position:0%
whether there are 10 students on it or
 
01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
40 students on it but we re that is the
 
01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
regulation as they are reimbursed at 10
 
01:07:18.549 --> 01:07:18.559 align:start position:0%
cents per mile per student
 
01:07:21.829 --> 01:07:21.839 align:start position:0%
so this form will show what the school
 
01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
districts reported their cost was for
 
01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
the busing
 
01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
and what was actually reimbursed for the
 
01:07:27.119 --> 01:07:31.349 align:start position:0%
and what was actually reimbursed for the
busing

01:07:31.349 --> 01:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
and so the total cost of busing to send
 
01:07:36.549 --> 01:07:36.559 align:start position:0%
students to cte
 
01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:39.760 align:start position:0%
was 2.6 million dollars based on the
 
01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
formula of 10 cents per mile per student
 
01:07:46.069 --> 01:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
so in addition to the 3 million dollar
 
01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
shortfall from the tuition
 
01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
if we were to fully fund transportation
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
it would be an additional 2 million
 
01:07:54.309 --> 01:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
dollars so
 
01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
we're now hitting a five million dollar
 
01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:58.390 align:start position:0%
we're now hitting a five million dollar
shortfall

01:07:58.390 --> 01:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
shortfall
 
01:07:59.910 --> 01:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
of fully funding tuition and
 
01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:02.309 align:start position:0%
of fully funding tuition and
transportation

01:08:02.309 --> 01:08:02.319 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
so we do have legislation in this year
 
01:08:07.109 --> 01:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
to change the regulations so that
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
transportation is fully funded
 
01:08:12.710 --> 01:08:12.720 align:start position:0%
however it does not increase the total
 
01:08:13.829 --> 01:08:13.839 align:start position:0%
in the budget
 
01:08:16.149 --> 01:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
so transportation will be fully funded
 
01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
up front
 
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
and then that leftover money is divided
 
01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
amongst the school the sending
 
01:08:23.669 --> 01:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
the students so it just lowers the
 
01:08:25.189 --> 01:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
amount available for tuition and the
 
01:08:25.199 --> 01:08:26.390 align:start position:0%
amount available for tuition and the
schools

01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
get hit with that secondary tuition
 
01:08:33.110 --> 01:08:33.120 align:start position:0%
so we borrowed from peter to pay paul
 
01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
but we didn't want transportation to be
 
01:08:36.789 --> 01:08:36.799 align:start position:0%
the reason that a school wasn't sending
 
01:08:38.070 --> 01:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
a student that they were spending so
 
01:08:41.110 --> 01:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
much on transportation
 
01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
okay so did it has that passed the
 
01:08:45.510 --> 01:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
legislature already
 
01:08:48.789 --> 01:08:48.799 align:start position:0%
oh it is currently um in uh it is in our
 
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
cte bill that is working its way through
 
01:08:52.470 --> 01:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
okay so it hasn't finished it has not
 
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
gone anywhere yet
 
01:08:58.950 --> 01:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
okay so that
 
01:09:02.630 --> 01:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
will probably take effect later on
 
01:09:05.110 --> 01:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
outside the budget cycle correct it
 
01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
would be next year
 
01:09:08.709 --> 01:09:08.719 align:start position:0%
okay thank you well next year's in the
 
01:09:09.749 --> 01:09:09.759 align:start position:0%
budget cycle right
 
01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
it would be well it would it would take
 
01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:12.870 align:start position:0%
it would be well it would it would take
effect

01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
effect
 
01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:15.600 align:start position:0%
we just wouldn't unless this year's
 
01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
budget money is increased
 
01:09:19.829 --> 01:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
the schools for the next two years will
 
01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
be reimbursed fully for busing
 
01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
and end up having to pay more for
 
01:09:23.279 --> 01:09:25.510 align:start position:0%
and end up having to pay more for
tuition

01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
tuition
 
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
and that is the end of my slide so i'm
 
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
open for other questions if there are
 
01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:37.510 align:start position:0%
open for other questions if there are
any

01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh does anyone have any additional
 
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
questions for eric
 
01:09:45.910 --> 01:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
we appreciate your uh very much
 
01:09:49.030 --> 01:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
what uh i did have one one other point
 
01:09:49.669 --> 01:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:09:51.189 --> 01:09:51.199 align:start position:0%
becky reminded me of it when she did
 
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
hers uh
 
01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
this nine million dollars is also part
 
01:10:00.149 --> 01:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:02.310 --> 01:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
towards the perkins grant towards our
 
01:10:10.709 --> 01:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
uh representative heath oh thank you
 
01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
01:10:17.430 --> 01:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
and thank you eric um again
 
01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
this is used for maintenance of effort
 
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
do you have enough
 
01:10:24.390 --> 01:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
or what else do you use for that
 
01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
sure so i actually have a maintenance of
 
01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:28.830 align:start position:0%
sure so i actually have a maintenance of
effort

01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:28.840 align:start position:0%
effort
 
01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:32.390 align:start position:0%
effort
chart

01:10:32.390 --> 01:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming you're seeing this now new
 
01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:35.430 align:start position:0%
i'm assuming you're seeing this now new
chart

01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
chart
 
01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
yes we are okay uh so
 
01:10:43.830 --> 01:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
um so our maintenance of effort is
 
01:10:47.189 --> 01:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
any state monies that goes towards
 
01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
cte so salaries for all the staff in my
 
01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:53.510 align:start position:0%
cte so salaries for all the staff in my
office

01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
all of the you know office expenses
 
01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
our membership dues for our
 
01:11:03.270 --> 01:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
national membership for ctes is part of
 
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
our is a state fund
 
01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
any travel that we do in state and then
 
01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
this nine million dollars
 
01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
and so based on this uh for this current
 
01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
year for fy21
 
01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh assuming all of our you know
 
01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
we're assuming twelve thousand dollars
 
01:11:23.669 --> 01:11:23.679 align:start position:0%
in state travel which we may not
 
01:11:26.149 --> 01:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
actually do this year because we didn't
 
01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
travel a lot
 
01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
we are anticipating that we will
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
surpass our moe requirement by about 145
 
01:11:35.030 --> 01:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
so we just make it if we do not
 
01:11:42.470 --> 01:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
meet our moe for our perkins
 
01:11:44.470 --> 01:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
our perkins funds next year would be
 
01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
reduced by the amount we miss
 
01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
and we are responsible for repaying the
 
01:11:50.630 --> 01:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
federal government for the difference
 
01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
that we missed so we get hit twice
 
01:11:57.270 --> 01:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
so um i have a phenomenal ba
 
01:11:59.750 --> 01:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
who works this chart to make sure that
 
01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
we do not miss our moe
 
01:12:04.229 --> 01:12:04.239 align:start position:0%
um and so she has actually put it out
 
01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
several years
 
01:12:09.110 --> 01:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
based on anticipated raises etc in
 
01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:10.390 align:start position:0%
based on anticipated raises etc in
salaries

01:12:10.390 --> 01:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
salaries
 
01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
um and so we're looking at
 
01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
next year of a possible shortfall
 
01:12:19.910 --> 01:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
but that really depends on where we land
 
01:12:21.030 --> 01:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
this year
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
because if we don't spend quite as much
 
01:12:24.310 --> 01:12:24.320 align:start position:0%
this year we're okay as long as we meet
 
01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
our moe
 
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:27.280 align:start position:0%
but she's keeping an eye on it for us
 
01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
and so that's something that we'll keep
 
01:12:32.630 --> 01:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:35.110 --> 01:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
yeah eric maybe you could uh send this
 
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
little chart to
 
01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
us since it didn't come yes
 
01:12:41.189 --> 01:12:41.199 align:start position:0%
uh representative petrie you have a
 
01:12:41.199 --> 01:12:43.030 align:start position:0%
uh representative petrie you have a
question

01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair uh the uh
 
01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
are we gonna expand cte or or
 
01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
within the facilities we have now or
 
01:12:55.669 --> 01:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
are we going to have more one of the
 
01:12:55.679 --> 01:12:57.430 align:start position:0%
are we going to have more one of the
things

01:12:57.430 --> 01:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
when i was on the farmington school
 
01:13:01.030 --> 01:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
board we actually changed uh centers we
 
01:13:02.229 --> 01:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
went to wolfeboro
 
01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
versus tri-city and uh
 
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
you know it's it we found that our kids
 
01:13:09.270 --> 01:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
were spending more time on the bus and
 
01:13:12.470 --> 01:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh so we are we're looking at all
 
01:13:16.229 --> 01:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
options um
 
01:13:20.070 --> 01:13:20.080 align:start position:0%
we are looking at how we can
 
01:13:22.630 --> 01:13:22.640 align:start position:0%
offer cte programs at non-regional
 
01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:24.070 align:start position:0%
offer cte programs at non-regional
centers

01:13:24.070 --> 01:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
centers
 
01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
um the challenge being student
 
01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
population and critical mass
 
01:13:31.990 --> 01:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know uh were we we would not
 
01:13:33.590 --> 01:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
be offering an auto program at every
 
01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
high school that just cost wise doesn't
 
01:13:36.310 --> 01:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
make sense
 
01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
but um what i refer to as the more
 
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
didactic programs the business-based
 
01:13:44.630 --> 01:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
programs the computer-based programs
 
01:13:46.149 --> 01:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
most high schools have facilities that
 
01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
could run those programs
 
01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
the question is would you have enough
 
01:13:51.510 --> 01:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
students at every high school
 
01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
to run that program and so that's where
 
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
this consultant is
 
01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
going to come in handy for us to try to
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
figure out what the best way is to
 
01:14:03.110 --> 01:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:06.310 --> 01:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
and it may mean setting up regional
 
01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:07.110 align:start position:0%
and it may mean setting up regional
programs

01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:14:10.229 --> 01:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
at more comprehensive high schools so a
 
01:14:10.239 --> 01:14:11.270 align:start position:0%
at more comprehensive high schools so a
student

01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
student
 
01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:13.120 align:start position:0%
you know if they were looking to do a
 
01:14:14.310 --> 01:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
business program they only have to
 
01:14:15.990 --> 01:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
travel to the next town over
 
01:14:18.390 --> 01:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
so it's less travel time but then that
 
01:14:20.229 --> 01:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
ends up being more travel costs for the
 
01:14:21.669 --> 01:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
school district because now they have
 
01:14:24.229 --> 01:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
two buses that they're sending uh so
 
01:14:25.590 --> 01:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
we're trying to balance all of those and
 
01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
figure out
 
01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh the answer we don't know the answer
 
01:14:32.870 --> 01:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
massachusetts had decided on the model
 
01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:35.840 align:start position:0%
of regional cte high schools
 
01:14:37.430 --> 01:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
where if you wanted to go you just
 
01:14:38.790 --> 01:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
transferred to that high school you went
 
01:14:39.990 --> 01:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
for four years
 
01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
and then that alleviated all of these
 
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
challenges well they've now
 
01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
maxed out those high schools and they
 
01:14:48.070 --> 01:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
have wait lists
 
01:14:49.669 --> 01:14:49.679 align:start position:0%
so now they're trying to figure out now
 
01:14:51.830 --> 01:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
what do we do and our
 
01:14:54.070 --> 01:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
cte programs are popping up at more high
 
01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:55.350 align:start position:0%
cte programs are popping up at more high
schools

01:14:55.350 --> 01:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:14:58.229 --> 01:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
having the same problem we have how do
 
01:15:00.310 --> 01:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
we get more students involved
 
01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
so we're looking at all the model
 
01:15:03.669 --> 01:15:03.679 align:start position:0%
options there may be more options like
 
01:15:03.679 --> 01:15:04.470 align:start position:0%
options there may be more options like
mst

01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
mst
 
01:15:06.470 --> 01:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
where there is a four-year high school
 
01:15:07.910 --> 01:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
that's showing up and students will just
 
01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
transfer there
 
01:15:12.550 --> 01:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
vermont has a model where a student can
 
01:15:14.870 --> 01:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
spend the entire day at the cte center
 
01:15:17.669 --> 01:15:17.679 align:start position:0%
and complete a program in one year so
 
01:15:18.709 --> 01:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
that way
 
01:15:21.669 --> 01:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
they can the schedule problem isn't as
 
01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
bad they just go for the whole day and
 
01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
then go back but it's only one year so
 
01:15:26.229 --> 01:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
they'll go for their 10th grade or their
 
01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
11th grade year
 
01:15:29.110 --> 01:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
out of high school and that's it so
 
01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
we're looking at all different models
 
01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:41.510 align:start position:0%
 
absolutely

01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh very much eric and uh
 
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
caitlyn what kind of great things do you
 
01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
have next
 
01:15:52.709 --> 01:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
for us okay so next up
 
01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
we have amy clark um so amy clark has a
 
01:15:57.350 --> 01:15:57.360 align:start position:0%
variety of different topics to talk to
 
01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
you about today
 
01:16:00.870 --> 01:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
um i don't know what you guys want to do
 
01:16:02.790 --> 01:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
as far as breaks or whatnot obviously
 
01:16:03.830 --> 01:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to come back
 
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
after lunch but what do you guys
 
01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
typically break at 12 or 12 30
 
01:16:12.870 --> 01:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
oh we figure it out depending upon
 
01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
depending upon what's what's what's
 
01:16:18.790 --> 01:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
going on
 
01:16:21.350 --> 01:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
all right so amy the first the first
 
01:16:23.030 --> 01:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
topic she so just three topics
 
01:16:25.350 --> 01:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
um building aid which is a fairly
 
01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:26.310 align:start position:0%
um building aid which is a fairly
complex

01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
complex
 
01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
topic i think you know every time amy
 
01:16:30.149 --> 01:16:30.159 align:start position:0%
gets into that the committee has a lot
 
01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
of questions so
 
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
i would say that might be go until up
 
01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
until lunch and then she can do her two
 
01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
quicker topics after lunch maybe that
 
01:16:39.590 --> 01:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
planning wise we can see how that goes
 
01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
or maybe building a little stretch
 
01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
but so amy um we'll be talking about
 
01:16:45.189 --> 01:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
building aid and
 
01:16:46.630 --> 01:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
then also the public school
 
01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund and
 
01:16:56.790 --> 01:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:59.830 --> 01:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me um so again my
 
01:17:01.189 --> 01:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
name is amy clark
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
and for the record i work for the
 
01:17:05.110 --> 01:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
department of education for the bureau
 
01:17:07.830 --> 01:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
of state safety and facility management
 
01:17:09.270 --> 01:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
so good to see you and especially
 
01:17:11.189 --> 01:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
representative umberger it's so good to
 
01:17:12.070 --> 01:17:12.080 align:start position:0%
see you back
 
01:17:15.189 --> 01:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
um and some friendly faces so that's
 
01:17:17.669 --> 01:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
always uh eases the pain of having to
 
01:17:19.030 --> 01:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
talk to a committee when you know a
 
01:17:20.950 --> 01:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
couple of the faces of the crowd
 
01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh but here is not that this is painful
 
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
at all
 
01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
of course for us um so
 
01:17:30.310 --> 01:17:30.320 align:start position:0%
here is a summary of the building aid
 
01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:31.750 align:start position:0%
here is a summary of the building aid
program

01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:17:34.229 --> 01:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
and in my pocket i have these six things
 
01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
that will go over some of them
 
01:17:37.510 --> 01:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
more at length and some of them just so
 
01:17:39.270 --> 01:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
that you have them for your insurance
 
01:17:40.870 --> 01:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
um i have a summary of the building aid
 
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
program i've been building a rates
 
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
i have a tail graph and a list of the
 
01:17:48.950 --> 01:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
applications as well as a list of the
 
01:17:50.950 --> 01:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
current payments that we're making
 
01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
and a list of um some other projects
 
01:17:57.270 --> 01:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing your screen yet have you
 
01:17:58.470 --> 01:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
started putting it i
 
01:18:01.189 --> 01:18:01.199 align:start position:0%
have i am sorry about that let's see
 
01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:19.990 --> 01:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
so there's my contact information right
 
01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:23.750 align:start position:0%
so there's my contact information right
there

01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:18:25.830 --> 01:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
and you should have all of these
 
01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
handouts but here is
 
01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
um there's a one-page summary of the
 
01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
program because my name my
 
01:18:33.030 --> 01:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
contact information if you ever have
 
01:18:34.630 --> 01:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
some more detailed questions you want
 
01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:35.510 align:start position:0%
some more detailed questions you want
answered

01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
answered
 
01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh the law and the rules are cited there
 
01:18:39.430 --> 01:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:18:42.390 --> 01:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
so simply put building aid is grant
 
01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
funds to support local school districts
 
01:18:46.390 --> 01:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
in meeting the cost of construction or
 
01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:48.229 align:start position:0%
in meeting the cost of construction or
reconstruction

01:18:48.229 --> 01:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
reconstruction
 
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
that is the source the state funds that
 
01:18:51.669 --> 01:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
they use
 
01:18:54.790 --> 01:18:54.800 align:start position:0%
to tap into are building aid grants
 
01:18:57.030 --> 01:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
the grants typically are the grants
 
01:18:59.430 --> 01:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
range from 30 to 60 percent that's the
 
01:18:59.440 --> 01:18:59.830 align:start position:0%
range from 30 to 60 percent that's the
state

01:18:59.830 --> 01:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:19:03.590 --> 01:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
share of those grants with less affluent
 
01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
communities being at the 60 percent more
 
01:19:08.070 --> 01:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
affluent communities being at the 30
 
01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:08.950 align:start position:0%
affluent communities being at the 30
percent

01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
um i'd just like to notice that note
 
01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
that even though the range is 30 to 60
 
01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
the actual average rate is closer to the
 
01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:16.470 align:start position:0%
the actual average rate is closer to the
30

01:19:16.470 --> 01:19:16.480 align:start position:0%
30
 
01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
range so it's weighted the formula is
 
01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
weighted so the average community
 
01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
gets 38 um the funding source is now the
 
01:19:26.790 --> 01:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
education trust fund which caitlyn
 
01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:28.709 align:start position:0%
education trust fund which caitlyn
mentioned

01:19:28.709 --> 01:19:28.719 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
01:19:31.990 --> 01:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
um so um the
 
01:19:36.070 --> 01:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
way that grants are paid to schools uh
 
01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
it's important to
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
cover because we're going to talk about
 
01:19:41.669 --> 01:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
the tail or these obligated payments so
 
01:19:43.669 --> 01:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
keep in mind during the presentation
 
01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
that there's two types
 
01:19:47.030 --> 01:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
of ways that building aid has been
 
01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:48.310 align:start position:0%
of ways that building aid has been
funded

01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
funded
 
01:19:49.830 --> 01:19:49.840 align:start position:0%
building aid has been around since the
 
01:19:53.189 --> 01:19:53.199 align:start position:0%
1940s all the way up through 2012
 
01:19:56.149 --> 01:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
the law said that building aid was going
 
01:19:56.550 --> 01:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:19:59.350 --> 01:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
paid over the life of a bond so as well
 
01:20:01.030 --> 01:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
without a 20-year bond
 
01:20:03.910 --> 01:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
building aid would be paid every year on
 
01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:04.470 align:start position:0%
building aid would be paid every year on
the

01:20:04.470 --> 01:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:20:06.310 --> 01:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
like on the term of the month during
 
01:20:08.629 --> 01:20:08.639 align:start position:0%
their bonding
 
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
in 2013 the law was changed
 
01:20:15.270 --> 01:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
and it the law in 2013 now says
 
01:20:18.229 --> 01:20:18.239 align:start position:0%
that the state pays 80 percent of that
 
01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
grant amount
 
01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
before construction and 20
 
01:20:25.270 --> 01:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
upon completion so instead of making
 
01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
payments over 20 years
 
01:20:30.229 --> 01:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
now building it only makes two payments
 
01:20:30.870 --> 01:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
just two
 
01:20:32.790 --> 01:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
and that's it one eighty percent up
 
01:20:34.390 --> 01:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
front and then 20
 
01:20:38.790 --> 01:20:38.800 align:start position:0%
upon completion so for a quick example
 
01:20:42.229 --> 01:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
if a school district had a 20-year bond
 
01:20:44.629 --> 01:20:44.639 align:start position:0%
and let's say their school costs to
 
01:20:45.430 --> 01:20:45.440 align:start position:0%
construct it
 
01:20:48.149 --> 01:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
40 million dollars and let's say for
 
01:20:50.229 --> 01:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
example for easy numbers their building
 
01:20:52.149 --> 01:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
aid rate was 50
 
01:20:54.390 --> 01:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
the state is going to pay 20 million and
 
01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
the local
 
01:20:58.950 --> 01:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
share is going to be 20 million so prior
 
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
to 2013
 
01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
that grant amount that state grant
 
01:21:04.070 --> 01:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
amount of 20 million
 
01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
would have been paid out in 1 million
 
01:21:10.149 --> 01:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
every year for 20 years
 
01:21:12.149 --> 01:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
after if that project happened after
 
01:21:12.159 --> 01:21:13.750 align:start position:0%
after if that project happened after
2013

01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
2013
 
01:21:15.830 --> 01:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
that project would have been paid 16
 
01:21:17.750 --> 01:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
million up front that's the 80
 
01:21:19.910 --> 01:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
so 60 million dollars up front before
 
01:21:22.870 --> 01:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
they even start construction
 
01:21:26.229 --> 01:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
and then 4 million upon completion
 
01:21:30.310 --> 01:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
um and so when we were paying
 
01:21:33.510 --> 01:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
on the term of a bond those are called
 
01:21:35.669 --> 01:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
obligated payments and if you can think
 
01:21:37.510 --> 01:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
about it it was a 20-year bond
 
01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
is a common example um we do have a
 
01:21:42.149 --> 01:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
couple of 30-year bonds but for the most
 
01:21:43.830 --> 01:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
part a 20-year bond is pretty
 
01:21:45.990 --> 01:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
typical that means we are still paying
 
01:21:47.430 --> 01:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
on projects that are
 
01:21:51.110 --> 01:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
20 years old or just finishing up those
 
01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:52.229 align:start position:0%
20 years old or just finishing up those
payments

01:21:52.229 --> 01:21:52.239 align:start position:0%
payments
 
01:21:53.830 --> 01:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
um so we'll get back to that in a little
 
01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
bit more but that's the kind of the
 
01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
summary of the funding structure of
 
01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:58.950 align:start position:0%
summary of the funding structure of
building

01:21:58.950 --> 01:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:00.719 align:start position:0%
here's a little bit of the history that
 
01:22:02.629 --> 01:22:02.639 align:start position:0%
you'll have it's a short history here
 
01:22:02.639 --> 01:22:03.189 align:start position:0%
you'll have it's a short history here
but

01:22:03.189 --> 01:22:03.199 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
um building it again has been around
 
01:22:07.510 --> 01:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
since the 1940s
 
01:22:10.870 --> 01:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
and as um money was
 
01:22:13.990 --> 01:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
has been appropriated to meet demand
 
01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
all the way up till um about 2007.
 
01:22:20.950 --> 01:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
and so uh there are keep in mind
 
01:22:23.910 --> 01:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
money was appropriated to meet demand so
 
01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
schools came to the department of
 
01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:26.390 align:start position:0%
schools came to the department of
education

01:22:26.390 --> 01:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
they proposed a construction project we
 
01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
collected okay this is going to cost you
 
01:22:31.510 --> 01:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
this much
 
01:22:33.189 --> 01:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
we're going to pay you this much we've
 
01:22:35.030 --> 01:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
reported it to the legislature
 
01:22:37.350 --> 01:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
and the legislature appropriated enough
 
01:22:38.550 --> 01:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
money to cover
 
01:22:41.590 --> 01:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
um what schools needed now that doesn't
 
01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
mean they could put in a swimming pool
 
01:22:44.629 --> 01:22:44.639 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't mean they can put an
 
01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
athletic turf deal
 
01:22:48.390 --> 01:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
in there were caps on building aid there
 
01:22:50.229 --> 01:22:50.239 align:start position:0%
are still cats on what is eligible
 
01:22:51.030 --> 01:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
what's not
 
01:22:52.790 --> 01:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
those eligible costs they could report
 
01:22:54.149 --> 01:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
hey i need um
 
01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
you know we're expanding or um you know
 
01:22:56.880 --> 01:22:57.830 align:start position:0%
you know we're expanding or um you know
this

01:22:57.830 --> 01:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:22:59.830 --> 01:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
wall is falling down and those are the
 
01:23:02.709 --> 01:23:02.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
in 2008 and 2009 we all remember
 
01:23:08.709 --> 01:23:08.719 align:start position:0%
there was quite a difficult um time at
 
01:23:08.719 --> 01:23:09.110 align:start position:0%
there was quite a difficult um time at
that

01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
time um financially and so
 
01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
so we did not the state did not have
 
01:23:18.390 --> 01:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
enough money to pay those obligated
 
01:23:20.470 --> 01:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
funds so i had passed projects
 
01:23:23.350 --> 01:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
but we could not meet those payments and
 
01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
payments were
 
01:23:26.149 --> 01:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
diminished so we asked the legislature
 
01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
for so much money and and they didn't
 
01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
um um appropriate as much as the schools
 
01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:31.990 align:start position:0%
um um appropriate as much as the schools
needed

01:23:31.990 --> 01:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
needed
 
01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
and therefore payments were prorated to
 
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
about 95
 
01:23:38.550 --> 01:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
so not significant shortfall but a
 
01:23:40.470 --> 01:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
shortfall in london
 
01:23:42.790 --> 01:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
in 2010 there was even more of a
 
01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
significant shortfall
 
01:23:47.830 --> 01:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
and what happened in 2010 is the state
 
01:23:48.550 --> 01:23:48.560 align:start position:0%
was paying
 
01:23:51.590 --> 01:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
about 49 million dollars per year
 
01:23:54.870 --> 01:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
each year on obligated payments
 
01:23:57.270 --> 01:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
and what the state said is we can't meet
 
01:23:58.870 --> 01:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
that obligation
 
01:24:01.110 --> 01:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
but we want to make the payments so the
 
01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:02.149 align:start position:0%
but we want to make the payments so the
state

01:24:02.149 --> 01:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:24:04.950 --> 01:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
took out their own bond to pay the
 
01:24:06.950 --> 01:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
obligated payments
 
01:24:10.229 --> 01:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
um i see some people shaking their heads
 
01:24:11.990 --> 01:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
so that's probably the appropriate
 
01:24:13.830 --> 01:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
response i think most people would
 
01:24:16.470 --> 01:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
have that response um so what that means
 
01:24:17.990 --> 01:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
is that they took out a bond
 
01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
to pay schools on their bond
 
01:24:24.310 --> 01:24:24.320 align:start position:0%
um that keep in mind that that practice
 
01:24:27.430 --> 01:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
um is now prohibited by law um
 
01:24:29.430 --> 01:24:29.440 align:start position:0%
shortly after somebody said this takes
 
01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
on how to do that anymore
 
01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
but either way it was done in 2010 and
 
01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:34.870 align:start position:0%
but either way it was done in 2010 and
that

01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
created a 20 it was a 20-year bond that
 
01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
created a 20-year bond
 
01:24:42.470 --> 01:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
off for those obligated payments and
 
01:24:43.669 --> 01:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
we'll see that show up a little bit
 
01:24:43.679 --> 01:24:43.990 align:start position:0%
we'll see that show up a little bit
later

01:24:43.990 --> 01:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
later
 
01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
too but that happened in 2010.
 
01:24:50.709 --> 01:24:50.719 align:start position:0%
what also happened in 2010 is
 
01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 put an official moratorium
 
01:24:57.350 --> 01:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
on school building aid for two years
 
01:24:58.550 --> 01:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
state said
 
01:25:00.790 --> 01:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
that we'll fund those obligated payments
 
01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
from past projects
 
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
but from here on out for the next two
 
01:25:07.510 --> 01:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
years we are not going to pay on any new
 
01:25:10.950 --> 01:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
school construction projects and
 
01:25:14.629 --> 01:25:14.639 align:start position:0%
um two years went by and then in 2012
 
01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
2013 that next biennium that moratorium
 
01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:17.910 align:start position:0%
2013 that next biennium that moratorium
was

01:25:17.910 --> 01:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:25:21.430 --> 01:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
extended for another two years also what
 
01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:21.990 align:start position:0%
extended for another two years also what
happened

01:25:21.990 --> 01:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
happened
 
01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
in 2013 um the
 
01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
building aid laws were rewritten
 
01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:28.229 align:start position:0%
building aid laws were rewritten
somewhat

01:25:28.229 --> 01:25:28.239 align:start position:0%
somewhat
 
01:25:31.830 --> 01:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
significantly the key things that they
 
01:25:33.910 --> 01:25:33.920 align:start position:0%
did in 2013
 
01:25:37.110 --> 01:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
um was that they put a cap or the
 
01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:38.149 align:start position:0%
um was that they put a cap or the
legislation

01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
now has a path on building aid
 
01:25:44.070 --> 01:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
and it says that there shall not be any
 
01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
the appropriation shall not be
 
01:25:47.830 --> 01:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
any larger than 50 million dollars per
 
01:25:50.070 --> 01:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
year and that exists today
 
01:25:52.229 --> 01:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
where there is a cap on building aid of
 
01:25:53.750 --> 01:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
50 million dollars
 
01:25:56.790 --> 01:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
per year and what that cap
 
01:25:59.430 --> 01:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
what that cap did was it now created
 
01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
instead of being able to fund
 
01:26:04.470 --> 01:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
on demand it created a ranking and a way
 
01:26:06.310 --> 01:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
that the department of education has to
 
01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:07.270 align:start position:0%
that the department of education has to
decide

01:26:07.270 --> 01:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
decide
 
01:26:09.750 --> 01:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
how to give that money out well it
 
01:26:12.310 --> 01:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
wasn't a problem in 2012 and 2013
 
01:26:13.110 --> 01:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
because we were
 
01:26:15.189 --> 01:26:15.199 align:start position:0%
still in a moratorium and that
 
01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
moratorium actually lasted for 10 years
 
01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
so from 2014 to 2019
 
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
there were no new projects um because of
 
01:26:25.189 --> 01:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
the moratorium
 
01:26:28.470 --> 01:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
in um rsa 19850
 
01:26:32.149 --> 01:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
in the building aid law and so
 
01:26:34.629 --> 01:26:34.639 align:start position:0%
although the law was changed in 2013 it
 
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
really didn't have an impact
 
01:26:37.990 --> 01:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
because we did not have any funds to
 
01:26:40.790 --> 01:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
actually award schools
 
01:26:44.229 --> 01:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
in um 2018 there is one
 
01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
exception and in 2018 um
 
01:26:50.149 --> 01:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
pennsdale elementary school was in some
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
of an emergency
 
01:26:53.430 --> 01:26:53.440 align:start position:0%
and so the legislature opened up
 
01:26:55.590 --> 01:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
building a just for hinsdale elementary
 
01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:56.149 align:start position:0%
building a just for hinsdale elementary
school

01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:26:59.510 --> 01:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
for that fun project um so aside from
 
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
that the state stayed in that moratorium
 
01:27:07.110 --> 01:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
in 2020 in 2021 our current
 
01:27:11.110 --> 01:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
biennium the moratorium officially ended
 
01:27:13.350 --> 01:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
and by that i mean i was still too no
 
01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
longer said that there was a moratorium
 
01:27:20.149 --> 01:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
on building the appropriation
 
01:27:23.830 --> 01:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
for fiscal 20 was the max amount of 50
 
01:27:25.830 --> 01:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
million dollars so for the first time
 
01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:26.390 align:start position:0%
million dollars so for the first time
ever

01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:26.400 align:start position:0%
ever
 
01:27:30.550 --> 01:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
in 2020 the state appropriated
 
01:27:33.030 --> 01:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
the full 50 million dollars of building
 
01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:33.990 align:start position:0%
the full 50 million dollars of building
aid

01:27:33.990 --> 01:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
aid
 
01:27:37.350 --> 01:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
and in 2021 um the state appropriates 39
 
01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:27:41.110 --> 01:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh ability and there's probably a couple
 
01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
of reasons that that wasn't 50 million
 
01:27:47.750 --> 01:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
um well one another 11 million dollars
 
01:27:50.229 --> 01:27:50.239 align:start position:0%
but also because there is a list of
 
01:27:50.239 --> 01:27:51.350 align:start position:0%
but also because there is a list of
projects

01:27:51.350 --> 01:27:51.360 align:start position:0%
projects
 
01:27:54.550 --> 01:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
and the amount that was appropriated
 
01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
was enough to cover three of the five
 
01:27:59.189 --> 01:27:59.199 align:start position:0%
projects that applied
 
01:28:01.270 --> 01:28:01.280 align:start position:0%
and three of the five projects that
 
01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:02.310 align:start position:0%
and three of the five projects that
applied

01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
applied
 
01:28:05.910 --> 01:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
um well i should say the bottom two
 
01:28:06.870 --> 01:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
projects that
 
01:28:10.149 --> 01:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
that were not funded had um not
 
01:28:13.350 --> 01:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
passed their warrant full um and
 
01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:14.400 align:start position:0%
matter of fact they didn't the
 
01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
subsequent year either um
 
01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
and so there may have been maybe that
 
01:28:20.070 --> 01:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
was one of the reasons
 
01:28:22.550 --> 01:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
all i know is i was able to fund the top
 
01:28:24.229 --> 01:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
three project
 
01:28:26.629 --> 01:28:26.639 align:start position:0%
those top three projects of that 50
 
01:28:26.639 --> 01:28:27.510 align:start position:0%
those top three projects of that 50
million

01:28:27.510 --> 01:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:28:30.790 --> 01:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
and 39 million for the biennium
 
01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
that included all my obligated payments
 
01:28:37.110 --> 01:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
lost 8.6 million dollars for these three
 
01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:38.390 align:start position:0%
lost 8.6 million dollars for these three
projects

01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:38.400 align:start position:0%
projects
 
01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
8.6 million dollars of grant money for
 
01:28:42.149 --> 01:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
three projects these projects were
 
01:28:43.830 --> 01:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
relatively small
 
01:28:49.189 --> 01:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:52.870 --> 01:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
um so there's that summary page again
 
01:28:55.590 --> 01:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
a lot on all that page um but that's
 
01:28:59.590 --> 01:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
here are the rates if you're curious as
 
01:29:04.149 --> 01:29:04.159 align:start position:0%
to hey what does my town get or what
 
01:29:06.149 --> 01:29:06.159 align:start position:0%
other towns get this is um you'll have
 
01:29:07.830 --> 01:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
this in your packet and it's just
 
01:29:09.830 --> 01:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
a list of the building aid rates those
 
01:29:11.669 --> 01:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
rates are recalculated
 
01:29:15.669 --> 01:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
every year but they are based on median
 
01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
median family income and equalized
 
01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
valuation per pupil
 
01:29:22.790 --> 01:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
what is great about the formula
 
01:29:25.189 --> 01:29:25.199 align:start position:0%
as somebody who has to calculate it it
 
01:29:27.030 --> 01:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
is a ranking
 
01:29:30.629 --> 01:29:30.639 align:start position:0%
of those the ranking of median family
 
01:29:30.639 --> 01:29:31.350 align:start position:0%
of those the ranking of median family
income

01:29:31.350 --> 01:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
income
 
01:29:33.830 --> 01:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
and the ranking of equalized valuation
 
01:29:35.110 --> 01:29:35.120 align:start position:0%
per pupil
 
01:29:37.590 --> 01:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
over a five year period so what that
 
01:29:38.629 --> 01:29:38.639 align:start position:0%
helps schools
 
01:29:40.950 --> 01:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
is because it's ranked media family
 
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
income sometimes people say
 
01:29:44.229 --> 01:29:44.239 align:start position:0%
well it's not really all that accurate
 
01:29:46.149 --> 01:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
i've heard before well this is a
 
01:29:48.790 --> 01:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
ranking so it doesn't necessarily matter
 
01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
if it's perfectly accurate
 
01:29:53.030 --> 01:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
or keeps that snapshot if if media
 
01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
family income
 
01:29:56.229 --> 01:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
goes down in a certain area sometimes
 
01:29:58.070 --> 01:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
everybody's goes down and their rankings
 
01:29:59.830 --> 01:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
don't change a whole lot
 
01:30:02.229 --> 01:30:02.239 align:start position:0%
so what happens with this formula is you
 
01:30:04.550 --> 01:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
might see somebody is at 45
 
01:30:07.030 --> 01:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
they are likely going to be at 45 this
 
01:30:07.910 --> 01:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
year as well
 
01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
and and so forth some of them do jump
 
01:30:11.350 --> 01:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
categories but not
 
01:30:13.030 --> 01:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
for the most part that those rates are
 
01:30:14.550 --> 01:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
pretty steady
 
01:30:16.390 --> 01:30:16.400 align:start position:0%
for planning purposes that help schools
 
01:30:18.830 --> 01:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
out a lot having a steady formula like
 
01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:20.470 align:start position:0%
out a lot having a steady formula like
that

01:30:20.470 --> 01:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:30:23.350 --> 01:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
um so you have that in your package and
 
01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:24.709 align:start position:0%
um so you have that in your package and
then

01:30:24.709 --> 01:30:24.719 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:30:32.830 --> 01:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:36.870 align:start position:0%
 
five

01:30:36.870 --> 01:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:40.790 --> 01:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
on page five um you should have
 
01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
um of this graph
 
01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:48.719 align:start position:0%
and on this graph um
 
01:30:49.990 --> 01:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
i won't spend a little bit of time on
 
01:30:51.510 --> 01:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
this track because i think it's um
 
01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
helpful it
 
01:30:54.149 --> 01:30:54.159 align:start position:0%
kind of tells you a little bit of the
 
01:30:56.470 --> 01:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
story about where we're going
 
01:30:59.669 --> 01:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
uh for building a the
 
01:31:02.709 --> 01:31:02.719 align:start position:0%
y-axis is in millions so that y-axis
 
01:31:05.350 --> 01:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
conveniently goes from zero to 50
 
01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:07.110 align:start position:0%
conveniently goes from zero to 50
million

01:31:07.110 --> 01:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:31:10.229 --> 01:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
the x-axis is fiscal years so if you
 
01:31:10.239 --> 01:31:10.950 align:start position:0%
the x-axis is fiscal years so if you
recall

01:31:10.950 --> 01:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
recall
 
01:31:14.149 --> 01:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
i said uh funding was fully funded in
 
01:31:16.149 --> 01:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
principle 20 you can see that bar goes
 
01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
all the way up to 50 million the bottom
 
01:31:22.229 --> 01:31:22.239 align:start position:0%
now how that's broken out is the bottom
 
01:31:23.669 --> 01:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
dark blue bar
 
01:31:26.470 --> 01:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
this bottom one here are the obligated
 
01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:27.750 align:start position:0%
this bottom one here are the obligated
payments

01:31:27.750 --> 01:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
payments
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
that are given to those past projects
 
01:31:32.550 --> 01:31:32.560 align:start position:0%
those bonds are out there they're for
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
all projects that are already built
 
01:31:38.310 --> 01:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
that's the second column of data in your
 
01:31:39.910 --> 01:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
table here the second called
 
01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
obligated payment systems
 
01:31:45.830 --> 01:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
that light blue bar the one on the top
 
01:31:47.910 --> 01:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
solid bar
 
01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
is that 2010 bond payment if you recall
 
01:31:53.189 --> 01:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
i said it was a 20-year bond payment you
 
01:31:54.149 --> 01:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
can see our last
 
01:31:57.270 --> 01:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
payment is fiscal 2030.
 
01:32:01.110 --> 01:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
that's date bond to pay those obligated
 
01:32:02.070 --> 01:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
payments from
 
01:32:06.149 --> 01:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
2010. that is the third column
 
01:32:08.870 --> 01:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
and you can see in 2030 we'll make our
 
01:32:10.229 --> 01:32:10.239 align:start position:0%
last payment the state will make their
 
01:32:13.189 --> 01:32:13.199 align:start position:0%
last payment and that would be done
 
01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
dark blue bar to schools the light blue
 
01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:16.550 align:start position:0%
dark blue bar to schools the light blue
bar

01:32:16.550 --> 01:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
bar
 
01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
is that 2010 bond unit
 
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
these little dashed lines uh are the
 
01:32:27.910 --> 01:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
payments that were uh for new projects
 
01:32:29.110 --> 01:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
for the first time
 
01:32:31.830 --> 01:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh at least in over 10 years so here's
 
01:32:33.510 --> 01:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
the new projects here
 
01:32:36.709 --> 01:32:36.719 align:start position:0%
6.7 million uh in the first year of the
 
01:32:36.719 --> 01:32:37.669 align:start position:0%
6.7 million uh in the first year of the
biennium

01:32:37.669 --> 01:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
01:32:39.510 --> 01:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
1.9 million in the second year of the
 
01:32:41.189 --> 01:32:41.199 align:start position:0%
biennium those
 
01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
those new funds funded three projects
 
01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:44.310 align:start position:0%
those new funds funded three projects
which

01:32:44.310 --> 01:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:32:47.590 --> 01:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
free rate um
 
01:32:53.189 --> 01:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
also amy yeah amy before you go on
 
01:32:56.950 --> 01:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
it shows the dark blue as obligated
 
01:33:01.270 --> 01:33:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:04.950 --> 01:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
what are those those are the bond
 
01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
payments on past construction projects
 
01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:07.990 align:start position:0%
payments on past construction projects
so

01:33:07.990 --> 01:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:33:11.669 --> 01:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
um yeah yep i got it
 
01:33:15.590 --> 01:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:19.030 --> 01:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
30 million basically
 
01:33:22.629 --> 01:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
due off the the bonding that we did in
 
01:33:26.070 --> 01:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
2010 is that correct
 
01:33:29.430 --> 01:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
um so in 2010
 
01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
um if you could see do you see this can
 
01:33:32.950 --> 01:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
you see my cursor
 
01:33:36.390 --> 01:33:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh on your end you guys so
 
01:33:40.149 --> 01:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
in 2022 this um biennium coming up
 
01:33:43.590 --> 01:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
2022 the state will have an 8.1 million
 
01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:43.990 align:start position:0%
2022 the state will have an 8.1 million
dollar

01:33:43.990 --> 01:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
01:33:47.189 --> 01:33:47.199 align:start position:0%
payment on that 2010 bond
 
01:33:50.229 --> 01:33:50.239 align:start position:0%
um we'll own 27 million schools
 
01:33:52.870 --> 01:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
for those past projects we'll have that
 
01:33:54.790 --> 01:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
eight point one million dollar bond
 
01:33:58.470 --> 01:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
uh payment payment and then that total
 
01:34:01.830 --> 01:34:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:04.229 --> 01:34:04.239 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much so this is not
 
01:34:04.950 --> 01:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
this is not
 
01:34:07.590 --> 01:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
new funding this is old funding that
 
01:34:08.950 --> 01:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
we're paying down
 
01:34:11.669 --> 01:34:11.679 align:start position:0%
correct yep so the all of those solid
 
01:34:13.189 --> 01:34:13.199 align:start position:0%
bars are all just past
 
01:34:15.030 --> 01:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
those are those are projects that are
 
01:34:18.629 --> 01:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
already done thank you
 
01:34:21.669 --> 01:34:21.679 align:start position:0%
you're welcome and so the total of those
 
01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
so let's see
 
01:34:26.470 --> 01:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
um the total of so we're coming up
 
01:34:30.070 --> 01:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
let me focus on fiscal um
 
01:34:32.070 --> 01:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
one two two and twenty three since
 
01:34:33.669 --> 01:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
that's the one individual like it's done
 
01:34:34.550 --> 01:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
right here
 
01:34:37.910 --> 01:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
if you can see the total of my obligated
 
01:34:40.629 --> 01:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
payments to schools plus that 2010 bond
 
01:34:44.310 --> 01:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
totals 35 million and we can see that on
 
01:34:44.950 --> 01:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
the ground
 
01:34:47.990 --> 01:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
if you look under crystal 22 there's the
 
01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:49.189 align:start position:0%
if you look under crystal 22 there's the
obligation

01:34:49.189 --> 01:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
obligation
 
01:34:51.189 --> 01:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
there's the 2010 bond and if you see
 
01:34:53.030 --> 01:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
right there that's 35 million
 
01:34:56.070 --> 01:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
so we are going to be paying 35 million
 
01:34:57.430 --> 01:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
as long as it's appropriated
 
01:35:00.790 --> 01:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
in that manner um the second year in the
 
01:35:02.629 --> 01:35:02.639 align:start position:0%
biennium that'll go down a little bit to
 
01:35:04.229 --> 01:35:04.239 align:start position:0%
32 million
 
01:35:06.070 --> 01:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
you can see why it's called the tail
 
01:35:07.270 --> 01:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
it's like a tail
 
01:35:09.430 --> 01:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
but it looks like that because every
 
01:35:12.070 --> 01:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
year we continue to pay off projects
 
01:35:14.149 --> 01:35:14.159 align:start position:0%
that are you know we're making our final
 
01:35:15.750 --> 01:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
payment to somebody this year
 
01:35:17.590 --> 01:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
and those projects that were built 28
 
01:35:19.109 --> 01:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
years ago i'll no longer have to pay
 
01:35:19.119 --> 01:35:20.629 align:start position:0%
years ago i'll no longer have to pay
them

01:35:20.629 --> 01:35:20.639 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
um if you um
 
01:35:26.470 --> 01:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
move over to the 50 million dollar
 
01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
column it says 50 million
 
01:35:31.510 --> 01:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
less debt service what this column
 
01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:32.629 align:start position:0%
less debt service what this column
represents

01:35:32.629 --> 01:35:32.639 align:start position:0%
represents
 
01:35:36.229 --> 01:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
is if building aid were fully funded
 
01:35:38.709 --> 01:35:38.719 align:start position:0%
and when i say fully funded i mean up to
 
01:35:40.629 --> 01:35:40.639 align:start position:0%
the maximum extent of the law
 
01:35:43.669 --> 01:35:43.679 align:start position:0%
of 50 million dollars per year what this
 
01:35:44.950 --> 01:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
would allow
 
01:35:48.790 --> 01:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
is this much money for new projects
 
01:35:52.229 --> 01:35:52.239 align:start position:0%
um so if buildings were fully funded in
 
01:35:54.070 --> 01:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
22 and 23
 
01:35:56.629 --> 01:35:56.639 align:start position:0%
it would give 15 million the first year
 
01:35:57.669 --> 01:35:57.679 align:start position:0%
the biennium
 
01:35:59.990 --> 01:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
and 18 million and the second year of
 
01:36:01.910 --> 01:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
the biennium for a new construction
 
01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:02.870 align:start position:0%
the biennium for a new construction
project

01:36:02.870 --> 01:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:36:05.189 --> 01:36:05.199 align:start position:0%
that's what would be available for new
 
01:36:06.310 --> 01:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
construction projects
 
01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:08.239 align:start position:0%
that total for the biennium has shipped
 
01:36:10.470 --> 01:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
these two numbers added together
 
01:36:15.189 --> 01:36:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:18.229 --> 01:36:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh yeah the debt
 
01:36:24.310 --> 01:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
service is um
 
01:36:27.510 --> 01:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh maybe let me think about that but
 
01:36:30.709 --> 01:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not i'm not
 
01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
convinced that um
 
01:36:38.070 --> 01:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
that i know it comes out
 
01:36:41.590 --> 01:36:41.600 align:start position:0%
of the education trust fund i got that
 
01:36:44.629 --> 01:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
but i'm not sure that we
 
01:36:49.030 --> 01:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
need to look at it as reducing
 
01:36:52.390 --> 01:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
the amount that's available for
 
01:36:55.510 --> 01:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
new construction but i'll have to i'll
 
01:36:56.709 --> 01:36:56.719 align:start position:0%
have to
 
01:36:59.350 --> 01:36:59.360 align:start position:0%
that's actually a good question um caleb
 
01:37:00.550 --> 01:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
you want me to answer that or you look
 
01:37:01.990 --> 01:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
like you can answer it yeah okay
 
01:37:03.750 --> 01:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
she's my boss so i'll defer to her if
 
01:37:07.030 --> 01:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
she wants but um representative umberger
 
01:37:10.470 --> 01:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
um you are for i'm glad you're thinking
 
01:37:11.189 --> 01:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
like that
 
01:37:12.709 --> 01:37:12.719 align:start position:0%
uh that would free up a little bit more
 
01:37:14.470 --> 01:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
money for new construction projects
 
01:37:17.189 --> 01:37:17.199 align:start position:0%
at one time that is how the law was
 
01:37:17.199 --> 01:37:17.910 align:start position:0%
at one time that is how the law was
interpreted

01:37:17.910 --> 01:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
interpreted
 
01:37:20.550 --> 01:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
and we would take 50 million and
 
01:37:20.560 --> 01:37:21.189 align:start position:0%
and we would take 50 million and
subtract

01:37:21.189 --> 01:37:21.199 align:start position:0%
subtract
 
01:37:23.750 --> 01:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
out our just our obligated payments but
 
01:37:24.629 --> 01:37:24.639 align:start position:0%
i believe
 
01:37:27.109 --> 01:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
three years ago caitlin correctly had
 
01:37:27.119 --> 01:37:27.750 align:start position:0%
three years ago caitlin correctly had
around

01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:37:31.270 --> 01:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
three years ago um if um somebody else
 
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
had a different interpretation
 
01:37:34.790 --> 01:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
and said that we had to include those
 
01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
debt service payments
 
01:37:39.109 --> 01:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
um in that 50 direction
 
01:37:40.709 --> 01:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
but somebody has looked at it and
 
01:37:43.350 --> 01:37:43.360 align:start position:0%
changed sort of how we
 
01:37:47.430 --> 01:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
look at that representative
 
01:37:49.590 --> 01:37:49.600 align:start position:0%
we had a legal interpretation from the
 
01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
ag's office
 
01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
and they determined that um i do want to
 
01:37:54.709 --> 01:37:54.719 align:start position:0%
just clarify too that the debt service
 
01:37:56.550 --> 01:37:56.560 align:start position:0%
is actually not in the education trust
 
01:37:58.229 --> 01:37:58.239 align:start position:0%
fund only the
 
01:38:00.229 --> 01:38:00.239 align:start position:0%
obligated schools to payment so like
 
01:38:01.750 --> 01:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
that true tale
 
01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
that is the portion that's an education
 
01:38:05.189 --> 01:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
trust and the remaining amount i believe
 
01:38:05.199 --> 01:38:05.510 align:start position:0%
trust and the remaining amount i believe
is

01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:38:07.510 --> 01:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
in the treasury's portion of the budget
 
01:38:08.629 --> 01:38:08.639 align:start position:0%
but like you can yeah
 
01:38:11.669 --> 01:38:11.679 align:start position:0%
i think you're right it is yeah so these
 
01:38:13.590 --> 01:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
two pieces are in different places right
 
01:38:15.590 --> 01:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund is here
 
01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
and treasury is here um however for me
 
01:38:21.510 --> 01:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
or for other schools when they're
 
01:38:23.109 --> 01:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
looking at funding new projects i have
 
01:38:25.030 --> 01:38:25.040 align:start position:0%
to include both as the total debt
 
01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:25.830 align:start position:0%
to include both as the total debt
service

01:38:25.830 --> 01:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
service
 
01:38:28.390 --> 01:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
less than 50 million uh therefore that
 
01:38:29.910 --> 01:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
would give me a resolving
 
01:38:32.149 --> 01:38:32.159 align:start position:0%
32 million dollars for new projects if
 
01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
building a work fully funded
 
01:38:37.030 --> 01:38:37.040 align:start position:0%
in fiscal 22 and 23. and can i can i
 
01:38:38.390 --> 01:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
point something out real quick
 
01:38:42.229 --> 01:38:42.239 align:start position:0%
uh house bill 594 which passed the house
 
01:38:45.750 --> 01:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
at the end of february um is referred to
 
01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:46.870 align:start position:0%
at the end of february um is referred to
finance

01:38:46.870 --> 01:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
finance
 
01:38:49.510 --> 01:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
and that bill and amy can speak more to
 
01:38:50.229 --> 01:38:50.239 align:start position:0%
it but
 
01:38:52.629 --> 01:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
that bill turns that 50 million dollar
 
01:38:54.149 --> 01:38:54.159 align:start position:0%
ceiling into a floor
 
01:38:55.750 --> 01:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
so that's where these two years where
 
01:38:57.350 --> 01:38:57.360 align:start position:0%
amy is doing the 50 million dollar
 
01:38:57.360 --> 01:38:57.990 align:start position:0%
amy is doing the 50 million dollar
exercise

01:38:57.990 --> 01:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
exercise
 
01:38:59.430 --> 01:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
comes into play this committee will have
 
01:39:01.590 --> 01:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
to consider that bill
 
01:39:07.750 --> 01:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:10.790 --> 01:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
thank you matt representative petry
 
01:39:13.590 --> 01:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
yes madam chair thank you uh looking at
 
01:39:14.229 --> 01:39:14.239 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:39:18.470 --> 01:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
20 and 21 at the uh on 20 you've got 6.7
 
01:39:20.229 --> 01:39:20.239 align:start position:0%
million allocated for construction
 
01:39:20.239 --> 01:39:21.430 align:start position:0%
million allocated for construction
projects

01:39:21.430 --> 01:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
projects
 
01:39:24.470 --> 01:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
how come the 21 year doesn't show that
 
01:39:26.070 --> 01:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
to the full 50 million
 
01:39:28.550 --> 01:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
or is that just on the other part of the
 
01:39:30.149 --> 01:39:30.159 align:start position:0%
chart show that
 
01:39:32.790 --> 01:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
well that's a good question so that 13
 
01:39:34.390 --> 01:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
million that you're seeing there
 
01:39:36.870 --> 01:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
was if building a were fully funded to
 
01:39:37.990 --> 01:39:38.000 align:start position:0%
50 million
 
01:39:40.470 --> 01:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
building it was not fully funded it was
 
01:39:43.189 --> 01:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
uh only funded to 39 million
 
01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
um that year instead of 50 million so
 
01:39:47.750 --> 01:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
that's why there's 13 million
 
01:39:49.910 --> 01:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
this is what the legislature could have
 
01:39:52.070 --> 01:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
appropriated but they did not
 
01:39:54.470 --> 01:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
they did not appropriate 19.2 million
 
01:39:55.350 --> 01:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
for the biennium
 
01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
instead they appropriated 8.6
 
01:40:02.870 --> 01:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
it's 6.7 in fiscal 2020
 
01:40:05.510 --> 01:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
um which is there so it was fully funded
 
01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:06.149 align:start position:0%
um which is there so it was fully funded
there

01:40:06.149 --> 01:40:06.159 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:40:08.310 --> 01:40:08.320 align:start position:0%
but then this year was not fully funded
 
01:40:09.669 --> 01:40:09.679 align:start position:0%
it's the only 1.9
 
01:40:12.229 --> 01:40:12.239 align:start position:0%
instead of 13 million only 1.9 million
 
01:40:14.950 --> 01:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:19.189 --> 01:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:25.990 --> 01:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:29.109 --> 01:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
uh please unmute
 
01:40:36.149 --> 01:40:36.159 align:start position:0%
okay i'm trying to get i'm
 
01:40:43.669 --> 01:40:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:47.990 --> 01:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
okay sorry um
 
01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
so my question was uh uh
 
01:40:55.990 --> 01:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
the chart shows um the blue
 
01:40:58.629 --> 01:40:58.639 align:start position:0%
the dark blue is obligated payments and
 
01:40:59.510 --> 01:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
plus the
 
01:41:02.629 --> 01:41:02.639 align:start position:0%
the the light blue is the what was what
 
01:41:04.070 --> 01:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
was bonded but but
 
01:41:08.149 --> 01:41:08.159 align:start position:0%
all of the blue equals the tail
 
01:41:10.470 --> 01:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
that that's called the tail right and it
 
01:41:13.109 --> 01:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
does not it doesn't include the two
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
the two uh new construction amounts of
 
01:41:17.109 --> 01:41:17.119 align:start position:0%
6.7 flips
 
01:41:20.390 --> 01:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
point nine all right gotta know
 
01:41:23.109 --> 01:41:23.119 align:start position:0%
correct and and and recall that those
 
01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
payment those projects are now paid
 
01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:25.910 align:start position:0%
payment those projects are now paid
differently

01:41:25.910 --> 01:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
differently
 
01:41:30.070 --> 01:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
so since 2013 although it's 2013 we just
 
01:41:30.950 --> 01:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
didn't have any
 
01:41:32.790 --> 01:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
that was when the new law was in place
 
01:41:34.629 --> 01:41:34.639 align:start position:0%
of how we paid projects
 
01:41:36.870 --> 01:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
but in 2013 that law said we're no
 
01:41:38.310 --> 01:41:38.320 align:start position:0%
longer going to have a tail
 
01:41:40.149 --> 01:41:40.159 align:start position:0%
i'm going to fund all those projects so
 
01:41:42.070 --> 01:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
when i said i paid 80 percent of the
 
01:41:43.510 --> 01:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
project upfront
 
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:52.149 --> 01:41:52.159 align:start position:0%
and so this 6.7 and 1.9
 
01:41:54.629 --> 01:41:54.639 align:start position:0%
covers all payments for those three
 
01:41:54.639 --> 01:41:55.590 align:start position:0%
covers all payments for those three
projects

01:41:55.590 --> 01:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
projects
 
01:41:59.750 --> 01:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
um and so those payments won't
 
01:42:03.030 --> 01:42:03.040 align:start position:0%
won't drag on with this sale they're
 
01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:07.109 align:start position:0%
won't drag on with this sale they're
done

01:42:07.109 --> 01:42:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
and similarly if building it were fully
 
01:42:11.270 --> 01:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
funded this 32 million
 
01:42:13.750 --> 01:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
would be blips here if they would be
 
01:42:15.430 --> 01:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
okay i'm going to spend this money i'm
 
01:42:15.990 --> 01:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
going to give
 
01:42:18.390 --> 01:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
projects to 32 million and we're not
 
01:42:20.229 --> 01:42:20.239 align:start position:0%
going to talk about it in 2040 about how
 
01:42:21.850 --> 01:42:21.860 align:start position:0%
much i have them
 
01:42:21.860 --> 01:42:22.870 align:start position:0%
much i have them
[Music]

01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:42:25.270 --> 01:42:25.280 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome yeah by the way
 
01:42:27.189 --> 01:42:27.199 align:start position:0%
tom i think you voted for this
 
01:42:31.109 --> 01:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
uh 80 20 split when uh
 
01:42:32.790 --> 01:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
when we finally got it through the
 
01:42:34.310 --> 01:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
legislature but
 
01:42:35.750 --> 01:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative heath you have a
 
01:42:37.910 --> 01:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you madam chair and
 
01:42:38.790 --> 01:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
amy thank you
 
01:42:41.109 --> 01:42:41.119 align:start position:0%
you do such a fabulous job explaining
 
01:42:42.229 --> 01:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
all of this
 
01:42:45.510 --> 01:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
my question is this
 
01:42:48.149 --> 01:42:48.159 align:start position:0%
in the governor's budget we have 30
 
01:42:50.149 --> 01:42:50.159 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:42:53.590 --> 01:42:53.600 align:start position:0%
dedicated to infrastructure would not
 
01:42:56.629 --> 01:42:56.639 align:start position:0%
that be more useful if we took that 30
 
01:42:56.639 --> 01:42:57.189 align:start position:0%
that be more useful if we took that 30
million

01:42:57.189 --> 01:42:57.199 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:43:00.390 --> 01:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
and put it in building aid and is that
 
01:43:02.229 --> 01:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
too loaded a question to ask you
 
01:43:06.790 --> 01:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:08.550 --> 01:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
i'm working at home and caitlyn can't
 
01:43:11.350 --> 01:43:11.360 align:start position:0%
even kick me under the desk
 
01:43:14.790 --> 01:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
but i know uh no i am going to talk
 
01:43:16.229 --> 01:43:16.239 align:start position:0%
about the public school infrastructure
 
01:43:17.669 --> 01:43:17.679 align:start position:0%
fund so you'll see the differences
 
01:43:17.679 --> 01:43:18.470 align:start position:0%
fund so you'll see the differences
between

01:43:18.470 --> 01:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:43:22.470 --> 01:43:22.480 align:start position:0%
um the two funds and um that's really a
 
01:43:24.470 --> 01:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
decision the public school
 
01:43:25.510 --> 01:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund
 
01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
and school building aid are different
 
01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:28.709 align:start position:0%
and school building aid are different
things

01:43:28.709 --> 01:43:28.719 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:43:30.390 --> 01:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh they have the word infrastructure in
 
01:43:32.310 --> 01:43:32.320 align:start position:0%
them but they are different funding so
 
01:43:33.590 --> 01:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
i'll present what public school
 
01:43:35.109 --> 01:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund is and you can
 
01:43:37.910 --> 01:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
decide where that 30 million dollars
 
01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:38.639 align:start position:0%
thanks uh
 
01:43:41.189 --> 01:43:41.199 align:start position:0%
mary i i would agree that was a very
 
01:43:43.030 --> 01:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
loaded question
 
01:43:46.390 --> 01:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
and uh not not one that we should ask
 
01:43:47.430 --> 01:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
amy to
 
01:43:51.590 --> 01:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
um to answer but uh i can guarantee you
 
01:43:53.109 --> 01:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
that we will be
 
01:43:56.229 --> 01:43:56.239 align:start position:0%
debating that issue uh when
 
01:43:59.270 --> 01:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh when we start doing our line by line
 
01:44:02.709 --> 01:44:02.719 align:start position:0%
so thank you here i apologize no
 
01:44:06.390 --> 01:44:06.400 align:start position:0%

01:44:36.550 --> 01:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
through bulk of it even though
 
01:44:38.629 --> 01:44:38.639 align:start position:0%
my number of slides won't tell that the
 
01:44:40.870 --> 01:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
story but the rest of it is relatively
 
01:44:44.629 --> 01:44:44.639 align:start position:0%
fast um here the next piece is the list
 
01:44:46.629 --> 01:44:46.639 align:start position:0%
of the projects that have applied for
 
01:44:48.629 --> 01:44:48.639 align:start position:0%
building aid this time around
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
so there is a biannual process for them
 
01:44:53.270 --> 01:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
they have to apply
 
01:44:55.510 --> 01:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
for this funding that potentially will
 
01:44:57.430 --> 01:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
come or potentially not
 
01:44:59.990 --> 01:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
um and this is a list of those projects
 
01:45:01.109 --> 01:45:01.119 align:start position:0%
it is simply an
 
01:45:04.629 --> 01:45:04.639 align:start position:0%
order of um sau um
 
01:45:07.590 --> 01:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
so you can see it's hard to read them
 
01:45:08.149 --> 01:45:08.159 align:start position:0%
it's more
 
01:45:10.149 --> 01:45:10.159 align:start position:0%
for you to see the handout in front of
 
01:45:11.830 --> 01:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
you but um
 
01:45:13.430 --> 01:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
there's a description of the project
 
01:45:15.350 --> 01:45:15.360 align:start position:0%
there's a list of the schools there's 12
 
01:45:16.149 --> 01:45:16.159 align:start position:0%
of them
 
01:45:18.550 --> 01:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
um their project offered here they're
 
01:45:19.990 --> 01:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
building a rate
 
01:45:22.390 --> 01:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
the total building eight amounts there
 
01:45:24.310 --> 01:45:24.320 align:start position:0%
and then i added a column to show
 
01:45:26.550 --> 01:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
where they are in their local local end
 
01:45:28.310 --> 01:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
of things whether they're
 
01:45:30.229 --> 01:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
already approved they're getting ready
 
01:45:32.070 --> 01:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
for approval um
 
01:45:34.310 --> 01:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
note that allen's town is going to vote
 
01:45:35.350 --> 01:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
this um
 
01:45:37.830 --> 01:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
march and their warrant article is
 
01:45:39.430 --> 01:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
subject to receiving building aid
 
01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:39.910 align:start position:0%
subject to receiving building aid
because

01:45:39.910 --> 01:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:45:41.830 --> 01:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
they have they are not going to be able
 
01:45:44.629 --> 01:45:44.639 align:start position:0%
to fund this project i just want to
 
01:45:45.910 --> 01:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
believe that that is the one that's
 
01:45:47.109 --> 01:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
subject to building
 
01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
a couple of schools have decided we're
 
01:45:50.870 --> 01:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
not even going to vote on it
 
01:45:52.790 --> 01:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
because we just don't know the status of
 
01:45:54.149 --> 01:45:54.159 align:start position:0%
building it and we're going to wait two
 
01:45:54.159 --> 01:45:55.430 align:start position:0%
building it and we're going to wait two
years

01:45:55.430 --> 01:45:55.440 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:45:57.109 --> 01:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
some schools might also be waiting
 
01:45:58.709 --> 01:45:58.719 align:start position:0%
because they're just undecided because
 
01:46:00.229 --> 01:46:00.239 align:start position:0%
it's loaded what their school what their
 
01:46:01.189 --> 01:46:01.199 align:start position:0%
future is
 
01:46:04.629 --> 01:46:04.639 align:start position:0%
um so that's the reason and then there
 
01:46:06.310 --> 01:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
are public schools that are passed
 
01:46:07.990 --> 01:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
and they haven't done any construction
 
01:46:09.910 --> 01:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
so they're they're eligible for billing
 
01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:10.390 align:start position:0%
so they're they're eligible for billing
aid

01:46:10.390 --> 01:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
aid
 
01:46:12.790 --> 01:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
but they're just holding off to see if
 
01:46:13.669 --> 01:46:13.679 align:start position:0%
they um
 
01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
get secured um so that there's a list of
 
01:46:19.109 --> 01:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
the projects again
 
01:46:20.950 --> 01:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
the summary is there but that really i
 
01:46:22.310 --> 01:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
think this is maybe it's
 
01:46:25.430 --> 01:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
the take-home message is that it's 270
 
01:46:27.669 --> 01:46:27.679 align:start position:0%
million dollars worth of construction
 
01:46:30.310 --> 01:46:30.320 align:start position:0%
they're seeking 104 million dollars of
 
01:46:31.669 --> 01:46:31.679 align:start position:0%
state aid
 
01:46:34.709 --> 01:46:34.719 align:start position:0%
if you recall from the graph if building
 
01:46:36.629 --> 01:46:36.639 align:start position:0%
they were fully funded i would have 32
 
01:46:38.070 --> 01:46:38.080 align:start position:0%
million dollars at most
 
01:46:41.270 --> 01:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
in the biennium um so 104 million
 
01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
dollars of projects seeking
 
01:46:45.830 --> 01:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
uh money for construction could the law
 
01:46:47.510 --> 01:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
currently attack
 
01:46:52.870 --> 01:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:56.310 --> 01:46:56.320 align:start position:0%
charge amy i i just have a question mary
 
01:46:57.030 --> 01:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
will or
 
01:46:59.109 --> 01:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
represent heath will uh if you don't
 
01:46:59.119 --> 01:47:00.070 align:start position:0%
represent heath will uh if you don't
mind

01:47:00.070 --> 01:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
mind
 
01:47:03.830 --> 01:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
uh i notice as i went down through there
 
01:47:06.629 --> 01:47:06.639 align:start position:0%
uh that there were lots of people that
 
01:47:07.750 --> 01:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
01:47:11.030 --> 01:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
anything going to the voters for
 
01:47:16.310 --> 01:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
a bond so the 104 million
 
01:47:19.910 --> 01:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
could not possibly be spent
 
01:47:23.030 --> 01:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
in this biennium is that correct
 
01:47:25.669 --> 01:47:25.679 align:start position:0%
um no because i i shouldn't say spent
 
01:47:25.679 --> 01:47:26.870 align:start position:0%
um no because i i shouldn't say spent
obligated

01:47:26.870 --> 01:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
obligated
 
01:47:29.430 --> 01:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
yeah it could because they would have so
 
01:47:29.440 --> 01:47:30.550 align:start position:0%
yeah it could because they would have so
um

01:47:30.550 --> 01:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:33.350 --> 01:47:33.360 align:start position:0%
they they could go next march because
 
01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
it's a biannum
 
01:47:38.390 --> 01:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
you know i i can offer so for example
 
01:47:40.390 --> 01:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
um let's say this list is ranked it's
 
01:47:42.070 --> 01:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
not but i would go to the top of the
 
01:47:43.189 --> 01:47:43.199 align:start position:0%
list and i would offer
 
01:47:45.270 --> 01:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
allentown 19 million dollars of their
 
01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:46.310 align:start position:0%
allentown 19 million dollars of their
building

01:47:46.310 --> 01:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:47:49.510 --> 01:47:49.520 align:start position:0%
um sorry for scrolling but i'm just
 
01:47:50.870 --> 01:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
going to see what these numbers are
 
01:47:54.070 --> 01:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
um this 32 million is 15 million in the
 
01:47:55.910 --> 01:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
first year of the biennium
 
01:47:58.870 --> 01:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
18 million in the second year again
 
01:48:00.550 --> 01:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
that's assuming bill the gate were fully
 
01:48:02.310 --> 01:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
funded to that 50 million
 
01:48:04.070 --> 01:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
i would have 15 million in the first
 
01:48:05.910 --> 01:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
year and 18 the second
 
01:48:08.709 --> 01:48:08.719 align:start position:0%
so this is the list for both years so if
 
01:48:10.470 --> 01:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
this were in order i would offer
 
01:48:13.270 --> 01:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
i only have 15 but i'd offer 19 to allen
 
01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:14.070 align:start position:0%
i only have 15 but i'd offer 19 to allen
sound

01:48:14.070 --> 01:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
sound
 
01:48:15.750 --> 01:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh they could they would get their
 
01:48:19.109 --> 01:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
second piece of it the following
 
01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
i really just need one of these projects
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
to pass and my money goes just like that
 
01:48:25.590 --> 01:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
well i already know i mean i already
 
01:48:27.189 --> 01:48:27.199 align:start position:0%
have a couple of schools
 
01:48:29.350 --> 01:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
that have already passed i mean this
 
01:48:31.270 --> 01:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
this is a 33 million dollar
 
01:48:33.910 --> 01:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
rant award right here so the first year
 
01:48:35.669 --> 01:48:35.679 align:start position:0%
the biennium
 
01:48:37.669 --> 01:48:37.679 align:start position:0%
won't be a problem the second year of
 
01:48:39.270 --> 01:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
the biennium getting an additional
 
01:48:40.229 --> 01:48:40.239 align:start position:0%
amount of money
 
01:48:42.950 --> 01:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
they start at the top of the list again
 
01:48:46.149 --> 01:48:46.159 align:start position:0%
let's say allen's time did not pass but
 
01:48:46.159 --> 01:48:46.470 align:start position:0%
let's say allen's time did not pass but
they

01:48:46.470 --> 01:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
would try again next march they could go
 
01:48:50.790 --> 01:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
to vote next march
 
01:48:52.709 --> 01:48:52.719 align:start position:0%
if they did pass they would then get
 
01:48:54.950 --> 01:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
offered on that second year
 
01:48:57.270 --> 01:48:57.280 align:start position:0%
um so this money will go because i have
 
01:48:58.070 --> 01:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
more money
 
01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:08.470 --> 01:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative heath uh if you
 
01:49:09.510 --> 01:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
would and then i'll
 
01:49:11.669 --> 01:49:11.679 align:start position:0%
follow up with a question thank you
 
01:49:12.790 --> 01:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:49:16.310 --> 01:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
um amy we've had a number of projects
 
01:49:20.790 --> 01:49:20.800 align:start position:0%
that were done previous to um
 
01:49:24.070 --> 01:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
being being able to pay to any of the
 
01:49:26.070 --> 01:49:26.080 align:start position:0%
school districts i think dover is one of
 
01:49:26.080 --> 01:49:26.870 align:start position:0%
school districts i think dover is one of
them

01:49:26.870 --> 01:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:49:30.070 --> 01:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
um am i correct
 
01:49:33.510 --> 01:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
that those older projects are no longer
 
01:49:36.629 --> 01:49:36.639 align:start position:0%
um available for funding it seems to me
 
01:49:38.310 --> 01:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
that i think we passed a loss
 
01:49:41.189 --> 01:49:41.199 align:start position:0%
some that said they weren't is that true
 
01:49:43.750 --> 01:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
i i can't i'm just not sure
 
01:49:45.270 --> 01:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
that's correct so if you built during
 
01:49:47.109 --> 01:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
the moratorium um
 
01:49:49.350 --> 01:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
essentially you have to be approved for
 
01:49:51.030 --> 01:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
the va prior to construction
 
01:49:53.189 --> 01:49:53.199 align:start position:0%
that's what the law says so if you build
 
01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
without approval
 
01:49:59.990 --> 01:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:01.990 --> 01:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
which public school 594 it's not in
 
01:50:04.070 --> 01:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
there right now that was removed from
 
01:50:05.990 --> 01:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
household 594. it
 
01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
comes up every two years to fund these
 
01:50:12.470 --> 01:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:15.669 --> 01:50:15.679 align:start position:0%
so uh amy you had indicated
 
01:50:19.830 --> 01:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
that we had not spent all of the money
 
01:50:26.229 --> 01:50:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:30.470 --> 01:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
am i correct in that uh uh
 
01:50:32.870 --> 01:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
you are correct i don't believe i said
 
01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:33.510 align:start position:0%
you are correct i don't believe i said
that

01:50:33.510 --> 01:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:50:37.750 --> 01:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
but the the this amount of money
 
01:50:41.350 --> 01:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
the 6.7 million um is
 
01:50:45.350 --> 01:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
done and gone this 1.9 million was
 
01:50:47.750 --> 01:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
when all said and done those three
 
01:50:47.760 --> 01:50:48.790 align:start position:0%
when all said and done those three
projects

01:50:48.790 --> 01:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
projects
 
01:50:51.990 --> 01:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
some of their costs were not eligible um
 
01:50:54.310 --> 01:50:54.320 align:start position:0%
and therefore there is actually seven
 
01:50:56.470 --> 01:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars or so
 
01:50:58.550 --> 01:50:58.560 align:start position:0%
that that will be returned that will
 
01:51:00.550 --> 01:51:00.560 align:start position:0%
lapse back into the general fund or the
 
01:51:02.310 --> 01:51:02.320 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
01:51:04.550 --> 01:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know which way that gets um sent
 
01:51:05.669 --> 01:51:05.679 align:start position:0%
back but
 
01:51:09.189 --> 01:51:09.199 align:start position:0%
so yes technically those three projects
 
01:51:11.430 --> 01:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
came under i won't say under budgets and
 
01:51:12.950 --> 01:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
things were not eligible
 
01:51:14.470 --> 01:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
and therefore seven hundred thousand
 
01:51:16.709 --> 01:51:16.719 align:start position:0%
dollars would be free
 
01:51:20.070 --> 01:51:20.080 align:start position:0%
but what i may have also said
 
01:51:22.149 --> 01:51:22.159 align:start position:0%
is that of this 13 million dollars
 
01:51:24.229 --> 01:51:24.239 align:start position:0%
building it was not fully funded
 
01:51:27.830 --> 01:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
in fiscal 21 so 13 million
 
01:51:30.070 --> 01:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
could have been if 50 million dollars
 
01:51:32.070 --> 01:51:32.080 align:start position:0%
was appropriated but 50 million
 
01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
was not appropriated only um
 
01:51:38.149 --> 01:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
only 39 or so million dollars was
 
01:51:40.470 --> 01:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
appropriated which must be only 1.9
 
01:51:40.480 --> 01:51:45.669 align:start position:0%
appropriated which must be only 1.9
million

01:51:45.669 --> 01:51:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:48.709 --> 01:51:48.719 align:start position:0%
so if i if i heard what you said
 
01:51:52.629 --> 01:51:52.639 align:start position:0%
out of what was appropriated in the 2021
 
01:51:52.639 --> 01:51:54.229 align:start position:0%
out of what was appropriated in the 2021
budget

01:51:54.229 --> 01:51:54.239 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:51:57.830 --> 01:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
that you have spent all that you had
 
01:52:03.910 --> 01:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:06.950 --> 01:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
okay and that will come back to us all
 
01:52:09.510 --> 01:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
right thank you
 
01:52:12.390 --> 01:52:12.400 align:start position:0%
and on a longer list i could offer that
 
01:52:13.589 --> 01:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
700 000
 
01:52:16.629 --> 01:52:16.639 align:start position:0%
to the next ranked project but my
 
01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
project list only had five projects and
 
01:52:21.189 --> 01:52:21.199 align:start position:0%
the bottom two did not pass their
 
01:52:22.950 --> 01:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
local warrant articles so when you don't
 
01:52:24.709 --> 01:52:24.719 align:start position:0%
have local approval you can't accept
 
01:52:24.719 --> 01:52:25.910 align:start position:0%
have local approval you can't accept
building

01:52:25.910 --> 01:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:52:27.510 --> 01:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
which is important to remember because
 
01:52:29.270 --> 01:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
some of these projects
 
01:52:32.310 --> 01:52:32.320 align:start position:0%
might not pass their local approval
 
01:52:33.589 --> 01:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean i still give them
 
01:52:36.149 --> 01:52:36.159 align:start position:0%
buildings obviously
 
01:52:38.070 --> 01:52:38.080 align:start position:0%
okay different buildings they actually
 
01:52:39.510 --> 01:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
have to have a contract
 
01:52:41.109 --> 01:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
and that have state fire marshal's
 
01:52:43.030 --> 01:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
office approval there's a lot of other
 
01:52:45.030 --> 01:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
tools that they need prior to
 
01:52:48.950 --> 01:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:51.990 --> 01:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
so um page eight uh
 
01:52:53.350 --> 01:52:53.360 align:start position:0%
you might want to avert your eyes
 
01:52:55.189 --> 01:52:55.199 align:start position:0%
because i'm doing gonna do some
 
01:52:59.270 --> 01:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
scrolling but um page 8 through 14
 
01:53:02.070 --> 01:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
is just the payments um you can look on
 
01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
any one of these
 
01:53:06.470 --> 01:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
um these are the most obligated payments
 
01:53:09.270 --> 01:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
and so this is fiscal 22 and 23 payments
 
01:53:10.470 --> 01:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
that i'm making
 
01:53:12.310 --> 01:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
um these are all those projects that
 
01:53:14.709 --> 01:53:14.719 align:start position:0%
we've built in the past 20 years
 
01:53:18.070 --> 01:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
um londonderry for example um
 
01:53:20.310 --> 01:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
we there was an edition renovation put
 
01:53:22.070 --> 01:53:22.080 align:start position:0%
on the south londonderry elementary
 
01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:22.950 align:start position:0%
on the south londonderry elementary
school

01:53:22.950 --> 01:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
school
 
01:53:25.510 --> 01:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
but um the project was about five
 
01:53:27.109 --> 01:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
their eight amounts a little over a
 
01:53:30.390 --> 01:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:53:33.510 --> 01:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
we paid that one this million dollars we
 
01:53:34.149 --> 01:53:34.159 align:start position:0%
paid it
 
01:53:37.109 --> 01:53:37.119 align:start position:0%
over that it was built in 2010 you can
 
01:53:38.830 --> 01:53:38.840 align:start position:0%
see this was a
 
01:53:41.589 --> 01:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
20 uh 20-year bond
 
01:53:46.070 --> 01:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
so um from 2010 to 2029
 
01:53:50.390 --> 01:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
we're paying them approximately 79 000
 
01:53:53.990 --> 01:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
a year for 20 years um we
 
01:53:56.950 --> 01:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
owe them 638 thousand dollars over the
 
01:53:56.960 --> 01:53:57.430 align:start position:0%
owe them 638 thousand dollars over the
course

01:53:57.430 --> 01:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
course
 
01:53:59.669 --> 01:53:59.679 align:start position:0%
until 2029 and we'll be done paying the
 
01:53:59.679 --> 01:54:01.430 align:start position:0%
until 2029 and we'll be done paying the
project

01:54:01.430 --> 01:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:54:04.229 --> 01:54:04.239 align:start position:0%
so here's a here's just all the projects
 
01:54:05.830 --> 01:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
the complicated projects that you kind
 
01:54:08.390 --> 01:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
of want to look to see
 
01:54:15.589 --> 01:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:18.550 --> 01:54:18.560 align:start position:0%
um if you're interested in what that
 
01:54:20.310 --> 01:54:20.320 align:start position:0%
total tail is
 
01:54:22.390 --> 01:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
that would be that dark blue bar if you
 
01:54:24.070 --> 01:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to just be like word is going to
 
01:54:25.270 --> 01:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
pay it off
 
01:54:28.950 --> 01:54:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh all in one month some that um
 
01:54:33.750 --> 01:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
total remaining payments is 163
 
01:54:37.750 --> 01:54:37.760 align:start position:0%
million um in fy 20 we'll be paying that
 
01:54:39.589 --> 01:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
26 million
 
01:54:43.830 --> 01:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
uh and fy23 will became that one
 
01:54:50.950 --> 01:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
both of those doctor bars
 
01:54:53.750 --> 01:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
um let's see what else do i have here i
 
01:54:54.790 --> 01:54:54.800 align:start position:0%
think this is
 
01:54:58.149 --> 01:54:58.159 align:start position:0%
one of my last um things on building aid
 
01:55:01.189 --> 01:55:01.199 align:start position:0%
um representative keith was
 
01:55:03.109 --> 01:55:03.119 align:start position:0%
mentioning these projects that were
 
01:55:05.430 --> 01:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
built during the moratorium
 
01:55:08.229 --> 01:55:08.239 align:start position:0%
um well this is a list of projects that
 
01:55:08.239 --> 01:55:08.790 align:start position:0%
um well this is a list of projects that
i

01:55:08.790 --> 01:55:08.800 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:55:11.830 --> 01:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
know of that have built during the march
 
01:55:14.870 --> 01:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
i would use this list cautiously
 
01:55:17.510 --> 01:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
if there was ever talk of funding retro
 
01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:18.149 align:start position:0%
if there was ever talk of funding retro
projects

01:55:18.149 --> 01:55:18.159 align:start position:0%
projects
 
01:55:19.990 --> 01:55:20.000 align:start position:0%
obviously i don't know anything about
 
01:55:21.669 --> 01:55:21.679 align:start position:0%
these projects because they didn't
 
01:55:23.910 --> 01:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
go through the department of education
 
01:55:25.910 --> 01:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
because they did not receive building
 
01:55:27.910 --> 01:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
aid but in the past 10 years during the
 
01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:28.870 align:start position:0%
aid but in the past 10 years during the
moratorium

01:55:28.870 --> 01:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
moratorium
 
01:55:29.830 --> 01:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
these are the projects that are
 
01:55:31.589 --> 01:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
committed i have no way of telling
 
01:55:33.030 --> 01:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
whether they're eligible
 
01:55:35.109 --> 01:55:35.119 align:start position:0%
if they they spent their money the way
 
01:55:36.470 --> 01:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
they should have
 
01:55:39.830 --> 01:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
um i'm sure they did um
 
01:55:41.990 --> 01:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
but this is the total project class and
 
01:55:42.870 --> 01:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
this was done
 
01:55:45.910 --> 01:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
by surveys or sometimes i would read it
 
01:55:46.870 --> 01:55:46.880 align:start position:0%
in a newspaper
 
01:55:49.350 --> 01:55:49.360 align:start position:0%
and i would add it to the list so this
 
01:55:51.669 --> 01:55:51.679 align:start position:0%
is not a fully vetted list
 
01:55:54.550 --> 01:55:54.560 align:start position:0%
but it kind of gives you an idea of the
 
01:55:56.149 --> 01:55:56.159 align:start position:0%
projects that are out there
 
01:55:59.189 --> 01:55:59.199 align:start position:0%
their total costs uh they're their
 
01:55:59.199 --> 01:55:59.750 align:start position:0%
their total costs uh they're their
building

01:55:59.750 --> 01:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:56:01.990 --> 01:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
rate if they were funded today they
 
01:56:03.270 --> 01:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
didn't go back and
 
01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
and take the specific year but this is
 
01:56:07.750 --> 01:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
approximately what a great year
 
01:56:09.830 --> 01:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
would have been and then they're
 
01:56:11.189 --> 01:56:11.199 align:start position:0%
building a what would it
 
01:56:14.229 --> 01:56:14.239 align:start position:0%
they did not receive buildings and big
 
01:56:15.750 --> 01:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
years sometimes i have trouble figuring
 
01:56:16.470 --> 01:56:16.480 align:start position:0%
out the year
 
01:56:18.310 --> 01:56:18.320 align:start position:0%
and to be honest most of this was done
 
01:56:20.629 --> 01:56:20.639 align:start position:0%
by a survey so most of this data i'd say
 
01:56:20.639 --> 01:56:21.270 align:start position:0%
by a survey so most of this data i'd say
90

01:56:21.270 --> 01:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
90
 
01:56:22.950 --> 01:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
of this data was given to me by the
 
01:56:25.030 --> 01:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
students themselves
 
01:56:28.149 --> 01:56:28.159 align:start position:0%
um and on the bottom
 
01:56:30.950 --> 01:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
you'll see if you're curious to know how
 
01:56:32.870 --> 01:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
much construction went on
 
01:56:36.070 --> 01:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh during moratorium um about
 
01:56:40.229 --> 01:56:40.239 align:start position:0%
um 554 million dollars where the
 
01:56:41.990 --> 01:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
projects were built without state
 
01:56:44.870 --> 01:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
aid if we had granted state aid it would
 
01:56:45.750 --> 01:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
have been supposed to
 
01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:48.950 align:start position:0%
have been supposed to
complete

01:56:48.950 --> 01:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:54.830 --> 01:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:54.840 --> 01:56:59.860 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:56:59.860 --> 01:56:59.870 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:59.870 --> 01:57:02.709 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:57:02.709 --> 01:57:02.719 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:57:04.790 --> 01:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
thank you amy are there any questions
 
01:57:07.990 --> 01:57:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:10.070 --> 01:57:10.080 align:start position:0%

01:57:17.350 --> 01:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
thousand more but that's okay
 
01:57:20.790 --> 01:57:20.800 align:start position:0%

01:57:38.149 --> 01:57:38.159 align:start position:0%
in uh keeping us informed and
 
01:57:40.709 --> 01:57:40.719 align:start position:0%
because it is it's a lot of money that
 
01:57:41.510 --> 01:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
01:57:44.870 --> 01:57:44.880 align:start position:0%
and and i really appreciate it
 
01:57:48.470 --> 01:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
so um i have
 
01:57:51.669 --> 01:57:51.679 align:start position:0%
12 so uh
 
01:57:55.910 --> 01:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
let us come back if we could at one
 
01:57:59.430 --> 01:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
and i have a meeting at 2 30
 
01:58:03.430 --> 01:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
so we will um go from
 
01:58:07.270 --> 01:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
1 to 2 30 but if we don't finish don't
 
01:58:08.390 --> 01:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
worry about it
 
01:58:12.149 --> 01:58:12.159 align:start position:0%
we have other time to uh to take care of
 
01:58:13.430 --> 01:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
this because we're not
 
01:58:15.990 --> 01:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know we're not going to slight
 
01:58:17.189 --> 01:58:17.199 align:start position:0%
our time
 
01:58:20.149 --> 01:58:20.159 align:start position:0%
with with education under any
 
01:58:22.149 --> 01:58:22.159 align:start position:0%
circumstances so
 
01:58:26.390 --> 01:58:26.400 align:start position:0%

01:58:29.910 --> 01:58:29.920 align:start position:0%
until one o'clock and
 
01:58:33.270 --> 01:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
