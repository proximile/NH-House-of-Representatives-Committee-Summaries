00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
I apologize for the delay I had to
 
00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:10.020 align:start position:0%
confer with my other half before we
 
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
begin if you could please rise and join
 
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:19.199 align:start position:0%
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the
 
00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:21.419 align:start position:0%
United States of America and to the
 
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:23.940 align:start position:0%
Republic for which it stands one nation
 
00:07:26.749 --> 00:07:26.759 align:start position:0%
under God indivisible with liberty and
 
00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:30.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:32.809 --> 00:07:32.819 align:start position:0%
with that we're going to begin our
 
00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:34.380 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work
 
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:37.740 align:start position:0%
on the bail bills
 
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
HP 38 HB 318 HP
 
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
653 Senate bill number 252 and Senate
 
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
bill number two excuse me 249.
 
00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:51.060 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of the for the
 
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
committee I'd like to lay out what my
 
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:55.740 align:start position:0%
thoughts are and what I've discussed
 
00:07:57.770 --> 00:07:57.780 align:start position:0%
with um
 
00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
with representative Harry gathright
 
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
on how the framework of this is going to
 
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
go going forward over the next
 
00:08:07.969 --> 00:08:07.979 align:start position:0%
three to four weeks we're going to meet
 
00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
twice a week and we're going to go over
 
00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:12.180 align:start position:0%
a series of issues that we're going to
 
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
incorporate into each of these bills
 
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
which will cause a considerable rewrite
 
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:20.220 align:start position:0%
of most of them however we will be
 
00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
incorporating most of the issues in
 
00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:23.039 align:start position:0%
these bills
 
00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:25.919 align:start position:0%
probably just in different ways so the
 
00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:29.340 align:start position:0%
first issue we're going to go over not
 
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
today but these are the issues we'll be
 
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:32.580 align:start position:0%
dealing with is we're going to be
 
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
looking at appropriating money
 
00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
and I'll be inviting finance that day
 
00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
that we talk about it
 
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
to totally revamp and update the it
 
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:45.300 align:start position:0%
system for the criminal justice and
 
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:47.220 align:start position:0%
court system in the state of New
 
00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.230 align:start position:0%
court system in the state of New
Hampshire

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:51.300 align:start position:0%
it's 2023 and the majority of our court
 
00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
system functions like it's in the early
 
00:08:57.050 --> 00:08:57.060 align:start position:0%
2000s maybe earlier they're heavily
 
00:08:59.870 --> 00:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
paper driven there's huge disconnects
 
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
between the different courts between the
 
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
courts and probation parole police
 
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
and in this day and age we should be
 
00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:09.959 align:start position:0%
able to have real-time information
 
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
when a warrant is entered or when a
 
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:16.200 align:start position:0%
warrant is canceled
 
00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:18.660 align:start position:0%
um bail is issued bails rescinded
 
00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
conditions of bail this should all be
 
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
available instantly to the law
 
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement across the state so
 
00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
I've invited several
 
00:09:30.889 --> 00:09:30.899 align:start position:0%
companies that have done this in other
 
00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:32.940 align:start position:0%
states they're going to come and give us
 
00:09:35.449 --> 00:09:35.459 align:start position:0%
a presentation it's not our role to
 
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
decide which company does what or who is
 
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
hired to do what it's our job to talk
 
00:09:42.889 --> 00:09:42.899 align:start position:0%
about the policy and we'll pass it to
 
00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:44.820 align:start position:0%
finance to appropriate and the courts
 
00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:46.140 align:start position:0%
will decide who they want to deal with
 
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
the purpose of having them come is so
 
00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:49.740 align:start position:0%
that we have an understanding of what
 
00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
they can provide versus where we are now
 
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
so we have a firm understanding of what
 
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with
 
00:09:58.430 --> 00:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
so that's going to be one of the issues
 
00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:00.959 align:start position:0%
the next issue and probably one of the
 
00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:02.180 align:start position:0%
most important we're going to deal with
 
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
is how the bail Commissioners are paid
 
00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:08.100 align:start position:0%
or more appropriately how they're not
 
00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:10.940 align:start position:0%
paid we've heard testimony over years
 
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
that they're getting paid somewhere
 
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:15.720 align:start position:0%
between 40 and 50 and I would defer to
 
00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:18.180 align:start position:0%
my colleague about how often they get
 
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:21.300 align:start position:0%
actually paid for the work they do
 
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
part of our work is going to be ensure
 
00:10:24.829 --> 00:10:24.839 align:start position:0%
that these folks are paid
 
00:10:26.449 --> 00:10:26.459 align:start position:0%
these folks get up in the middle of the
 
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
night they drive sometimes many miles to
 
00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:32.940 align:start position:0%
go bail someone out that's a service not
 
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
a right
 
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:36.060 align:start position:0%
and they don't get paid for it many many
 
00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:37.370 align:start position:0%
and they don't get paid for it many many
times

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:37.380 align:start position:0%
times
 
00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:39.839 align:start position:0%
and it's fundamentally unfair and it's
 
00:10:41.389 --> 00:10:41.399 align:start position:0%
it's just simply wrong
 
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:43.740 align:start position:0%
so one of our jobs on this committee
 
00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
during the subcommittee is going to be
 
00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:48.959 align:start position:0%
to figure out a way to ensure that our
 
00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
bear Commissioners are paid right now we
 
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:53.700 align:start position:0%
are very depleted the numbers of bail
 
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:54.769 align:start position:0%
are very depleted the numbers of bail
commissioners

00:10:54.769 --> 00:10:54.779 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
and if they all decided to walk off job
 
00:10:59.870 --> 00:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
tomorrow we'd be in big trouble
 
00:11:02.269 --> 00:11:02.279 align:start position:0%
um so we need to we need to fix that and
 
00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:04.740 align:start position:0%
we need to buttress that so that is
 
00:11:06.829 --> 00:11:06.839 align:start position:0%
something people want to do right now I
 
00:11:08.829 --> 00:11:08.839 align:start position:0%
can't imagine anyone wanting to do that
 
00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
in light of the fact that they don't
 
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
even get reimbursed
 
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
the next issue that we'll be talking
 
00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.970 align:start position:0%
the next issue that we'll be talking
about

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:16.980 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
is what crimes if a list of crimes that
 
00:11:23.569 --> 00:11:23.579 align:start position:0%
can or cannot be bailed by a bail
 
00:11:23.579 --> 00:11:24.650 align:start position:0%
can or cannot be bailed by a bail
commissioner

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:24.660 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
that have to be held for a judge
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
and as part of that we're going to
 
00:11:29.279 --> 00:11:30.470 align:start position:0%
and as part of that we're going to
discuss

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:32.820 align:start position:0%
and we're going to work with the courts
 
00:11:35.389 --> 00:11:35.399 align:start position:0%
to see about getting judges to be able
 
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
to work on the weekends so we have
 
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
on-call judges so there's no reason for
 
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
anyone to sit in jail longer than
 
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
necessary to be heard and either
 
00:11:47.569 --> 00:11:47.579 align:start position:0%
released or held
 
00:11:47.579 --> 00:11:48.350 align:start position:0%
released or held
um

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:51.060 align:start position:0%
currently we don't have that there's
 
00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
certain issues behind that that we're
 
00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
going to have to work through for
 
00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
example a judge is able to do hearings
 
00:12:01.310 --> 00:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
from home but a clerk is required to
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
either open the court or and somehow be
 
00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:06.060 align:start position:0%
able there to take notes or minutes or
 
00:12:08.329 --> 00:12:08.339 align:start position:0%
in recordings of what happens so we're
 
00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
going to work with the courts to figure
 
00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:12.300 align:start position:0%
out what that needs if it requires
 
00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:13.519 align:start position:0%
another position
 
00:12:16.009 --> 00:12:16.019 align:start position:0%
because the clerks
 
00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:18.660 align:start position:0%
and the folks at the court are part of a
 
00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:20.220 align:start position:0%
union so it's a collective bargaining
 
00:12:22.009 --> 00:12:22.019 align:start position:0%
issue so we're going to look at that
 
00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to hear from the courts
 
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
about that and we're going to work on
 
00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:27.140 align:start position:0%
figuring out a way to do that
 
00:12:29.329 --> 00:12:29.339 align:start position:0%
I've spoken with one of representatives
 
00:12:32.329 --> 00:12:32.339 align:start position:0%
from the courts it's doable as always
 
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
though it comes down to money
 
00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
it's my opinion that right now we have
 
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
some excess one-time money to spend
 
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
we can't encumber a future legislature
 
00:12:45.949 --> 00:12:45.959 align:start position:0%
it's not a budget but we can fund things
 
00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:47.220 align:start position:0%
up until
 
00:12:49.069 --> 00:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
the next budget when the courts would
 
00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
have to take it over themselves so we're
 
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
going to look at that and again I'll be
 
00:12:55.009 --> 00:12:55.019 align:start position:0%
including Finance in that
 
00:12:57.170 --> 00:12:57.180 align:start position:0%
and those are the the main issues that
 
00:12:58.629 --> 00:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
we're going to deal with
 
00:13:01.009 --> 00:13:01.019 align:start position:0%
at this point I'm happy to hear from any
 
00:13:02.329 --> 00:13:02.339 align:start position:0%
of the committee that would like to
 
00:13:04.009 --> 00:13:04.019 align:start position:0%
discuss what their thoughts are on those
 
00:13:05.329 --> 00:13:05.339 align:start position:0%
and if they have certain other issues
 
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
they'd like to discuss
 
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
representative Rhodes
 
00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:12.420 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:13:15.410 --> 00:13:15.420 align:start position:0%
explaining that very well and um I agree
 
00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
with everything that you said for the
 
00:13:19.009 --> 00:13:19.019 align:start position:0%
record and
 
00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:20.820 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I really think
 
00:13:23.629 --> 00:13:23.639 align:start position:0%
that we we need to focus on is violation
 
00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
of bail that has anything to do with a
 
00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
restraining order domestic violence
 
00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:31.320 align:start position:0%
um or anything that had any any harm
 
00:13:33.769 --> 00:13:33.779 align:start position:0%
especially sexual harm with a child so
 
00:13:36.889 --> 00:13:36.899 align:start position:0%
as long as we can get that in there
 
00:13:38.569 --> 00:13:38.579 align:start position:0%
pretty much on board
 
00:13:41.569 --> 00:13:41.579 align:start position:0%
thank you and And to clarify when I said
 
00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
bail release that that's not only a list
 
00:13:47.389 --> 00:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
of crimes that's also things that we are
 
00:13:49.069 --> 00:13:49.079 align:start position:0%
going to discuss whether or not people
 
00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
should be held over to talk to the judge
 
00:13:55.129 --> 00:13:55.139 align:start position:0%
such as excessive failures to appear
 
00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:57.420 align:start position:0%
um this this committee went on a field
 
00:14:00.889 --> 00:14:00.899 align:start position:0%
trip and I I believe all of us saw the
 
00:14:02.449 --> 00:14:02.459 align:start position:0%
the number of people that would be
 
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
called and they were defaulted they just
 
00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
didn't show up and they had other
 
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.090 align:start position:0%
didn't show up and they had other
defaults

00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:08.100 align:start position:0%
defaults
 
00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:09.300 align:start position:0%
um so we're going to talk about people
 
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:10.860 align:start position:0%
that have trouble finding their way to
 
00:14:13.009 --> 00:14:13.019 align:start position:0%
the court for their appearances that's a
 
00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:14.700 align:start position:0%
burden on the system to waste time who
 
00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:18.060 align:start position:0%
wastes money and it inhibits the uh the
 
00:14:20.269 --> 00:14:20.279 align:start position:0%
ability of Justice to be carried out
 
00:14:20.279 --> 00:14:22.370 align:start position:0%
ability of Justice to be carried out
also

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:23.030 align:start position:0%
also
um

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
in regard to that there will be other
 
00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:27.300 align:start position:0%
issues we discuss whether someone should
 
00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:29.820 align:start position:0%
be bailed uh for violating restraining
 
00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:33.300 align:start position:0%
order that's not necessarily a new crime
 
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:34.980 align:start position:0%
that's being discussed but it's
 
00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:36.300 align:start position:0%
something that hasn't been brought up in
 
00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:39.060 align:start position:0%
any of the bills I believe a violation
 
00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:41.839 align:start position:0%
of our protective order in and of itself
 
00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:43.980 align:start position:0%
screams dangerous
 
00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:46.620 align:start position:0%
so we'll be discussing that as well
 
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
representative here gatherer would you
 
00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:49.380 align:start position:0%
like to
 
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
yes I agree 100 with what you're
 
00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.189 align:start position:0%
yes I agree 100 with what you're
presenting

00:14:58.189 --> 00:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
presenting
 
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
um and after having conversations with
 
00:15:02.329 --> 00:15:02.339 align:start position:0%
others that feel the same way I think
 
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:04.740 align:start position:0%
it's great my main concern was holding
 
00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
people and they haven't been proven to
 
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
be guilty of any crime actually you know
 
00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
so that is a concern but I know that
 
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:16.680 align:start position:0%
following offenders definitely would be
 
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
helped but that's always already in the
 
00:15:21.050 --> 00:15:21.060 align:start position:0%
record so
 
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:23.880 align:start position:0%
correct I I think that we need to focus
 
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
on first we're going to start with the
 
00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:27.300 align:start position:0%
presumption that everyone is innocent
 
00:15:29.689 --> 00:15:29.699 align:start position:0%
until proven guilty and then we work on
 
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
each person presents an individual
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
situation to the courts into the justice
 
00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:37.260 align:start position:0%
system so throwing out a blanket you all
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
will be held
 
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
um is is first of all it's not in
 
00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
keeping with the Constitution and second
 
00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:46.860 align:start position:0%
of all it causes Expense It causes
 
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
strain on the system but at the same
 
00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:51.380 align:start position:0%
time we we recognize
 
00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
the sacrifices and the stresses puts on
 
00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
law enforcement to arrest people and see
 
00:15:58.430 --> 00:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
them walking out the door before they
 
00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:00.540 align:start position:0%
can even finish their police report only
 
00:16:02.629 --> 00:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
to pick them up a day or two later
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
but this goes back to my first point on
 
00:16:05.519 --> 00:16:06.430 align:start position:0%
but this goes back to my first point on
it

00:16:06.430 --> 00:16:06.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:16:10.069 --> 00:16:10.079 align:start position:0%
as I pointed out earlier right now you
 
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
can be arrested in Manchester on a
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
serious crime bailed out and picked up
 
00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
in another part of the state a day later
 
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
bailed out again and we scream why are
 
00:16:21.650 --> 00:16:21.660 align:start position:0%
they letting them out again they're
 
00:16:23.629 --> 00:16:23.639 align:start position:0%
already on Bill well there's a very good
 
00:16:25.069 --> 00:16:25.079 align:start position:0%
chance the person who made that decision
 
00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:26.820 align:start position:0%
has no idea that that person was out on
 
00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:29.100 align:start position:0%
bail we heard from police officers who
 
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
said oftentimes they only found
 
00:16:32.449 --> 00:16:32.459 align:start position:0%
someone's on bail when they searched
 
00:16:34.970 --> 00:16:34.980 align:start position:0%
their car and found a bail slip crumbled
 
00:16:37.009 --> 00:16:37.019 align:start position:0%
up on the floorboard of the car and I
 
00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:39.320 align:start position:0%
don't think that that's a any way for a
 
00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:43.079 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system to operate
 
00:16:44.329 --> 00:16:44.339 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to hear from representative
 
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:45.720 align:start position:0%
scitec if you have anything to say
 
00:16:50.749 --> 00:16:50.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
the issues the issues brought up are
 
00:16:56.749 --> 00:16:56.759 align:start position:0%
excellent uh the especially the I.T I
 
00:16:59.210 --> 00:16:59.220 align:start position:0%
mean that we look the police and I look
 
00:17:01.249 --> 00:17:01.259 align:start position:0%
at each other and say is this guy on
 
00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:04.140 align:start position:0%
bail I think he's Manchester I heard
 
00:17:07.329 --> 00:17:07.339 align:start position:0%
that's a wonderful wonderful Direction
 
00:17:10.789 --> 00:17:10.799 align:start position:0%
I want to point out a side comment not
 
00:17:12.770 --> 00:17:12.780 align:start position:0%
related to this but you might find it
 
00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:15.959 align:start position:0%
interesting I'm adjusted to the peace
 
00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
I am sworn before other justices when I
 
00:17:22.970 --> 00:17:22.980 align:start position:0%
am renewed in order to marry people I am
 
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:24.780 align:start position:0%
not sworn
 
00:17:26.929 --> 00:17:26.939 align:start position:0%
to incarcerate people or keep them
 
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
incarcerated isn't that a little strange
 
00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
I mentioned briefly to representative
 
00:17:36.529 --> 00:17:36.539 align:start position:0%
cathright that one of the things that we
 
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:39.720 align:start position:0%
does that I think needs to be done it's
 
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
ancillary to this not to I'm not going
 
00:17:43.909 --> 00:17:43.919 align:start position:0%
to enlarge on what you've said it's
 
00:17:43.919 --> 00:17:45.289 align:start position:0%
to enlarge on what you've said it's
wonderful

00:17:45.289 --> 00:17:45.299 align:start position:0%
wonderful
 
00:17:48.529 --> 00:17:48.539 align:start position:0%
is training for bail Commissioners I
 
00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:51.900 align:start position:0%
took it seriously I took I've trained
 
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
two other bail commissions it took hours
 
00:17:57.529 --> 00:17:57.539 align:start position:0%
I'm telling you it honest and there's a
 
00:18:00.529 --> 00:18:00.539 align:start position:0%
laboratory portion I got a guy up my guy
 
00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:04.140 align:start position:0%
in Salem we got up two in the morning he
 
00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:06.900 align:start position:0%
came with me to Pal him for usually
 
00:18:09.409 --> 00:18:09.419 align:start position:0%
pelham's famous for its DUIs they love I
 
00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:10.740 align:start position:0%
don't know they come from Lowell to
 
00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:13.100 align:start position:0%
Manchester through it's a great place
 
00:18:16.549 --> 00:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
DUI capital of Southern New Hampshire
 
00:18:16.559 --> 00:18:17.750 align:start position:0%
DUI capital of Southern New Hampshire
um

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:21.110 --> 00:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
and he was with me through I would say a
 
00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.610 align:start position:0%
and he was with me through I would say a
dozen

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
dozen
 
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
veils we get a bail commissioner
 
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
handbook but the street is
 
00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
enlarges that experience that's all I'm
 
00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:34.380 align:start position:0%
that that's all I wanted to say thank
 
00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative and and
 
00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
that is a um actually a very a very good
 
00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:40.860 align:start position:0%
point and I did already have it in my
 
00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
notes for uh training but I think also
 
00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:46.140 align:start position:0%
important is a continuing ed we changed
 
00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:48.179 align:start position:0%
the laws every year I don't know how
 
00:18:49.789 --> 00:18:49.799 align:start position:0%
often these bail handbooks are are
 
00:18:49.799 --> 00:18:51.230 align:start position:0%
often these bail handbooks are are
updated

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
updated
 
00:18:54.289 --> 00:18:54.299 align:start position:0%
um you can respond to that if you there
 
00:18:57.049 --> 00:18:57.059 align:start position:0%
is an attempt at continuing ed because
 
00:18:58.970 --> 00:18:58.980 align:start position:0%
every year we meet with our district
 
00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:01.640 align:start position:0%
court judge but I have found
 
00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:04.740 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies because when you said
 
00:19:06.289 --> 00:19:06.299 align:start position:0%
we're short
 
00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:09.660 align:start position:0%
I have for the team this is patting
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
myself on the back I have gone to Nashua
 
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
I have gone to Raymond I have gone once
 
00:19:18.169 --> 00:19:18.179 align:start position:0%
to Somersworth the only time I've been
 
00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:20.700 align:start position:0%
in Somersworth in my life because the
 
00:19:22.549 --> 00:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
police needed a bail commissioner I did
 
00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
it for the team
 
00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
so how short would you say that you are
 
00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:32.940 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that uh
 
00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:34.860 align:start position:0%
Salem could use another
 
00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
week do three towns Salem needs at least
 
00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
one more and the whole Derry Nashua area
 
00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:42.900 align:start position:0%
someone else can speak to that but I'll
 
00:19:45.289 --> 00:19:45.299 align:start position:0%
bet they can use at least two or three
 
00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:49.140 align:start position:0%
at least that number and and it's really
 
00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:52.620 align:start position:0%
not a questioning of of funding because
 
00:19:54.049 --> 00:19:54.059 align:start position:0%
um these positions aren't funded by the
 
00:19:55.909 --> 00:19:55.919 align:start position:0%
court they're they're basically at this
 
00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
point volunteer could you address how
 
00:19:59.570 --> 00:19:59.580 align:start position:0%
often you actually get reimbursed for
 
00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:01.260 align:start position:0%
your work
 
00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:03.240 align:start position:0%
I don't want to because I'm
 
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily lucky I I have done the
 
00:20:09.970 --> 00:20:09.980 align:start position:0%
veils in Manchester and it's 50 percent
 
00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:13.860 align:start position:0%
okay because
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%
this it's terrible the people you see
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
don't need incarceration they need a
 
00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:22.860 align:start position:0%
hospital bed and you're looking at this
 
00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
person it's a life that's in front of
 
00:20:27.289 --> 00:20:27.299 align:start position:0%
you that's going down the drain
 
00:20:30.289 --> 00:20:30.299 align:start position:0%
yet you've got to do your job it's a
 
00:20:33.169 --> 00:20:33.179 align:start position:0%
real conflict when you're I'm not a
 
00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:34.740 align:start position:0%
counselor but I'm looking at a human
 
00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:36.780 align:start position:0%
being that's all right
 
00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
I I I lose
 
00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
look I Didn't Do It for the money I'm a
 
00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:44.580 align:start position:0%
pensioner I'm okay but
 
00:20:47.450 --> 00:20:47.460 align:start position:0%
uh two out of ten
 
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm extraordinarily lucky
 
00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.730 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm extraordinarily lucky
indeed

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:52.740 align:start position:0%
indeed
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
um and and I think that we can New
 
00:20:57.890 --> 00:20:57.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a probed history of a
 
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
volunteer service in our government none
 
00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
of us here are in it for the money
 
00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:04.500 align:start position:0%
um so I I would say that the same
 
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
probably applies for the bail
 
00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
Commissioners having said that there is
 
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:10.799 align:start position:0%
an expense that they incur and the
 
00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
inconvenience they concur the incur that
 
00:21:15.289 --> 00:21:15.299 align:start position:0%
we don't no one's calling us to get up
 
00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
at three o'clock in the morning and
 
00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:19.740 align:start position:0%
drive 50 miles to bail someone
 
00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:21.480 align:start position:0%
um so I think it's very important that
 
00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
we focus on making sure those folks are
 
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
reimbursed and in the training and and
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
also figuring out a way to bolster those
 
00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
numbers because without the bill
 
00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:32.940 align:start position:0%
Commissioners our system would come to a
 
00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:34.740 align:start position:0%
screeching halt
 
00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your input
 
00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:41.149 --> 00:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
yes I just wanted to say before we get
 
00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
going that um
 
00:21:44.289 --> 00:21:44.299 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:48.669 --> 00:21:48.679 align:start position:0%
sometimes the the simplest and clearest
 
00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:53.039 align:start position:0%
Solutions aren't necessarily uh
 
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
solutions to the problem and I think
 
00:21:56.570 --> 00:21:56.580 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things that we've
 
00:21:59.570 --> 00:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
struggled with with a lot of these bills
 
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
um uh they may be clear and Simple
 
00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:06.140 align:start position:0%
Solutions to a problem
 
00:22:09.049 --> 00:22:09.059 align:start position:0%
but in some cases they're the wrong
 
00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:11.460 align:start position:0%
Solutions there are constitutional
 
00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
issues with uh with some of them there
 
00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:19.620 align:start position:0%
are also issues related to what
 
00:22:23.149 --> 00:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
representative scitec raises so what we
 
00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:26.220 align:start position:0%
don't want to be in is a position where
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
we're further criminalizing mental
 
00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
health uh and and I think it's something
 
00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:35.820 align:start position:0%
that we as we as we start down this path
 
00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
I think that's one of the things that we
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
really do need to try to specifically uh
 
00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
to avoid
 
00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:45.780 align:start position:0%
um and I do know that a lot of people
 
00:22:48.409 --> 00:22:48.419 align:start position:0%
have been looking over our shoulders uh
 
00:22:49.789 --> 00:22:49.799 align:start position:0%
every session I've been in the
 
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
legislature we've had to deal with with
 
00:22:54.169 --> 00:22:54.179 align:start position:0%
Bill bills and a lot of the people who
 
00:22:56.510 --> 00:22:56.520 align:start position:0%
look over our shoulders are looking at
 
00:23:00.049 --> 00:23:00.059 align:start position:0%
it from a constitutional perspective so
 
00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:04.260 align:start position:0%
we have we have a definite obligation to
 
00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:07.380 align:start position:0%
the people that we need to protect but
 
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we also have an
 
00:23:12.409 --> 00:23:12.419 align:start position:0%
obligation to do is to make sure that
 
00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:14.580 align:start position:0%
our criminal justice system functions
 
00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
fairly and effectively for people who
 
00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
are accused of crimes so we actually are
 
00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:22.500 align:start position:0%
going to have a lot of our a lot on our
 
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
shoulders over the next few weeks uh and
 
00:23:29.149 --> 00:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
uh and as I said sometimes the clearest
 
00:23:32.029 --> 00:23:32.039 align:start position:0%
and the simplest Solutions uh are the
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
wrong ones so I think the challenge for
 
00:23:36.409 --> 00:23:36.419 align:start position:0%
this committee is to try to come up with
 
00:23:38.870 --> 00:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
solutions that are as clear and simple
 
00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:41.460 align:start position:0%
as we can make them but that actually
 
00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
solve the problem and one of the things
 
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
I'm really happy to see you know in the
 
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
list uh that representative Roy went
 
00:23:54.649 --> 00:23:54.659 align:start position:0%
through uh is a is a legitimate attempt
 
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
to address some of the systemic things
 
00:23:59.690 --> 00:23:59.700 align:start position:0%
that are really driving problems with
 
00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:01.100 align:start position:0%
the bail system
 
00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:04.860 align:start position:0%
so I think we're we're off to a good
 
00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:06.529 align:start position:0%
so I think we're we're off to a good
start

00:24:06.529 --> 00:24:06.539 align:start position:0%
start
 
00:24:09.049 --> 00:24:09.059 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Muse and I
 
00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:11.220 align:start position:0%
think as part of the things we need to
 
00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
discuss is we need to look at are people
 
00:24:17.029 --> 00:24:17.039 align:start position:0%
being held on crimes that even if
 
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:19.740 align:start position:0%
convicted they ultimately would not have
 
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
to serve jail
 
00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:23.039 align:start position:0%
um it seems counterintuitive to me that
 
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
someone would be held for a crime that
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
even if convicted of it there's no jail
 
00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:29.460 align:start position:0%
sentence so that's one of the things we
 
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
need to look at as well which is why
 
00:24:33.649 --> 00:24:33.659 align:start position:0%
we're going to look at a list of crimes
 
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
very carefully
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
as far as who needs to see a judge and
 
00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:41.580 align:start position:0%
ensure that there's a judge readily
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
available so that people aren't held for
 
00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
extended times for example if someone's
 
00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:48.980 align:start position:0%
arrested on a Friday
 
00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:52.740 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't have to wait until Monday
 
00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:54.900 align:start position:0%
a judge should be able to make a quick
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
decision via a zoom call whether that
 
00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:01.020 align:start position:0%
person is a danger or not and and I feel
 
00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:02.580 align:start position:0%
like that will take some of the burden
 
00:25:04.669 --> 00:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
off the decision making of the bail
 
00:25:06.649 --> 00:25:06.659 align:start position:0%
Commissioners when they know that it's
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
going to be looked at by by someone else
 
00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:11.340 align:start position:0%
within a short period of time
 
00:25:16.669 --> 00:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:16.679 --> 00:25:18.890 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:18.900 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
um so at this point I think what we're
 
00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:21.919 align:start position:0%
going to do is we're going to talk about
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do in the upcoming
 
00:25:26.990 --> 00:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
meeting so that we people have kind of a
 
00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
feel for
 
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
um who as far as people in the audience
 
00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:32.039 align:start position:0%
here in the gallery who may want to
 
00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:34.380 align:start position:0%
attend or may not want to attend
 
00:25:36.049 --> 00:25:36.059 align:start position:0%
um I think the first issue will be
 
00:25:37.149 --> 00:25:37.159 align:start position:0%
taking up
 
00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:40.799 align:start position:0%
tomorrow will be
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
probably we're going to go over our list
 
00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:44.700 align:start position:0%
of crimes I think that's where we'll
 
00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
start I wanted to do i t but I I think
 
00:25:50.409 --> 00:25:50.419 align:start position:0%
I've got a date
 
00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:53.700 align:start position:0%
in October when the company that
 
00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:55.380 align:start position:0%
actually did just did this for it was
 
00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
one of the Carolinas they just redid
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
their entire court system and that will
 
00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:01.500 align:start position:0%
be the date we'll take that up and
 
00:26:03.049 --> 00:26:03.059 align:start position:0%
that'll give us time to get Finance to
 
00:26:05.830 --> 00:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
come as well so tomorrow
 
00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:09.240 align:start position:0%
plan on looking at the lists of crimes
 
00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be discussing I'll
 
00:26:13.610 --> 00:26:13.620 align:start position:0%
circulate this evening a draft proposal
 
00:26:16.789 --> 00:26:16.799 align:start position:0%
to the members and we will discuss it
 
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
tomorrow at the hearing
 
00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
and bring your thoughts on that
 
00:26:24.529 --> 00:26:24.539 align:start position:0%
and then next Thursday I think that will
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
start with discussing the bill
 
00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and how they are
 
00:26:31.789 --> 00:26:31.799 align:start position:0%
reimbursed and we will invite someone
 
00:26:34.909 --> 00:26:34.919 align:start position:0%
from the court on that day I am working
 
00:26:38.269 --> 00:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
on a meeting with the Chief Justice of
 
00:26:40.669 --> 00:26:40.679 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court for
 
00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
myself and representative gathright to
 
00:26:45.169 --> 00:26:45.179 align:start position:0%
bring our proposals the court can't tell
 
00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:47.400 align:start position:0%
us policy but they can tell us whether
 
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
our policy is workable or not so we're
 
00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:51.620 align:start position:0%
going to kind of try and pick his brain
 
00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
and thread that needle as far as him
 
00:26:58.430 --> 00:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
telling us our policy and US imposing
 
00:26:59.870 --> 00:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
something on the court that just isn't
 
00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
workable or will clog the justice system
 
00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:04.250 align:start position:0%
workable or will clog the justice system
um

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:04.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
and we'll go further on our schedule
 
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
after that so those are the next two
 
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
days tomorrow and next Thursday is there
 
00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:14.820 align:start position:0%
anyone here in the audience there is
 
00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:16.020 align:start position:0%
there in a better word in the audience
 
00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:25.549 --> 00:27:25.559 align:start position:0%
as a lark I started to list the fails
 
00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:28.140 align:start position:0%
that I did yeah I've done about 3 500
 
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
Bales and I have coffee books which I'm
 
00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:32.940 align:start position:0%
willing to bring in you might want to
 
00:27:35.930 --> 00:27:35.940 align:start position:0%
see what it actually looks like how many
 
00:27:38.029 --> 00:27:38.039 align:start position:0%
personal recognizants which is the
 
00:27:40.370 --> 00:27:40.380 align:start position:0%
overwhelming majority what the crimes
 
00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
are how it just might be an interesting
 
00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
thing to thumb through if anybody wants
 
00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:46.260 align:start position:0%
I'll bring them in you can take a look
 
00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
at them if you like I think that's a
 
00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
good idea because it's frankly probably
 
00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:52.860 align:start position:0%
um the best information we could get
 
00:27:54.289 --> 00:27:54.299 align:start position:0%
because we couldn't go to the court
 
00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:56.940 align:start position:0%
again because the it system is a mess so
 
00:27:58.970 --> 00:27:58.980 align:start position:0%
thank you is there anyone um here uh
 
00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
representative would you like to address
 
00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:01.620 align:start position:0%
the committee I see you're here probably
 
00:28:06.289 --> 00:28:06.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:11.820 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
um I just want to say I I really
 
00:28:15.769 --> 00:28:15.779 align:start position:0%
um I think the points that you guys just
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
laid out the three points that you guys
 
00:28:18.529 --> 00:28:18.539 align:start position:0%
are going to work on as a committee are
 
00:28:18.539 --> 00:28:20.269 align:start position:0%
are going to work on as a committee are
fantastic

00:28:20.269 --> 00:28:20.279 align:start position:0%
fantastic
 
00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:22.140 align:start position:0%
um I talk to a lot of people around the
 
00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
state officials and citizens and the
 
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
state is really looking for us to do
 
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
something and um I I'm hopeful after
 
00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
coming to this meeting this morning that
 
00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:32.700 align:start position:0%
something's going to be accomplished and
 
00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:34.500 align:start position:0%
I'm looking forward to seeing what you
 
00:28:35.870 --> 00:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
guys come up with
 
00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:40.740 align:start position:0%
um and frankly that was my my point when
 
00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:43.260 align:start position:0%
I started framing this is I looked back
 
00:28:45.409 --> 00:28:45.419 align:start position:0%
and I realized as representative Muse
 
00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:47.220 align:start position:0%
said we seems like we're dealing with a
 
00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
bail issue um every couple years we're
 
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:52.559 align:start position:0%
back at bail back at bill I feel like
 
00:28:54.049 --> 00:28:54.059 align:start position:0%
um it's time to fix it once and for all
 
00:28:56.630 --> 00:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
and instead of patching the holes let's
 
00:28:59.570 --> 00:28:59.580 align:start position:0%
just rebuild the dam and do it right and
 
00:29:02.390 --> 00:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
I think that would um that would so far
 
00:29:06.289 --> 00:29:06.299 align:start position:0%
to help our citizens I see a a former
 
00:29:08.029 --> 00:29:08.039 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner would you like to
 
00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
I know you I'd probably put you on the
 
00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:24.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
my name is Trixie LeFevre I was a bail
 
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
commissioner up until August 31st of
 
00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
this year when I resigned at the time of
 
00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
my resignation I was owed for 2022 and
 
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
2023 over fifteen thousand dollars most
 
00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:41.039 align:start position:0%
of my calls were to the Manchester
 
00:29:42.769 --> 00:29:42.779 align:start position:0%
Police Department
 
00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:44.220 align:start position:0%
um I feel as it was there was a
 
00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
disconnect with the bail commissioner
 
00:29:50.389 --> 00:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
community and the payment process I
 
00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate the fact that you were all on
 
00:29:54.529 --> 00:29:54.539 align:start position:0%
the right track with putting bail
 
00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:56.460 align:start position:0%
Commissioners as part of your committee
 
00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:58.010 align:start position:0%
Commissioners as part of your committee
charge

00:29:58.010 --> 00:29:58.020 align:start position:0%
charge
 
00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
um it's and I do know that at one point
 
00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:02.700 align:start position:0%
in time within the past five years there
 
00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:04.740 align:start position:0%
were probably over 125 bail
 
00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and last I knew we were
 
00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:10.260 align:start position:0%
down to about 85. so there does need to
 
00:30:12.590 --> 00:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
be a fix to the situation so that the
 
00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:13.980 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire can go back to
 
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
where they were which is to provide the
 
00:30:18.649 --> 00:30:18.659 align:start position:0%
service to the police departments
 
00:30:21.289 --> 00:30:21.299 align:start position:0%
so that the officers are not held inside
 
00:30:22.789 --> 00:30:22.799 align:start position:0%
the police departments and not able to
 
00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
patrol and keep the citizens safe so I
 
00:30:27.289 --> 00:30:27.299 align:start position:0%
just appreciate all that I will be
 
00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:29.580 align:start position:0%
continuing to attend because I was
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
raised to say to think that I'm going to
 
00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
see it to the end I've been here since
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
2019 and it would be nice to know that
 
00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:37.980 align:start position:0%
the bail commissioner Community is being
 
00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:40.260 align:start position:0%
looked after so thank you very much I
 
00:30:41.990 --> 00:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and the institutional
 
00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:43.620 align:start position:0%
knowledge that you bring we will
 
00:30:45.169 --> 00:30:45.179 align:start position:0%
definitely be using it over the course
 
00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:47.220 align:start position:0%
of the next three or four weeks so be
 
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
prepared to have your brain picked okay
 
00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you is there
 
00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
anyone else would like to speak
 
00:30:55.020 --> 00:31:03.610 align:start position:0%
anyone else would like to speak
Frank

00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:03.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:05.810 --> 00:31:05.820 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman members of the committee
 
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
thank you silly New Hampshire
 
00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
um I just
 
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
really I wanted to say I appreciate the
 
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
time that this committee has put into
 
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
this issue has not been distracted by
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
rhetoric has been really dedicated to
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
looking at what the facts are looking at
 
00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
the law currently allows and so I really
 
00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate that you all are taking this
 
00:31:24.889 --> 00:31:24.899 align:start position:0%
very kind of thoughtful approach to this
 
00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
and I hope you all see us as a resource
 
00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:29.640 align:start position:0%
throughout this process and um yeah
 
00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:31.260 align:start position:0%
we'll be here each week and appreciate
 
00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
your time
 
00:31:36.769 --> 00:31:36.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:38.520 align:start position:0%
seeing no one else anyone else on the
 
00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:44.389 --> 00:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
seeing none I think that's all we really
 
00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:46.740 align:start position:0%
have for today I apologize for the short
 
00:31:48.590 --> 00:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
meeting but I felt like it was important
 
00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
to kind of set the groundwork on what we
 
00:31:53.269 --> 00:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
will be doing
 
00:31:55.250 --> 00:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
um some of you may appreciate being able
 
00:31:56.930 --> 00:31:56.940 align:start position:0%
to leave quickly some of you maybe drove
 
00:31:59.330 --> 00:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
a long way in or angry with me but I
 
00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:01.380 align:start position:0%
feel like we need to be um we need to be
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
prepared and not just especially in
 
00:32:05.389 --> 00:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
light of the way that I'd like to go
 
00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:08.220 align:start position:0%
forward with this one piece at a time I
 
00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
want to give you all an opportunity to
 
00:32:11.570 --> 00:32:11.580 align:start position:0%
kind of prep for it so that when you
 
00:32:13.490 --> 00:32:13.500 align:start position:0%
come to the next meeting you have some
 
00:32:15.649 --> 00:32:15.659 align:start position:0%
thoughts on it rather than having to
 
00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
come up with them off the cuff
 
00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
um did you want to say something or no
 
00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:22.559 align:start position:0%
okay with that I see nothing further
 
00:32:24.169 --> 00:32:24.179 align:start position:0%
then I will see you all tomorrow morning
 
00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
at 10 o'clock and be prepared to discuss
 
00:32:27.889 --> 00:32:27.899 align:start position:0%
crimes that should or should not be
 
00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:31.380 align:start position:0%
available I I just want to note I am
 
00:32:33.649 --> 00:32:33.659 align:start position:0%
going to try and reach out to the
 
00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:35.460 align:start position:0%
members of the Senate
 
00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:37.140 align:start position:0%
um our counterparts and see if anyone
 
00:32:39.169 --> 00:32:39.179 align:start position:0%
would like to attend what I don't want
 
00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
to do is have this committee spend a
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
month working really hard to have it go
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
to the other side of the of the
 
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
bicameral chamber to have it tossed out
 
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
so I'd like their support and buy in
 
00:32:54.649 --> 00:32:54.659 align:start position:0%
input early on I see this as a joint
 
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
effort not US versus them and I feel
 
00:32:59.149 --> 00:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
like what fell apart
 
00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh this previous session was unfortunate
 
00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:05.100 align:start position:0%
but out of it became something good
 
00:33:06.889 --> 00:33:06.899 align:start position:0%
we're gonna we're gonna instead of just
 
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
passing that fix and moving on we're
 
00:33:11.149 --> 00:33:11.159 align:start position:0%
going to look at the whole system so
 
00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
I'll be reaching out to them this
 
00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
afternoon hopefully we'll be seeing some
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
of them soon with that I closed the
