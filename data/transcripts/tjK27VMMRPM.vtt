cap okay is there any um discussion on
 
00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:47.520 align:start position:0%

clarification if I could Madam chair on
 
00:44:57.150 --> 00:44:57.160 align:start position:0%
B School District shall place the the
 
00:44:58.950 --> 00:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
warrant article for SAU budget the
 
00:45:00.270 --> 00:45:00.280 align:start position:0%
beginning of the school district warrant
 
00:45:02.150 --> 00:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
article not all school districts have a
 
00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
separate SAU budget so is this requiring
 
00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:07.720 align:start position:0%
a separate sa budget suddenly um thank
 
00:45:09.069 --> 00:45:09.079 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative
 
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
grund I I I would all like to speak to
 
00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment as well as to respond to
 
00:45:17.349 --> 00:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
your inquiry so this amendment here it
 
00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
it does two things so um with regards to
 
00:45:23.230 --> 00:45:23.240 align:start position:0%
lines 14 and 16 on the bill the
 
00:45:26.349 --> 00:45:26.359 align:start position:0%
amendment um cleans up some confusing
 
00:45:26.359 --> 00:45:27.750 align:start position:0%
amendment um cleans up some confusing
language

00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:45:30.069 --> 00:45:30.079 align:start position:0%
um in the bill as file regarding
 
00:45:35.109 --> 00:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
multi-year warrant articles um which is
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
that language is is being
 
00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:40.790 align:start position:0%
that language is is being
misinterpreted

00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted
 
00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
um what's happening is that um bonds
 
00:45:48.349 --> 00:45:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
interpreting that bonds are never
 
00:45:53.589 --> 00:45:53.599 align:start position:0%
subject to the tax cap after the first
 
00:45:57.069 --> 00:45:57.079 align:start position:0%
year so the amendment addresses that to
 
00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
um to clarify that and to to your
 
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
inquiry on lines 21 through 20
 
00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
um two of the bill with regards to
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
section B of the amendment um that
 
00:46:15.309 --> 00:46:15.319 align:start position:0%
recognizes that there are multiple ways
 
00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
to to um have an SAU budget warrant
 
00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
article there is a statute and it's
 
00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:26.920 align:start position:0%
um RSA
 
00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:27.990 align:start position:0%
um RSA
colon

00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
colon
 
00:46:31.870 --> 00:46:31.880 align:start position:0%
9-b which is um enabling statute and
 
00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:33.880 align:start position:0%
that allows for what is called the
 
00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:37.480 align:start position:0%
alternate budget procedure and that's um
 
00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:41.720 align:start position:0%
that's one way uh to to handle the SAU
 
00:46:46.109 --> 00:46:46.119 align:start position:0%
Budget on the warrant and so that's
 
00:46:48.589 --> 00:46:48.599 align:start position:0%
that's what the amendment clarifies
 
00:46:52.589 --> 00:46:52.599 align:start position:0%
that can I follow up on that yes so when
 
00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:54.280 align:start position:0%
it says but the school district shall
 
00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
place the warrant article does that
 
00:46:59.109 --> 00:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
indicates that the saus are going to
 
00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
place no matter what which says they're
 
00:47:03.870 --> 00:47:03.880 align:start position:0%
going to have to
 
00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
separate and that's not the way many
 
00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
enabling what that's referring to is
 
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
that if you do have a separate one
 
00:47:22.829 --> 00:47:22.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:25.510 --> 00:47:25.520 align:start position:0%
beginning and if you have a separate one
 
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
then that comes on the AL alternative
 
00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:33.390 align:start position:0%
then that comes on the AL alternative
budget

00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
procedure representative
 
00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
Davis uh thank you madam chair first of
 
00:47:41.109 --> 00:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
all I don't see that in the amendment
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
and second of all the amendment does say
 
00:47:48.069 --> 00:47:48.079 align:start position:0%
shall it doesn't say may it says
 
00:47:51.190 --> 00:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
shall I think that's tremendously
 
00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
confusing for anyone attempting to put
 
00:47:56.589 --> 00:47:56.599 align:start position:0%
forward an SAU budget that doesn't fit
 
00:47:56.599 --> 00:47:57.990 align:start position:0%
forward an SAU budget that doesn't fit
with

00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
the structure proposed in this
 
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
amendment but if if the SAU spending is
 
00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
is in the operating budget for the
 
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
school you don't have an SAU separate
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
budget so it doesn't
 
00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:16.829 align:start position:0%
budget so it doesn't
apply

00:48:16.829 --> 00:48:16.839 align:start position:0%
apply
 
00:48:16.839 --> 00:48:19.349 align:start position:0%
apply
further

00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:48:19.359 --> 00:48:21.030 align:start position:0%
further
further

00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:23.960 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
Colby um my main concern haven't been
 
00:48:30.069 --> 00:48:30.079 align:start position:0%
addressed either in the bill or in the
 
00:48:32.910 --> 00:48:32.920 align:start position:0%
amendment which is the stepping on voter
 
00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
Authority um it makes it makes it more
 
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
difficult for an electorate to have
 
00:48:40.069 --> 00:48:40.079 align:start position:0%
their voices heard um the bill also
 
00:48:44.069 --> 00:48:44.079 align:start position:0%
offers no adoption procedure um instead
 
00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
of mandating that all communities with a
 
00:48:49.789 --> 00:48:49.799 align:start position:0%
tax cap use this method um instead of
 
00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
respecting the will of the community at
 
00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:53.240 align:start position:0%
large thank
 
00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:55.720 align:start position:0%
you further
 
00:48:58.030 --> 00:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
comments representing majority is
 
00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:00.200 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you madam chair uh
 
00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:01.670 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you madam chair uh
chairwoman

00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
chairwoman
 
00:49:05.870 --> 00:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
um this provision of law of Statute was
 
00:49:09.589 --> 00:49:09.599 align:start position:0%
amended last year and it went into
 
00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
effect in October of
 
00:49:18.190 --> 00:49:18.200 align:start position:0%
24 so now we have a bill to fix the am
 
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
fix the law from last year which has now
 
00:49:25.069 --> 00:49:25.079 align:start position:0%
been amended again I have no faith that
 
00:49:27.549 --> 00:49:27.559 align:start position:0%
what we have in front of us addresses
 
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
the issues which have only been in
 
00:49:33.390 --> 00:49:33.400 align:start position:0%
effect since October of 24 furthermore
 
00:49:35.309 --> 00:49:35.319 align:start position:0%
I'm not even sure we had a problem in
 
00:49:39.390 --> 00:49:39.400 align:start position:0%
October of 24 if that's law that passed
 
00:49:43.549 --> 00:49:43.559 align:start position:0%
so this to me is I I have no faith that
 
00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
what we have in front of us is worthy of
 
00:49:51.230 --> 00:49:51.240 align:start position:0%
passing further comments
 
00:49:54.789 --> 00:49:54.799 align:start position:0%
wait mean to do so I I have a
 
00:49:57.789 --> 00:49:57.799 align:start position:0%
comment with regard to the
 
00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
bill a a bill was referenced from from
 
00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
last year that addressed a totally
 
00:50:07.069 --> 00:50:07.079 align:start position:0%
separate issue House Bill 200 is not a
 
00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
housekeeping Bill House Bill 200
 
00:50:15.150 --> 00:50:15.160 align:start position:0%
addresses the vote threshold by which a
 
00:50:18.349 --> 00:50:18.359 align:start position:0%
local tax cap is
 
00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:20.680 align:start position:0%
overridden changing it from a simple
 
00:50:22.069 --> 00:50:22.079 align:start position:0%
majority to a
 
00:50:22.079 --> 00:50:24.309 align:start position:0%
majority to a
35ths

00:50:24.309 --> 00:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
35ths
 
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
majority so it's completely different
 
00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:29.720 align:start position:0%
and it it's it doesn't
 
00:50:33.710 --> 00:50:33.720 align:start position:0%
relate to the bill that was the the
 
00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:43.910 --> 00:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
year the only the only similarity is
 
00:50:47.589 --> 00:50:47.599 align:start position:0%
it's the same um
 
00:50:54.349 --> 00:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:57.390 --> 00:50:57.400 align:start position:0%
discussion representative grundt I feel
 
00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
I just I just need to clarify on that
 
00:51:02.349 --> 00:51:02.359 align:start position:0%
194c so A School District like Hollis
 
00:51:04.630 --> 00:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
Brookline that separates out their sa
 
00:51:06.789 --> 00:51:06.799 align:start position:0%
budget they vote on it separately so
 
00:51:08.829 --> 00:51:08.839 align:start position:0%
that would be placed on the warrant
 
00:51:11.230 --> 00:51:11.240 align:start position:0%
article before these other things as
 
00:51:14.349 --> 00:51:14.359 align:start position:0%
indicated here a a school district like
 
00:51:15.630 --> 00:51:15.640 align:start position:0%
mine we have
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
sau39 amher school district soan school
 
00:51:20.309 --> 00:51:20.319 align:start position:0%
district Monon School District we do not
 
00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
separate out our SAU budget it is part
 
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:26.280 align:start position:0%
of all of our budgets it's spread out by
 
00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
number of students therefore I'm worried
 
00:51:32.670 --> 00:51:32.680 align:start position:0%
about B now forcing school districts to
 
00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:34.640 align:start position:0%
place the warrant article for the SAU
 
00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:36.440 align:start position:0%
budget we don't separate it out and this
 
00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
is not enabling and it's kind of does
 
00:51:43.309 --> 00:51:43.319 align:start position:0%
not separate out the um
 
00:51:47.549 --> 00:51:47.559 align:start position:0%

00:58:52.309 --> 00:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
references need to be corrected in order
 
00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:56.760 align:start position:0%
for the statute to function properly
 
00:58:59.470 --> 00:58:59.480 align:start position:0%
and it also
 
00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:01.029 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
clarifies definitions that need
 
00:59:08.990 --> 00:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
clarification so again this is simply a
 
00:59:12.069 --> 00:59:12.079 align:start position:0%
housekeeping bill and I I
 
00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:15.200 align:start position:0%

00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:17.880 align:start position:0%

00:59:25.470 --> 00:59:25.480 align:start position:0%
may be a housekeeping bill but there are
 
00:59:27.910 --> 00:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
lots and lots lot of different ways of
 
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
housekeeping um and the bottom line for
 
00:59:34.510 --> 00:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
me is that this is one of several bills
 
00:59:37.510 --> 00:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
that undermine local control and local
 
00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
control is what the New Hampshire
 
00:59:42.069 --> 00:59:42.079 align:start position:0%

01:05:39.269 --> 01:05:39.279 align:start position:0%
good thing to put um to have a
 
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
requirement on a special warrant article
 
01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
that does list the estimated tax impact

01:06:05.269 --> 01:06:05.279 align:start position:0%
the key word key word in representative
 
01:06:08.150 --> 01:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
Fran's comment was
 
01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:10.349 align:start position:0%
Fran's comment was
estimated

01:06:10.349 --> 01:06:10.359 align:start position:0%
estimated
 
01:06:14.549 --> 01:06:14.559 align:start position:0%
um if you're if you're implying a tax
 
01:06:18.029 --> 01:06:18.039 align:start position:0%
impact for your voters and that impact
 
01:06:20.549 --> 01:06:20.559 align:start position:0%
can only be an estimate based on
 
01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
everything that we heard and all the
 
01:06:24.870 --> 01:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
evidence that was presented to us in a
 
01:06:28.269 --> 01:06:28.279 align:start position:0%
hearing about about Bond rates being
 
01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
changeable over the years there is
 
01:06:33.829 --> 01:06:33.839 align:start position:0%
simply no way that you can deliver truth
 
01:06:37.470 --> 01:06:37.480 align:start position:0%
to the voters in in a bill such as this
 
01:06:41.349 --> 01:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
tax impact is an estimate it's a guess
 
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
it's not what the impact is going to be
 
01:06:47.230 --> 01:06:47.240 align:start position:0%
it's just a guess and no one can make an
 
01:06:49.789 --> 01:06:49.799 align:start position:0%
informed choice on a
 
01:06:52.430 --> 01:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
guess further comments
 
01:06:56.109 --> 01:06:56.119 align:start position:0%
discussion representative um Gil is
 
01:06:59.589 --> 01:06:59.599 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you madam chair um I am
 
01:07:03.150 --> 01:07:03.160 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill because first
 
01:07:04.910 --> 01:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
because the Department of Revenue
 
01:07:07.230 --> 01:07:07.240 align:start position:0%
Administration was not contacted and
 
01:07:08.789 --> 01:07:08.799 align:start position:0%
they are the ones that work with the
 
01:07:12.789 --> 01:07:12.799 align:start position:0%
towns to set the tax rate um
 
01:07:16.549 --> 01:07:16.559 align:start position:0%
also as as fellow representative stavis
 
01:07:20.349 --> 01:07:20.359 align:start position:0%
said um things vary we don't know what
 
01:07:23.510 --> 01:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
our revenue is we don't know uh what our
 
01:07:25.190 --> 01:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh property values are going to be and
 
01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
their evaluations within the 5-year
 
01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
period uh so these things would affect
 
01:07:33.069 --> 01:07:33.079 align:start position:0%
these lease agreements
 
01:07:36.589 --> 01:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
um at any
 
01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
time thank you
 
01:07:41.269 --> 01:07:41.279 align:start position:0%
further further comments um
 
01:07:43.349 --> 01:07:43.359 align:start position:0%
representative grund is
 
01:07:46.910 --> 01:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you madam chairwoman so
 
01:07:48.549 --> 01:07:48.559 align:start position:0%
my concerns about when we talk about
 
01:07:49.510 --> 01:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
estimates I'm going to give you an
 
01:07:51.710 --> 01:07:51.720 align:start position:0%
example of the bonds which is what this
 
01:07:54.390 --> 01:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
is really about when you do a when you
 
01:07:56.589 --> 01:07:56.599 align:start position:0%
when you start working on a bond you're
 
01:07:58.190 --> 01:07:58.200 align:start position:0%
working on it first of all the prior
 
01:07:59.630 --> 01:07:59.640 align:start position:0%
year you get estimates from the Bond
 
01:08:02.069 --> 01:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
Bank in October or November you have
 
01:08:04.069 --> 01:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
public hearings December January
 
01:08:05.990 --> 01:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
deliberative sessions February voting
 
01:08:09.150 --> 01:08:09.160 align:start position:0%
March you don't sell the bonds until
 
01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
later in the summer when that happen
 
01:08:13.109 --> 01:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
your interest rate has changed think
 
01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
about what's happened since October
 
01:08:17.829 --> 01:08:17.839 align:start position:0%
until what might happen J June or even
 
01:08:20.309 --> 01:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
now that is a huge estimate but yet
 
01:08:22.110 --> 01:08:22.120 align:start position:0%
you've put this out there and you have
 
01:08:25.149 --> 01:08:25.159 align:start position:0%
to educate your public um I'm very
 
01:08:26.709 --> 01:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
concerned concerned about the estimates
 
01:08:29.789 --> 01:08:29.799 align:start position:0%
on it um you know what happened to local
 
01:08:31.870 --> 01:08:31.880 align:start position:0%
control if a town would like to have
 
01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
this type of information included on
 
01:08:35.229 --> 01:08:35.239 align:start position:0%
their Ballot or in their voter guides to
 
01:08:36.709 --> 01:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
communicate to the public then that can
 
01:08:38.910 --> 01:08:38.920 align:start position:0%
be done without this legislation
 
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
calculations that may be inaccurate due
 
01:08:42.829 --> 01:08:42.839 align:start position:0%
to budgeting 8 months in advance changes
 
01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
in valuations changes in interest rates
 
01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
and terms when selling bonds and other
 
01:08:48.789 --> 01:08:48.799 align:start position:0%
estimated concerns does not communicate
 
01:08:50.990 --> 01:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
accurate information to taxpayers and
 
01:08:52.749 --> 01:08:52.759 align:start position:0%
estimating a tax impact 5 years out is
 
01:08:54.030 --> 01:08:54.040 align:start position:0%
going to be difficult to defend when
 
01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
it's not the actual impact to two or
 
01:08:58.510 --> 01:08:58.520 align:start position:0%
three years later thank you thank you

01:10:40.229 --> 01:10:40.239 align:start position:0%
the the voters or Dr ever saying there's

multi-year tax impacts um are borderline
 
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
irresponsible governing bodies being
 
01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
mandated to provide inaccurate forecast
 
01:11:06.590 --> 01:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
knowing full well their residents are
 
01:11:10.149 --> 01:11:10.159 align:start position:0%
making financial decisions based on
 
01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
falsehoods I feel the bill advocates for
 
01:11:16.189 --> 01:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
fiary malpractice and SWS seeds of
 
01:11:18.189 --> 01:11:18.199 align:start position:0%
distrust the state should not be
 
01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
suggesting that local officials violate
 
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
their legal or ethical
 
01:11:26.310 --> 01:11:26.320 align:start position:0%

stated exactly what I was going to say
 
01:11:35.790 --> 01:11:35.800 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
01:11:38.110 --> 01:11:38.120 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation can be a
 
01:11:40.629 --> 01:11:40.639 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation is by definition a
 
01:11:43.270 --> 01:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
misrepresentation because it's an
 
01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:47.440 align:start position:0%
estimate voters cannot decide in their
 
01:11:50.629 --> 01:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
best interests based on an estimate and
 
01:11:53.390 --> 01:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
where is their recourse by the way when
 
01:11:57.070 --> 01:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
that estimate is wrong
 
01:11:57.080 --> 01:12:00.350 align:start position:0%
that estimate is wrong

and there's been a lot of questions
 
01:15:06.750 --> 01:15:06.760 align:start position:0%
about estimate estimate estimate well if
 
01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
you look at the
 
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
bill and the war could say if this war
 
01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
anle passes there'll be an
 
01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
estimated weight estimated estimated tax
 
01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
impact of a certain amount per thousand
 
01:15:21.669 --> 01:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
of the evaluation for year one and then
 
01:15:22.990 --> 01:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
everything is estimated they're not
 
01:15:24.350 --> 01:15:24.360 align:start position:0%
saying the town's not saying it's going
 
01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
to be eight cents a thousand 10 cents a
 
01:15:28.669 --> 01:15:28.679 align:start position:0%
thousand they giving you the best
 
01:15:30.990 --> 01:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
ballpack figure of what exists currently
 
01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
on that particular day when you
 
01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
vote um again I I I think it's better to
 
01:15:37.830 --> 01:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
be open have open government in
 
01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
providing the taxpayers how much
 
01:15:42.270 --> 01:15:42.280 align:start position:0%
everything is going to cost on their tax
 
01:15:44.310 --> 01:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
rate uh unfortunately there are other
 
01:15:46.229 --> 01:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
people that don't agree that agree with
 
01:15:48.709 --> 01:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
that and I respect their opinion but I
 
01:15:50.229 --> 01:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
think openness in government is better
 
01:15:53.510 --> 01:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
than having uh no figures at all thank
 
01:15:58.590 --> 01:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
discussion I'd like to make a couple of
 
01:16:03.550 --> 01:16:03.560 align:start position:0%
comments um this amendment here before
 
01:16:06.910 --> 01:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
us it cleans up statutory language in
 
01:16:08.990 --> 01:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
the bill as it was
 
01:16:12.709 --> 01:16:12.719 align:start position:0%
filed when the bill was was filed
 
01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunately multi- toown
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
districts was not um accommodated for in
 
01:16:21.990 --> 01:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
the bill language multi-year warrant
 
01:16:28.870 --> 01:16:28.880 align:start position:0%
articles uh is is imported in
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
and also this amendment provides that on
 
01:16:38.990 --> 01:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
an sb2 ballot that the total tax impact
 
01:16:42.550 --> 01:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
um will be
 
01:16:46.030 --> 01:16:46.040 align:start position:0%
noted further
 
01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
comments representative Dolan thank you
 
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
madam chair I I just think it's worth
 
01:16:54.229 --> 01:16:54.239 align:start position:0%
noting that several communities do this
 
01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
quite well and they should be commended
 
01:16:59.550 --> 01:16:59.560 align:start position:0%
for their openness and and disclosure
 
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
some communities however don't do a very
 
01:17:06.470 --> 01:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
good job with this and this uh would put
 
01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
a requirement on those towns to do it so
 
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
it's no longer we be no longer at their
 
01:17:13.189 --> 01:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
option thank
 
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960 align:start position:0%

previous
 
01:20:00.870 --> 01:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
statements is there further comments or
 
01:20:03.510 --> 01:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
01:20:06.390 --> 01:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
grund thank you madam chair um one of
 
01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
the one of the issues I do have with
 
01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
this and I I could have spoken out the
 
01:20:12.790 --> 01:20:12.800 align:start position:0%
amendment it it just I remembered it
 
01:20:15.310 --> 01:20:15.320 align:start position:0%
says on line 181 19 and 20 in multi-
 
01:20:16.870 --> 01:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
toown districts the notation shall be
 
01:20:18.510 --> 01:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
included for each town by prefixing the
 
01:20:22.189 --> 01:20:22.199 align:start position:0%
notation with the name of each town in a
 
01:20:25.030 --> 01:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
school district similar to exitor that
 
01:20:27.030 --> 01:20:27.040 align:start position:0%
has five or six towns you're now going
 
01:20:29.270 --> 01:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
to list five or six towns is this the
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
one I
 
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
don't it's very confusing because that
 
01:20:37.470 --> 01:20:37.480 align:start position:0%
will cause a cost to the towns when you
 
01:20:39.830 --> 01:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
have warrant articles that you're going
 
01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
to have five or six towns and I'm not
 
01:20:44.189 --> 01:20:44.199 align:start position:0%
voting like even in soan I'm not voting
 
01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
on what Mont Vernon's tax rate is as a
 
01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard member trust me we talk
 
01:20:50.950 --> 01:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
about it a lot but as a voter you're
 
01:20:52.629 --> 01:20:52.639 align:start position:0%
voting on your impact to your town
 
01:20:57.189 --> 01:20:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:00.590 --> 01:21:00.600 align:start position:0%

this looks like um Timberlane is four
 
01:21:17.830 --> 01:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
communities this also calls for all of
 
01:21:20.110 --> 01:21:20.120 align:start position:0%
this posting to be done under up to

exceptionally exceptionally long ballot

you are creating uh which is borderline
 
01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
and unfunded mandate onto communities
 
01:21:55.990 --> 01:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
for printing
 
01:22:00.830 --> 01:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
um and just in general reviewing uh and
 
01:22:02.990 --> 01:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
making sure that all of these rates are
 
01:22:06.270 --> 01:22:06.280 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chairwoman um I always
 
01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
like the idea of transparency which is
 
01:22:20.310 --> 01:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
why we discussed these things at so many
 
01:22:22.390 --> 01:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
different meetings from September
 
01:22:24.990 --> 01:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
through right through March um I could
 
01:22:26.790 --> 01:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
almost swallow the idea of putting the
 
01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
estimated tax impact on there what I
 
01:22:31.270 --> 01:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
would really be curious to see and I
 
01:22:33.030 --> 01:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
don't know if nhma could do this or
 
01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
anybody could do this let's see how many
 
01:22:38.270 --> 01:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
warrant articles pass this year and then
 
01:22:40.830 --> 01:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
after this bill passes when you have the
 
01:22:43.229 --> 01:22:43.239 align:start position:0%
total tax impact summary statement at
 
01:22:45.910 --> 01:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
the beginning how many warrant articles
 
01:22:48.030 --> 01:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
fail the following year people are going
 
01:22:49.870 --> 01:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
to see a total tax impact at the
 
01:22:52.110 --> 01:22:52.120 align:start position:0%
beginning and say I don't want my taxes
 
01:22:55.110 --> 01:22:55.120 align:start position:0%
going up by a dollar two I'm voting no
 
01:22:58.990 --> 01:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
on everything I'll bet that's going to
 
01:23:01.470 --> 01:23:01.480 align:start position:0%
happen further
 
01:23:03.990 --> 01:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
01:23:06.189 --> 01:23:06.199 align:start position:0%
grunt actually I want to thank uh
 
01:23:07.830 --> 01:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
representative majori for bringing that
 
01:23:10.110 --> 01:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
up because you know one of the things
 
01:23:11.590 --> 01:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
that I'm observing today is that there
 
01:23:13.390 --> 01:23:13.400 align:start position:0%
are multiple bills in front of us asking
 
01:23:15.430 --> 01:23:15.440 align:start position:0%
us to change or increase requirements
 
01:23:17.629 --> 01:23:17.639 align:start position:0%
for reporting voting warn
 
01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
articles I would say if you sit in on
 
01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
Town meetings if you sit on school board
 
01:23:24.870 --> 01:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
meetings we talk about all this
 
01:23:27.870 --> 01:23:27.880 align:start position:0%
information constantly we talk about it
 
01:23:31.629 --> 01:23:31.639 align:start position:0%
we present it at at public hearings at
 
01:23:35.430 --> 01:23:35.440 align:start position:0%
deliberative um printed voter guides um
 
01:23:38.110 --> 01:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
it just my observation is there's an
 
01:23:39.629 --> 01:23:39.639 align:start position:0%
opinion people only vote because there's
 
01:23:43.390 --> 01:23:43.400 align:start position:0%
a tax impact to themselves um or because
 
01:23:44.870 --> 01:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
something's not going their way in their
 
01:23:46.750 --> 01:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
own town I I believe many people also
 
01:23:48.229 --> 01:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
need to assess the quality of the
 
01:23:51.070 --> 01:23:51.080 align:start position:0%
program and the warrant article um and
 
01:23:55.149 --> 01:23:55.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:57.149 --> 01:23:57.159 align:start position:0%

01:24:00.790 --> 01:24:00.800 align:start position:0%

01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:02.960 align:start position:0%

01:24:05.189 --> 01:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
reasons mentioned by my colleagues but I
 
01:24:07.990 --> 01:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
would also like to add that I view this
 
01:24:13.550 --> 01:24:13.560 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair I move itl on this
 
01:27:30.510 --> 01:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
bill based on a number of reasons but
 
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
primarily the fact that the sponsor
 
01:27:34.910 --> 01:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
never showed up to defend his bill or to
 
01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:36.189 align:start position:0%
never showed up to defend his bill or to
answer

01:27:36.189 --> 01:27:36.199 align:start position:0%
answer
 
01:27:40.109 --> 01:27:40.119 align:start position:0%
questions is there a second I will

Davis did you want to speak to your
 
01:27:52.590 --> 01:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
motion believe I already did but um yeah
 
01:27:54.390 --> 01:27:54.400 align:start position:0%
we we should have done that myself want
 
01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:55.790 align:start position:0%
we we should have done that myself want
but

01:27:55.790 --> 01:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:28:01.030 --> 01:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
no so um we normally speak to the motion
 
01:28:04.470 --> 01:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
after a second yeah we both messed up
 
01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:07.520 align:start position:0%

01:28:11.109 --> 01:28:11.119 align:start position:0%
problem further comments discussion
 
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative Colby thank you madam
 
01:28:16.109 --> 01:28:16.119 align:start position:0%
chair uh this bill would mandate changes
 
01:28:18.550 --> 01:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh to be made to assessing software many
 
01:28:21.070 --> 01:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
municipalities have existing contracts
 
01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
that will have to take on additional
 
01:28:24.510 --> 01:28:24.520 align:start position:0%
Financial burdens
 
01:28:27.070 --> 01:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
um very expensive software updates will
 
01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
have to be
 
01:28:30.669 --> 01:28:30.679 align:start position:0%
undertaken there's also a lack of
 
01:28:31.790 --> 01:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
guidance on how to deal with
 
01:28:34.430 --> 01:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
reassessments and variation in bills
 
01:28:37.149 --> 01:28:37.159 align:start position:0%
that are delivered quarterly or by
 
01:28:41.310 --> 01:28:41.320 align:start position:0%
anually there is no Direction um as to
 
01:28:43.590 --> 01:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
if we're providing individual breakdowns
 
01:28:45.550 --> 01:28:45.560 align:start position:0%
personalized for each property or
 
01:28:48.669 --> 01:28:48.679 align:start position:0%
overall tax rate changes uh and we of
 
01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
course heard in testimony uh that
 
01:28:53.669 --> 01:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
through nhma and Avatar Associates
 
01:28:56.430 --> 01:28:56.440 align:start position:0%
question the accuracy of the fiscal note
 
01:28:59.750 --> 01:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh and nhma has no record that anyone uh
 
01:29:01.510 --> 01:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
from their organization actually did
 
01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:02.470 align:start position:0%
from their organization actually did
provide

01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:29:05.229 --> 01:29:05.239 align:start position:0%
input Avatar and Associates are
 
01:29:07.870 --> 01:29:07.880 align:start position:0%
concerned that the $10,000 estimate uh
 
01:29:11.030 --> 01:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
in cost was far too low thank
 
01:29:13.510 --> 01:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
you thank you further comments
 
01:29:15.910 --> 01:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan is recognized thank
 
01:29:18.510 --> 01:29:18.520 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I think in in this case
 
01:29:21.750 --> 01:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
as as uh in other cases that we've come
 
01:29:23.750 --> 01:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
across I think we have one further down
 
01:29:27.470 --> 01:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
our l list to talk about is the public
 
01:29:29.870 --> 01:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
hearing process that we undertake we
 
01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
have we have a a sacred I believe a
 
01:29:36.229 --> 01:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
sacred obligation to share with the with
 
01:29:38.750 --> 01:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
our constituents and the voters what
 
01:29:40.830 --> 01:29:40.840 align:start position:0%
we're doing what laws we're we're
 
01:29:44.709 --> 01:29:44.719 align:start position:0%
looking at enacting uh and we go we do
 
01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
that through the public hearing process
 
01:29:49.510 --> 01:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
where we invite the the sponsors of a
 
01:29:51.390 --> 01:29:51.400 align:start position:0%
bill to explain what the bill is all
 
01:29:54.270 --> 01:29:54.280 align:start position:0%
about and for us to ask questions imp
 
01:29:57.189 --> 01:29:57.199 align:start position:0%
pulse the sponsors and co-sponsors so
 
01:29:59.510 --> 01:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
that we can get a further understanding
 
01:30:01.750 --> 01:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
and help share with the voters what
 
01:30:04.790 --> 01:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
their government is doing in a case like
 
01:30:07.870 --> 01:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
this when none of the when the sponsor
 
01:30:09.709 --> 01:30:09.719 align:start position:0%
and the co-sponsors don't show up for
 
01:30:12.550 --> 01:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
the public hearing then that process I
 
01:30:15.189 --> 01:30:15.199 align:start position:0%
believe becomes contaminated with a lack
 
01:30:18.070 --> 01:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
of transparency to the voters and so in
 
01:30:20.270 --> 01:30:20.280 align:start position:0%
this case where there's a no-show for
 
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
both the sponsor and the co-sponsors I
 
01:30:24.510 --> 01:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
don't think we have any other choice but
 
01:30:27.149 --> 01:30:27.159 align:start position:0%
to itl the
 
01:30:31.270 --> 01:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:34.350 --> 01:30:34.360 align:start position:0%
comments I have a few comments with
 
01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
regards to this this bill and
 
01:30:41.550 --> 01:30:41.560 align:start position:0%
and it needs work it's not ready for
 
01:30:45.629 --> 01:30:45.639 align:start position:0%
prime time um one example would be
 
01:30:47.950 --> 01:30:47.960 align:start position:0%
multip with regards to if there's
 
01:30:50.189 --> 01:30:50.199 align:start position:0%
multiple school districts and and
 
01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
potentially multiple um village
 
01:30:54.310 --> 01:30:54.320 align:start position:0%
districts that's that's not a addressed
 
01:30:56.750 --> 01:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
in this bill additionally it's my
 
01:30:59.950 --> 01:30:59.960 align:start position:0%
opinion that um providing tax rate
 
01:31:02.750 --> 01:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
information is only part of the story I
 
01:31:05.470 --> 01:31:05.480 align:start position:0%
don't find that to be particularly a
 
01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:06.709 align:start position:0%
don't find that to be particularly a
useful

01:31:06.709 --> 01:31:06.719 align:start position:0%
useful
 
01:31:06.719 --> 01:31:09.790 align:start position:0%
useful
metric

01:31:09.790 --> 01:31:09.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:12.229 --> 01:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:31:14.990 --> 01:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
also I am aware of the fact that there's
 
01:31:22.109 --> 01:31:22.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:24.669 --> 01:31:24.679 align:start position:0%
um okay
 
01:31:28.510 --> 01:31:28.520 align:start position:0%
that um seeks to to do a similar uh
 
01:31:30.590 --> 01:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
thing with regards to providing
 
01:31:33.870 --> 01:31:33.880 align:start position:0%
information however that Senate bill um
 
01:31:36.910 --> 01:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
has this information to be posted online
 
01:31:39.990 --> 01:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
at a on a town website or School website
 
01:31:43.310 --> 01:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
which I think is a a much more practical
 
01:31:48.390 --> 01:31:48.400 align:start position:0%
way to um address what's being proposed
 
01:31:49.350 --> 01:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
in this
 
01:31:56.030 --> 01:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:00.149 --> 01:32:00.159 align:start position:0%

consent calendar so without objection
 
01:33:49.189 --> 01:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
the recommendation will go on to the
 
01:33:50.790 --> 01:33:50.800 align:start position:0%
house consent
 
01:33:54.109 --> 01:33:54.119 align:start position:0%

regards to bills with fiscal notes and
 
01:34:25.870 --> 01:34:25.880 align:start position:0%
which calendar it's to go on is that it
 
01:34:29.709 --> 01:34:29.719 align:start position:0%
is acceptable to place a bill with a
 
01:34:32.669 --> 01:34:32.679 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on the consent calendar if
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
the motion is inexpedient to
 
01:34:38.669 --> 01:34:38.679 align:start position:0%
legislate so but I do appreciate that
 
01:34:41.430 --> 01:34:41.440 align:start position:0%

unique quality of life and culture
 
01:37:48.350 --> 01:37:48.360 align:start position:0%
within their Community when local
 
01:37:50.830 --> 01:37:50.840 align:start position:0%
officials make decisions they are
 
01:37:52.830 --> 01:37:52.840 align:start position:0%
carrying out the policy values set forth
 
01:37:54.990 --> 01:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
by the majority of residents the policy
 
01:37:57.030 --> 01:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
values set forth by the majority give
 
01:38:00.589 --> 01:38:00.599 align:start position:0%
the governing B bodies purpose and
 
01:38:02.709 --> 01:38:02.719 align:start position:0%
direction this is yet another bill that
 
01:38:04.310 --> 01:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
if passed will undermine prudent
 
01:38:06.550 --> 01:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
management of local Affairs thwart the
 
01:38:08.470 --> 01:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
will of the majority increase the
 
01:38:10.430 --> 01:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
influence of special interest groups and
 
01:38:13.189 --> 01:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
local government and create barriers to
 
01:38:15.990 --> 01:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
repealing errors in harmful rules and
 
01:38:17.550 --> 01:38:17.560 align:start position:0%
actions and therefore I'm opposed to
 
01:38:18.910 --> 01:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
both the amendment and the underlying
 
01:38:21.870 --> 01:38:21.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:25.310 --> 01:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
you okay further
 
01:38:28.030 --> 01:38:28.040 align:start position:0%

01:38:41.510 --> 01:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
um this is a question or I'm just musing
 
01:38:45.910 --> 01:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
out loud is representative majority
 
01:38:50.149 --> 01:38:50.159 align:start position:0%
reading from his own words or is he
 
01:38:52.430 --> 01:38:52.440 align:start position:0%
referencing something that was written
 
01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:57.629 align:start position:0%
referencing something that was written
elsewhere

01:38:57.629 --> 01:38:57.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:07.629 --> 01:39:07.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:12.229 --> 01:39:12.239 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm well I'm thinking right now um
 
01:39:14.790 --> 01:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
I I I'm inclined
 
01:39:16.990 --> 01:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
to this is why I'm
 
01:39:22.149 --> 01:39:22.159 align:start position:0%
hesitating I'm inclined to find that
 
01:39:26.790 --> 01:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
inquiry by the representative
 
01:39:28.750 --> 01:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
um somewhat
 
01:39:32.109 --> 01:39:32.119 align:start position:0%
inappropriate so what I will say is that
 
01:39:36.070 --> 01:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
the representative to whom the inquiry
 
01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:36.910 align:start position:0%
the representative to whom the inquiry
was

01:39:36.910 --> 01:39:36.920 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:39:41.790 --> 01:39:41.800 align:start position:0%
directed um may choose not to respond or
 
01:39:45.109 --> 01:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
if the representative chooses to respond
 
01:39:46.910 --> 01:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
you can be
 
01:39:49.629 --> 01:39:49.639 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you madam chairwoman at
 
01:39:54.189 --> 01:39:54.199 align:start position:0%

01:39:56.310 --> 01:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
these comments which are mine and mine
 
01:39:58.030 --> 01:39:58.040 align:start position:0%
alone thank
 
01:40:02.669 --> 01:40:02.679 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative further um
 
01:40:05.629 --> 01:40:05.639 align:start position:0%
discussion representative stavis is
 
01:40:08.550 --> 01:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you madam chair I just
 
01:40:10.750 --> 01:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
have to
 
01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
say that why are we discounting simple
 
01:40:19.950 --> 01:40:19.960 align:start position:0%
majority votes I I just don't understand
 
01:40:23.470 --> 01:40:23.480 align:start position:0%
why we don't trust the simple majority
 
01:40:26.350 --> 01:40:26.360 align:start position:0%
of our constituents to vote and we're
 
01:40:28.709 --> 01:40:28.719 align:start position:0%
insisting that three fifths of them have
 
01:40:30.229 --> 01:40:30.239 align:start position:0%
to vote in the affirmative or the
 
01:40:32.830 --> 01:40:32.840 align:start position:0%
negative in order to prove the point I
 
01:40:35.430 --> 01:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
think that is anti-democratic I think
 
01:40:39.189 --> 01:40:39.199 align:start position:0%
that it is burdensome and I I just I
 
01:40:41.550 --> 01:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
think that it is uncalled for and
 
01:40:45.030 --> 01:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
unwarranted and an illegitimate
 
01:40:48.030 --> 01:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
expression of Power by the state
 
01:40:50.870 --> 01:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
legislature on individual cities and
 
01:40:52.790 --> 01:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
towns that have their own needs their
 
01:40:57.470 --> 01:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
own Cates in their own priorities thank
 
01:41:01.270 --> 01:41:01.280 align:start position:0%
you further discussion representative
 
01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:02.830 align:start position:0%
you further discussion representative
col's

01:41:02.830 --> 01:41:02.840 align:start position:0%
col's
 
01:41:07.470 --> 01:41:07.480 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you madam chair um I
 
01:41:10.030 --> 01:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
have the most troubling part of
 
01:41:13.950 --> 01:41:13.960 align:start position:0%
listening uh to the testimony was the
 
01:41:16.709 --> 01:41:16.719 align:start position:0%
implication um that we need to offer a
 
01:41:18.950 --> 01:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
third type of
 
01:41:22.070 --> 01:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
budget uh warrant article budgetary
 
01:41:24.350 --> 01:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
warrant article uh was because there was
 
01:41:27.229 --> 01:41:27.239 align:start position:0%
a slim Financial difference
 
01:41:30.629 --> 01:41:30.639 align:start position:0%
between a default budget and a presented
 
01:41:30.639 --> 01:41:32.470 align:start position:0%
between a default budget and a presented
operating

01:41:32.470 --> 01:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
operating
 
01:41:38.790 --> 01:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
budget um I it is in my experience the
 
01:41:41.189 --> 01:41:41.199 align:start position:0%
reason that you don't see a big
 
01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
variation between these two figures is
 
01:41:46.030 --> 01:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
because school districts and
 
01:41:49.790 --> 01:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities towns are working hard at
 
01:41:51.950 --> 01:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
delivering budgets that are reflective
 
01:41:54.990 --> 01:41:55.000 align:start position:0%
of the needs um of their community and
 
01:41:57.229 --> 01:41:57.239 align:start position:0%
respecting the burden that is taken on
 
01:42:01.189 --> 01:42:01.199 align:start position:0%
by taxpayers already to set forth a
 
01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
third budget
 
01:42:06.709 --> 01:42:06.719 align:start position:0%
option um that is just an arbitrary
 
01:42:09.709 --> 01:42:09.719 align:start position:0%
figure uh is and thinking about the
 
01:42:11.510 --> 01:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
cative damage of
 
01:42:14.070 --> 01:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
that um is beyond
 
01:42:16.589 --> 01:42:16.599 align:start position:0%
comprehension residents will will see a
 
01:42:19.350 --> 01:42:19.360 align:start position:0%
degradation and services uh and quality
 
01:42:22.270 --> 01:42:22.280 align:start position:0%
of care as the missing money has to come
 
01:42:24.990 --> 01:42:25.000 align:start position:0%
from somewhere municipalities are
 
01:42:28.229 --> 01:42:28.239 align:start position:0%
strictly service based they're strictly
 
01:42:30.790 --> 01:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
there to provide services they don't
 
01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:32.149 align:start position:0%
there to provide services they don't
make

01:42:32.149 --> 01:42:32.159 align:start position:0%
make
 
01:42:35.629 --> 01:42:35.639 align:start position:0%
money uh towns cannot decide to carry a
 
01:42:37.750 --> 01:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
different product to reduce their cost
 
01:42:40.950 --> 01:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
they can't decide uh to Outsource uh
 
01:42:44.510 --> 01:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
production overseas um the only way to
 
01:42:47.550 --> 01:42:47.560 align:start position:0%
make arbitrary Cuts uh that are not
 
01:42:49.790 --> 01:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
suggested by your elected officials or
 
01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
your town
 
01:42:54.910 --> 01:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
officials um it's reduce services that
 
01:42:58.430 --> 01:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
our residents depend on thank you
 
01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:00.189 align:start position:0%
our residents depend on thank you
further

01:43:00.189 --> 01:43:00.199 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:43:03.430 --> 01:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
discussion representative grund is
 
01:43:06.790 --> 01:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you madam chairwoman um
 
01:43:10.709 --> 01:43:10.719 align:start position:0%
so picking backing on representative
 
01:43:14.669 --> 01:43:14.679 align:start position:0%
Colby I am I believe default budget
 
01:43:17.070 --> 01:43:17.080 align:start position:0%
calculations need to be worked on yes I
 
01:43:21.149 --> 01:43:21.159 align:start position:0%
do but this is not the way to present a
 
01:43:25.390 --> 01:43:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:28.669 --> 01:43:28.679 align:start position:0%
um it's not based on facts it's not
 
01:43:31.790 --> 01:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
based on actual information it's going
 
01:43:35.070 --> 01:43:35.080 align:start position:0%
back to um asking people to vote on a
 
01:43:37.350 --> 01:43:37.360 align:start position:0%
tax rate impact and not assess the
 
01:43:40.990 --> 01:43:41.000 align:start position:0%
programs um themselves I you know part
 
01:43:43.070 --> 01:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
of the critical thinking skills we teach
 
01:43:44.950 --> 01:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
in schools are to understand the source
 
01:43:47.229 --> 01:43:47.239 align:start position:0%
and the motivation many towns and
 
01:43:48.669 --> 01:43:48.679 align:start position:0%
schools are doing a thorough job
 
01:43:50.149 --> 01:43:50.159 align:start position:0%
educating residents through meetings
 
01:43:52.750 --> 01:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
that include public comments public
 
01:43:54.589 --> 01:43:54.599 align:start position:0%
hearing ings deliberative sessions
 
01:43:56.109 --> 01:43:56.119 align:start position:0%
documentation that's mailed to voters
 
01:43:58.189 --> 01:43:58.199 align:start position:0%
and holding extra meetings as needed on
 
01:44:00.550 --> 01:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
important topics such as bonds school
 
01:44:01.990 --> 01:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
districts and town leaders are not
 
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
hiding information and we need to get
 
01:44:05.830 --> 01:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
back to open discussions and Trust in
 
01:44:07.669 --> 01:44:07.679 align:start position:0%
our towns and school leaders I am
 
01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
against this amendment and look forward
 
01:44:14.310 --> 01:44:14.320 align:start position:0%
motion thank you representative stavis
 
01:44:17.709 --> 01:44:17.719 align:start position:0%
is recognized thank you madam chair uh I
 
01:44:20.350 --> 01:44:20.360 align:start position:0%
have a question actually on the
 
01:44:23.790 --> 01:44:23.800 align:start position:0%
amendment and it's line 18 and 19
 
01:44:25.550 --> 01:44:25.560 align:start position:0%
where it says only votes in the
 
01:44:27.430 --> 01:44:27.440 align:start position:0%
affirmative or negative shall be
 
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
included in the
 
01:44:47.709 --> 01:44:47.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:54.430 --> 01:44:54.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:57.310 --> 01:44:57.320 align:start position:0%
representative Kosinski y I could offer
 
01:44:59.870 --> 01:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
a potential answer to that question
 
01:45:03.870 --> 01:45:03.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um I think if
 
01:45:07.830 --> 01:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
people come in and register to vote and
 
01:45:11.390 --> 01:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
don't vote you could have 1500
 
01:45:16.950 --> 01:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
people in attendance and if 500 vote
 
01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:19.030 align:start position:0%
people in attendance and if 500 vote
for

01:45:19.030 --> 01:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:45:23.669 --> 01:45:23.679 align:start position:0%
and 800 vote against
 
01:45:24.950 --> 01:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
that's how you f figure your
 
01:45:27.750 --> 01:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
three-fifths calculation you wouldn't
 
01:45:30.310 --> 01:45:30.320 align:start position:0%
include the 200 people that are also
 
01:45:32.669 --> 01:45:32.679 align:start position:0%
there not voting I believe that's what
 
01:45:36.070 --> 01:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
that's trying to answer thank you but
 
01:45:37.390 --> 01:45:37.400 align:start position:0%
there is no language in the bill that
 
01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:38.350 align:start position:0%
there is no language in the bill that
says

01:45:38.350 --> 01:45:38.360 align:start position:0%
says
 
01:45:43.510 --> 01:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:45.990 --> 01:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none the motion before

h

01:48:25.870 --> 01:48:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:29.350 --> 01:48:29.360 align:start position:0%
so House Bill 613 this is enabling
 
01:48:34.030 --> 01:48:34.040 align:start position:0%
legislation for SP2 towns and school
 
01:48:38.790 --> 01:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
districts that allows for an an option
 
01:48:42.870 --> 01:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
to put forward a reduced default budget
 
01:48:46.270 --> 01:48:46.280 align:start position:0%
by a fixed percentage that is specified
 
01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:47.629 align:start position:0%
by a fixed percentage that is specified
when

01:48:47.629 --> 01:48:47.639 align:start position:0%
when
 
01:48:53.750 --> 01:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
um when this provision is is approved
 
01:48:56.550 --> 01:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
there are issues as another
 
01:48:59.589 --> 01:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
representative had um stated with
 
01:49:02.790 --> 01:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
regards to default budgets in this bill
 
01:49:09.109 --> 01:49:09.119 align:start position:0%
is um legislation that seeks to address
 
01:49:12.030 --> 01:49:12.040 align:start position:0%
the um problems and the
 
01:49:16.070 --> 01:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:19.109 --> 01:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
budgets so what that means is if the
 
01:49:24.310 --> 01:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
proposed budget does not pass in an sb2
 
01:49:28.709 --> 01:49:28.719 align:start position:0%
town or School District that there's of
 
01:49:30.629 --> 01:49:30.639 align:start position:0%
course there's a default budget but
 
01:49:33.990 --> 01:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
there's if this is enabling
 
01:49:38.229 --> 01:49:38.239 align:start position:0%
legislation is passed that it allows for
 
01:49:41.109 --> 01:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
like I said the reduced default
 
01:49:46.589 --> 01:49:46.599 align:start position:0%
budget and what this bill seeks to do is
 
01:49:49.310 --> 01:49:49.320 align:start position:0%
to prevent the biggest problem with
 
01:49:53.510 --> 01:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
default budgets is monitor ionically
 
01:49:57.750 --> 01:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
increasing default budgets so
 
01:50:01.669 --> 01:50:01.679 align:start position:0%
I I support this bill and I I it's an
 
01:50:04.990 --> 01:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
important bill to to
 
01:50:10.709 --> 01:50:10.719 align:start position:0%
um remedy the issues um in
 
01:50:13.629 --> 01:50:13.639 align:start position:0%
SP2 further
 
01:50:16.270 --> 01:50:16.280 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Gilman thank
 
01:50:18.550 --> 01:50:18.560 align:start position:0%
you madam chair I I understand that this
 
01:50:21.709 --> 01:50:21.719 align:start position:0%
is enabling uh legislation but I do
 
01:50:25.750 --> 01:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
wonder about line 20 that says the
 
01:50:29.109 --> 01:50:29.119 align:start position:0%
question shall not be amended uh by the
 
01:50:33.550 --> 01:50:33.560 align:start position:0%
legislative body and I am curious how it
 
01:50:36.830 --> 01:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
is that we go to a public town meeting
 
01:50:40.350 --> 01:50:40.360 align:start position:0%
but aren't allowed to um to vote on
 
01:50:44.270 --> 01:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
something different than what is
 
01:50:47.709 --> 01:50:47.719 align:start position:0%
presented further
 
01:50:50.069 --> 01:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
discussion representative
 
01:50:52.669 --> 01:50:52.679 align:start position:0%
majori and I I it was a question
 
01:50:54.870 --> 01:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
question that was asked before I guess
 
01:50:57.149 --> 01:50:57.159 align:start position:0%
I'm asking it again but won't look for
 
01:51:02.589 --> 01:51:02.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:06.910 --> 01:51:06.920 align:start position:0%
year that seems dangerous
 
01:51:10.350 --> 01:51:10.360 align:start position:0%
thanks further comments or discussion
 
01:51:13.189 --> 01:51:13.199 align:start position:0%
representative grund thank you madam
 
01:51:16.310 --> 01:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
chairwoman so one of the reasons default
 
01:51:18.149 --> 01:51:18.159 align:start position:0%
budgets are so close to budgets is
 
01:51:21.229 --> 01:51:21.239 align:start position:0%
because we try not to add that much
 
01:51:22.950 --> 01:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
extra unless there's a need that's why
 
01:51:24.669 --> 01:51:24.679 align:start position:0%
many times you see extra special warrant
 
01:51:26.229 --> 01:51:26.239 align:start position:0%
articles because you don't necessarily
 
01:51:27.950 --> 01:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
put in your budget but you ask the town
 
01:51:30.270 --> 01:51:30.280 align:start position:0%
do you want to do this as a separate
 
01:51:33.510 --> 01:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
issue if you go to a percentage there
 
01:51:35.870 --> 01:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
are contractual obligations and things
 
01:51:37.189 --> 01:51:37.199 align:start position:0%
that need to be met like special
 
01:51:39.149 --> 01:51:39.159 align:start position:0%
education that if you start cutting it
 
01:51:43.109 --> 01:51:43.119 align:start position:0%
by 8% 10% yeah you're going to start
 
01:51:45.510 --> 01:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
impacting your education and I would
 
01:51:48.790 --> 01:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
certainly hope the town people voters
 
01:51:51.109 --> 01:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
that are showing up have educated
 
01:51:53.990 --> 01:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
themselves on the budget has shown up
 
01:51:56.790 --> 01:51:56.800 align:start position:0%
this is just another way to to just
 
01:51:56.800 --> 01:51:59.310 align:start position:0%
this is just another way to to just
attack

01:51:59.310 --> 01:51:59.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:03.669 --> 01:52:03.679 align:start position:0%
schools for representative stavis is
 
01:52:06.510 --> 01:52:06.520 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you madam chair now I
 
01:52:08.709 --> 01:52:08.719 align:start position:0%
have an enormous amount of respect for
 
01:52:11.550 --> 01:52:11.560 align:start position:0%
the combined expertise and experience of
 
01:52:13.950 --> 01:52:13.960 align:start position:0%
all of the legislators on this
 
01:52:18.669 --> 01:52:18.679 align:start position:0%
committee um they all hold um local have
 
01:52:20.950 --> 01:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
local responsibilities many of them hold
 
01:52:24.510 --> 01:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
local offices and I I just I simply
 
01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:26.270 align:start position:0%
local offices and I I just I simply
cannot

01:52:26.270 --> 01:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
cannot
 
01:52:30.109 --> 01:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
support bill after Bill after Bill that
 
01:52:31.669 --> 01:52:31.679 align:start position:0%
seeks to
 
01:52:36.310 --> 01:52:36.320 align:start position:0%
subvert and and the way locally
 
01:52:39.830 --> 01:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
elected officials can or cannot do their
 
01:52:44.310 --> 01:52:44.320 align:start position:0%
jobs and I wonder why given the the very
 
01:52:48.189 --> 01:52:48.199 align:start position:0%
proud history that this legislature has
 
01:52:51.149 --> 01:52:51.159 align:start position:0%
has put into place a very fine level of
 
01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
balance between legislative Authority
 
01:52:58.510 --> 01:52:58.520 align:start position:0%
and local control always deferring to on
 
01:53:01.149 --> 01:53:01.159 align:start position:0%
the side of local control that all of a
 
01:53:04.510 --> 01:53:04.520 align:start position:0%
sudden we need to pass a raft of bills
 
01:53:07.189 --> 01:53:07.199 align:start position:0%
that tie the hands of locally elected
 
01:53:10.750 --> 01:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
officials and confuse their constituents
 
01:53:12.990 --> 01:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
I just I don't understand
 
01:53:15.870 --> 01:53:15.880 align:start position:0%
it and I can't support it further
 
01:53:15.880 --> 01:53:23.270 align:start position:0%
it and I can't support it further

legislation representative stavis is
 
02:00:31.109 --> 02:00:31.119 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you madam chair in my
 
02:00:33.870 --> 02:00:33.880 align:start position:0%
opinion this legislature has
 
02:00:37.629 --> 02:00:37.639 align:start position:0%
historically upheld a balance between
 
02:00:40.870 --> 02:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
what it dictates to cities and
 
02:00:44.510 --> 02:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
towns and what it leaves to local
 
02:00:47.830 --> 02:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
control and that bance has always aired
 
02:00:52.149 --> 02:00:52.159 align:start position:0%
on the side of local control and why we
 
02:00:52.159 --> 02:00:53.550 align:start position:0%
on the side of local control and why we
are

02:00:53.550 --> 02:00:53.560 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:00:57.030 --> 02:00:57.040 align:start position:0%

bills erasing that history I simply have
 
02:01:08.990 --> 02:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
no idea and I cannot support any of
 
02:01:17.270 --> 02:01:17.280 align:start position:0%

representative Colby is recognized thank
 
02:03:38.229 --> 02:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
you madam chair in my humble opinion uh
 
02:03:40.790 --> 02:03:40.800 align:start position:0%
we should not be creating legislation
 
02:03:42.990 --> 02:03:43.000 align:start position:0%
based on the assumption that unused
 
02:03:45.870 --> 02:03:45.880 align:start position:0%
money budgeted for positions is being
 
02:03:45.880 --> 02:03:46.870 align:start position:0%
money budgeted for positions is being
used

02:03:46.870 --> 02:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
used
 
02:03:50.430 --> 02:03:50.440 align:start position:0%
recklessly it is more likely that this
 
02:03:52.470 --> 02:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
money is being utilized to offset
 
02:03:56.109 --> 02:03:56.119 align:start position:0%
overtime lines or contracted
 
02:04:00.990 --> 02:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
Services HB 475 even as amended seems to
 
02:04:03.709 --> 02:04:03.719 align:start position:0%
be borne from baseless accusations of
 
02:04:06.310 --> 02:04:06.320 align:start position:0%
Fraud and Abuse of public funds by
 
02:04:08.750 --> 02:04:08.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities and school
 
02:04:11.750 --> 02:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
districts this bill asks municipalities
 
02:04:13.549 --> 02:04:13.559 align:start position:0%
and school districts both to look into
 
02:04:15.549 --> 02:04:15.559 align:start position:0%
crystal balls and see the
 
02:04:17.950 --> 02:04:17.960 align:start position:0%
future uh no one can really predict when
 
02:04:20.669 --> 02:04:20.679 align:start position:0%
a police officer a firefighter or a
 
02:04:22.149 --> 02:04:22.159 align:start position:0%
special education teacher teacher will
 
02:04:25.629 --> 02:04:25.639 align:start position:0%
apply for or be granted employment nor
 
02:04:27.549 --> 02:04:27.559 align:start position:0%
can school districts predict when a
 
02:04:29.950 --> 02:04:29.960 align:start position:0%
child with unique needs may move into
 
02:04:32.350 --> 02:04:32.360 align:start position:0%
their District public schools are
 
02:04:35.549 --> 02:04:35.559 align:start position:0%
legally required to provide services to
 
02:04:37.510 --> 02:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
these children regardless of their
 
02:04:40.750 --> 02:04:40.760 align:start position:0%
approved budgets and in some cases this
 
02:04:43.549 --> 02:04:43.559 align:start position:0%
involves hiring experienced Personnel at
 
02:04:48.669 --> 02:04:48.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:52.069 --> 02:04:52.079 align:start position:0%

default budgets we need to consider
 
02:05:05.950 --> 02:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
those things that are required by law
 
02:05:08.189 --> 02:05:08.199 align:start position:0%

default budget we got to go find that
 
02:05:25.350 --> 02:05:25.360 align:start position:0%

02:06:02.750 --> 02:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
of transparency in one of my district

towns uh they're trying to pass a $3.2
 
02:06:10.629 --> 02:06:10.639 align:start position:0%
million Bond based on a single sheet of
 
02:06:13.629 --> 02:06:13.639 align:start position:0%
paper um that was mailed to
 
02:06:19.030 --> 02:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
voters um and despite exposing the fact
 
02:06:22.149 --> 02:06:22.159 align:start position:0%
that no estimated cost breakdown
 
02:06:22.159 --> 02:06:22.910 align:start position:0%
that no estimated cost breakdown
has

02:06:22.910 --> 02:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
has
 
02:06:25.990 --> 02:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
been publicized or
 
02:06:31.229 --> 02:06:31.239 align:start position:0%
created um I'm sorry but there are towns
 
02:06:33.669 --> 02:06:33.679 align:start position:0%
that want to
 
02:06:38.350 --> 02:06:38.360 align:start position:0%
hide um what they're doing and do not
 
02:06:41.390 --> 02:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
disclose to the the citizens what they
 
02:06:44.390 --> 02:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:47.430 --> 02:06:47.440 align:start position:0%

respectfully um representative that's
 
02:06:55.470 --> 02:06:55.480 align:start position:0%
what Municipal elections should be doing
 
02:06:58.390 --> 02:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
um and if that is not the
 
02:06:58.400 --> 02:06:59.570 align:start position:0%
um and if that is not the
case

02:06:59.570 --> 02:06:59.580 align:start position:0%

case
[Music]

02:07:01.030 --> 02:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:07:04.149 --> 02:07:04.159 align:start position:0%
then I would think that that is the
 
02:07:06.549 --> 02:07:06.559 align:start position:0%
electorate still speaking to what they
 
02:07:06.559 --> 02:07:07.830 align:start position:0%
electorate still speaking to what they
would

02:07:07.830 --> 02:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:07:10.629 --> 02:07:10.639 align:start position:0%
like representative
 
02:07:13.549 --> 02:07:13.559 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you madam chair I strongly
 
02:07:16.669 --> 02:07:16.679 align:start position:0%
object in my opinion to the question
 
02:07:19.270 --> 02:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
just put forward by representative award
 
02:07:21.069 --> 02:07:21.079 align:start position:0%
it has nothing to do with the bill at
 
02:07:23.109 --> 02:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
hand it has everything to do with a
 
02:07:25.790 --> 02:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
personal grievance against one town that
 
02:07:28.870 --> 02:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
is not what we are here to do that is
 
02:07:33.229 --> 02:07:33.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:38.229 --> 02:07:38.239 align:start position:0%
do further comments representative
 
02:07:41.470 --> 02:07:41.480 align:start position:0%
grundt thank you again Madam chairwoman
 
02:07:43.350 --> 02:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
so in my
 
02:07:47.270 --> 02:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
opinion boards School boards Town boards
 
02:07:50.510 --> 02:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
all have public meetings bonds require
 
02:07:52.470 --> 02:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
public hearings
 
02:07:56.430 --> 02:07:56.440 align:start position:0%
uh there's separate public hearings for
 
02:07:59.109 --> 02:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
before deliberative sessions all that
 
02:08:02.109 --> 02:08:02.119 align:start position:0%
information has to be produced for a
 
02:08:04.189 --> 02:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
public hearing that includes all of that
 
02:08:06.149 --> 02:08:06.159 align:start position:0%
as a discussion
 
02:08:09.030 --> 02:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
so again I I do agree it's it it should
 
02:08:11.950 --> 02:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
not be a grievance against one town it
 
02:08:14.430 --> 02:08:14.440 align:start position:0%
should it's I mean that's just the law
 
02:08:16.229 --> 02:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
that has to happen so I don't understand
 
02:08:18.189 --> 02:08:18.199 align:start position:0%
what's not being followed thank
 
02:08:21.910 --> 02:08:21.920 align:start position:0%

02:08:39.669 --> 02:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
fair to change a law for the entire
 
02:08:42.470 --> 02:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
state for a problem that has to be
 
02:08:42.480 --> 02:08:46.030 align:start position:0%
state for a problem that has to be
solved

02:08:46.030 --> 02:08:46.040 align:start position:0%

colleague representative Gilman for
 
02:08:59.229 --> 02:08:59.239 align:start position:0%
reminding me in our opinion and it has
 
02:09:01.350 --> 02:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
been the opinion of this committee for
 
02:09:03.270 --> 02:09:03.280 align:start position:0%
as many years as I have had the
 
02:09:05.589 --> 02:09:05.599 align:start position:0%
privilege of serving on it that we do
 
02:09:09.189 --> 02:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
not make state law that only applies to
 
02:09:11.270 --> 02:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
individual towns or certain
 
02:09:13.950 --> 02:09:13.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities that is not what voters
 
02:09:16.750 --> 02:09:16.760 align:start position:0%
sent us here to do and it is not what we
 
02:09:19.830 --> 02:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
should be doing further
 
02:09:23.350 --> 02:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
comments representative lward is
 
02:09:25.629 --> 02:09:25.639 align:start position:0%
recognized yes I just want to State for
 
02:09:29.149 --> 02:09:29.159 align:start position:0%
the record that I use that as an
 
02:09:32.830 --> 02:09:32.840 align:start position:0%
example and that I have heard from
 
02:09:36.709 --> 02:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
numerous towns
 
02:09:39.350 --> 02:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
people um
 
02:09:42.430 --> 02:09:42.440 align:start position:0%
of what I can only call
 
02:09:42.440 --> 02:09:44.030 align:start position:0%
of what I can only call
Shenanigans

02:09:44.030 --> 02:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
Shenanigans
 
02:09:46.589 --> 02:09:46.599 align:start position:0%
to keep the
 
02:09:46.599 --> 02:09:48.750 align:start position:0%
to keep the
people

02:09:48.750 --> 02:09:48.760 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:09:51.950 --> 02:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
oppressed and so again I just use that
 
02:09:56.149 --> 02:09:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:01.549 --> 02:10:01.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:04.790 --> 02:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
comments I'd like to make one comment
 
02:10:07.470 --> 02:10:07.480 align:start position:0%
the the bill as amended absolutely
 
02:10:10.870 --> 02:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
upholds and maintains that
 
02:10:13.310 --> 02:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
any oblig
 
02:10:17.229 --> 02:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
obligations required by law are
 
02:10:20.069 --> 02:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
supported in the default budget and
 
02:10:26.350 --> 02:10:26.360 align:start position:0%
secondly I would like to state that I do
 
02:10:28.629 --> 02:10:28.639 align:start position:0%
agree with representative stavis that it
 
02:10:32.350 --> 02:10:32.360 align:start position:0%
is completely inappropriate to be
 
02:10:37.549 --> 02:10:37.559 align:start position:0%
passing legislation that pertains to a
 
02:10:42.830 --> 02:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
single individual or or a single um
 
02:10:45.350 --> 02:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
situation that being
 
02:10:48.910 --> 02:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
said this bill before
 
02:10:54.589 --> 02:10:54.599 align:start position:0%
us pertains to default budgets under sb2
 
02:10:58.229 --> 02:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
the official ballot referendum form of
 
02:10:58.239 --> 02:10:59.229 align:start position:0%
the official ballot referendum form of
town

02:10:59.229 --> 02:10:59.239 align:start position:0%
town
 
02:11:03.109 --> 02:11:03.119 align:start position:0%
meetings and to be clear there are
 
02:11:07.910 --> 02:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
numerous towns and school districts with
 
02:11:09.750 --> 02:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
spb2 and
 
02:11:13.350 --> 02:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
therefore this legislation before us
 
02:11:16.790 --> 02:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
pertains to legislation that is
 
02:11:21.950 --> 02:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
currently on the books in the state and
 
02:11:26.790 --> 02:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
moreover it pertains to
 
02:11:31.470 --> 02:11:31.480 align:start position:0%
many towns and school districts with
 
02:11:35.390 --> 02:11:35.400 align:start position:0%

Statewide

02:11:47.310 --> 02:11:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:55.750 --> 02:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:58.510 --> 02:11:58.520 align:start position:0%
I would have a further comment um I
 
02:12:02.950 --> 02:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
support this bill with Amendment because
 
02:12:06.430 --> 02:12:06.440 align:start position:0%
this bill closes numerous
 
02:12:10.069 --> 02:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
loopholes and IT addresses the the
 
02:12:11.950 --> 02:12:11.960 align:start position:0%
deficiencies and problems with the
 
02:12:16.069 --> 02:12:16.079 align:start position:0%
default budget and the purpose of a
 
02:12:19.270 --> 02:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
default budget as compared to the um
 
02:12:22.270 --> 02:12:22.280 align:start position:0%
proposed budget a default budget is
 
02:12:26.149 --> 02:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
supposed to be a more Bare Bones basic
 
02:12:28.950 --> 02:12:28.960 align:start position:0%
budget so for those reasons I support
 
02:12:35.229 --> 02:12:35.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:35.239 --> 02:12:38.830 align:start position:0%

amendment I think that covers it thank
 
02:18:46.910 --> 02:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
you is there are there further
 
02:18:52.309 --> 02:18:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:53.669 --> 02:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairwoman I'm hoping to
 
02:18:56.230 --> 02:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
get some clarification um throughout the
 
02:18:58.230 --> 02:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
rest of this on all petition warant
 
02:19:01.469 --> 02:19:01.479 align:start position:0%
articles it gives the length of time is
 
02:19:03.469 --> 02:19:03.479 align:start position:0%
um I I can't find exactly but the length
 
02:19:06.990 --> 02:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
the longest length of if any other um
 
02:19:08.669 --> 02:19:08.679 align:start position:0%
article is being presented that it gives
 
02:19:10.389 --> 02:19:10.399 align:start position:0%
them the longest the same length of time
 
02:19:12.429 --> 02:19:12.439 align:start position:0%
as the longest but yet for zoning it's
 
02:19:14.150 --> 02:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
only 10 minutes why are we making a
 
02:19:15.669 --> 02:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
differentiation rather than saying 10
 
02:19:23.509 --> 02:19:23.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:27.990 --> 02:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
I did not write the language for items 1
 
02:19:31.190 --> 02:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
through 4 the amended language for items
 
02:19:32.469 --> 02:19:32.479 align:start position:0%
1 through
 
02:19:37.509 --> 02:19:37.519 align:start position:0%
4 and so a minimum of 10 minutes um
 
02:19:41.309 --> 02:19:41.319 align:start position:0%
seems reasonable as opposed to 3 minutes
 
02:19:43.270 --> 02:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
that you know some people seem to think
 
02:19:51.190 --> 02:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:54.230 --> 02:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
can I just have a quick
 
02:19:54.240 --> 02:19:59.150 align:start position:0%
can I just have a quick
followup

02:19:59.150 --> 02:19:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:03.429 --> 02:20:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:03.439 --> 02:20:05.670 align:start position:0%
 
could

02:20:05.670 --> 02:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:20:08.990 --> 02:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
yes um the clarification I'm looking for
 
02:20:12.550 --> 02:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
is uh for a petition warrant article in
 
02:20:14.510 --> 02:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
other instances they're given a long
 
02:20:16.830 --> 02:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
long length of time
 
02:20:18.950 --> 02:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
potentially but the zoning is only 10
 
02:20:20.150 --> 02:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
minutes so yes I agree with you 3
 
02:20:23.270 --> 02:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
minutes is not enough I I get the 10 but
 
02:20:25.670 --> 02:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
we're differentiating a different amount
 
02:20:27.110 --> 02:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
of time for each group and I'm just
 
02:20:31.389 --> 02:20:31.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:34.429 --> 02:20:34.439 align:start position:0%
category I I'll respond to to to your
 
02:20:36.230 --> 02:20:36.240 align:start position:0%
inquiries with regards to to the
 
02:20:36.240 --> 02:20:39.950 align:start position:0%
inquiries with regards to to the
amendment

02:20:39.950 --> 02:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:42.309 --> 02:20:42.319 align:start position:0%
um what we're the section that we're
 
02:20:45.270 --> 02:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
looking at here right now has to do with
 
02:20:47.950 --> 02:20:47.960 align:start position:0%
um a hearing which is very different
 
02:20:53.030 --> 02:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
than an annual meeting and and therefore
 
02:20:56.590 --> 02:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
um the structure and and what occurs is
 
02:21:02.550 --> 02:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
is different so that is why um the 10
 
02:21:05.190 --> 02:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
minutes at least 10 minutes it doesn't
 
02:21:07.230 --> 02:21:07.240 align:start position:0%
mean that the that the individual needs
 
02:21:10.190 --> 02:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
to utilize the 10 minutes so that's
 
02:21:11.349 --> 02:21:11.359 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
02:21:14.710 --> 02:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
that's that's why that's different um
 
02:21:17.950 --> 02:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
than the bill as as referred to the
 
02:21:22.230 --> 02:21:22.240 align:start position:0%

02:21:25.389 --> 02:21:25.399 align:start position:0%

all but I do expect somebody to speak to
 
02:25:03.870 --> 02:25:03.880 align:start position:0%

thank you representative majori would
 
02:30:25.790 --> 02:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to your
 
02:30:29.870 --> 02:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
motion yes well given that um I'm a
 
02:30:31.269 --> 02:30:31.279 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor on this there was a time
 
02:30:32.750 --> 02:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
where I thought this was a great bill
 
02:30:34.710 --> 02:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
that continues through today and I do
 
02:30:36.830 --> 02:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
think that it makes perfect sense to
 
02:30:38.510 --> 02:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
include Public Works
 
02:30:43.309 --> 02:30:43.319 align:start position:0%
facilities um in um for impact fees uh
 
02:30:45.389 --> 02:30:45.399 align:start position:0%
and I think of my own Community where
 
02:30:48.309 --> 02:30:48.319 align:start position:0%
that Public Works facility is on a Town
 
02:30:50.870 --> 02:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
border um and is going to be renovated
 
02:30:53.670 --> 02:30:53.680 align:start position:0%
and sits on a considerable piece of land
 
02:30:56.349 --> 02:30:56.359 align:start position:0%
uh I think considering considering
 
02:30:59.469 --> 02:30:59.479 align:start position:0%
impact fees is very logical so for that
 
02:31:02.030 --> 02:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
reason I support the Bill thank you
 
02:31:05.110 --> 02:31:05.120 align:start position:0%

France is recognized for a motion yes
 
03:35:51.469 --> 03:35:51.479 align:start position:0%

03:35:54.680 --> 03:35:54.690 align:start position:0%
amendment number uh
 
03:35:54.690 --> 03:36:03.750 align:start position:0%
amendment number uh

France would you like to speak to your
[Music]

03:36:12.790 --> 03:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:17.429 --> 03:36:17.439 align:start position:0%
motion I I think this amendment is is
 
03:36:21.110 --> 03:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
just very simple um it's taking it gives
 
03:36:21.120 --> 03:36:22.269 align:start position:0%
just very simple um it's taking it gives
the

03:36:22.269 --> 03:36:22.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:36:25.229 --> 03:36:25.239 align:start position:0%
town um the opportunity to take money
 
03:36:27.229 --> 03:36:27.239 align:start position:0%
that they've appropriated to a
 
03:36:29.510 --> 03:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission or a forestry
 
03:36:32.150 --> 03:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
committee um it can be offered if
 
03:36:34.269 --> 03:36:34.279 align:start position:0%
there's a surplus in the account at the
 
03:36:36.269 --> 03:36:36.279 align:start position:0%
end of a period it can be offered back
 
03:36:40.469 --> 03:36:40.479 align:start position:0%
to the town to accept and put into their
 
03:36:43.189 --> 03:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
uh unreserved fund balance um which is a
 
03:36:44.630 --> 03:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
lot better than going into a general
 
03:36:46.429 --> 03:36:46.439 align:start position:0%
fund for sure
 
03:36:48.550 --> 03:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
and it's totally optional so I think
 
03:36:51.229 --> 03:36:51.239 align:start position:0%
it's a a good amendment is there any
 
03:36:54.469 --> 03:36:54.479 align:start position:0%
discussion or comments on
 
03:36:57.269 --> 03:36:57.279 align:start position:0%
this representative majority is
 
03:36:59.469 --> 03:36:59.479 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you madam chairwoman
 
03:37:03.510 --> 03:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
and I I I do believe I I like where this
 
03:37:05.070 --> 03:37:05.080 align:start position:0%
is trying to go and I want to get there
 
03:37:07.389 --> 03:37:07.399 align:start position:0%
my question is on line 14 we say a
 
03:37:10.189 --> 03:37:10.199 align:start position:0%
conservation committee and I and I
 
03:37:12.309 --> 03:37:12.319 align:start position:0%
believe that needs to say Conservation
 
03:37:13.510 --> 03:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
Commission I don't think there's
 
03:37:16.229 --> 03:37:16.239 align:start position:0%
anything as a conservation
 
03:37:19.349 --> 03:37:19.359 align:start position:0%
committee so it's actually a question a
 
03:37:21.550 --> 03:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
general question is that something that
 
03:37:23.030 --> 03:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
if we accept the
 
03:37:26.550 --> 03:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
amendment can be can be changed uh
 
03:37:28.429 --> 03:37:28.439 align:start position:0%
administratively or would there need to
 
03:37:30.670 --> 03:37:30.680 align:start position:0%
be an amendment if that is true that it
 
03:37:33.990 --> 03:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
needs to be commission rather than
 
03:37:36.189 --> 03:37:36.199 align:start position:0%
committee thank you representative
 
03:37:41.150 --> 03:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
majority um when when you ask if it can
 
03:37:44.429 --> 03:37:44.439 align:start position:0%
well first of all we know that this was
 
03:37:46.110 --> 03:37:46.120 align:start position:0%
drafted by ol
 
03:37:49.349 --> 03:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
so it it appears to be that that is
 
03:37:54.830 --> 03:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
um an oversight in in the wording so um
 
03:38:00.750 --> 03:38:00.760 align:start position:0%
as to the ability to Simply um make that
 
03:38:03.710 --> 03:38:03.720 align:start position:0%
change between now and when it goes to
 
03:38:10.150 --> 03:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:14.910 --> 03:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
um could you know here in the house we
 
03:38:17.229 --> 03:38:17.239 align:start position:0%
the other chamber has the ability
 
03:38:19.670 --> 03:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
through their their house rules to to do
 
03:38:21.950 --> 03:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
what you're exactly what you're asking I
 
03:38:24.469 --> 03:38:24.479 align:start position:0%
am unaware of the ability in the house
 
03:38:26.990 --> 03:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
to do that okay I've
 
03:38:30.469 --> 03:38:30.479 align:start position:0%
um may be something that's that's like
 
03:38:32.590 --> 03:38:32.600 align:start position:0%
latent hidden that I don't know about
 
03:38:35.910 --> 03:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
but um I've never never seen it but what
 
03:38:39.630 --> 03:38:39.640 align:start position:0%
I would like to um offer or suggest is
 
03:38:42.710 --> 03:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
that if this bill were to go forward and
 
03:38:46.670 --> 03:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
were to go over to the other chamber um
 
03:38:50.110 --> 03:38:50.120 align:start position:0%
the it certainly could be amended over
 
03:38:54.710 --> 03:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
there and it it should be thank you
 
03:38:54.720 --> 03:38:56.790 align:start position:0%
there and it it should be thank you
further

03:38:56.790 --> 03:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
further
 
03:38:59.550 --> 03:38:59.560 align:start position:0%
comments representative
 
03:39:02.990 --> 03:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
Colby um thank you madam chair uh during
 
03:39:03.000 --> 03:39:03.830 align:start position:0%
Colby um thank you madam chair uh during
the

03:39:03.830 --> 03:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:39:06.389 --> 03:39:06.399 align:start position:0%
presentation um I and and I'm still
 
03:39:10.030 --> 03:39:10.040 align:start position:0%
confused as to
 
03:39:12.389 --> 03:39:12.399 align:start position:0%
why they would be
 
03:39:15.990 --> 03:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
unable they being a town Forest
 
03:39:20.469 --> 03:39:20.479 align:start position:0%
committee would be unable to do this
 
03:39:22.990 --> 03:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
um because it seems like the statute
 
03:39:25.550 --> 03:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
already reads that they should be able
 
03:39:29.349 --> 03:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
to and if for some reason a personal or
 
03:39:32.189 --> 03:39:32.199 align:start position:0%
not a personal but uh in in the case of
 
03:39:34.389 --> 03:39:34.399 align:start position:0%
the town of arrel uh which we heard
 
03:39:34.399 --> 03:39:35.410 align:start position:0%
the town of arrel uh which we heard
about

03:39:35.410 --> 03:39:35.420 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:39:35.420 --> 03:39:36.630 align:start position:0%
about
[Music]

03:39:36.630 --> 03:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:39:40.429 --> 03:39:40.439 align:start position:0%
um generally this is done with
 
03:39:42.590 --> 03:39:42.600 align:start position:0%
contacting Town Council uh maybe
 
03:39:45.670 --> 03:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
reaching out to nhma creating a warrant
 
03:39:48.870 --> 03:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
article that dissolves their current
 
03:39:52.910 --> 03:39:52.920 align:start position:0%
fund um appropriating the money into the
 
03:39:55.750 --> 03:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
general fund or unexpended fund balance
 
03:39:58.670 --> 03:39:58.680 align:start position:0%
um and then reestablishing a new process
 
03:40:00.389 --> 03:40:00.399 align:start position:0%
that better suits their needs I feel
 
03:40:04.030 --> 03:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
like there's already there's already a
 
03:40:06.750 --> 03:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
mechanism available and I could be
 
03:40:08.910 --> 03:40:08.920 align:start position:0%
mistaken but I I can see nothing in the
 
03:40:11.750 --> 03:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
current statute that would
 
03:40:17.229 --> 03:40:17.239 align:start position:0%
prevent them from doing this um
 
03:40:19.550 --> 03:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
um and then I just have concerns that it
 
03:40:22.229 --> 03:40:22.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't Set uh out any mechanics as to
 
03:40:25.150 --> 03:40:25.160 align:start position:0%
how um the forestry committee would
 
03:40:27.429 --> 03:40:27.439 align:start position:0%
officially decide to offer the
 
03:40:31.030 --> 03:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
Surplus um there's no official vote
 
03:40:34.309 --> 03:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
that's taken it's just an arbitrary
 
03:40:36.469 --> 03:40:36.479 align:start position:0%
offer and then I would ask that people
 
03:40:39.389 --> 03:40:39.399 align:start position:0%
do keep in mind that even if the
 
03:40:39.399 --> 03:40:40.630 align:start position:0%
do keep in mind that even if the
governing

03:40:40.630 --> 03:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
governing
 
03:40:44.349 --> 03:40:44.359 align:start position:0%
body is allocated These funds they are
 
03:40:45.950 --> 03:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
not obligated
 
03:40:49.550 --> 03:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
to use this offered Surplus
 
03:40:52.189 --> 03:40:52.199 align:start position:0%
through this particular
 
03:40:56.630 --> 03:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
bill um to offset property taxes with
 
03:41:00.349 --> 03:41:00.359 align:start position:0%
the money um so there's no obligation by
 
03:41:04.150 --> 03:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
the governing body to do that within the
 
03:41:06.710 --> 03:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
bill representative
 
03:41:10.229 --> 03:41:10.239 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you madam chair in addition

raised I am looking at the RSA that this
 
03:41:21.389 --> 03:41:21.399 align:start position:0%
bill seeks to amend which is RSA 31

03:41:31.269 --> 03:41:31.279 align:start position:0%
further
 
03:41:33.429 --> 03:41:33.439 align:start position:0%
comments represented
 
03:41:36.510 --> 03:41:36.520 align:start position:0%
majori thank you madam chairwoman again
 
03:41:38.429 --> 03:41:38.439 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure if it would be
 
03:41:39.990 --> 03:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate or inappropriate or even
 
03:41:41.309 --> 03:41:41.319 align:start position:0%
accept it but I was speaking with the
 
03:41:43.149 --> 03:41:43.159 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of the bill and the prime
 
03:41:45.389 --> 03:41:45.399 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the amendment
 
03:41:48.349 --> 03:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
and if I at lunch and if I understood
 
03:41:48.359 --> 03:41:49.349 align:start position:0%
and if I at lunch and if I understood
him

03:41:49.349 --> 03:41:49.359 align:start position:0%
him
 
03:41:51.910 --> 03:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
correctly and I would be wondering of
 
03:41:54.149 --> 03:41:54.159 align:start position:0%
the of the chair if it would be okay for
 
03:41:57.990 --> 03:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
him to speak but that that Council said
 
03:42:01.110 --> 03:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
they need this language in order to do
 
03:42:03.070 --> 03:42:03.080 align:start position:0%
what they want to do because they went
 
03:42:04.309 --> 03:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
down all the
 
03:42:07.110 --> 03:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
Avenues that they tried to and they were
 
03:42:09.269 --> 03:42:09.279 align:start position:0%
told you can't unless you have this
 
03:42:11.550 --> 03:42:11.560 align:start position:0%
language even though it seems like they
 
03:42:14.349 --> 03:42:14.359 align:start position:0%
can and and I don't know I I don't know
 
03:42:17.469 --> 03:42:17.479 align:start position:0%
that I'm quoting the the uh the sponsor
 
03:42:19.750 --> 03:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
correctly so I and I like I said I don't
 
03:42:22.030 --> 03:42:22.040 align:start position:0%
know if it would be permissible to have
 
03:42:25.070 --> 03:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
the sponsor respond to
 
03:42:29.590 --> 03:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
that thank you representative um
 
03:42:32.910 --> 03:42:32.920 align:start position:0%
normally individuals don't provide input
 
03:42:34.309 --> 03:42:34.319 align:start position:0%
at executive
 
03:42:37.630 --> 03:42:37.640 align:start position:0%
sessions but um due to the fact that
 
03:42:40.469 --> 03:42:40.479 align:start position:0%
there's um some confusion with regards
 
03:42:43.830 --> 03:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
to this uh Amendment and I do see the
 
03:42:46.990 --> 03:42:47.000 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor here I will um permit the
 
03:42:48.870 --> 03:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor
 
03:42:52.469 --> 03:42:52.479 align:start position:0%
to um respond to your
 
03:42:56.710 --> 03:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:01.149 --> 03:43:01.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:03.830 --> 03:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
Davis yes thank you madam chair and
 
03:43:06.149 --> 03:43:06.159 align:start position:0%
thank you representative majori majori
 
03:43:09.229 --> 03:43:09.239 align:start position:0%
for uh allowing me to asking me to speak
 
03:43:12.910 --> 03:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
here um I I honestly it's above my pay
 
03:43:15.590 --> 03:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
grade to know why this can't be done
 
03:43:18.710 --> 03:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
simply I read it the same way you do in
 
03:43:20.790 --> 03:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
the town
 
03:43:23.510 --> 03:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh I believe that was a clerical error
 
03:43:25.349 --> 03:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
as well from OS put not putting
 
03:43:29.790 --> 03:43:29.800 align:start position:0%
commission I I overlook that as well but
 
03:43:32.030 --> 03:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
talking with the the forestry Committee
 
03:43:34.830 --> 03:43:34.840 align:start position:0%
in arrol they've they've tried several
 
03:43:38.389 --> 03:43:38.399 align:start position:0%
times all these different Avenues Dr
 
03:43:40.429 --> 03:43:40.439 align:start position:0%
tells them if you know they they put in
 
03:43:41.870 --> 03:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
their request and they give them the
 
03:43:44.149 --> 03:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
ability to yes or no you can spend it
 
03:43:47.229 --> 03:43:47.239 align:start position:0%
for that the three things their Forest
 
03:43:50.469 --> 03:43:50.479 align:start position:0%
is set up for buying more land which
 
03:43:52.189 --> 03:43:52.199 align:start position:0%
they have 8,500 Acres they're not
 
03:43:54.389 --> 03:43:54.399 align:start position:0%
interested in buying more maintaining
 
03:43:56.349 --> 03:43:56.359 align:start position:0%
their land and they do that they do that
 
03:43:58.469 --> 03:43:58.479 align:start position:0%
at a very high level and the other one
 
03:44:00.389 --> 03:44:00.399 align:start position:0%
they can spend it in the town as long as
 
03:44:04.590 --> 03:44:04.600 align:start position:0%
it has something to do with with helping
 
03:44:06.110 --> 03:44:06.120 align:start position:0%
their Forest like one year they bought a
 
03:44:08.830 --> 03:44:08.840 align:start position:0%
fire truck for the town now they do
 
03:44:11.389 --> 03:44:11.399 align:start position:0%
timber Harvest annually and that money's
 
03:44:13.389 --> 03:44:13.399 align:start position:0%
accumulating and they have no place to
 
03:44:15.950 --> 03:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
spend it and the ENT of this from the
 
03:44:18.229 --> 03:44:18.239 align:start position:0%
beginning was once they got to this
 
03:44:20.269 --> 03:44:20.279 align:start position:0%
point they would like to use some of
 
03:44:22.229 --> 03:44:22.239 align:start position:0%
that money for tax relief they need to
 
03:44:25.309 --> 03:44:25.319 align:start position:0%
keep certain amount in their account to
 
03:44:27.110 --> 03:44:27.120 align:start position:0%
maintain their forest or if something
 
03:44:30.349 --> 03:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
comes up like that but any
 
03:44:32.830 --> 03:44:32.840 align:start position:0%
surplus this would allow either that
 
03:44:35.550 --> 03:44:35.560 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission or the forestry
 
03:44:37.990 --> 03:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
committee to if they deem there is a
 
03:44:39.910 --> 03:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
surplus they can offer it to the select
 
03:44:42.830 --> 03:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
board to put in a warrant article that
 
03:44:44.469 --> 03:44:44.479 align:start position:0%
the legislative body which would be the
 
03:44:47.149 --> 03:44:47.159 align:start position:0%
town at a town meeting would vote to put
 
03:44:50.469 --> 03:44:50.479 align:start position:0%
that into the uh into this fund that
 
03:44:53.349 --> 03:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
they could spend the money on so and it
 
03:44:54.710 --> 03:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
would create tax
 
03:44:57.389 --> 03:44:57.399 align:start position:0%
relief so the there's checks and
 
03:44:59.950 --> 03:44:59.960 align:start position:0%
balances all the way through I I can I
 
03:45:01.229 --> 03:45:01.239 align:start position:0%
mean I don't know all the procedes
 
03:45:03.710 --> 03:45:03.720 align:start position:0%
either I can check with the clerk but uh
 
03:45:05.550 --> 03:45:05.560 align:start position:0%
if this if that committee could be
 
03:45:08.030 --> 03:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
changed to community commission a
 
03:45:10.389 --> 03:45:10.399 align:start position:0%
Conservation Commission in the Senate I
 
03:45:13.630 --> 03:45:13.640 align:start position:0%
would be all over that
 
03:45:16.870 --> 03:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh but other than that I I've been to Dr
 
03:45:18.990 --> 03:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
myself myself reading that I said well
 
03:45:20.149 --> 03:45:20.159 align:start position:0%
it looks
 
03:45:22.710 --> 03:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
like you're able to do it it looks like
 
03:45:24.670 --> 03:45:24.680 align:start position:0%
you could spend the money anyway you
 
03:45:26.710 --> 03:45:26.720 align:start position:0%
want but it doesn't I I see it different
 
03:45:30.429 --> 03:45:30.439 align:start position:0%
than the attorneys and so I asked uh his
 
03:45:32.790 --> 03:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
name is Adam denor at Dr what what would
 
03:45:35.429 --> 03:45:35.439 align:start position:0%
I need to make this work for this town
 
03:45:36.870 --> 03:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
and he said well you need this some kind
 
03:45:38.429 --> 03:45:38.439 align:start position:0%
of language like this and then I worked
 
03:45:41.590 --> 03:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
with the chair to tweak it a little bit
 
03:45:45.950 --> 03:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
and and this is what we came up with uh
 
03:45:47.510 --> 03:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
what the problem's going to be is you'll
 
03:45:49.870 --> 03:45:49.880 align:start position:0%
have some towns are set up differently
 
03:45:51.630 --> 03:45:51.640 align:start position:0%
like the town that I live
 
03:45:55.269 --> 03:45:55.279 align:start position:0%
in I don't ask me why I'm I'm not a I I
 
03:45:57.790 --> 03:45:57.800 align:start position:0%
cut wood myself so I'm not
 
03:46:00.550 --> 03:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
a a college educated or anything like
 
03:46:04.070 --> 03:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
that but I I do not know why they they
 
03:46:06.149 --> 03:46:06.159 align:start position:0%
can't do it when I read the RSA it looks
 
03:46:08.309 --> 03:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
like sure that's acceptable but they
 
03:46:10.349 --> 03:46:10.359 align:start position:0%
told me no it had the language has to be
 
03:46:12.309 --> 03:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
changed so that it gives them the
 
03:46:18.309 --> 03:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:20.910 --> 03:46:20.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Davis you
 
03:46:23.630 --> 03:46:23.640 align:start position:0%
addressed you addressed um
 
03:46:26.349 --> 03:46:26.359 align:start position:0%
representative majority's question this
 
03:46:29.389 --> 03:46:29.399 align:start position:0%
is not a hearing this is an ex no not
 
03:46:32.630 --> 03:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
you it's for these people over here this
 
03:46:34.710 --> 03:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
is not a hearing it's an executive
 
03:46:37.630 --> 03:46:37.640 align:start position:0%
session so the representative Davis will
 
03:46:39.910 --> 03:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
not take further
 
03:46:43.950 --> 03:46:43.960 align:start position:0%
questions um I'm assuming that you here
 
03:46:45.550 --> 03:46:45.560 align:start position:0%
have comments with with regards to the
 
03:46:49.189 --> 03:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
bill correct so the chair will recognize
 
03:46:49.199 --> 03:46:50.870 align:start position:0%
bill correct so the chair will recognize
representative

03:46:50.870 --> 03:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:46:53.269 --> 03:46:53.279 align:start position:0%
Murphy thank you madam
 
03:46:56.750 --> 03:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
chair since this is an unapproved uh
 
03:46:59.229 --> 03:46:59.239 align:start position:0%
Amendment why can't we change the one
 
03:47:02.229 --> 03:47:02.239 align:start position:0%
word from committee to commission since
 
03:47:05.269 --> 03:47:05.279 align:start position:0%
it's unapproved already just a question
 
03:47:07.990 --> 03:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
you know so representative Murphy that
 
03:47:11.550 --> 03:47:11.560 align:start position:0%
is not how things work here in the house
 
03:47:14.950 --> 03:47:14.960 align:start position:0%
we request drafts ahead of the executive
 
03:47:18.630 --> 03:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
session OSS drafts an amendment in its
 
03:47:21.830 --> 03:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
unapproved language there is no time
 
03:47:25.469 --> 03:47:25.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:27.950 --> 03:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
03:47:31.870 --> 03:47:31.880 align:start position:0%
stavis would you agree with with with
 
03:47:31.880 --> 03:47:34.830 align:start position:0%
stavis would you agree with with with
this

03:47:34.830 --> 03:47:34.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:47:37.790 --> 03:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair I actually have
 
03:47:41.630 --> 03:47:41.640 align:start position:0%
been in exec sessions where someone has
 
03:47:45.229 --> 03:47:45.239 align:start position:0%
fed an amendment to OS and request a
 
03:47:49.469 --> 03:47:49.479 align:start position:0%
change so uh so I I
 
03:47:51.670 --> 03:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
respectfully I've not I've had the
 
03:47:54.750 --> 03:47:54.760 align:start position:0%
experience where an emergency change has
 
03:47:56.990 --> 03:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
been made but I'm not saying that's
 
03:47:58.630 --> 03:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate in this case I'm just saying
 
03:48:02.429 --> 03:48:02.439 align:start position:0%
I have had that experience just
 
03:48:07.149 --> 03:48:07.159 align:start position:0%
so with respect to the ranking member I
 
03:48:09.110 --> 03:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
I completely agree with that and I did
 
03:48:11.710 --> 03:48:11.720 align:start position:0%
not want to make an executive decision
 
03:48:14.349 --> 03:48:14.359 align:start position:0%
that we would do exactly what you had
 
03:48:14.359 --> 03:48:15.269 align:start position:0%
that we would do exactly what you had
just

03:48:15.269 --> 03:48:15.279 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:48:18.349 --> 03:48:18.359 align:start position:0%
um outlined
 
03:48:22.910 --> 03:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
without discussion so I I would be fine
 
03:48:26.269 --> 03:48:26.279 align:start position:0%
with that if that would um satisfy the
 
03:48:28.229 --> 03:48:28.239 align:start position:0%
the concerns with regards to the
 
03:48:28.239 --> 03:48:31.630 align:start position:0%
the concerns with regards to the
amendment

03:48:31.630 --> 03:48:31.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:31.640 --> 03:48:33.189 align:start position:0%
 
we

03:48:33.189 --> 03:48:33.199 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:48:37.269 --> 03:48:37.279 align:start position:0%
um we we could certainly um do
 
03:48:40.389 --> 03:48:40.399 align:start position:0%
that representive stavis sorry you
 
03:48:41.790 --> 03:48:41.800 align:start position:0%
opened the
 
03:48:45.110 --> 03:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
door but um if we did do that then I
 
03:48:45.120 --> 03:48:46.030 align:start position:0%
door but um if we did do that then I
would

03:48:46.030 --> 03:48:46.040 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:48:49.910 --> 03:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
request in line 17 that the word shall
 
03:48:52.710 --> 03:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
be changed to
 
03:48:55.990 --> 03:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
May the governing body should not be
 
03:48:58.429 --> 03:48:58.439 align:start position:0%
required to accept the
 
03:49:01.670 --> 03:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
Surplus If This truly is enabling that
 
03:49:04.110 --> 03:49:04.120 align:start position:0%
should be May so if we look at the
 
03:49:07.110 --> 03:49:07.120 align:start position:0%
amendment on line 15 it says with
 
03:49:09.830 --> 03:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
regards to the surface the committee may
 
03:49:12.550 --> 03:49:12.560 align:start position:0%
offer may offer the Surplus it's not
 
03:49:15.309 --> 03:49:15.319 align:start position:0%
saying the committee shall offer for the
 
03:49:18.070 --> 03:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
Surplus and I think to I was referring
 
03:49:21.349 --> 03:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
to I'm getting there okay and so with
 
03:49:23.870 --> 03:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
regards to I think representative Colby
 
03:49:28.670 --> 03:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
had had asked a question with regards to
 
03:49:33.510 --> 03:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
um the procedure so lines 16 and 17 says
 
03:49:37.070 --> 03:49:37.080 align:start position:0%
that the legislative body shall vote and
 
03:49:41.590 --> 03:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
to me that clearly implies that the the
 
03:49:45.269 --> 03:49:45.279 align:start position:0%
offer of monies will be on warrant
 
03:49:48.950 --> 03:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
article and and and and therefore that
 
03:49:51.429 --> 03:49:51.439 align:start position:0%
it's to be voted upon by the legislative
 
03:49:57.990 --> 03:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:04.990 --> 03:50:05.000 align:start position:0%
funds yes so um I hope that makes I hope
 
03:50:06.990 --> 03:50:07.000 align:start position:0%
I hope that clarifies things for you
 
03:50:09.550 --> 03:50:09.560 align:start position:0%
representative Colby thank you madam
 
03:50:11.990 --> 03:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
chair my question was more in how the
 
03:50:14.750 --> 03:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
how these separate committees are making
 
03:50:18.469 --> 03:50:18.479 align:start position:0%
that determination um you know if you go
 
03:50:21.750 --> 03:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
into a committee meeting and how many
 
03:50:24.189 --> 03:50:24.199 align:start position:0%
are saying yes let's send the Surplus
 
03:50:26.309 --> 03:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
are are we and how are they approving
 
03:50:28.790 --> 03:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
that are they taking a vote in official
 
03:50:31.590 --> 03:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
meeting minutes um and then of course
 
03:50:33.189 --> 03:50:33.199 align:start position:0%
you know down the line the legislative
 
03:50:36.550 --> 03:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
body would either accept or not um
 
03:50:39.389 --> 03:50:39.399 align:start position:0%
representative Colby my response would
 
03:50:41.990 --> 03:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
be yes to all of your statements that
 
03:50:44.149 --> 03:50:44.159 align:start position:0%
would be the procedure that's the normal
 
03:50:44.159 --> 03:50:45.469 align:start position:0%
would be the procedure that's the normal
operating

03:50:45.469 --> 03:50:45.479 align:start position:0%
operating
 
03:50:49.910 --> 03:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:52.309 --> 03:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
committee further comments
 
03:50:52.319 --> 03:50:53.990 align:start position:0%

03:50:53.990 --> 03:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:50:57.910 --> 03:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
Guthrie thank thank you madam chair uh I
 
03:51:01.910 --> 03:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
have a question why on on the amendment
 
03:51:06.189 --> 03:51:06.199 align:start position:0%
why we Chang from the uh general fund to
 
03:51:09.229 --> 03:51:09.239 align:start position:0%
the unreserved fund balance why is it
 
03:51:15.670 --> 03:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:18.750 --> 03:51:18.760 align:start position:0%
it was it was changed to unreserved fund
 
03:51:22.710 --> 03:51:22.720 align:start position:0%
balance to because if the money was put
 
03:51:26.110 --> 03:51:26.120 align:start position:0%
into the general fund then that money
 
03:51:30.070 --> 03:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
could be used for just about anything it
 
03:51:33.550 --> 03:51:33.560 align:start position:0%
would be extra money that that that was
 
03:51:40.229 --> 03:51:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:42.429 --> 03:51:42.439 align:start position:0%
the wasn't
 
03:51:45.149 --> 03:51:45.159 align:start position:0%
specifically part of the of the process
 
03:51:47.590 --> 03:51:47.600 align:start position:0%
and if it went into the unreserved fund
 
03:51:51.630 --> 03:51:51.640 align:start position:0%
balance that it would um more
 
03:51:55.229 --> 03:51:55.239 align:start position:0%
specifically go back to um as a revenue
 
03:51:56.950 --> 03:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
and to defer
 
03:51:59.469 --> 03:51:59.479 align:start position:0%
taxes representative
 
03:52:03.630 --> 03:52:03.640 align:start position:0%
Dolan thank you madam chair if it uh
 
03:52:06.389 --> 03:52:06.399 align:start position:0%
went to the general fund then it can be
 
03:52:09.389 --> 03:52:09.399 align:start position:0%
it could be reallocated by any Town
 
03:52:12.710 --> 03:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
manager Town Administrator whatever uh
 
03:52:14.990 --> 03:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
if it goes to the unreserve fun balance
 
03:52:17.149 --> 03:52:17.159 align:start position:0%
that has to be done by the governing
 
03:52:20.469 --> 03:52:20.479 align:start position:0%
board not just the administrator or
 
03:52:23.229 --> 03:52:23.239 align:start position:0%
manager so I think that's the you split
 
03:52:25.630 --> 03:52:25.640 align:start position:0%
the hairs that's the
 
03:52:27.870 --> 03:52:27.880 align:start position:0%
difference further
 
03:52:29.990 --> 03:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
comments if I could
 
03:52:34.110 --> 03:52:34.120 align:start position:0%
answer Tom commas I agree I I just to me
 
03:52:37.110 --> 03:52:37.120 align:start position:0%
it didn't make any difference whether uh
 
03:52:41.229 --> 03:52:41.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:09.550 --> 03:53:09.560 align:start position:0%

FS you know who is it on the committee
 
03:55:21.149 --> 03:55:21.159 align:start position:0%
that authorizes this transfer of funds I
 
03:55:24.590 --> 03:55:24.600 align:start position:0%
think that's the you have there's got to
 
03:55:27.189 --> 03:55:27.199 align:start position:0%
be some boiler
 
03:55:29.510 --> 03:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
plate so you
 
03:55:31.670 --> 03:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
don't live in the
 
03:55:31.680 --> 03:55:38.070 align:start position:0%
don't live in the
woods

03:55:38.070 --> 03:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:40.389 --> 03:55:40.399 align:start position:0%
live Stephanie yeah do you want me to do
 
03:55:42.429 --> 03:55:42.439 align:start position:0%
that do you have a
 
03:55:54.429 --> 03:55:54.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:56.830 --> 03:55:56.840 align:start position:0%
we're just trying to figure out it's a
 
03:56:00.030 --> 03:56:00.040 align:start position:0%
revolving F so um at this time where're
 
03:56:02.790 --> 03:56:02.800 align:start position:0%
we're we're sorting out a few details so
 
03:56:05.389 --> 03:56:05.399 align:start position:0%
is there a motion to withdraw the a
 
03:56:10.429 --> 03:56:10.439 align:start position:0%
motion to to accept the the
 
03:56:13.110 --> 03:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
amendment I'll make that motion
 
03:56:15.110 --> 03:56:15.120 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald motions to
 
03:56:16.990 --> 03:56:17.000 align:start position:0%
withdraw the motion to accept the
 
03:56:18.790 --> 03:56:18.800 align:start position:0%
amendment is there a
 
03:56:25.389 --> 03:56:25.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:28.229 --> 03:56:28.239 align:start position:0%
that so if you're in favor of
 
03:56:30.750 --> 03:56:30.760 align:start position:0%
withdrawing the current motion so that
 
03:56:34.110 --> 03:56:34.120 align:start position:0%
um we could address the issues that just
 
03:56:37.149 --> 03:56:37.159 align:start position:0%
came up um you'll vote Yes if you're
 
03:56:39.389 --> 03:56:39.399 align:start position:0%

04:07:14.349 --> 04:07:14.359 align:start position:0%
second second
 
04:07:15.910 --> 04:07:15.920 align:start position:0%

second Vice chairman McDonald would you
 
04:07:20.870 --> 04:07:20.880 align:start position:0%

motion yes uh thank you madam chair this
 
04:07:28.429 --> 04:07:28.439 align:start position:0%
would ban uh 5G Towers expansion of 5G
 
04:07:29.790 --> 04:07:29.800 align:start position:0%
in in our local
 
04:07:32.109 --> 04:07:32.119 align:start position:0%
communities I think we all can recognize
 
04:07:34.670 --> 04:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
the uh importance of having uh moving
 
04:07:37.830 --> 04:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
forward with 5G as concerned to uh
 
04:07:41.229 --> 04:07:41.239 align:start position:0%
individuals businesses industry and uh
 
04:07:42.070 --> 04:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
the Improvement of our
 
04:07:42.080 --> 04:07:43.790 align:start position:0%
the Improvement of our
Telecommunications

04:07:43.790 --> 04:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
Telecommunications
 
04:07:46.830 --> 04:07:46.840 align:start position:0%
uh we'll see uh A reduced time it takes
 
04:07:49.590 --> 04:07:49.600 align:start position:0%
for uh our messages to travel across the
 
04:07:51.590 --> 04:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
internet uh we'll have a better
 
04:07:54.469 --> 04:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
bandwidth increase speed and improve
 
04:07:56.109 --> 04:07:56.119 align:start position:0%
coverage throughout our
 
04:07:58.670 --> 04:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
state that's why I'm requesting an itl
 
04:08:01.070 --> 04:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
on this bill which would uh allow the
 
04:08:03.269 --> 04:08:03.279 align:start position:0%
communities to ban this uh technology
 
04:08:07.590 --> 04:08:07.600 align:start position:0%
thank you further comments
 
04:08:10.670 --> 04:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
discussion representative majori thank
 
04:08:13.030 --> 04:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
you madam chairwoman um we've seen a lot
 
04:08:15.030 --> 04:08:15.040 align:start position:0%
of bills or we have a lot of bills that
 
04:08:16.950 --> 04:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
require empirical evidence I know even
 
04:08:19.349 --> 04:08:19.359 align:start position:0%
in my own Community we see uh warant
 
04:08:21.790 --> 04:08:21.800 align:start position:0%
articles that require or ask for
 
04:08:24.349 --> 04:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
empirical evidence I found that the
 
04:08:27.990 --> 04:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
testimony from Andrew Thatcher um
 
04:08:30.870 --> 04:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
provided the kind of empirical evidence
 
04:08:33.590 --> 04:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
that allows me to support the itl motion
 
04:08:36.429 --> 04:08:36.439 align:start position:0%
he was very thorough and his written
 
04:08:39.229 --> 04:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
testimony was compelling thank you
 
04:08:53.429 --> 04:08:53.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:56.030 --> 04:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
so one of the concerns that I have with
 
04:08:59.269 --> 04:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
regards to this bill as written is that
 
04:09:03.790 --> 04:09:03.800 align:start position:0%
it repeals in its entirety chapter
 
04:09:06.870 --> 04:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
12K entitled deployment of personal
 
04:09:10.070 --> 04:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
wireless service facilities and then it
 
04:09:13.670 --> 04:09:13.680 align:start position:0%
reenacts that entire section with the
 
04:09:15.950 --> 04:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
provisions of of the
 
04:09:15.960 --> 04:09:19.109 align:start position:0%
provisions of of the
bill

04:09:19.109 --> 04:09:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:22.630 --> 04:09:22.640 align:start position:0%
um that's a concern because it removes
 
04:09:25.750 --> 04:09:25.760 align:start position:0%
or repeals the goals and the purposes
 
04:09:25.760 --> 04:09:28.109 align:start position:0%
or repeals the goals and the purposes
the

04:09:28.109 --> 04:09:28.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:30.870 --> 04:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
definitions Wireless Provisions for
 
04:09:32.870 --> 04:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
wireless carriers doing business in the
 
04:09:35.750 --> 04:09:35.760 align:start position:0%
state payments of cost fall zones
 
04:09:38.309 --> 04:09:38.319 align:start position:0%
Regional notification application review
 
04:09:41.830 --> 04:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
and limitations on applications so to me
 
04:09:45.790 --> 04:09:45.800 align:start position:0%
that's that's that that's a big concern
 
04:09:45.800 --> 04:09:49.790 align:start position:0%
that's that's that that's a big concern
and

04:09:49.790 --> 04:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:53.510 --> 04:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
additionally a further concern is that
 
04:09:57.710 --> 04:09:57.720 align:start position:0%
uh we the state needs to follow the
 
04:10:00.149 --> 04:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
Telecommunications Act of
 
04:10:04.229 --> 04:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
1996 so I I'm not really sure what
 
04:10:08.229 --> 04:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
exactly this bill would would be
 
04:10:10.990 --> 04:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
accomplishing so for those reasons I
 
04:10:15.990 --> 04:10:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:18.109 --> 04:10:18.119 align:start position:0%
uh representative Dolan thank you madam
 
04:10:22.910 --> 04:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
chair there is a um there's one El one
 
04:10:25.349 --> 04:10:25.359 align:start position:0%
aspect of these towers that's really
 
04:10:27.429 --> 04:10:27.439 align:start position:0%
non-technical that I'd like to speak to
 
04:10:33.189 --> 04:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
and that is that many uh fire and police
 
04:10:37.030 --> 04:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
entities piggyback on these five Towers
 
04:10:39.189 --> 04:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
because there's so many dead spots in
 
04:10:41.790 --> 04:10:41.800 align:start position:0%
rural areas that we need the height of
 
04:10:44.550 --> 04:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
these of these tow hours in order to
 
04:10:47.349 --> 04:10:47.359 align:start position:0%
further the emergency communications
 
04:10:48.870 --> 04:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
that happened between the fire and
 
04:10:52.309 --> 04:10:52.319 align:start position:0%
police so uh it's so it's not a 5G issue
 
04:10:54.910 --> 04:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
but it's a it's a communication issue to
 
04:10:59.070 --> 04:10:59.080 align:start position:0%
help uh a first responder so in that in
 
04:11:01.149 --> 04:11:01.159 align:start position:0%
that regard I think uh we ought to try
 
04:11:03.670 --> 04:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
to help them uh through through the use
 
04:11:05.349 --> 04:11:05.359 align:start position:0%
of these towers and piggybacking on
 
04:11:09.750 --> 04:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
these towers thank you further
 
04:11:11.910 --> 04:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
comments representative
 
04:11:15.229 --> 04:11:15.239 align:start position:0%
stavis um thank you madam chair and this
 
04:11:18.070 --> 04:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
is not really a technical comment but
 
04:11:22.429 --> 04:11:22.439 align:start position:0%
it's kind of an INT an intent comment um
 
04:11:24.750 --> 04:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
where the the bill title is Municipal
 
04:11:28.070 --> 04:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
control of 5G Towers but really when you
 
04:11:30.670 --> 04:11:30.680 align:start position:0%
read the bill all it does is give
 
04:11:33.189 --> 04:11:33.199 align:start position:0%
municip municipalities the authority to
 
04:11:33.199 --> 04:11:34.349 align:start position:0%
municip municipalities the authority to
deny

04:11:34.349 --> 04:11:34.359 align:start position:0%
deny
 
04:11:36.510 --> 04:11:36.520 align:start position:0%
them there's nothing in the bill that
 
04:11:38.870 --> 04:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
says they have the authority to allow
 
04:11:42.429 --> 04:11:42.439 align:start position:0%
them so it it seems it seems a little
 
04:11:42.439 --> 04:11:44.030 align:start position:0%
them so it it seems it seems a little
bit

04:11:44.030 --> 04:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
bit
 
04:11:47.349 --> 04:11:47.359 align:start position:0%
unbalanced in what it's trying to
 
04:11:50.349 --> 04:11:50.359 align:start position:0%
do maybe the the you know it's just
 
04:11:52.950 --> 04:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
assuming a given conclusion that that
 
04:11:55.349 --> 04:11:55.359 align:start position:0%
voters may not agree
 
04:12:03.950 --> 04:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:07.510 --> 04:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
comments seeing none the motion before
 
04:12:10.429 --> 04:12:10.439 align:start position:0%
us is inexpedient to legislate on House

the house consent calendar because
 
04:13:41.510 --> 04:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
despite the FN it the motion is
 
04:13:44.910 --> 04:13:44.920 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legis L and the majority
 
04:13:47.189 --> 04:13:47.199 align:start position:0%

04:14:23.790 --> 04:14:23.800 align:start position:0%
at this time the chair opens the
 
04:14:26.109 --> 04:14:26.119 align:start position:0%
executive session on House Bill
 
04:14:28.950 --> 04:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
471 establishing a commission to study
 
04:14:31.670 --> 04:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
issues related to growth traffic and
 
04:14:35.070 --> 04:14:35.080 align:start position:0%

04:14:43.550 --> 04:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you madam chair would like
 
04:14:46.229 --> 04:14:46.239 align:start position:0%
to move itl on HB
 
04:14:48.830 --> 04:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
471 the motion is inexpedient to
 
04:14:51.309 --> 04:14:51.319 align:start position:0%
legislate is there a
 
04:14:54.030 --> 04:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
second representative Gilman seconds the
 
04:14:56.309 --> 04:14:56.319 align:start position:0%
motion representative stavis would you
 
04:14:58.429 --> 04:14:58.439 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your motion thank you
 
04:15:01.189 --> 04:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
madam chair yes just a few words um what
 
04:15:03.389 --> 04:15:03.399 align:start position:0%
this uh Bill attempts to do can already
 
04:15:06.910 --> 04:15:06.920 align:start position:0%
be done by Regional planning commissions
 
04:15:10.189 --> 04:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
um it also so it's duplicative and it
 
04:15:12.630 --> 04:15:12.640 align:start position:0%
will cost the state money in other words
 
04:15:15.790 --> 04:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
it will cost taxpayers money and it only
 
04:15:17.990 --> 04:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
applies to a
 
04:15:21.269 --> 04:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
certain grouping of towns and leaves at
 
04:15:24.670 --> 04:15:24.680 align:start position:0%
least one town in that Corridor out for
 
04:15:27.750 --> 04:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
unknown reasons so I believe that it is
 
04:15:31.750 --> 04:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
a badly written Bill and not unnecessary
 
04:15:36.309 --> 04:15:36.319 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you further
 
04:15:38.910 --> 04:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
comments representative Dolan is
 
04:15:41.429 --> 04:15:41.439 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you madam chair in
 
04:15:45.229 --> 04:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
addition I believe we have too many
 
04:15:48.590 --> 04:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
expensive duplicative commissions and
 
04:15:52.630 --> 04:15:52.640 align:start position:0%
committees in the state and this would
 
04:15:55.389 --> 04:15:55.399 align:start position:0%
uh unfortunately add to
 
04:15:59.149 --> 04:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
that thank you further comments
 
04:16:01.710 --> 04:16:01.720 align:start position:0%
representative Gilman is
 
04:16:04.229 --> 04:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you madam chair and
 
04:16:07.269 --> 04:16:07.279 align:start position:0%
this is another bill um it does carve
 
04:16:11.429 --> 04:16:11.439 align:start position:0%
out those towns the surrounding ones are
 
04:16:16.070 --> 04:16:16.080 align:start position:0%
um have some commonalities but it's a
 
04:16:17.630 --> 04:16:17.640 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
04:16:19.550 --> 04:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
specialty um
 
04:16:23.630 --> 04:16:23.640 align:start position:0%
and there were no specialty or experts
 
04:16:26.870 --> 04:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
that um were here to comment or or were
 
04:16:28.950 --> 04:16:28.960 align:start position:0%
here they didn't know about it and they
 
04:16:31.469 --> 04:16:31.479 align:start position:0%
didn't have anything to add to this bill
 
04:16:34.429 --> 04:16:34.439 align:start position:0%
um so I for that that reason that there
 
04:16:37.550 --> 04:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
was no expertise represented that this
 
04:16:41.590 --> 04:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
is a donut of a of a Rockingham
 
04:16:43.550 --> 04:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
Rockingham a planning commission which
 
04:16:47.030 --> 04:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
does help communities with grants and um
 
04:16:50.670 --> 04:16:50.680 align:start position:0%
assistance with the uh writing zoning
 
04:16:53.750 --> 04:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
ordance and transportation plans etc for
 
04:16:55.790 --> 04:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
those purposes I have to vote itl on
 
04:16:55.800 --> 04:16:56.590 align:start position:0%
those purposes I have to vote itl on
this

04:16:56.590 --> 04:16:56.600 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:17:01.149 --> 04:17:01.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:03.389 --> 04:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
discussion I have a few I have a few
 
04:17:05.590 --> 04:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
comments so my understanding of this
 
04:17:10.670 --> 04:17:10.680 align:start position:0%
bill is that it is it would create an an
 
04:17:14.630 --> 04:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
overlay commission to to look look at um
 
04:17:18.630 --> 04:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
the issues that were outlined in the
 
04:17:23.229 --> 04:17:23.239 align:start position:0%
bill so I I do um concur with the with
 
04:17:25.990 --> 04:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
the comments that that were have been
 
04:17:28.309 --> 04:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
have been made thus far but I would like
 
04:17:31.389 --> 04:17:31.399 align:start position:0%
to point out that in the
 
04:17:34.469 --> 04:17:34.479 align:start position:0%
bill on line three it says the
 
04:17:38.349 --> 04:17:38.359 align:start position:0%
commission shall study um solutions for
 
04:17:41.070 --> 04:17:41.080 align:start position:0%
growth traffic and planning so to me
 
04:17:44.590 --> 04:17:44.600 align:start position:0%
that implies for example a traffic study
 
04:17:47.189 --> 04:17:47.199 align:start position:0%
and the question would be where are we
 
04:17:49.510 --> 04:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
getting the money to to conduct that
 
04:17:51.830 --> 04:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
traffic study and when I look at the
 
04:17:55.389 --> 04:17:55.399 align:start position:0%
bill there's no fiscal note so that's
 
04:17:58.550 --> 04:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
seems to me very curious uh I don't know
 
04:18:01.670 --> 04:18:01.680 align:start position:0%
if it was an oversight I don't know I I
 
04:18:04.109 --> 04:18:04.119 align:start position:0%
just don't know how that would be funded
 
04:18:07.510 --> 04:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
and um furthermore it's my understanding
 
04:18:10.309 --> 04:18:10.319 align:start position:0%
with regards to Regional planning
 
04:18:13.429 --> 04:18:13.439 align:start position:0%
commissions that in fact the director of
 
04:18:16.790 --> 04:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
the commissions do do meet so the
 
04:18:21.309 --> 04:18:21.319 align:start position:0%
question that I would have is um why
 
04:18:24.750 --> 04:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
can't these issues be discussed and
 
04:18:30.469 --> 04:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
sorted out um at at that level so to me
 
04:18:32.870 --> 04:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
therefore what this bill is seeking to
 
04:18:36.830 --> 04:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
do can can already be done without
 
04:18:39.670 --> 04:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
standing up um
 
04:18:43.149 --> 04:18:43.159 align:start position:0%
through a stat without setting up or
 
04:18:47.590 --> 04:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
standing up a statutory commission and
 
04:18:50.510 --> 04:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
additionally the concern would be with
 
04:18:52.630 --> 04:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
regards to these commissions it's
 
04:18:54.990 --> 04:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
already difficult to get people to
 
04:18:57.429 --> 04:18:57.439 align:start position:0%
volunteer and to participate in
 
04:19:00.189 --> 04:19:00.199 align:start position:0%
commissions and
 
04:19:03.189 --> 04:19:03.199 align:start position:0%
um for all those reasons I feel this
 
04:19:07.349 --> 04:19:07.359 align:start position:0%
bill is is unnecessary it has problems
 
04:19:15.070 --> 04:19:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:18.189 --> 04:19:18.199 align:start position:0%
seeing none the oh
 
04:19:21.429 --> 04:19:21.439 align:start position:0%
sorry representative Gilman thank you
 
04:19:23.229 --> 04:19:23.239 align:start position:0%
madam chair um I agree with what you've
 
04:19:25.790 --> 04:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
said and I just want to recognize that
 
04:19:27.950 --> 04:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
um some counties are doing this they're
 
04:19:31.870 --> 04:19:31.880 align:start position:0%
collaborating on traffic studies and um
 
04:19:33.670 --> 04:19:33.680 align:start position:0%
uh what are the other
 
04:19:36.149 --> 04:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
ones traffic studies and planning and
 
04:19:38.229 --> 04:19:38.239 align:start position:0%
land use and and working with the
 
04:19:40.550 --> 04:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
communities that lie within their Comm
 
04:19:44.269 --> 04:19:44.279 align:start position:0%
lie within their region um to answer
 
04:19:46.910 --> 04:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
those questions regionally so not each
 
04:19:49.349 --> 04:19:49.359 align:start position:0%
one town is not uh coming up with a
 
04:19:51.030 --> 04:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
solution that conflicts with the next
 
04:19:53.510 --> 04:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
town so you what you said about the
 
04:19:55.990 --> 04:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
Commissioners all getting together to um
 
04:19:57.910 --> 04:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
talk about these things is what should
 
04:19:59.790 --> 04:19:59.800 align:start position:0%
be happening and is not happening in
 
04:19:59.800 --> 04:20:01.349 align:start position:0%
be happening and is not happening in
this

04:20:01.349 --> 04:20:01.359 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:20:05.790 --> 04:20:05.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:08.269 --> 04:20:08.279 align:start position:0%
discussion seeing none the motion before
 
04:20:10.870 --> 04:20:10.880 align:start position:0%

04:23:19.269 --> 04:23:19.279 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:23:23.189 --> 04:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
um in testimony we received 12
 
04:23:27.070 --> 04:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
examples um printed out uh 10 of them
 
04:23:28.950 --> 04:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
were Revenue generating
 
04:23:31.389 --> 04:23:31.399 align:start position:0%
leases with more than half of them
 
04:23:33.710 --> 04:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
potentially generating Millions over the
 
04:23:34.910 --> 04:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
course of their
 
04:23:37.149 --> 04:23:37.159 align:start position:0%
agreements municipalities and school
 
04:23:39.229 --> 04:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
districts are currently desperate to
 
04:23:42.070 --> 04:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
overcome increasing cost of providing
 
04:23:42.080 --> 04:23:44.070 align:start position:0%
overcome increasing cost of providing
services

04:23:44.070 --> 04:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
services
 
04:23:45.670 --> 04:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
it is irresponsible to present
 
04:23:48.389 --> 04:23:48.399 align:start position:0%
legislation that would handcuff efforts
 
04:23:50.830 --> 04:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
uh to decrease property tax burdens in
 
04:23:53.389 --> 04:23:53.399 align:start position:0%
anyway a simple majority in this case
 
04:23:55.870 --> 04:23:55.880 align:start position:0%
should be a majority uh we should not be
 
04:23:57.990 --> 04:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
advocating for further restrictions when
 
04:23:59.630 --> 04:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
it comes to initiatives that generate
 
04:24:01.990 --> 04:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
revenue or otherwise reduce the
 
04:24:04.670 --> 04:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
operating costs and allowing
 
04:24:08.830 --> 04:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities uh the ability to lower
 
04:24:12.550 --> 04:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
our property taxes
 
04:24:15.750 --> 04:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
further comments representative
 
04:24:19.349 --> 04:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
grund thank you madam chairwoman um
 
04:24:21.590 --> 04:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
so representative Colby pretty much said
 
04:24:22.870 --> 04:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
what I was going to say but you know
 
04:24:24.269 --> 04:24:24.279 align:start position:0%
when towns and school districts are
 
04:24:26.149 --> 04:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
looking for Revenue sources we shouldn't
 
04:24:28.030 --> 04:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily make it more difficult are
 
04:24:30.670 --> 04:24:30.680 align:start position:0%
there a few examples in here that
 
04:24:34.070 --> 04:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
probably you're cutting it close yes um
 
04:24:36.790 --> 04:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
but you know it's what's presented to
 
04:24:38.710 --> 04:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
the voters to vote and their voters
 
04:24:42.550 --> 04:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
spoke at the time so um we need to not
 
04:24:44.910 --> 04:24:44.920 align:start position:0%
make it harder to reduce taxes at this
 
04:24:46.469 --> 04:24:46.479 align:start position:0%
time and I want to thank representative
 
04:24:48.670 --> 04:24:48.680 align:start position:0%
kby for everything she added thank you
 
04:24:48.680 --> 04:24:53.070 align:start position:0%
kby for everything she added thank you
further

04:24:53.070 --> 04:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:57.990 --> 04:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
comments so I I have a few comments
 
04:25:01.590 --> 04:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
um this amendment is um comes forward
 
04:25:04.030 --> 04:25:04.040 align:start position:0%
today because during the the bill
 
04:25:06.830 --> 04:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
hearing I listened to the feedback from
 
04:25:10.550 --> 04:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
the committee so in the spirit of um
 
04:25:12.910 --> 04:25:12.920 align:start position:0%
listening and compromise
 
04:25:16.469 --> 04:25:16.479 align:start position:0%
I um present this amendment to you today
 
04:25:17.950 --> 04:25:17.960 align:start position:0%
on this
 
04:25:24.790 --> 04:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:28.670 --> 04:25:28.680 align:start position:0%
um with regards to
 
04:25:32.389 --> 04:25:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:36.510 --> 04:25:36.520 align:start position:0%
fifths for entering into a lease of
 
04:25:40.349 --> 04:25:40.359 align:start position:0%
greater than five years I felt that that
 
04:25:43.590 --> 04:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
was important
 
04:25:47.269 --> 04:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
because of the length of the
 
04:25:51.030 --> 04:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
term I feel that it's when when you're
 
04:25:54.149 --> 04:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
committing unused um Municipal property
 
04:25:57.510 --> 04:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
for that length of of time
 
04:26:00.030 --> 04:26:00.040 align:start position:0%
that there should be
 
04:26:04.870 --> 04:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
a a higher majority than just the simple
 
04:26:08.550 --> 04:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
majority so that's that's the reason for
 
04:26:08.560 --> 04:26:15.710 align:start position:0%
majority so that's that's the reason for
that

04:26:15.710 --> 04:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:15.720 --> 04:26:20.309 align:start position:0%
 
further

04:26:20.309 --> 04:26:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:22.990 --> 04:26:23.000 align:start position:0%
comments representative
 
04:26:25.670 --> 04:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
stavis thank you madam chair and I and I
 
04:26:28.189 --> 04:26:28.199 align:start position:0%
do want to thank you for listening to
 
04:26:29.870 --> 04:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
the comments and putting forward an
 
04:26:32.550 --> 04:26:32.560 align:start position:0%
amendment in an attempt to to reach a
 
04:26:36.229 --> 04:26:36.239 align:start position:0%
compromised position but I will never
 
04:26:40.189 --> 04:26:40.199 align:start position:0%
compromise on what constitutes the will
 
04:26:41.950 --> 04:26:41.960 align:start position:0%
of the voters and what constitutes the
 
04:26:44.389 --> 04:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
will of of the voters is a simple
 
04:26:47.630 --> 04:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
majority we have very very stringent
 
04:26:51.070 --> 04:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations about when we must
 
04:26:53.870 --> 04:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
have a two-thirds majority in this house
 
04:26:56.990 --> 04:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
and we ought not to be imposing what we
 
04:27:00.389 --> 04:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
believe to be reasonable
 
04:27:03.510 --> 04:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
numbers percentages of majorities on
 
04:27:07.189 --> 04:27:07.199 align:start position:0%
voters who who elect public officials to
 
04:27:09.670 --> 04:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
do that it's just it's it's an
 
04:27:12.349 --> 04:27:12.359 align:start position:0%
unwarranted intrusion of state power
 
04:27:14.149 --> 04:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
into local
 
04:27:17.790 --> 04:27:17.800 align:start position:0%
control representative
 
04:27:20.990 --> 04:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
grundt thank you madam chair and U maybe
 
04:27:24.189 --> 04:27:24.199 align:start position:0%
a clarification but is there any is this
 
04:27:28.630 --> 04:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
bill retroactive or current leases that
 
04:27:29.830 --> 04:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
are in
 
04:27:38.510 --> 04:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:41.710 --> 04:27:41.720 align:start position:0%
in my understanding is that no it's not
 
04:27:41.720 --> 04:27:42.950 align:start position:0%
in my understanding is that no it's not
okay

04:27:42.950 --> 04:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:27:44.030 --> 04:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
I think
 
04:27:47.109 --> 04:27:47.119 align:start position:0%
that's representative majori thank you
 
04:27:49.790 --> 04:27:49.800 align:start position:0%
madam chairwoman um I'm going to argue
 
04:27:51.349 --> 04:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
at a different a little bit of a
 
04:27:53.790 --> 04:27:53.800 align:start position:0%
different side here if we're going to
 
04:27:58.229 --> 04:27:58.239 align:start position:0%
require this kind of action so that
 
04:28:00.990 --> 04:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
there is the greatest amount of input
 
04:28:03.510 --> 04:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
from the legislative body I'm actually
 
04:28:05.469 --> 04:28:05.479 align:start position:0%
opposed to this because it says may and
 
04:28:07.550 --> 04:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
not shall now I don't support the bill I
 
04:28:09.229 --> 04:28:09.239 align:start position:0%
don't support the amendment but if
 
04:28:11.469 --> 04:28:11.479 align:start position:0%
you're going to have it drop the hammer
 
04:28:13.910 --> 04:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
and say if you're going to do this for
 
04:28:16.469 --> 04:28:16.479 align:start position:0%
more than 5 years you must go to the
 
04:28:18.429 --> 04:28:18.439 align:start position:0%
legislative body and you must get
 
04:28:20.990 --> 04:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
approval from them if you say may well
 
04:28:22.349 --> 04:28:22.359 align:start position:0%
I'm not on the select board anymore
 
04:28:26.070 --> 04:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
after tomorrow but um I would just say
 
04:28:29.630 --> 04:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
no thanks I may some towns and we hear
 
04:28:33.149 --> 04:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
about towns that may not be may may not
 
04:28:35.189 --> 04:28:35.199 align:start position:0%
be as above board as other towns we've
 
04:28:37.309 --> 04:28:37.319 align:start position:0%
heard that today they might just say no
 
04:28:39.149 --> 04:28:39.159 align:start position:0%
we're not going to do it I find that
 
04:28:42.269 --> 04:28:42.279 align:start position:0%
remarkable but it says May so I just
 
04:28:51.070 --> 04:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:54.429 --> 04:28:54.439 align:start position:0%
you if you if you continue to read the
 
04:28:54.439 --> 04:28:58.830 align:start position:0%
you if you if you continue to read the
the

04:28:58.830 --> 04:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:10.149 --> 04:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:18.149 --> 04:29:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:20.590 --> 04:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
the the intent of the amendment was that
 
04:29:27.990 --> 04:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:38.750 --> 04:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:43.070 --> 04:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
um and I would further further say that
 
04:29:46.670 --> 04:29:46.680 align:start position:0%
if a project is is a good idea and it's
 
04:29:48.630 --> 04:29:48.640 align:start position:0%
bringing in
 
04:29:51.670 --> 04:29:51.680 align:start position:0%
in Revenue through through through the
 
04:29:55.269 --> 04:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
lease then there should be no issue with
 
04:29:58.229 --> 04:29:58.239 align:start position:0%
with getting the Three-Fifths majority
 
04:30:01.389 --> 04:30:01.399 align:start position:0%
um for the sake of it's it's beneficial
 
04:30:03.910 --> 04:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
so I'm not concerned with that the piece
 
04:30:07.910 --> 04:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
that I'm concerned with is the the
 
04:30:09.950 --> 04:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
property that's being leased the fact
 
04:30:12.830 --> 04:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
that it could potentially be
 
04:30:16.790 --> 04:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
um committed for a long period of time
 
04:30:19.550 --> 04:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
so therefore I feel that a simple
 
04:30:23.990 --> 04:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
majority is is not the appropriate vote
 
04:30:27.670 --> 04:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
threshold to um
 
04:30:31.349 --> 04:30:31.359 align:start position:0%
approve such a matter further questions
 
04:30:34.269 --> 04:30:34.279 align:start position:0%
or I didn't mean questions comments or
 
04:30:37.389 --> 04:30:37.399 align:start position:0%
discussion representative majority thank
 
04:30:42.189 --> 04:30:42.199 align:start position:0%
you and and um so so in line 14 at the
 
04:30:43.469 --> 04:30:43.479 align:start position:0%
least more than 5 years then the
 
04:30:47.030 --> 04:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
legislative body may vote well yeah I
 
04:30:48.910 --> 04:30:48.920 align:start position:0%
assume that they they will vote but this
 
04:30:51.910 --> 04:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that the select board or the
 
04:30:54.510 --> 04:30:54.520 align:start position:0%
governing body shall put a warrant
 
04:30:56.910 --> 04:30:56.920 align:start position:0%
article on for them to vote and that's
 
04:30:59.109 --> 04:30:59.119 align:start position:0%
my concern that the language is
 
04:31:01.710 --> 04:31:01.720 align:start position:0%
ambiguous such that we're you're going
 
04:31:03.469 --> 04:31:03.479 align:start position:0%
to have to go to council and say does
 
04:31:05.510 --> 04:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
this mean I have to put the b a ballot
 
04:31:07.389 --> 04:31:07.399 align:start position:0%
measure on or I don't have to put a
 
04:31:09.070 --> 04:31:09.080 align:start position:0%
ballot measure on I know exactly where
 
04:31:11.429 --> 04:31:11.439 align:start position:0%
you want to go and what you want to do
 
04:31:13.510 --> 04:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
and and quite frankly I'm I I think that
 
04:31:14.990 --> 04:31:15.000 align:start position:0%
if you're going to bind future select
 
04:31:18.189 --> 04:31:18.199 align:start position:0%
boards that you should have to have a
 
04:31:19.950 --> 04:31:19.960 align:start position:0%
vote I just think that this language
 
04:31:23.229 --> 04:31:23.239 align:start position:0%
leaves it open that it may not
 
04:31:24.590 --> 04:31:24.600 align:start position:0%
accomplish what you're looking to
 
04:31:40.830 --> 04:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:40.840 --> 04:32:10.830 align:start position:0%
 
you

04:32:10.830 --> 04:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:10.840 --> 04:32:40.830 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:32:40.830 --> 04:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:31.429 --> 04:33:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:36.150 --> 04:33:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:39.910 --> 04:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
caucus um yes I will allow a caucus for
 
04:33:42.670 --> 04:33:42.680 align:start position:0%
how long 10 minutes
 
04:33:45.709 --> 04:33:45.719 align:start position:0%
okay so we will come back at quarter
 
04:33:49.750 --> 04:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
past I can't see my watch is it one no
 
04:34:10.709 --> 04:34:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:10.719 --> 04:34:40.629 align:start position:0%
 
okay

chairwoman um
 
04:44:14.590 --> 04:44:14.600 align:start position:0%
I I think the original bill unamended
 
04:44:17.190 --> 04:44:17.200 align:start position:0%
got to the point it says the town
 
04:44:21.788 --> 04:44:21.798 align:start position:0%
meeting shall buy a vote um and it gave
 
04:44:24.230 --> 04:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
it gave clear Direction what you must do
 
04:44:26.190 --> 04:44:26.200 align:start position:0%
I think this bill with the amendment
 
04:44:29.110 --> 04:44:29.120 align:start position:0%
just became much weaker and is going to
 
04:44:32.470 --> 04:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
open up for legal uh issues in towns
 
04:44:34.430 --> 04:44:34.440 align:start position:0%
which is only going to drive up costs
 
04:44:36.470 --> 04:44:36.480 align:start position:0%

04:48:38.590 --> 04:48:38.600 align:start position:0%
major I'm opposed to this bill for
 
04:48:40.830 --> 04:48:40.840 align:start position:0%
several reasons but the one that sticks
 
04:48:44.030 --> 04:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
out the most on page two lines 13 and 14
 
04:48:47.230 --> 04:48:47.240 align:start position:0%
you've made a retroactive law and those
 
04:48:51.150 --> 04:48:51.160 align:start position:0%
part our constitution should be
 
04:48:55.788 --> 04:48:55.798 align:start position:0%

stavis thank you madam chair I also
 
04:49:02.310 --> 04:49:02.320 align:start position:0%
oppose to this bill because because it
 
04:49:04.670 --> 04:49:04.680 align:start position:0%
further erodes local control something
 
04:49:07.110 --> 04:49:07.120 align:start position:0%

executive
 
04:49:12.830 --> 04:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
session um in my community in Lebanon
 
04:49:15.548 --> 04:49:15.558 align:start position:0%
there is a development that has been
 
04:49:19.708 --> 04:49:19.718 align:start position:0%
halted for 15 years
 
04:49:22.430 --> 04:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
15 um they have asked for extension
 
04:49:25.110 --> 04:49:25.120 align:start position:0%
after extension the last one we refused
 
04:49:27.470 --> 04:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
they went to court they
 
04:49:31.628 --> 04:49:31.638 align:start position:0%
won um that they are now going to be
 
04:49:32.910 --> 04:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
putting up
 
04:49:35.788 --> 04:49:35.798 align:start position:0%
buildings that were planned and approved
 
04:49:40.070 --> 04:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
15 years ago should this law pass any
 
04:49:42.390 --> 04:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
kind of code updates that have happened
 
04:49:44.990 --> 04:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
in those subsequent years will be
 
04:49:46.628 --> 04:49:46.638 align:start position:0%
non-consequential which I think is a
 
04:49:49.430 --> 04:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
threat to life safety and that is one of
 
04:49:51.070 --> 04:49:51.080 align:start position:0%
the reasons one of the many reasons I
 
04:49:52.230 --> 04:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
oppose this
 
04:49:55.590 --> 04:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
bill further comments representative
 
04:49:57.788 --> 04:49:57.798 align:start position:0%
grund thank you madam chairwoman there
 
04:50:00.910 --> 04:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
was another piece that um had been
 
04:50:02.670 --> 04:50:02.680 align:start position:0%
brought forward during testimony that
 
04:50:06.190 --> 04:50:06.200 align:start position:0%
made me think and wonder um would this
 
04:50:08.590 --> 04:50:08.600 align:start position:0%
because it makes things retroactive if
 
04:50:10.910 --> 04:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
there's any legal cases that were closed
 
04:50:12.628 --> 04:50:12.638 align:start position:0%
could this potentially open them up as
 
04:50:14.470 --> 04:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
well and I think that was a that's a
 
04:50:14.480 --> 04:50:17.190 align:start position:0%
well and I think that was a that's a
serious

04:50:17.190 --> 04:50:17.200 align:start position:0%

recognized thank you madam chair I'm
 
04:57:12.470 --> 04:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
still unclear as to
 
04:57:15.110 --> 04:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
the point of the legislation is trying
 
04:57:17.868 --> 04:57:17.878 align:start position:0%
to make um I see towns and school
 
04:57:19.830 --> 04:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
districts utilizing multiple Financial
 
04:57:21.750 --> 04:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
tools to keep buildings and fixtures in
 
04:57:25.030 --> 04:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
working order um simply claiming misuse
 
04:57:28.510 --> 04:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
of the statute is a matter of opinion
 
04:57:30.310 --> 04:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
leasing allows for municipalities to
 
04:57:32.510 --> 04:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
maintain Bond ratings for larger
 
04:57:35.708 --> 04:57:35.718 align:start position:0%
projects and at the same old time uh
 
04:57:37.190 --> 04:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
keep up with the cost of
 
04:57:39.190 --> 04:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
Maintenance also to note is all the
 
04:57:41.150 --> 04:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
lease agreements that were presented uh
 
04:57:43.590 --> 04:57:43.600 align:start position:0%
we were presented with as evidence went
 
04:57:46.110 --> 04:57:46.120 align:start position:0%
through a proper process uh through a
 
04:57:46.120 --> 04:57:47.590 align:start position:0%
through a proper process uh through a
democratic

04:57:47.590 --> 04:57:47.600 align:start position:0%
democratic
 
04:57:50.548 --> 04:57:50.558 align:start position:0%
process um and none of the leases
 
04:57:54.070 --> 04:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
circumvented that de Democratic process
 
04:57:55.350 --> 04:57:55.360 align:start position:0%
the majority of Voters in their
 
04:57:57.350 --> 04:57:57.360 align:start position:0%
respective communities voted in favor of
 
04:57:59.470 --> 04:57:59.480 align:start position:0%
the projects a small portion of the
 
04:58:01.830 --> 04:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
electorate is obviously disenchanted
 
04:58:04.510 --> 04:58:04.520 align:start position:0%
with their neighbors decisions and I
 
04:58:05.948 --> 04:58:05.958 align:start position:0%
don't believe this committee should be
 
04:58:08.110 --> 04:58:08.120 align:start position:0%
supporting legislation that is created
 
04:58:11.390 --> 04:58:11.400 align:start position:0%
because of a personal grievance
 
04:58:15.510 --> 04:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
further comments representative grund so
 
04:58:16.948 --> 04:58:16.958 align:start position:0%
basically representative kobby said
 
04:58:18.510 --> 04:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
everything I want to do I was going to
 
04:58:21.948 --> 04:58:21.958 align:start position:0%
say so I support her comments thank
 
04:58:25.430 --> 04:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
you further comments discussion
 
04:58:27.910 --> 04:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
representative Davis thank you madam
 
04:58:30.190 --> 04:58:30.200 align:start position:0%
chair I would also just like to
 
04:58:32.150 --> 04:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
reiterate the fact that we discussed at
 
04:58:34.910 --> 04:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
our hearing that this is the redraft of
 
04:58:37.708 --> 04:58:37.718 align:start position:0%
a bill that was uh sent to the
 
04:58:39.628 --> 04:58:39.638 align:start position:0%
governor's desk in the last session and
 
04:58:41.990 --> 04:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
it was vetoed by the Republican Governor
 
04:58:46.750 --> 04:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:46.760 --> 04:58:48.310 align:start position:0%
 
business

04:58:48.310 --> 04:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
business
 
04:58:51.230 --> 04:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
representative majori is recognized
 
04:58:53.070 --> 04:58:53.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mad chairwoman and we also
 
04:58:56.430 --> 04:58:56.440 align:start position:0%
have testimony um from well we also have
 
04:58:59.150 --> 04:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
testimony which said that if we had if
 
04:59:02.548 --> 04:59:02.558 align:start position:0%
the bill just had a a simple part about
 
04:59:05.590 --> 04:59:05.600 align:start position:0%
except for energy performance contracts
 
04:59:08.150 --> 04:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
that maybe we could have held our nose
 
04:59:10.470 --> 04:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
and swallowed hard and agreed with this
 
04:59:13.628 --> 04:59:13.638 align:start position:0%
but that was still left out um as as a
 
04:59:22.510 --> 04:59:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:25.270 --> 04:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
bill okay representative grund I was
 
04:59:28.030 --> 04:59:28.040 align:start position:0%
just thinking that's okay um the one
 
04:59:30.990 --> 04:59:31.000 align:start position:0%
thing I wanted to point out also it was
 
04:59:32.708 --> 04:59:32.718 align:start position:0%
stated during testimony that the state
 
04:59:36.910 --> 04:59:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:42.270 --> 04:59:42.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:48.350 --> 04:59:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:53.270 --> 04:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
um I would like to um say that
 
04:59:56.788 --> 04:59:56.798 align:start position:0%
indeed this bill passed the house this
 
04:59:59.590 --> 04:59:59.600 align:start position:0%
is a refiling the exact
 
05:00:02.470 --> 05:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
language of a bill that passed the house
 
05:00:05.230 --> 05:00:05.240 align:start position:0%
last legislative session on consent
 
05:00:06.990 --> 05:00:07.000 align:start position:0%
calendar out of this
 
05:00:10.390 --> 05:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
committee it also obviously pass the
 
05:00:12.948 --> 05:00:12.958 align:start position:0%
Senate and went to the governor's desk
 
05:00:16.750 --> 05:00:16.760 align:start position:0%
and yes the governor did veto it and I
 
05:00:18.670 --> 05:00:18.680 align:start position:0%
believe that it was vetoed because the
 
05:00:21.990 --> 05:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
governor did not understand the
 
05:00:26.310 --> 05:00:26.320 align:start position:0%
bill so a couple of other comments is um
 
05:00:30.830 --> 05:00:30.840 align:start position:0%
very clearly that this statute lease
 
05:00:34.190 --> 05:00:34.200 align:start position:0%
agreements of equipment with Escape
 
05:00:37.788 --> 05:00:37.798 align:start position:0%
Clauses is indeed being used
 
05:00:40.590 --> 05:00:40.600 align:start position:0%
improperly and it is incumbent upon the
 
05:00:44.070 --> 05:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
legislature that when the legislative
 
05:00:44.080 --> 05:00:46.230 align:start position:0%
legislature that when the legislative
intent

05:00:46.230 --> 05:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
intent
 
05:00:51.230 --> 05:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
of a bill that became law is being
 
05:00:54.830 --> 05:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
improperly used that it's incumbent upon
 
05:00:57.910 --> 05:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
the legislature to address that through
 
05:01:00.470 --> 05:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
legislation and that's exactly what the
 
05:01:04.270 --> 05:01:04.280 align:start position:0%
bill that got vetoed did and that's
 
05:01:08.750 --> 05:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
exactly what the bill before us
 
05:01:12.270 --> 05:01:12.280 align:start position:0%
does the this bill prevents lease
 
05:01:15.070 --> 05:01:15.080 align:start position:0%
agreements of equipment that becomes
 
05:01:15.080 --> 05:01:17.788 align:start position:0%
agreements of equipment that becomes
fixtures

05:01:17.788 --> 05:01:17.798 align:start position:0%
fixtures
 
05:01:23.868 --> 05:01:23.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:23.878 --> 05:01:25.510 align:start position:0%
 
337e

05:01:25.510 --> 05:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
337e
 
05:01:30.590 --> 05:01:30.600 align:start position:0%
because if equipment becomes a fixture
 
05:01:32.230 --> 05:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
it it's a
 
05:01:35.830 --> 05:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
fixture it cannot be returned and it
 
05:01:38.110 --> 05:01:38.120 align:start position:0%
clearly the
 
05:01:42.030 --> 05:01:42.040 align:start position:0%
list of in instances where this
 
05:01:45.470 --> 05:01:45.480 align:start position:0%
particular RSA is being improperly used
 
05:01:48.590 --> 05:01:48.600 align:start position:0%
it was was provided during the
 
05:01:51.708 --> 05:01:51.718 align:start position:0%
hearing furthermore to be clear this
 
05:01:55.470 --> 05:01:55.480 align:start position:0%
bill before us does not in any way Pro
 
05:01:55.480 --> 05:01:57.990 align:start position:0%
bill before us does not in any way Pro
prohibit

05:01:57.990 --> 05:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
prohibit
 
05:02:00.590 --> 05:02:00.600 align:start position:0%
leases from from
 
05:02:03.590 --> 05:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
being done
 
05:02:06.470 --> 05:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
including energy performance contracts
 
05:02:11.310 --> 05:02:11.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:13.948 --> 05:02:13.958 align:start position:0%
19 I have asked
 
05:02:16.548 --> 05:02:16.558 align:start position:0%
repeatedly since the day that the
 
05:02:20.030 --> 05:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
governor vetoed the bill last
 
05:02:20.040 --> 05:02:21.470 align:start position:0%
governor vetoed the bill last
legislative

05:02:21.470 --> 05:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
05:02:25.548 --> 05:02:25.558 align:start position:0%
session um with regards to the the piece
 
05:02:30.590 --> 05:02:30.600 align:start position:0%
about the energy performance Contracting
 
05:02:33.390 --> 05:02:33.400 align:start position:0%
like it's not clear to me why that was
 
05:02:37.510 --> 05:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
put in by the Senate I I've furthermore
 
05:02:40.788 --> 05:02:40.798 align:start position:0%
I've asked and even the recent P after
 
05:02:43.628 --> 05:02:43.638 align:start position:0%
the hearing what is the purpose of that
 
05:02:47.230 --> 05:02:47.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:49.948 --> 05:02:49.958 align:start position:0%
because those types of contracts can
 
05:02:52.750 --> 05:02:52.760 align:start position:0%
still be done even if this bill becomes
 
05:02:54.910 --> 05:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
law and I have yet to have an answer
 
05:03:00.070 --> 05:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
that's why that Clause is not in the
 
05:03:03.628 --> 05:03:03.638 align:start position:0%
bill I don't understand it it it
 
05:03:06.510 --> 05:03:06.520 align:start position:0%
Exempted energy performance contracts
 
05:03:10.590 --> 05:03:10.600 align:start position:0%
from from the the bill for period of 3
 
05:03:14.190 --> 05:03:14.200 align:start position:0%
years well what happens after 3 years I
 
05:03:17.390 --> 05:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
if I could get an answer and I you know
 
05:03:22.750 --> 05:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:24.830 --> 05:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
consideration and with regards to
 
05:03:27.190 --> 05:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
personal grievances I'm not sure what
 
05:03:30.470 --> 05:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
what that meant um
 
05:03:34.510 --> 05:03:34.520 align:start position:0%
clearly clearly there's numerous
 
05:03:37.830 --> 05:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
examples covering many years across the
 
05:03:42.590 --> 05:03:42.600 align:start position:0%
state um and for those reasons I I I
 
05:03:45.830 --> 05:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
support the the motion of ought to
 
05:03:49.430 --> 05:03:49.440 align:start position:0%

oh do representative Dolan is recognized
 
05:06:14.270 --> 05:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I have a motion
 
05:06:17.628 --> 05:06:17.638 align:start position:0%
um on House Bill 432 that it's
 
05:06:21.030 --> 05:06:21.040 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legisl is is there a
 
05:06:25.110 --> 05:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
second representative Walker seconds the
 
05:06:27.510 --> 05:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
motion would you like to speak to your
 
05:06:29.830 --> 05:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
motion representative Dolan yes thank
 
05:06:31.990 --> 05:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
you uh I
 
05:06:35.910 --> 05:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
have four elements basically of my uh
 
05:06:37.548 --> 05:06:37.558 align:start position:0%
objection to this
 
05:06:41.350 --> 05:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
legislation uh first let me say that I
 
05:06:43.948 --> 05:06:43.958 align:start position:0%
think it's without goes without saying
 
05:06:46.708 --> 05:06:46.718 align:start position:0%
that that uh there
 
05:06:50.948 --> 05:06:50.958 align:start position:0%
is a tremendous amount of empathy for
 
05:06:52.910 --> 05:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
those people who are find themselves in
 
05:06:52.920 --> 05:06:53.708 align:start position:0%
those people who are find themselves in
this

05:06:53.708 --> 05:06:53.718 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:06:57.070 --> 05:06:57.080 align:start position:0%
situation uh and that need either help
 
05:06:59.270 --> 05:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
with alcohol problems or drug problems
 
05:07:02.150 --> 05:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
or other related problems and I think
 
05:07:04.830 --> 05:07:04.840 align:start position:0%
that that uh most of us can say that we
 
05:07:07.948 --> 05:07:07.958 align:start position:0%
want to reach out and help them however
 
05:07:11.110 --> 05:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh this bill for Falls far short on a
 
05:07:13.910 --> 05:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
number of issues the probably the most
 
05:07:15.670 --> 05:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
important is
 
05:07:18.868 --> 05:07:18.878 align:start position:0%
safety uh this bill exempts the the
 
05:07:18.878 --> 05:07:19.948 align:start position:0%
safety uh this bill exempts the the
safety

05:07:19.948 --> 05:07:19.958 align:start position:0%
safety
 
05:07:21.830 --> 05:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
requirements that we would normally
 
05:07:23.708 --> 05:07:23.718 align:start position:0%
think would would happen especially in a
 
05:07:27.670 --> 05:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
in a uh a recovery situation where
 
05:07:29.190 --> 05:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
people are are
 
05:07:29.200 --> 05:07:31.110 align:start position:0%
people are are
compromised

05:07:31.110 --> 05:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
compromised
 
05:07:34.190 --> 05:07:34.200 align:start position:0%
um we've Exempted the the uh the fire
 
05:07:34.200 --> 05:07:35.470 align:start position:0%
um we've Exempted the the uh the fire
alarm

05:07:35.470 --> 05:07:35.480 align:start position:0%
alarm
 
05:07:39.670 --> 05:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
requirements um there aren't any Ada
 
05:07:41.190 --> 05:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
requirements that would
 
05:07:43.590 --> 05:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
apply for use of
 
05:07:46.470 --> 05:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
toilets uh opening and closing
 
05:07:49.750 --> 05:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
doors certification of of a recovery
 
05:07:52.590 --> 05:07:52.600 align:start position:0%
house is only required after it's been
 
05:07:55.070 --> 05:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
open and in use for a
 
05:07:58.990 --> 05:07:59.000 align:start position:0%
year uh and and not
 
05:08:01.708 --> 05:08:01.718 align:start position:0%
beforehand secondly the public process
 
05:08:05.230 --> 05:08:05.240 align:start position:0%
associated with with the recovery house
 
05:08:08.030 --> 05:08:08.040 align:start position:0%
uh around local control which we've
 
05:08:09.750 --> 05:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot today about how
 
05:08:11.390 --> 05:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
important that is to maintain local
 
05:08:14.548 --> 05:08:14.558 align:start position:0%
control but we've Stripped Away the
 
05:08:17.230 --> 05:08:17.240 align:start position:0%
requirement uh for a planning board or
 
05:08:21.150 --> 05:08:21.160 align:start position:0%
or a zoning board to oversee uh these
 
05:08:25.430 --> 05:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
requirements in other words uh the local
 
05:08:27.628 --> 05:08:27.638 align:start position:0%
residents local community is really
 
05:08:30.548 --> 05:08:30.558 align:start position:0%
going to have very little of any say as
 
05:08:32.990 --> 05:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
to the sighting and and and
 
05:08:36.670 --> 05:08:36.680 align:start position:0%
implementation of a recovery house there
 
05:08:40.310 --> 05:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
will'll be no site plan review um
 
05:08:43.430 --> 05:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
the community's input on things like
 
05:08:47.110 --> 05:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
parking and so forth are eliminated in
 
05:08:49.350 --> 05:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
this process in this
 
05:08:53.670 --> 05:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
legislation thirdly uh volume it was
 
05:08:57.548 --> 05:08:57.558 align:start position:0%
explained uh to us we we did have a u
 
05:09:00.670 --> 05:09:00.680 align:start position:0%
the chair did uh appoint a subcommittee
 
05:09:03.030 --> 05:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
to look into this matter and we met for
 
05:09:06.708 --> 05:09:06.718 align:start position:0%
for a few hours uh and took testimony
 
05:09:11.628 --> 05:09:11.638 align:start position:0%
and it looks like the uh the quantity of
 
05:09:14.910 --> 05:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
recovery houses from The Advocates of
 
05:09:20.430 --> 05:09:20.440 align:start position:0%
this uh situation are estimating that we
 
05:09:23.230 --> 05:09:23.240 align:start position:0%
uh increase the quantity in the state
 
05:09:25.470 --> 05:09:25.480 align:start position:0%
from currently about
 
05:09:28.670 --> 05:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
1,300 to
 
05:09:33.350 --> 05:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
15,000 and that's going to be uh that's
 
05:09:36.470 --> 05:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
going to be uh apply to us to bring that
 
05:09:38.350 --> 05:09:38.360 align:start position:0%
message back to our local communities
 
05:09:40.948 --> 05:09:40.958 align:start position:0%
that that uh hey guys we're about to
 
05:09:43.310 --> 05:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
increase recovery houses to 15,000 in
 
05:09:47.150 --> 05:09:47.160 align:start position:0%
the state over a factor of 10 and uh is
 
05:09:49.750 --> 05:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
that are those local communities ready
 
05:09:52.868 --> 05:09:52.878 align:start position:0%
for that and willing to accept that and
 
05:09:57.070 --> 05:09:57.080 align:start position:0%
the implications of of what that really
 
05:10:00.910 --> 05:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
means and lastly uh although you can't
 
05:10:04.628 --> 05:10:04.638 align:start position:0%
really consider consider this input and
 
05:10:07.110 --> 05:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
as part of the vote to move forward or
 
05:10:11.510 --> 05:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
not with this but this bill as flawed as
 
05:10:15.628 --> 05:10:15.638 align:start position:0%
it is is mostly corrected by the by the
 
05:10:18.910 --> 05:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
contents of a of a sister bill and it's
 
05:10:21.110 --> 05:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
currently matriculating through the
 
05:10:23.868 --> 05:10:23.878 align:start position:0%
Senate uh that I haven't seen and I
 
05:10:25.788 --> 05:10:25.798 align:start position:0%
can't recommend to you that it's better
 
05:10:29.430 --> 05:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
than or fixes everything but it's it's
 
05:10:32.868 --> 05:10:32.878 align:start position:0%
certainly to me is an alternative a much
 
05:10:35.310 --> 05:10:35.320 align:start position:0%
better alternative potentially than what
 
05:10:37.190 --> 05:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
we have in front of us which I think is
 
05:10:40.190 --> 05:10:40.200 align:start position:0%
terribly flawed and and sacrifices the
 
05:10:43.750 --> 05:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
safety and well-being of those
 
05:10:45.948 --> 05:10:45.958 align:start position:0%
desperately needy people that would be
 
05:10:48.350 --> 05:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
using these recovery houses thank you
 
05:10:51.470 --> 05:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
madam chair further comments
 
05:10:54.110 --> 05:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
representative gerana thank you madam
 
05:10:55.948 --> 05:10:55.958 align:start position:0%
chair um yeah I served on that
 
05:10:58.230 --> 05:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittee as well just to touch on
 
05:10:59.990 --> 05:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
one of those points um that the other
 
05:11:02.510 --> 05:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
representative brought up um for that
 
05:11:05.230 --> 05:11:05.240 align:start position:0%
number 1300 to 15,000 we're not talking
 
05:11:07.350 --> 05:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
about recovery homes we're talking about
 
05:11:10.868 --> 05:11:10.878 align:start position:0%
beds that are available right um I
 
05:11:12.990 --> 05:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
agree and that's something that we can
 
05:11:15.868 --> 05:11:15.878 align:start position:0%
all see in our own districts that our
 
05:11:18.190 --> 05:11:18.200 align:start position:0%
constituents are calling for and we need
 
05:11:20.910 --> 05:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
more beds in our communities and as we I
 
05:11:22.470 --> 05:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
agree that this is not a perfect bill
 
05:11:24.628 --> 05:11:24.638 align:start position:0%
which is where I would move that we
 
05:11:26.830 --> 05:11:26.840 align:start position:0%
defeat the itl and move then move to
 
05:11:28.990 --> 05:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
retain afterwards um because there are
 
05:11:31.510 --> 05:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
some problems that with this bill that I
 
05:11:33.948 --> 05:11:33.958 align:start position:0%
believe can be fixed through Amendment
 
05:11:36.110 --> 05:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
um and in the meantime while we keep
 
05:11:38.350 --> 05:11:38.360 align:start position:0%
working on ways to find solutions to
 
05:11:39.548 --> 05:11:39.558 align:start position:0%
both this bill and maybe maybe other
 
05:11:41.628 --> 05:11:41.638 align:start position:0%
bills brought up in the future how many
 
05:11:44.230 --> 05:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
people are left on the streets for years
 
05:11:47.190 --> 05:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
while we while we wait for maybe a minor
 
05:11:48.670 --> 05:11:48.680 align:start position:0%
detail that we don't agree with that
 
05:11:50.788 --> 05:11:50.798 align:start position:0%
could be amended if we just made went
 
05:11:53.470 --> 05:11:53.480 align:start position:0%
back to retain and figured it out there
 
05:11:55.390 --> 05:11:55.400 align:start position:0%
this is something that could help found
 
05:11:58.430 --> 05:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
thousands of graned Staters over the
 
05:12:01.830 --> 05:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
years and while we just slow this down
 
05:12:04.350 --> 05:12:04.360 align:start position:0%
by saying we might need ADA requirements
 
05:12:06.548 --> 05:12:06.558 align:start position:0%
or by throwing some other issues on
 
05:12:07.830 --> 05:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
there that could be either fixed through
 
05:12:10.150 --> 05:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
Amendment or as a homeowner it's your
 
05:12:12.548 --> 05:12:12.558 align:start position:0%
job to figure out issues when you have a
 
05:12:14.110 --> 05:12:14.120 align:start position:0%
home that doesn't have the right septic
 
05:12:19.070 --> 05:12:19.080 align:start position:0%
or parking that's a homeowner issue
 
05:12:19.080 --> 05:12:20.670 align:start position:0%
or parking that's a homeowner issue
um

05:12:20.670 --> 05:12:20.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:23.310 --> 05:12:23.320 align:start position:0%
and it's just a shame that we slow down
 
05:12:25.270 --> 05:12:25.280 align:start position:0%
the process of so many people having a
 
05:12:27.470 --> 05:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
second chance while they're on the
 
05:12:30.470 --> 05:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
streets um they could be either just not
 
05:12:32.830 --> 05:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
sober in the first place or having
 
05:12:35.230 --> 05:12:35.240 align:start position:0%
trouble with that process without these
 
05:12:37.070 --> 05:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
homes being available in large parts of
 
05:12:39.310 --> 05:12:39.320 align:start position:0%
our state including I know there's two
 
05:12:41.190 --> 05:12:41.200 align:start position:0%
counties in New Hampshire one of which
 
05:12:43.110 --> 05:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
is Coos and I'm I'm forgetting the other
 
05:12:45.708 --> 05:12:45.718 align:start position:0%
one off the top of my head which have no
 
05:12:48.868 --> 05:12:48.878 align:start position:0%
currently open um recovery
 
05:12:51.150 --> 05:12:51.160 align:start position:0%
houses so there's just there's a large
 
05:12:54.030 --> 05:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
need that this body needs to really take
 
05:12:56.470 --> 05:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
seriously in figuring out how we address
 
05:12:58.590 --> 05:12:58.600 align:start position:0%
our housing crisis the homelessness
 
05:13:00.948 --> 05:13:00.958 align:start position:0%
crisis as well as the drug epidemic that
 
05:13:02.190 --> 05:13:02.200 align:start position:0%
we're seeing here in New Hampshire and
 
05:13:04.670 --> 05:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
this bill takes a serious stab at that
 
05:13:06.110 --> 05:13:06.120 align:start position:0%
um so I think at the very least we
 
05:13:09.190 --> 05:13:09.200 align:start position:0%
should defeat the itl and move to retain
 
05:13:11.910 --> 05:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
thank you further comments
 
05:13:14.270 --> 05:13:14.280 align:start position:0%
representative stavis is
 
05:13:17.270 --> 05:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you madam chair I agree
 
05:13:19.430 --> 05:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
with the com comments that
 
05:13:22.150 --> 05:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
representative Shana just made I also
 
05:13:23.548 --> 05:13:23.558 align:start position:0%
agree with some of the comments that
 
05:13:26.030 --> 05:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan made this is far
 
05:13:30.150 --> 05:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
from a perfect bill but better is often
 
05:13:33.430 --> 05:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
the enemy of good and I can't think of a
 
05:13:37.150 --> 05:13:37.160 align:start position:0%
better case than this in which better is
 
05:13:39.910 --> 05:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
the enemy of good there are fixes we can
 
05:13:43.070 --> 05:13:43.080 align:start position:0%
make to this bill real pretty simple
 
05:13:46.628 --> 05:13:46.638 align:start position:0%
fixes if we just didn't itl it and move
 
05:13:49.230 --> 05:13:49.240 align:start position:0%
to retain it and make those fixes and we
 
05:13:51.548 --> 05:13:51.558 align:start position:0%
could we could meet the needs of some of
 
05:13:52.990 --> 05:13:53.000 align:start position:0%
the people in our communities who
 
05:13:56.430 --> 05:13:56.440 align:start position:0%
desperately need these places to
 
05:13:59.628 --> 05:13:59.638 align:start position:0%
live F further
 
05:14:03.510 --> 05:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:05.948 --> 05:14:05.958 align:start position:0%
Walker all day we've been hearing about
 
05:14:05.958 --> 05:14:07.430 align:start position:0%
Walker all day we've been hearing about
local

05:14:07.430 --> 05:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
local
 
05:14:09.628 --> 05:14:09.638 align:start position:0%
control local control control each one
 
05:14:11.390 --> 05:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
of our bills that we wanted to pass
 
05:14:14.190 --> 05:14:14.200 align:start position:0%
local control here's one where it cuts
 
05:14:16.670 --> 05:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
out local control shoehorns these things
 
05:14:18.548 --> 05:14:18.558 align:start position:0%
in neighborhoods that might not fit
 
05:14:21.548 --> 05:14:21.558 align:start position:0%
right might be septic issues might be
 
05:14:24.470 --> 05:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
parking issues might be safety issues
 
05:14:26.990 --> 05:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
God forbid I wouldn't want this that one
 
05:14:28.708 --> 05:14:28.718 align:start position:0%
of these places burns up CU someone let
 
05:14:30.350 --> 05:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
a match and the whole place burns up and
 
05:14:31.910 --> 05:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
we kill 15 people because we got too
 
05:14:34.708 --> 05:14:34.718 align:start position:0%
many people in the building but uh this
 
05:14:37.868 --> 05:14:37.878 align:start position:0%
bill is highly flawed and highly
 
05:14:41.590 --> 05:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
dangerous as is is and I look forward to
 
05:14:43.110 --> 05:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
the Senate Bill coming through I want to
 
05:14:45.030 --> 05:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
see what that does because this is a
 
05:14:47.788 --> 05:14:47.798 align:start position:0%
need I recognize that it's a need but it
 
05:14:52.070 --> 05:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
needs a lot more work than it
 
05:14:54.470 --> 05:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
is further
 
05:14:57.628 --> 05:14:57.638 align:start position:0%
comments representative
 
05:14:59.590 --> 05:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
ger thank you yeah I just wanted to
 
05:15:02.110 --> 05:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
bring back to the um that safety point
 
05:15:04.708 --> 05:15:04.718 align:start position:0%
one more time um with the safety
 
05:15:06.110 --> 05:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
requirements the only exemption that
 
05:15:08.548 --> 05:15:08.558 align:start position:0%
these houses are given is that they
 
05:15:10.948 --> 05:15:10.958 align:start position:0%
don't need a sprinkler in in every room
 
05:15:13.948 --> 05:15:13.958 align:start position:0%
is effectively what it is um it has to
 
05:15:15.628 --> 05:15:15.638 align:start position:0%
do with the sprinklers that's that's the
 
05:15:18.190 --> 05:15:18.200 align:start position:0%
only the only ex exemption they get in
 
05:15:18.200 --> 05:15:22.350 align:start position:0%
only the only ex exemption they get in
that

05:15:22.350 --> 05:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:25.590 --> 05:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
case representative Colby is recognized
 
05:15:27.628 --> 05:15:27.638 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I think uh to
 
05:15:29.510 --> 05:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
speak to representative Walker's
 
05:15:33.788 --> 05:15:33.798 align:start position:0%
concerns is the goal here is to um
 
05:15:36.270 --> 05:15:36.280 align:start position:0%
address concerns with local control at
 
05:15:38.270 --> 05:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
least that's what I would like to see
 
05:15:41.230 --> 05:15:41.240 align:start position:0%
come out of of um the ability to retain
 
05:15:43.788 --> 05:15:43.798 align:start position:0%
the bill and work on it further um so to
 
05:15:45.510 --> 05:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
your point and to the point we have been
 
05:15:48.548 --> 05:15:48.558 align:start position:0%
making all day is yes uh local control
 
05:15:52.788 --> 05:15:52.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:56.390 --> 05:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
bill further comments represented
 
05:16:00.430 --> 05:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
roock thank you madam chair um I too was
 
05:16:01.708 --> 05:16:01.718 align:start position:0%
on the
 
05:16:01.718 --> 05:16:03.670 align:start position:0%
on the
subcommittee

05:16:03.670 --> 05:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittee
 
05:16:08.270 --> 05:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
and I had voted um with the motion of
 
05:16:10.948 --> 05:16:10.958 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee committee to recommend
 
05:16:14.910 --> 05:16:14.920 align:start position:0%
itl however after further reflection it
 
05:16:17.990 --> 05:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
appears to me that the best way
 
05:16:22.070 --> 05:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
of um moving this very important bill
 
05:16:25.390 --> 05:16:25.400 align:start position:0%
forward would be to retain it in
 
05:16:28.948 --> 05:16:28.958 align:start position:0%
committee and proceed to come out with a
 
05:16:33.310 --> 05:16:33.320 align:start position:0%
good workable bill that protects the
 
05:16:34.830 --> 05:16:34.840 align:start position:0%
rights and
 
05:16:36.948 --> 05:16:36.958 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of
 
05:16:41.150 --> 05:16:41.160 align:start position:0%
landlords of operat ERS of the recovery
 
05:16:44.190 --> 05:16:44.200 align:start position:0%
homes and also
 
05:16:50.070 --> 05:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
allows for the abing property owners and
 
05:16:54.788 --> 05:16:54.798 align:start position:0%
the town's people in general to have a
 
05:17:00.350 --> 05:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
say in the process so I would vote
 
05:17:04.430 --> 05:17:04.440 align:start position:0%
for um retaining this bill in committee
 
05:17:07.190 --> 05:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
working on it and coming up with a
 
05:17:10.708 --> 05:17:10.718 align:start position:0%

control and I I got some really good
 
05:17:39.430 --> 05:17:39.440 align:start position:0%
quotes that I'm taking down because
 
05:17:40.670 --> 05:17:40.680 align:start position:0%
they're really good in case I can use
 
05:17:43.150 --> 05:17:43.160 align:start position:0%
them sometime and not extending the long
 
05:17:44.548 --> 05:17:44.558 align:start position:0%
arm of government into how
 
05:17:47.190 --> 05:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities execute their Affairs
 
05:17:50.270 --> 05:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
what's this bill do takes us long I'm in
 
05:17:52.030 --> 05:17:52.040 align:start position:0%
government and and infects the
 
05:17:54.310 --> 05:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities subvert to
 
05:17:56.788 --> 05:17:56.798 align:start position:0%
locally elected officials can do their
 
05:17:59.390 --> 05:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
jobs legislative deferring to local
 
05:18:01.868 --> 05:18:01.878 align:start position:0%
control and unfortunately I wish I had
 
05:18:03.830 --> 05:18:03.840 align:start position:0%
represent represent major speech because
 
05:18:05.628 --> 05:18:05.638 align:start position:0%
it was excellent and I think a lot of it
 
05:18:07.708 --> 05:18:07.718 align:start position:0%
there was in his that I want to say is
 
05:18:09.548 --> 05:18:09.558 align:start position:0%
contained in that again
 
05:18:11.270 --> 05:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
all day we've heard local control local
 
05:18:13.070 --> 05:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
control local control on many many other
 
05:18:16.590 --> 05:18:16.600 align:start position:0%
bills this bill no it is it's taken away
 
05:18:18.470 --> 05:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
local control the way it's written and
 
05:18:22.070 --> 05:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:24.868 --> 05:18:24.878 align:start position:0%
you further comments I see
 
05:18:26.868 --> 05:18:26.878 align:start position:0%
representative grund has a
 
05:18:29.350 --> 05:18:29.360 align:start position:0%
comment thank you madam chair and i'
 
05:18:30.708 --> 05:18:30.718 align:start position:0%
just like to repeat what said before is
 
05:18:32.030 --> 05:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
that one of the things that probably
 
05:18:34.390 --> 05:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
does need looked Act is part of the
 
05:18:36.390 --> 05:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
piece of the part of the sorry the piece
 
05:18:38.270 --> 05:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
is about local control so no one's
 
05:18:39.270 --> 05:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
05:18:40.590 --> 05:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
we are against it in this bill we're
 
05:18:42.470 --> 05:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
saying we want to look at the bill and
 
05:18:44.390 --> 05:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
its entirety and at the pieces and try
 
05:18:45.990 --> 05:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
and fix the parts that are flawed
 
05:18:48.430 --> 05:18:48.440 align:start position:0%
because overall this bill addresses a
 
05:18:51.030 --> 05:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
strong need in our
 
05:18:53.990 --> 05:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
state further
 
05:18:56.628 --> 05:18:56.638 align:start position:0%
comments representative
 
05:19:01.510 --> 05:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
FR thank you madam chair um a process
 
05:19:02.910 --> 05:19:02.920 align:start position:0%
question if you
 
05:19:06.750 --> 05:19:06.760 align:start position:0%
will um right now the motion before us
 
05:19:09.110 --> 05:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
is itl
 
05:19:13.470 --> 05:19:13.480 align:start position:0%
and we are expressing a desire
 
05:19:17.670 --> 05:19:17.680 align:start position:0%
to uh to retain the bill in committee to
 
05:19:19.788 --> 05:19:19.798 align:start position:0%
in order to work on it and come out with
 
05:19:20.990 --> 05:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
a better
 
05:19:26.150 --> 05:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
Bill U my understanding is that if itl
 
05:19:28.470 --> 05:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
passes it just
 
05:19:34.110 --> 05:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
ends um and if that is the case I would
 
05:19:37.670 --> 05:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
request that the representative that
 
05:19:39.548 --> 05:19:39.558 align:start position:0%
made the motion
 
05:19:43.830 --> 05:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
withdraw the motion so that a different
 
05:19:48.310 --> 05:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
motion I.E a motion to retain can be
 
05:19:52.350 --> 05:19:52.360 align:start position:0%
introduced and we can do something that
 
05:19:55.830 --> 05:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
actually benefits the people that are so
 
05:19:59.548 --> 05:19:59.558 align:start position:0%
in need of recovery housing while
 
05:20:03.230 --> 05:20:03.240 align:start position:0%
maintaining local control and local
 
05:20:09.548 --> 05:20:09.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:09.558 --> 05:20:13.390 align:start position:0%
 
further

05:20:13.390 --> 05:20:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:18.270 --> 05:20:18.280 align:start position:0%
comments we we need to ex deal with this
 
05:20:21.830 --> 05:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
motion who is the who made the motion I
 
05:20:25.070 --> 05:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
did so I guess the the fair question
 
05:20:26.670 --> 05:20:26.680 align:start position:0%
would be are you interested in
 
05:20:30.910 --> 05:20:30.920 align:start position:0%
withdrawing this motion yes or no no the
 
05:20:32.350 --> 05:20:32.360 align:start position:0%
the the the
 
05:20:35.830 --> 05:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
the you said no right the representative
 
05:20:37.990 --> 05:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
that made the motion is not interested
 
05:20:40.510 --> 05:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
in withdrawing ing therefore we need to
 
05:20:42.910 --> 05:20:42.920 align:start position:0%
take a vote on this motion if this
 
05:20:46.510 --> 05:20:46.520 align:start position:0%
motion does not pass then another motion
 
05:20:49.708 --> 05:20:49.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:53.590 --> 05:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:56.350 --> 05:20:56.360 align:start position:0%
comments seeing none the motion before
 
05:20:59.788 --> 05:20:59.798 align:start position:0%
us is in expedient to legislate on House
 
05:21:02.830 --> 05:21:02.840 align:start position:0%

05:21:04.470 --> 05:21:04.480 align:start position:0%

05:24:41.110 --> 05:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
enabling a city or town Forest committee
 
05:24:43.948 --> 05:24:43.958 align:start position:0%

05:24:57.230 --> 05:24:57.240 align:start position:0%
well so we're resuming that that was
 
05:25:03.270 --> 05:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:06.628 --> 05:25:06.638 align:start position:0%
okay so I guess at this point in time I
 
05:25:15.830 --> 05:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:19.350 --> 05:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
I make a motion to accept the amendment
 
05:25:19.360 --> 05:25:20.230 align:start position:0%
I make a motion to accept the amendment
to

05:25:20.230 --> 05:25:20.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:25:26.830 --> 05:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
hb24 the amendment number 2025 d08
 
05:25:29.830 --> 05:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
61h representative Dolan seconds that
 
05:25:31.750 --> 05:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
representative fron would you like to
 
05:25:34.310 --> 05:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:38.390 --> 05:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
motion well I like the um the the new
 
05:25:41.628 --> 05:25:41.638 align:start position:0%
amendment that you you presented it did
 
05:25:45.628 --> 05:25:45.638 align:start position:0%
change um some wording in it and I also
 
05:25:49.948 --> 05:25:49.958 align:start position:0%
just like the fact that it said that um
 
05:25:52.470 --> 05:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
the fees may be offered after a majority
 
05:25:54.910 --> 05:25:54.920 align:start position:0%
vote to do so it just clears a lot of
 
05:25:57.990 --> 05:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
things up it keeps it in the unreserved
 
05:26:00.350 --> 05:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
fund balance which I think is a good
 
05:26:02.830 --> 05:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
idea as opposed to the general
 
05:26:09.230 --> 05:26:09.240 align:start position:0%

business for today and our favorite part
 
05:34:04.150 --> 05:34:04.160 align:start position:0%
of the day is afternoon
 
05:34:07.548 --> 05:34:07.558 align:start position:0%
announcements so um a house session has
 
05:34:09.868 --> 05:34:09.878 align:start position:0%
been been scheduled for Thursday March
 
05:34:13.110 --> 05:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
13th and the committee will be pleased
 
05:34:16.150 --> 05:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
to know that we have completed our
 
05:34:20.990 --> 05:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
committee work on a total of um 61
 
05:34:24.230 --> 05:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
hearings 60 house bills in one non-
 
05:34:27.190 --> 05:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
gerine amendment that had been referred
 
05:34:29.310 --> 05:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
to this
 
05:34:33.190 --> 05:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
committee um so after crossover we will
 
05:34:36.110 --> 05:34:36.120 align:start position:0%
take up our work on Senate bills that
 
05:34:38.590 --> 05:34:38.600 align:start position:0%
have been referred to that will be
 
05:34:41.270 --> 05:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
referred to this committee and I hope
 
05:34:43.670 --> 05:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
that we have less Senate bills than we
 
05:34:46.030 --> 05:34:46.040 align:start position:0%
had house
 
05:34:48.270 --> 05:34:48.280 align:start position:0%
bills oh you you
 
05:34:48.280 --> 05:34:50.070 align:start position:0%
bills oh you you
looked

05:34:50.070 --> 05:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
looked
 
05:34:53.030 --> 05:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
05:34:56.510 --> 05:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
okay so um with regards to committee
 
05:34:59.110 --> 05:34:59.120 align:start position:0%
reports generally speaking that they're
 
05:35:02.548 --> 05:35:02.558 align:start position:0%
due to the committee assistant by by
 
05:35:06.070 --> 05:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
noon on Wednesdays so again that's less
 
05:35:09.030 --> 05:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
than the 48 hours but it would be very
 
05:35:14.270 --> 05:35:14.280 align:start position:0%
nice to be able to to to have those
 
05:35:16.310 --> 05:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
um Pro
 
05:35:19.350 --> 05:35:19.360 align:start position:0%
like submitted to me so that I can do
 
05:35:21.750 --> 05:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
what I need to do so that I could pass
 
05:35:24.270 --> 05:35:24.280 align:start position:0%
them um on to the committee assistant so
 
05:35:28.030 --> 05:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
that they can do their um input into the
 
05:35:30.190 --> 05:35:30.200 align:start position:0%
system and that they finally make their
 
05:35:34.110 --> 05:35:34.120 align:start position:0%
way to the house Clerk and the
 
05:35:40.788 --> 05:35:40.798 align:start position:0%
speaker and um any questions we have any
 
05:35:46.910 --> 05:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
questions no okay no questions we're
 
05:35:51.670 --> 05:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
good no um according to to my um
 
05:35:53.948 --> 05:35:53.958 align:start position:0%
recordkeeping we're done unless
 
05:35:57.430 --> 05:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
something bizarre comes up um that I'm
 
05:36:01.830 --> 05:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
not aware of but um we've completed uh
 
05:36:04.190 --> 05:36:04.200 align:start position:0%

05:36:06.510 --> 05:36:06.520 align:start position:0%
referred to this
 
05:36:10.310 --> 05:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:13.868 --> 05:36:13.878 align:start position:0%
Davis may I make a generic
 
05:36:15.840 --> 05:36:15.850 align:start position:0%
statement only if it's
 
05:36:15.850 --> 05:36:18.510 align:start position:0%

05:36:32.190 --> 05:36:32.200 align:start position:0%
are
 
05:36:34.830 --> 05:36:34.840 align:start position:0%
considerable when we disagree we do it
 
05:36:37.150 --> 05:36:37.160 align:start position:0%
in a civil manner we don't attack one
 
05:36:41.030 --> 05:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
another we don't vilify one another and
 
05:36:44.868 --> 05:36:44.878 align:start position:0%
um frequently we are able to arrive at
 
05:36:48.230 --> 05:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
really good compromises that make bills
 
05:36:50.628 --> 05:36:50.638 align:start position:0%
better most of the time that's what
 
05:36:53.350 --> 05:36:53.360 align:start position:0%
happened it didn't happen today so much
 
05:36:55.470 --> 05:36:55.480 align:start position:0%
but that is going to happen every once
 
05:36:57.830 --> 05:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
in a while we are going to have days on
 
05:37:00.510 --> 05:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
which we largely disagree on things and
 
05:37:03.390 --> 05:37:03.400 align:start position:0%
our executive session in the last time I
 
05:37:04.830 --> 05:37:04.840 align:start position:0%
think we agreed on pretty much
 
05:37:07.670 --> 05:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
everything so once again it is my
 
05:37:10.510 --> 05:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
privilege to say how proud I am to serve
 
05:37:12.590 --> 05:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
on this committee which I consider to be
 
05:37:15.150 --> 05:37:15.160 align:start position:0%
the best Committee in the house uh and
 
05:37:18.150 --> 05:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
to work with all of my colleagues in
 
05:37:23.270 --> 05:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:26.510 --> 05:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
better thank you representative Davis I
 
05:37:30.510 --> 05:37:30.520 align:start position:0%

05:37:33.350 --> 05:37:33.360 align:start position:0%
to say that I do appreciate every single
 
05:37:34.750 --> 05:37:34.760 align:start position:0%
member of this
 
05:37:38.510 --> 05:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
committee we have um we had a very
 
05:37:42.390 --> 05:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
aggressive schedule and everybody um you
 
05:37:45.110 --> 05:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
know showed up and participated in both
 
05:37:47.670 --> 05:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
the hearings and the executive sessions
 
05:37:50.590 --> 05:37:50.600 align:start position:0%

this this year thus far has been um very
 
05:38:05.350 --> 05:38:05.360 align:start position:0%
interesting it's nothing like I've
 
05:38:09.110 --> 05:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
