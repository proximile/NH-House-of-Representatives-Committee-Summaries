the department of public works employees
 
00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
worked through
 
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
so much of the shutdown they kept our
 
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
cities and towns running
 
00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 align:start position:0%
um there's so many groups that were
 
00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
there that
 
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
originally we had this language to add
 
00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 align:start position:0%
them to define as first responses to get
 
00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 align:start position:0%
into new hampshire law religion
 
00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
originally we had the language that we
 
00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
matched from the homeland security act
 
00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
of 2002
 
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
we did work with the state fire marshal
 
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
and the emergency management director is
 
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
here today to take any questions uh to
 
00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
place that in the right spot in statute
 
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 align:start position:0%
and we did work on that where it's gonna
 
00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 align:start position:0%
if if you see fit is to keep that where
 
00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 align:start position:0%
we did place it to um
 
00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
to put in an appropriate spot is that we
 
00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
worked with together to do that but we
 
00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
did we had dpw workers running the towns
 
00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 align:start position:0%
we had mechanics and water work
 
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
professionals throughout the state that
 
00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 align:start position:0%
were on the front line managing repairs
 
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
during our shutdown
 
00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
another group that really did an
 
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
exception exceptional job was they're
 
00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 align:start position:0%
public health professionals they were
 
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
working seven days a week and i know in
 
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 align:start position:0%
manchester they started the first
 
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
drive-through testing uh in the state if
 
00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
not the country and it's just i think
 
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
it's just an important way to to
 
00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 align:start position:0%
show these employees what they've done
 
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
did for us and what they continue to do
 
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
and that's why i put in the bill and
 
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
would be glad to take any any questions
 
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
but i know there's a lot of people
 
00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 align:start position:0%
behind me experts in the field
 
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
working people and people that are
 
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
running the department of public works
 
00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much madam chair and
 
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 align:start position:0%

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
this do to first responders
 
00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
is there any practical impact well i
 
00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
would like to give that to them a lot of
 
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
that is in the emergency management part
 
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
of it the the coordination of of um
 
00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
storm damage a declaration of uh
 
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
emergency over a typical one not that we
 
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
saw on a pandemic but more the
 
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
communication of a storm damage or
 
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
something where you're getting all the
 
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
parties together
 
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
to communicate thank you very much
 
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
are there other questions representative
 
00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.749 align:start position:0%
are there other questions representative
pearson

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:21.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i was uh
 
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 align:start position:0%
i was one of the guys that worked that
 
00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:27.759 align:start position:0%
drive through
 
00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:29.919 align:start position:0%
right testing location
 
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
um did you
 
00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
and this may just be because it's
 
00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 align:start position:0%
already in statute this way but on line
 
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
five the part that says repealed has
 
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
that was that repealed a long time ago
 
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
was that being repealed as part of this
 
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh could you repeat where that was a
 
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
long time ago
 
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.029 align:start position:0%
long time ago
okay

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
i think we already have the i think i
 
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
got the answer apparently it was
 
00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
repealed a while ago okay we love to we
 
00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639 align:start position:0%
love to in the past not adjust
 
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
numbers and paragraph letters and things
 
00:05:59.189 --> 00:05:59.199 align:start position:0%
for some reason um so my other question
 
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
is then
 
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 align:start position:0%
on the new
 
00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.590 align:start position:0%
on the new
[Music]

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
section which would be i guess nine
 
00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
starting on line 26
 
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
and specifically on line 30 it starts to
 
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
when you say equipment operators are you
 
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
you're referring to public works i would
 
00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 align:start position:0%
presume since it follows the the public
 
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
works and other skilled support
 
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.309 align:start position:0%
works and other skilled support
personnel

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
personnel
 
00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
correct public works waterworks
 
00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:31.590 align:start position:0%
correct public works waterworks
mike

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
mike
 
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
is it your intention
 
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
and i i'm concerned about this being a
 
00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:39.759 align:start position:0%
something like an unattended consequence
 
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
is your intention for them at some point
 
00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
to come before this committee and ask to
 
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
be placed into group two absolutely not
 
00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
that's one of the
 
00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:47.919 align:start position:0%
first things that came up and i have no
 
00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
intention of that i don't think we
 
00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
should i think that's um they're built
 
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
into where they are where their pension
 
00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
funds are and i i
 
00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
my intention is not to allow that at all
 
00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.469 align:start position:0%
my intention is not to allow that at all
okay

00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:58.479 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 align:start position:0%
thank you for
 
00:07:01.749 --> 00:07:01.759 align:start position:0%
making sure that's on the record and
 
00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
also i want to thank you for that drive
 
00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
through uh testing too my wife was there
 
00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:06.639 align:start position:0%
too at the time was working for
 
00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
manchester water and mitch's the health
 
00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
department she's no longer there but you
 
00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
guys did an incredible job there were
 
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
long hours and a lot of people coming
 
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 align:start position:0%
through at a time when we didn't have a
 
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
vaccine and we didn't know how deadly
 
00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
this was so thank you we fought each
 
00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:20.319 align:start position:0%
other over who was going to be testing
 
00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:21.310 align:start position:0%
the aldermen by the way
 
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:22.950 align:start position:0%
the aldermen by the way
[Laughter]

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien has a question
 
00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you senator
 
00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh basically am i
 
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
correct in assuming
 
00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
that this already exists in the incident
 
00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:42.639 align:start position:0%
command structure within what is adopted
 
00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 align:start position:0%
with most fire and police in this
 
00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
particular state
 
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
so in the in it's in the command
 
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
structure if something was needed from
 
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
public works or something like that they
 
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
would come in so what this clearly is
 
00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
the intent of this is to give it
 
00:07:59.029 --> 00:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
legitimate authority that they are
 
00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
included as first responders to deal
 
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
let's say in the example of a flood
 
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
situation where uh slush gate did not
 
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
operate the neighborhood's being flooded
 
00:08:10.469 --> 00:08:10.479 align:start position:0%
the fire department is the lead
 
00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
organization but would seek to help a
 
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
public works to help alleviate that so
 
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
i'd be correct in assuming that you
 
00:08:18.629 --> 00:08:18.639 align:start position:0%
would be and that's what we did work
 
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
with the state fire marshal and the
 
00:08:21.589 --> 00:08:21.599 align:start position:0%
emergency management director we do not
 
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
want to intend this to change the
 
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
structure we want to keep the structure
 
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
the way it is but add those um
 
00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:30.479 align:start position:0%
dpw workers water works health care
 
00:08:33.029 --> 00:08:33.039 align:start position:0%
worker health department workers on that
 
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
um but not
 
00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
it was very
 
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
it was good work to work with those two
 
00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:41.039 align:start position:0%
groups to say we in no way want to
 
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
change the command
 
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.590 align:start position:0%
change the command
structure

00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
structure
 
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:46.470 align:start position:0%

okay

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:46.480 align:start position:0%

the very first on the scene
 
00:10:58.069 --> 00:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
semi likened it to the world war ii u.s

navy seabees which cleared the
 
00:11:01.269 --> 00:11:01.279 align:start position:0%
obstructions for landing crafts so the
 
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
u.s marine corps could reach the beach
 
00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:06.399 align:start position:0%
some people might disagree with that but
 
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
i know many would take exception to this
 
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
but hope you understand that most times
 
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
public works employees are the first on
 
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
the scene okay public works personnel
 
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
are essential workers critical to the

and keeping the roads clear of
 
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
obstructions are a few of the
 
00:11:32.069 --> 00:11:32.079 align:start position:0%
reoccurring events that public works
 
00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:33.519 align:start position:0%
deals with
 
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:35.200 align:start position:0%
if the roads are not safe other
 
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
emergency responders are hampered or
 
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
prevented from performing their duties
 
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
i hope you recognize the important role
 
00:11:44.949 --> 00:11:44.959 align:start position:0%
of public works personnel perform
 
00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:47.519 align:start position:0%

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
could that be like one of the potential
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
benefits that could come up so they can
 
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
do that now through the
 
00:14:29.829 --> 00:14:29.839 align:start position:0%
many grant opportunities that the state
 
00:14:29.839 --> 00:14:31.590 align:start position:0%
many grant opportunities that the state
has

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.389 align:start position:0%
has
but

00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
you never know when grant opportunities
 
00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
may present themselves so this will help
 
00:14:37.199 --> 00:14:38.389 align:start position:0%
may present themselves so this will help
them

00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
in a disaster to make sure that
 
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
they are now but we just want to make
 
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
sure that public works is truly
 
00:14:47.430 --> 00:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
recognized as one of our first
 
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
responders in the state and if there is
 
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
a disaster that they
 
00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
are afforded the opportunity for
 
00:14:57.509 --> 00:14:57.519 align:start position:0%
reimbursement of expenses they are now
 
00:14:59.590 --> 00:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
but it's just in writing so it
 
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:11.360 align:start position:0%
thank you director harper um
 
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
i'm just thinking i have a master's
 
00:15:14.069 --> 00:15:14.079 align:start position:0%
degree in emergency management so i'm
 
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
thinking back to
 
00:15:18.389 --> 00:15:18.399 align:start position:0%
my time at oklahoma state in the infancy
 
00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
of this profession and
 
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
things have certainly changed and
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
evolved over time
 
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
and you touched a little bit in your
 
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
answer with chief o'brien or sorry
 
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien as far as
 
00:15:33.509 --> 00:15:33.519 align:start position:0%
as what
 
00:15:33.519 --> 00:15:35.110 align:start position:0%
as what
this

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
some of the things that this could
 
00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
potentially do
 
00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
but in reference to what chairman
 
00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
mcguire said you know other than
 
00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:45.519 align:start position:0%
some feel-good stuff what is
 
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
what does the world look like for you
 
00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:51.759 align:start position:0%
once this passes what is different
 
00:15:53.829 --> 00:15:53.839 align:start position:0%
that this bill does that it does that
 
00:16:02.069 --> 00:16:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
like you said it's feel good it clearly
 
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
recognizes public works as one of new
 
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire's first responders like i said
 
00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
to representative o'brien
 
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
public works and as the gentleman just
 
00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
spoke is very integral to emergency
 
00:16:21.749 --> 00:16:21.759 align:start position:0%
response as you all know um
 
00:16:21.759 --> 00:16:25.030 align:start position:0%
response as you all know um
the

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
public works association that we work
 
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
with now
 
00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
are really great partners
 
00:16:33.199 --> 00:16:35.430 align:start position:0%
are really great partners
and

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
we need to get more of the communities
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
into that association but i think with
 
00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
this it
 
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
clearly defines them as part of the
 
00:16:46.949 --> 00:16:46.959 align:start position:0%
incident command structure
 
00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
part of when there is an emergency that
 
00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%
they're in the emergency operations
 
00:16:52.079 --> 00:16:54.230 align:start position:0%
they're in the emergency operations
center

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
center
 
00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
providing data providing information to
 
00:16:58.710 --> 00:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
make decisions whether it's in hampton
 
00:17:02.069 --> 00:17:02.079 align:start position:0%
or manchester or concord or wherever
 
00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
for the incident commanders
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
responding to whatever flood tornado
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
whatever um
 
00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:11.089 align:start position:0%
they've been
 
00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:12.549 align:start position:0%
they've been
[Music]

00:17:12.549 --> 00:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to say left out
 
00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:18.079 align:start position:0%
but left out of you know being
 
00:17:21.429 --> 00:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
i don't know how else to answer your
 
00:17:22.799 --> 00:17:25.750 align:start position:0%
i don't know how else to answer your
question

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
okay so what i'm getting from this is
 
00:17:29.669 --> 00:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
that this is basically a this will
 
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:36.400 align:start position:0%
lines of communication
 
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
in the sense of
 
00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
some of the reimbursements that occur
 
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
from the federal government
 
00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.029 align:start position:0%
from the federal government
so

00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:45.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
so if we have let me use an example so
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
we had the july storms out in cheshire
 
00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
and sullivan county flooding and we got
 
00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
a presidential disaster declaration for
 
00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.630 align:start position:0%
a presidential disaster declaration for
them

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:57.510 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
public works as well as new hampshire
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
d.o.t public works state level
 
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
were out there night and day for many
 
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
and the work that they do
 
00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
will be reimbursed
 
00:18:20.710 --> 00:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
by fema
 
00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.549 align:start position:0%
by fema
90

00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
90
 
00:18:24.549 --> 00:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate at this point
 
00:18:24.559 --> 00:18:27.190 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate at this point
and

00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
those eligible activities get documented
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
the work gets done they get reimbursed
 
00:18:34.799 --> 00:18:37.270 align:start position:0%
the work gets done they get reimbursed
so

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
the communications
 
00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
the collaboration and the reimbursements
 
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
for disaster declarations
 
00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.590 align:start position:0%
for disaster declarations
all

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
this enhances that um
 
00:18:51.029 --> 00:18:51.039 align:start position:0%
it's not a re you know it's not required
 
00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
by the federal government that we list
 
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
every single first responder
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
it just helps us with our emergency
 
00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.270 align:start position:0%
it just helps us with our emergency
planning

00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
planning
 
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
process and procedures and the plans
 
00:19:05.909 --> 00:19:05.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you
 
00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:08.830 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you
representative

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
bailey thank you
 
00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
several witnesses have spoken in terms
 
00:19:18.789 --> 00:19:18.799 align:start position:0%
of a command structure that's in place
 
00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:21.039 align:start position:0%
and not all of the entities listed here
 
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:22.840 align:start position:0%
are public
 
00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
entities and by including them in this
 
00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
list does that imply that you will
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
well you might
 
00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:36.640 align:start position:0%
you might cooperate with them but no no
 
00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
no we already do that yeah that's
 
00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:38.870 align:start position:0%
no we already do that yeah that's
already

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:19:40.549 --> 00:19:40.559 align:start position:0%
private and public partnerships are very
 
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
integral to the incident command
 
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
structure and that has existed for a
 
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
long time partners don't command yes
 
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
they do in this case they do
 
00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
ah then they're not partners are they
 
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
we'll take we'll take this up in private
 
00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
i think gentlemen
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
uh i do have one question i'm from a
 
00:19:58.549 --> 00:19:58.559 align:start position:0%
small town we don't have a public works
 
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
department would this would that be
 
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
essentially our road agent and his crew
 
00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
yes yes thank you and hopefully you
 
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
belong to the public works mutual aid
 
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
assistance group
 
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
beyond my scope
 
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
representative judy yes good morning
 
00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.549 align:start position:0%
representative judy yes good morning
director

00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:16.559 align:start position:0%
director
 
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
um i see and i understand
 
00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
the homeland security
 
00:20:25.029 --> 00:20:25.039 align:start position:0%
but i would like to know if we don't put
 
00:20:28.549 --> 00:20:28.559 align:start position:0%
why we don't put national guards
 
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
in that emergency the national guard the
 
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
national guard is a as a state partner
 
00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
with us in the emergency operations
 
00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:36.310 align:start position:0%
with us in the emergency operations
center

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
center
 
00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
yep so they are when we activate the
 
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
state emergency operations center for

all right thank you yes representative
 
00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
o'brien excuse me uh thank you madam
 
00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
chair uh
 
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:12.640 align:start position:0%
your comment uh kind of got me so my
 
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
question to you
 
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh in nashua we're pretty prepared we're
 
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
very fortunate to have our own emergency
 
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
preparedness director
 
00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.110 align:start position:0%
preparedness director
but

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
the chairman chairwoman brought up a
 
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
very good point some communities cannot
 
00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
or do not you know have an emergency
 
00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
preparedness so this is up makes it
 
00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:34.559 align:start position:0%
an enlightenment in a way that they can
 
00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
now think of this to extend within the
 
00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
incident command system so this will
 
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
definitely help where no thought was
 
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:44.240 align:start position:0%
previously thought to a road agent or
 
00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
something like that that he is part of
 
00:21:47.909 --> 00:21:47.919 align:start position:0%
this right emergency preparedness
 
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
sustainability so i know we use the word
 
00:21:52.149 --> 00:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
public works but that also equates back
 
00:21:53.909 --> 00:21:53.919 align:start position:0%
to what representative mcguire said to
 
00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
your road agent same
 
00:21:59.590 --> 00:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
synonymous well not exactly but very
 
00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:02.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:09.039 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much
 
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%

many of the emergency services we offer
 
00:25:24.789 --> 00:25:24.799 align:start position:0%
are often taken for granted because they
 
00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
occur on such a regular basis that
 
00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
people don't think of what daily life
 
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
would be like without them
 
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
one of the most well-known emergency
 
00:25:33.669 --> 00:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
services that we provide are winter
 
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
operations which include snow plowing
 
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
and treatment on roads dpws are on call
 
00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
24 7 to provide those emergency services
 
00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
during snowstorms and without dpw first
 
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
responders travel on roads could quickly
 
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
become impassable for the public
 
00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
including police and fire departments
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
trying to respond to their own emergency
 
00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:53.029 align:start position:0%
trying to respond to their own emergency
calls

00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
calls
 
00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
accidents would increase exponentially
 
00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
and so would the burden on police and
 
00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559 align:start position:0%
fire departments to those accident
 
00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559 align:start position:0%
scenes without the emergency services
 
00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
provided by dpw
 
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
other weather-related emergencies that
 
00:26:07.029 --> 00:26:07.039 align:start position:0%
dpw first responders
 
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
respond to which are less common but can
 
00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
significantly impact travel on roads are
 
00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:13.120 align:start position:0%

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
during these events many roads need to
 
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
be temporarily shut down due to varying
 
00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
hazards and dpw's on-call 24 7 to
 
00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:23.120 align:start position:0%
provide emergency services such as
 
00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
unclogging drainage pipes and structures
 
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
removing trees and limbs from the travel
 
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
ways placement of barricades and signage

even after intense rain and flooding
 
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
events are over there are often weeks
 
00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
that dpw is involved in the cleanup and
 
00:26:40.149 --> 00:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
repair of the washouts and opening up

emergency services by dpw the public
 
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
would be at a high risk for traveling on
 
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
countless unsafe roads and police and
 
00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:54.400 align:start position:0%
fire response could be negatively
 
00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:55.830 align:start position:0%
fire response could be negatively
impacted

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:55.840 align:start position:0%

00:26:59.430 --> 00:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
overlooked critical service provided by

dpw personnel is solid waste management

solid waste and maintaining a functional
 
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
water and sewer system became an

immediate essential service that could
 
00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
not shut down
 
00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
dpws who were short staffed due the
 
00:27:19.269 --> 00:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
pandemic had to shift employees around
 
00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:21.200 align:start position:0%
to provide critical coverage at each of
 
00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:22.640 align:start position:0%

i encourage all of you to support sb 325
 
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
and recognize public works employees as

the first responders they already are
 
00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:19.919 align:start position:0%
and will continue to be with or without
 
00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
the recognition that they deserve in
 
00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:23.200 align:start position:0%

00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:47.919 align:start position:0%
this one sounds like a relatively
 
00:29:51.029 --> 00:29:51.039 align:start position:0%
harmless way to be nice to people that's
 
00:30:05.029 --> 00:30:05.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:20.720 align:start position:0%

hearing
 
00:32:27.669 --> 00:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
350 senate bill 357
 
00:32:29.509 --> 00:32:29.519 align:start position:0%
of which i am the prime sponsor for the
 
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
record my name is regina bartzel i am
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
the state senator for district 19 which
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
encompasses the towns of derry hampstead
 
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
and windham
 
00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.710 align:start position:0%
and windham
and

00:32:40.710 --> 00:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
senate bill 357
 
00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
i also sit as chair of the commission on
 
00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
ptsd so what this bill does we decided
 
00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
start a little early and
 
00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:57.519 align:start position:0%
reconstitute the commission on ptsd for
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
first responders so this
 
00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
allows us to continue our work come
 
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
november when the commit commission
 
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
ends it also requires and this was a
 
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
bill that was put in last year and got
 
00:33:14.470 --> 00:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
taken out during the omnibus
 
00:33:17.590 --> 00:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
debacles i'll say
 
00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
so it requires
 
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
first responders to be trained in ptsd
 
00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:23.909 align:start position:0%
first responders to be trained in ptsd
and

00:33:23.909 --> 00:33:23.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:27.519 align:start position:0%
fire right now firefighters and
 
00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:30.559 align:start position:0%
police officers are required to have
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
when they're going through their
 
00:33:33.509 --> 00:33:33.519 align:start position:0%
training before they take on a job when
 
00:33:35.509 --> 00:33:35.519 align:start position:0%
they're going through the police academy
 
00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
or the fire academy it requires them to
 
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
be trained in p um in ptsd as well as an
 
00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
annual online training one of the things
 
00:33:48.149 --> 00:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
that we found in the commission was
 
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:51.440 align:start position:0%
there and this is all levels of fire and
 
00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
and police what we found in the
 
00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
commission is it's really needs a
 
00:33:57.269 --> 00:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
culture change
 
00:33:59.830 --> 00:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
and the culture is actually changing to
 
00:34:01.669 --> 00:34:01.679 align:start position:0%
address ptsd
 
00:34:04.470 --> 00:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
but i think this this will help
 
00:34:08.069 --> 00:34:08.079 align:start position:0%
allow the leadership in the fire and the
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
police to understand ptsd and it also
 
00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.629 align:start position:0%
police to understand ptsd and it also
allows

00:34:12.629 --> 00:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
allows
 
00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
the young
 
00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:16.720 align:start position:0%
police officers and firefighters coming
 
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
up through to understand that there is
 
00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:21.190 align:start position:0%
up through to understand that there is
ptsd

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
ptsd
 
00:34:23.109 --> 00:34:23.119 align:start position:0%
attached to some of these
 
00:34:24.869 --> 00:34:24.879 align:start position:0%
these jobs that they do
 
00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
so with that i'll try and
 
00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:33.839 align:start position:0%
good morning senator i have one question
 
00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:35.919 align:start position:0%
i noticed the fiscal note mentions an
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
impact on
 
00:34:41.589 --> 00:34:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:44.149 --> 00:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
it should not impact local communities
 
00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:45.919 align:start position:0%
because as firefighters go through the
 
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
fire academy this is going to be a
 
00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:49.909 align:start position:0%
fire academy this is going to be a
training

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:49.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
yes but
 
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
we have currently have
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
firefighters and police officers
 
00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
who have not yet gone through that train
 
00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure other towns and cities are
 
00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839 align:start position:0%
in the same situation are you only
 
00:35:06.069 --> 00:35:06.079 align:start position:0%
making it available
 
00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
and requiring new officers to be trained
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
or are you expecting to go back and
 
00:35:13.829 --> 00:35:13.839 align:start position:0%
train every existing fire firefighter or
 
00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
police officer no the intent is just
 
00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
new ones coming up but
 
00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
everyone will be required to do an
 
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
online training which is actually no
 
00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:23.829 align:start position:0%
online training which is actually no
cost

00:35:23.829 --> 00:35:23.839 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
from what i've heard is it cost
 
00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
online training is actually no cost nami
 
00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
is also going to help provide with that
 
00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:32.550 align:start position:0%
is also going to help provide with that
okay

00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
so i will uh
 
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
so i think we will need to make very s
 
00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
very clear
 
00:35:41.510 --> 00:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
that it is
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
no effort is required on the part of
 
00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.390 align:start position:0%
no effort is required on the part of
current

00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
current
 
00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
officers and first responders other than
 
00:35:51.109 --> 00:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
taking the online training
 
00:35:53.349 --> 00:35:53.359 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you does anyone else
 
00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman good morning
 
00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:04.470 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman good morning
senator

00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:04.480 align:start position:0%
senator
 
00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
so this is a quite a
 
00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
large commission
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
uh uh have you already been in contact
 
00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:11.750 align:start position:0%
uh uh have you already been in contact
with

00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
all the constituent organizations
 
00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
with regard to their
 
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
abilities and or willingness to
 
00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:20.630 align:start position:0%
abilities and or willingness to
participate

00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
participate
 
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
yes we have the chief
 
00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
as you can see the the membership on the
 
00:36:27.589 --> 00:36:27.599 align:start position:0%
commission is probably quite broad we
 
00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
actually opened it up to
 
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
the commissioner of corrections as well
 
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
so the chief the
 
00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:38.720 align:start position:0%
chief of police association is a member
 
00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:40.069 align:start position:0%
chief of police association is a member
the

00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:40.079 align:start position:0%

members of nashua manchester police the
 
00:36:43.599 --> 00:36:45.510 align:start position:0%
members of nashua manchester police the
firefighters

00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
firefighters
 
00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
professional firefighters of new
 
00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire are members and they they all
 
00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
agree that this is really needed
 
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
are there other questions
 
00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you senator
 
00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
now i am
 
00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:37:29.109 --> 00:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:32.480 align:start position:0%
madam chair members of the committee uh
 
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
my name is david goldstein for the
 
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
record i'm presently the chief of police
 
00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:38.240 align:start position:0%
in the city of franklin i've been there
 
00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
for over 13 years as chief
 
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
i've been a police officer for over 42
 
00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:45.430 align:start position:0%
i've been a police officer for over 42
years

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:47.829 --> 00:37:47.839 align:start position:0%
i didn't prepare any specific remarks
 
00:37:49.349 --> 00:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
for this morning i know that this has
 
00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
been floating around the legislature for
 
00:37:53.589 --> 00:37:53.599 align:start position:0%
a while and i wanted to this morning to
 
00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
speak a little bit both from the head
 
00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
and the heart
 
00:37:58.150 --> 00:37:58.160 align:start position:0%
about this matter
 
00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
you as members of the greatest country
 
00:38:02.069 --> 00:38:02.079 align:start position:0%
in the world have certain expectations
 
00:38:03.910 --> 00:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
of the people that are going to care for
 
00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:04.710 align:start position:0%
of the people that are going to care for
you

00:38:04.710 --> 00:38:04.720 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:06.560 align:start position:0%
in a very realistic sense
 
00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
fire police ems corrections
 
00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:11.200 align:start position:0%
we have every right in the world
 
00:38:13.030 --> 00:38:13.040 align:start position:0%
to leave your house any time of the day
 
00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
or night and feel safe
 
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
and our job is to make sure that that is
 
00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:19.829 align:start position:0%
and our job is to make sure that that is
guaranteed

00:38:19.829 --> 00:38:19.839 align:start position:0%
guaranteed
 
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
what people don't know is how the
 
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
sausage is made
 
00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly it's a very difficult
 
00:38:30.069 --> 00:38:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:31.349 --> 00:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
and i'm certainly happy to answer
 
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
questions about that
 
00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:34.480 align:start position:0%
i live in what's called the contingency
 
00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
what i call a contingency world
 
00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
that's a what-if world
 
00:38:40.950 --> 00:38:40.960 align:start position:0%
what if this what if that
 
00:38:43.109 --> 00:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
and i spend my day making decisions
 
00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:46.320 align:start position:0%
relative to that as do my offices and as
 
00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:47.839 align:start position:0%
do the rest of the first responders in
 
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
 
00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:50.710 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire
why

00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
we have a front row seat to despair on a
 
00:38:55.589 --> 00:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
daily basis
 
00:38:59.270 --> 00:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
we prepare for battle every single day
 
00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
people don't dress like this normally
 
00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:03.839 align:start position:0%
and i don't even have my body hammer on
 
00:39:05.589 --> 00:39:05.599 align:start position:0%
because i don't need it hopefully for
 
00:39:05.599 --> 00:39:08.790 align:start position:0%
because i don't need it hopefully for
today

00:39:08.790 --> 00:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:12.069 --> 00:39:12.079 align:start position:0%
we ride an emotional roller coaster
 
00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
some days are good some days are bad i
 
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
and then there's often negative public
 
00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
perception for virtually everything that
 
00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
a first responder does at any time
 
00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
because people know better than we do
 
00:39:29.589 --> 00:39:29.599 align:start position:0%
because they watch television and movies
 
00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
the problem with that is that's
 
00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.390 align:start position:0%
the problem with that is that's
two-dimensional

00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
two-dimensional
 
00:39:36.069 --> 00:39:36.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
madam chair you made a comment uh i just
 
00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
want to address and perhaps correct just
 
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
a little bit i've been teaching at the
 
00:39:45.109 --> 00:39:45.119 align:start position:0%
new hampshire police academy since 1981
 
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
and the topic that i teach for the
 
00:39:49.349 --> 00:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
recruits is mitigating and dealing with
 
00:39:51.589 --> 00:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
stress crisis and trauma in that
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
particular area
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
i've taught about ptsd
 
00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
since the dsm-2 was in vogue it's now
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
the dsm-5
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
so yes we do have a basic
 
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
knowledge of what that entails and we've
 
00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
talked about it a lot
 
00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
i think that the most important thing
 
00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
today quite frankly i'm very socratic in
 
00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
nature especially when i teach at the
 
00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
college level
 
00:40:16.309 --> 00:40:16.319 align:start position:0%
and that is questions and answers so
 
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
with that i'm going to end my testimony
 
00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
and ask if there are any questions from
 
00:40:20.950 --> 00:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
the group
 
00:40:22.230 --> 00:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative rhodes
 
00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
good morning chief thank you for taking
 
00:40:33.109 --> 00:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
my question my pleasure so um
 
00:40:35.589 --> 00:40:35.599 align:start position:0%
i'm i just have a question about the
 
00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
the annual so that you go to the
 
00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:38.870 align:start position:0%
the annual so that you go to the
training

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:40:42.309 --> 00:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
and the annual training and one of the
 
00:40:43.589 --> 00:40:43.599 align:start position:0%
i don't have a concern with having the
 
00:40:47.030 --> 00:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
training i'm just curious if if maybe a
 
00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
my concern is with the lack of
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
officers that we're hearing there's a
 
00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
lack of first responders all the way
 
00:41:01.030 --> 00:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
around and you know
 
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
obviously i'm assuming you'd probably
 
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
stagger this but what would happen if a
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
person's you know their year is up and
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
they haven't gone to the training yet
 
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
what exactly would be the role there
 
00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
would it be when you just can't go until
 
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
you've had this training or is there
 
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
going to be like a little bit of elapsed
 
00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
time in there should it be maybe
 
00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
bi-annually just to kind of i can't
 
00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
really imagine it's going to change that
 
00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
much in a year
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
as far as the updates
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
representative pearson's giving me dirty
 
00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:32.069 --> 00:41:32.079 align:start position:0%
not me
 
00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
no are you talking about uh people that
 
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:36.240 align:start position:0%
are already on duty and in the system
 
00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:38.470 align:start position:0%
are already on duty and in the system
themselves

00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
yes i'm i'm looking at the page three
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's actually on on line 10 where it
 
00:41:45.990 --> 00:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
says the subsequent initial training and
 
00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:46.870 align:start position:0%
says the subsequent initial training and
then

00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
um that you have to complete
 
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
my understanding from this would be
 
00:41:53.349 --> 00:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
annually after that like like continue
 
00:41:55.589 --> 00:41:55.599 align:start position:0%
like continuing ed i would think is that
 
00:41:58.870 --> 00:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
the understanding yes um
 
00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
if we're going to be professional like
 
00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
any other profession law medicine etc we
 
00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:05.599 align:start position:0%
have to have ongoing education
 
00:42:07.589 --> 00:42:07.599 align:start position:0%
and we do do that and being familiar
 
00:42:09.430 --> 00:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
with how the academy works and how they
 
00:42:12.069 --> 00:42:12.079 align:start position:0%
develop classes and try to stay up to
 
00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
date with things like this absolutely
 
00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
this is done we also have on ground
 
00:42:18.069 --> 00:42:18.079 align:start position:0%
training uh that's often what we call
 
00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
in-service and we do that advanced
 
00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
classes on stress management crisis
 
00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
trauma for both line offices supervisors
 
00:42:27.910 --> 00:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
and for chiefs of police or command
 
00:42:30.390 --> 00:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
personnel so yeah there's there's
 
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
nothing that would preclude us from
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
being able to do this i do this all the
 
00:42:35.109 --> 00:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
time in my department if something new
 
00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:36.720 align:start position:0%
comes down that's necessary and it's
 
00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:37.829 align:start position:0%
comes down that's necessary and it's
online

00:42:37.829 --> 00:42:37.839 align:start position:0%
online
 
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
what my full expectation is the officer
 
00:42:41.030 --> 00:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
is going to sit down at his or her
 
00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:42.150 align:start position:0%
is going to sit down at his or her
computer

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:42.160 align:start position:0%
computer
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
and take the class and and go from there
 
00:42:46.069 --> 00:42:46.079 align:start position:0%
hopefully that helps address your
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
question so to do it annually would not
 
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
be a large a large problem
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
so so it's your understanding that
 
00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
once the course is developed it would be
 
00:42:58.870 --> 00:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
available for all the officers in the
 
00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
state to take at their convenience sure
 
00:43:01.359 --> 00:43:02.230 align:start position:0%
state to take at their convenience sure
yes

00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:43:05.109 --> 00:43:05.119 align:start position:0%
which makes sense i have a question i
 
00:43:09.430 --> 00:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
after this is
 
00:43:13.430 --> 00:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
like at the bottom of page one
 
00:43:15.109 --> 00:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
to say that
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
current law enforcement officers are
 
00:43:20.069 --> 00:43:20.079 align:start position:0%
encouraged to attend such training
 
00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
programs but are only required to
 
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
successfully complete the annual online
 
00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:26.710 align:start position:0%
successfully complete the annual online
training

00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:28.640 align:start position:0%
to make it clear that we are not
 
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
imposing a mandate on the towns that
 
00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
aren't perhaps not as well organized as
 
00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:34.470 align:start position:0%
aren't perhaps not as well organized as
yours

00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
yours
 
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
that would that be the
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
would that clarify your intention on
 
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
this that they're encouraged to attend
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
but it's not a not a mandate that they
 
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
sign up for a major course
 
00:43:48.870 --> 00:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
would prefer a mandate
 
00:43:53.750 --> 00:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
personally uh and it doesn't cost me any
 
00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
extra money to do that
 
00:43:58.230 --> 00:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
if i've got an officer who's on duty and
 
00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
he he or she needs to take an hour off
 
00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
to do a course we do that now with a
 
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
variety of things right so
 
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
i don't see that as as interfering or
 
00:44:09.109 --> 00:44:09.119 align:start position:0%
becoming a female i meant that
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
you said you have on ground training and
 
00:44:12.069 --> 00:44:12.079 align:start position:0%
things like yes
 
00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
yes so i would say that someone who's
 
00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
been a police officer
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
well you started in 81 so that's that's
 
00:44:20.069 --> 00:44:20.079 align:start position:0%
a long time ago
 
00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
actually started in 79 but that's a
 
00:44:23.589 --> 00:44:23.599 align:start position:0%
whole nother story
 
00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:26.720 align:start position:0%
round right okay so
 
00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:27.910 align:start position:0%
round right okay so
um

00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll talk about that because i'm
 
00:44:32.390 --> 00:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm concerned about
 
00:44:33.829 --> 00:44:33.839 align:start position:0%
people who are
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
who have had some formal training in the
 
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.349 align:start position:0%
who have had some formal training in the
past

00:44:37.349 --> 00:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
past
 
00:44:39.349 --> 00:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
and now that they don't want to think
 
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
that they're now required to take a
 
00:44:43.109 --> 00:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
week's course at the police standards
 
00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
and training or whatever it wouldn't be
 
00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
a week's course anyway and and i'd
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
certainly be happy to discuss it further
 
00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that's just my concern
 
00:44:53.109 --> 00:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien
 
00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
thank you um along that vein though
 
00:44:59.750 --> 00:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh from people i know
 
00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
that have suffered with this and you
 
00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
know i come from the firefighting ranks
 
00:45:07.109 --> 00:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
ptsd is an insidious disease or
 
00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
affliction uh a lot of people have it
 
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
that realize that they don't have it
 
00:45:14.069 --> 00:45:14.079 align:start position:0%
right because of the counterculture of
 
00:45:14.079 --> 00:45:15.030 align:start position:0%
right because of the counterculture of
the

00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
police or fire i mean
 
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
you know scraping the body off the floor
 
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
that's part of what we do
 
00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
and it may affect you
 
00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
and may it not affect you
 
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
you never know when it's going to hit so
 
00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:28.950 align:start position:0%
you never know when it's going to hit so
mandatory

00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
mandatory
 
00:45:31.349 --> 00:45:31.359 align:start position:0%
is the key here to really get the people
 
00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:33.680 align:start position:0%
in because they're not going to show you
 
00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
any outside signs until they're drunk or
 
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
maybe committing suicide
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
i can't disagree with that i've been i'm
 
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
a member of two critical instant stress
 
00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
management teams so certainly i see this
 
00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:48.480 align:start position:0%
and my own career the things i've had to
 
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
do and be involved in certainly i agree
 
00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
with you
 
00:45:54.309 --> 00:45:54.319 align:start position:0%
the statistics are staggering for all
 
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
first responders
 
00:45:57.589 --> 00:45:57.599 align:start position:0%
as to how many of us are actually
 
00:46:00.069 --> 00:46:00.079 align:start position:0%
walking around with ptsd
 
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
clinically speaking the uh however
 
00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
behind that is the fact that the
 
00:46:07.030 --> 00:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
american psychiatric association updates
 
00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
their diagnostic and statistical manual
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
every five to seven years and the
 
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
criteria may change so we have to be
 
00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
if that happens no other questions
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair good morning chief
 
00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
good morning good to see you again
 
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
always um
 
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
we had another bill a couple of days ago
 
00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:40.829 --> 00:46:40.839 align:start position:0%
police officers and corrections
 
00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
officers before us and
 
00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:45.280 align:start position:0%
that the testimony
 
00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
in general quite
 
00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:48.150 align:start position:0%
in general quite
uh

00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
quite uh
 
00:46:51.589 --> 00:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
shattering is probably too strong a word
 
00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
but but really quite emotionally uh
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
devastating for me hearing the kinds of
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
things that uh these police officers
 
00:47:01.829 --> 00:47:01.839 align:start position:0%
have experienced on a virtually daily
 
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
basis dead children for example uh
 
00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:06.069 align:start position:0%
basis dead children for example uh
uh

00:47:06.069 --> 00:47:06.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
one can imagine all kinds of
 
00:47:10.870 --> 00:47:10.880 align:start position:0%
circumstances in which death suddenly
 
00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
is thrust upon an uns suspecting person
 
00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:15.200 align:start position:0%
of any age
 
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
but but a dead child is always a special
 
00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
tragedy uh but but i don't think i even
 
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
though i could theorize about it uh
 
00:47:27.109 --> 00:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
i don't think i'd ever really heard that
 
00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
kind of testimony before
 
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
we know that combat veterans for example
 
00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
very often don't talk about their
 
00:47:35.829 --> 00:47:35.839 align:start position:0%
experiences in combat at all
 
00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
i i served in the lower but never saw
 
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.190 align:start position:0%
i i served in the lower but never saw
combat

00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
combat
 
00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:39.990 align:start position:0%
combat
uh

00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:47:42.069 --> 00:47:42.079 align:start position:0%
your question
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
madam chair there's always a question
 
00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
sometimes it has to be framed a little
 
00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
bit the chief was not here for that
 
00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
particular hearing that's why i let you
 
00:47:52.470 --> 00:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
introduce it yeah i'm sure he can
 
00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
easily imagine
 
00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
the kinds of things i'm talking about
 
00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
but but
 
00:47:58.950 --> 00:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
mental strain that police officers and
 
00:48:04.470 --> 00:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
firefighters emergency responders of all
 
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
kinds i can be subjected to
 
00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
suddenly or routinely
 
00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
has got to be a matter of tremendous
 
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
concern to their families as well
 
00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:16.309 align:start position:0%
concern to their families as well
so

00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:16.319 --> 00:48:17.349 align:start position:0%
so
uh

00:48:17.349 --> 00:48:17.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:48:18.630 --> 00:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
this this
 
00:48:20.710 --> 00:48:20.720 align:start position:0%
mental health training
 
00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
for first responders what are we doing
 
00:48:25.349 --> 00:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
for the family members especially
 
00:48:25.359 --> 00:48:26.549 align:start position:0%
for the family members especially
spouses

00:48:26.549 --> 00:48:26.559 align:start position:0%
spouses
 
00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
uh who see their their their loved one
 
00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:32.559 align:start position:0%
uh you know coming back after a
 
00:48:35.109 --> 00:48:35.119 align:start position:0%
difficult experience but they they're
 
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
impacted as well what are we doing for
 
00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:38.790 align:start position:0%
impacted as well what are we doing for
them

00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:48:41.349 --> 00:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
nothing in this bill i'm sorry nothing
 
00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
in this bill addresses that correct
 
00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:44.720 align:start position:0%
that's correct correct well yes but
 
00:48:46.230 --> 00:48:46.240 align:start position:0%
we're do we
 
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
we're developing expertise you've been
 
00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
doing this for over 40 years quickly
 
00:48:53.109 --> 00:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
doing the math uh it was an easy one
 
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
with the years you gave
 
00:48:57.910 --> 00:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh so you you're developing expertise
 
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:00.720 align:start position:0%
what what how we can we make that
 
00:49:03.349 --> 00:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
available to family members
 
00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question
 
00:49:07.589 --> 00:49:07.599 align:start position:0%
representative and um
 
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit of a complex answer so
 
00:49:12.309 --> 00:49:12.319 align:start position:0%
i'm going to just take a couple moments
 
00:49:14.549 --> 00:49:14.559 align:start position:0%
to to address that
 
00:49:16.309 --> 00:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
similar to what uh representative
 
00:49:18.549 --> 00:49:18.559 align:start position:0%
o'brien was saying uh the attitude used
 
00:49:20.549 --> 00:49:20.559 align:start position:0%
to be suck it up buttercup
 
00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:22.000 align:start position:0%
and if you can't take it find another
 
00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
job it was that simple in the old days
 
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh i actually began this work in the
 
00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:28.950 align:start position:0%
uh i actually began this work in the
mid-1970s

00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
mid-1970s
 
00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
before i ever became a police officer
 
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
when i was in graduate school doing some
 
00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
clinical work
 
00:49:35.829 --> 00:49:35.839 align:start position:0%
and then i became a police officer and
 
00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
carried that over
 
00:49:40.549 --> 00:49:40.559 align:start position:0%
so what we try to do is early on in the
 
00:49:42.309 --> 00:49:42.319 align:start position:0%
academy when when i get these
 
00:49:44.470 --> 00:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
individuals for a grand total of four
 
00:49:44.480 --> 00:49:45.750 align:start position:0%
individuals for a grand total of four
hours

00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
hours
 
00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:49.040 align:start position:0%
i try to include the issues dealing with
 
00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:50.950 align:start position:0%
i try to include the issues dealing with
family

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
family
 
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
as best that i can
 
00:49:55.109 --> 00:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
in the in service training the on ground
 
00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
in service training we tried to do that
 
00:49:59.750 --> 00:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
as well what i have found over the years
 
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
is as this has become more of a cause
 
00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:04.960 align:start position:0%
celeb and we understand more about this
 
00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:05.990 align:start position:0%
celeb and we understand more about this
um

00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:07.589 --> 00:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
and we conduct what are known as
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
critical instance stress debriefings
 
00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
after an issue like that for example
 
00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
which is a relatively new
 
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh it's been around for a while but the
 
00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
the enactment of that is relatively new
 
00:50:23.030 --> 00:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
we spend a lot of time in those
 
00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
debriefings talking to the individuals
 
00:50:27.270 --> 00:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
involved about how their families are
 
00:50:29.510 --> 00:50:29.520 align:start position:0%
going to be affected
 
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
the reality is we hope that the message
 
00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:33.440 align:start position:0%
gets home
 
00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
one way or another
 
00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
there is no bill there is no statute
 
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
there is no rule that requires families
 
00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:42.800 align:start position:0%
be involved uh and quite frankly some of
 
00:50:45.349 --> 00:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
my colleagues and i'm sure some of fire
 
00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:47.200 align:start position:0%
and ems are the same way they go home
 
00:50:49.589 --> 00:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
how was your day dear no big deal
 
00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
until the uh until the plastic trash
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
barrel in the kitchen goes flying by you
 
00:50:56.069 --> 00:50:56.079 align:start position:0%
your your significant other's right ear
 
00:50:58.790 --> 00:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
and then say hmm bad day type of thing
 
00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
so this is something that we still need
 
00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
to work on we have been doing that i
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
will say that
 
00:51:06.309 --> 00:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
um and i can certainly identify with
 
00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
some of what you said my youngest i was
 
00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
a homicide detective i was major crime
 
00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
but state police my 23 year uh 23-year
 
00:51:15.349 --> 00:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
career state police for about a dozen
 
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
years my youngest victim was 10 weeks
 
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
old here in concord so
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
who was murdered so along with her
 
00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
sisters and her mother so i understand
 
00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
exactly what you're saying and this is
 
00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
the stuff that we have to work on i wish
 
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
i had a very definitive answer for you
 
00:51:32.710 --> 00:51:32.720 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate the preamble that you
 
00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
gave but it's the best i got for the
 
00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:36.950 align:start position:0%
gave but it's the best i got for the
moment

00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
moment
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
representative judy
 
00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
good morning chief good morning
 
00:51:48.309 --> 00:51:48.319 align:start position:0%
nice to see you again oh
 
00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
uh did uh police officers
 
00:51:53.109 --> 00:51:53.119 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
00:51:56.549 --> 00:51:56.559 align:start position:0%
uh the academy did the the they have the
 
00:52:00.309 --> 00:52:00.319 align:start position:0%
training mental health training yes
 
00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
on a variety of levels nami for example
 
00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
has a course of study as well within the
 
00:52:06.549 --> 00:52:06.559 align:start position:0%
class so it's not just mine there are
 
00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
other uh there are other
 
00:52:11.829 --> 00:52:11.839 align:start position:0%
classes within the academy regimen
 
00:52:14.069 --> 00:52:14.079 align:start position:0%
itself that cover mental health issues
 
00:52:14.079 --> 00:52:14.870 align:start position:0%
itself that cover mental health issues
too

00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:52:16.230 --> 00:52:16.240 align:start position:0%
so i just don't want you to think it's
 
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
just mine there are others but i do have
 
00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:19.750 align:start position:0%
just mine there are others but i do have
them

00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:27.109 --> 00:52:27.119 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
00:52:28.390 --> 00:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:52:35.109 --> 00:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:36.309 --> 00:52:36.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for the record representative

pearson rockingham district six dairy
 
00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
i just i sit on the ptsd commission
 
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
right now and i just wanted to address a
 
00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
couple of things that i've heard um
 
00:52:48.150 --> 00:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt you talked about
 
00:52:49.589 --> 00:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
size and scope of the commission the
 
00:52:52.069 --> 00:52:52.079 align:start position:0%
commission already exists these
 
00:52:54.069 --> 00:52:54.079 align:start position:0%
positions are already filled and there's
 
00:52:55.589 --> 00:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
already people doing them
 
00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:57.200 align:start position:0%
the commission is extraordinarily active
 
00:52:59.750 --> 00:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
and meets monthly and it's working and
 
00:53:02.549 --> 00:53:02.559 align:start position:0%
the agencies seem to be fine with
 
00:53:02.559 --> 00:53:03.990 align:start position:0%
the agencies seem to be fine with
with

00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
as far as family members go
 
00:53:11.910 --> 00:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in state statute that
 
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
dictates family members but one of the
 
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
things that
 
00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
some of the communities have done upon
 
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
themselves especially the city of
 
00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
manchester has is to provide
 
00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
some of that awareness training to
 
00:53:24.309 --> 00:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
family members and we've done that
 
00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
three times in the city of manchester in
 
00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
the last two years so that's not really
 
00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
a state requirement but some communities
 
00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:31.430 align:start position:0%
a state requirement but some communities
are

00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
bringing that upon themselves to do that
 
00:53:36.150 --> 00:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
and that's certainly their their choice
 
00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:37.030 align:start position:0%
and that's certainly their their choice
um

00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:39.910 --> 00:53:39.920 align:start position:0%
if if you're looking to expand that
 
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
i would i would say that you know we
 
00:53:43.829 --> 00:53:43.839 align:start position:0%
gotta walk before we run
 
00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
and this is this is the walk so
 
00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
um but i do appreciate your recognition
 
00:53:51.829 --> 00:53:51.839 align:start position:0%
of that because it is not just a single
 
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
person event this definitely affects
 
00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
folks in your family
 
00:53:58.870 --> 00:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
so you know part of the part of the
 
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
reason why that i'm on the commission
 
00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
it's near and dear to me is i've had two
 
00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
working partners that have committed
 
00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:04.390 align:start position:0%
working partners that have committed
suicide

00:54:04.390 --> 00:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
suicide
 
00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:54:08.069 --> 00:54:08.079 align:start position:0%
unheard of um
 
00:54:10.950 --> 00:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
and that is something that i don't want
 
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
to see
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
i certainly don't want a third but i
 
00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
certainly don't want to see this
 
00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
situation and these problems exacerbate
 
00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
themselves and keep going when we have
 
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
the ability to do some intervention here
 
00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
as far as annual training i would i'd
 
00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
like to to bring up that we
 
00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
have annual sexual harassment training
 
00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
for employees i mean those there are
 
00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
certain things that
 
00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
that are worthy of touching upon an
 
00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:41.829 --> 00:54:41.839 align:start position:0%
pushing something like this out to a
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
two-year venue there's a lot of bad
 
00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
things that happen in the course of a
 
00:54:47.430 --> 00:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
year for someone and
 
00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
you know the this the type of training
 
00:54:51.670 --> 00:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
that's being looked at right now i can
 
00:54:53.109 --> 00:54:53.119 align:start position:0%
tell you from the fired up
 
00:54:54.309 --> 00:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
standpoint the new hampshire fire
 
00:54:56.549 --> 00:54:56.559 align:start position:0%
academy is focused in developing and
 
00:54:58.390 --> 00:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
expanding upon the online training they
 
00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
have now and once the fire academy
 
00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
creates this training
 
00:55:03.910 --> 00:55:03.920 align:start position:0%
it's going to be available for fire
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
departments throughout the state
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
regardless of status whether they're
 
00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
paid a career volunteer or whatever
 
00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
and that's just a matter of sitting down
 
00:55:13.349 --> 00:55:13.359 align:start position:0%
on a computer and watching a program so
 
00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
you know as far as as far as this
 
00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
becoming some sort of a mandate that
 
00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
comes down upon communities to have to
 
00:55:20.069 --> 00:55:20.079 align:start position:0%
fork over all kinds of money that just
 
00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:22.240 align:start position:0%
isn't there with the state's
 
00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
handling this is is part of their
 
00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
function and making this available so so
 
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
this isn't going to be a 28a issue or
 
00:55:30.549 --> 00:55:30.559 align:start position:0%
anything like that we're not going to be
 
00:55:30.559 --> 00:55:31.670 align:start position:0%
anything like that we're not going to be
dumping

00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
dumping
 
00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
all sorts of things that are going to
 
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
require and frankly if if that
 
00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
if that if we'd been going down that
 
00:55:38.789 --> 00:55:38.799 align:start position:0%
road we would have been i would have
 
00:55:40.470 --> 00:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
intervened in that a long long before
 
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
this because that's
 
00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
obviously not going to work so so this
 
00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:46.720 align:start position:0%
the way 357 is written
 
00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
right now um you know the the beginning
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
of this obviously is just the
 
00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
reconstitution of the com the commission
 
00:55:54.789 --> 00:55:54.799 align:start position:0%
but the bottom part here i think that
 
00:55:56.549 --> 00:55:56.559 align:start position:0%
you know as senator birdsell said you
 
00:55:58.309 --> 00:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
know we are in desperate need of a
 
00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
cultural shift and it has begun
 
00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
um but it without
 
00:56:05.589 --> 00:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
continuing to reinforce that cultural
 
00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
shift it's going to take a generation or
 
00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
two for that to really set in
 
00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:11.750 align:start position:0%
two for that to really set in
so

00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:56:13.589 --> 00:56:13.599 align:start position:0%
other than that i have i'm happy to take
 
00:56:15.030 --> 00:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
questions at least from the fire
 
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
standpoint or my own personal experience
 
00:56:18.870 --> 00:56:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:21.839 align:start position:0%
representative i have two questions
 
00:56:24.069 --> 00:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
one is that i'm
 
00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
fully supportive of adding this to the
 
00:56:29.510 --> 00:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
continuing education requirement and if
 
00:56:31.430 --> 00:56:31.440 align:start position:0%
it's online yes that's free i'm
 
00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:32.549 align:start position:0%
it's online yes that's free i'm
concerned

00:56:32.549 --> 00:56:32.559 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
that it
 
00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:35.430 align:start position:0%
that it
we

00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
i want to make it clear that we're not
 
00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:38.630 align:start position:0%
i want to make it clear that we're not
asking

00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
asking
 
00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:39.670 align:start position:0%
asking
current

00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
current
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
firefighters or police officers to go
 
00:56:45.349 --> 00:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
back to the academy for the
 
00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
sa mental health training etc from so
 
00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:49.910 align:start position:0%
sa mental health training etc from so
that's

00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:56:52.789 --> 00:56:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
yes new people ought to take it no
 
00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:56.549 align:start position:0%
yes new people ought to take it no
question

00:56:56.549 --> 00:56:56.559 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:56:58.870 --> 00:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
but we shouldn't end with it should be
 
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
available to other people but i don't
 
00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
think we should mandate that every
 
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
experienced police or firefighter in the
 
00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
state go through that
 
00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh so that's that's my concern the other
 
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
is why are you reconstituting the
 
00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
committee instead of just repealing its
 
00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:19.190 --> 00:57:19.200 align:start position:0%
i mean that would be the
 
00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that would be a much
 
00:57:22.309 --> 00:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
simpler way to do it if you're happy if
 
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
the commission exists subsequently that
 
00:57:26.230 --> 00:57:26.240 align:start position:0%
would have the same effect i suppose
 
00:57:28.950 --> 00:57:28.960 align:start position:0%
okay so i as far as i i can tell from
 
00:57:30.069 --> 00:57:30.079 align:start position:0%
reading this there's no change in the
 
00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
makeup of the commission right i mean
 
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:38.390 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:57:40.789 --> 00:57:40.799 align:start position:0%
so there is an update to the topics
 
00:57:40.799 --> 00:57:42.150 align:start position:0%
so there is an update to the topics
okay

00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
fine so
 
00:57:46.230 --> 00:57:46.240 align:start position:0%
thank you sure are there any other
 
00:57:48.789 --> 00:57:48.799 align:start position:0%
questions representative o'brien
 
00:57:51.750 --> 00:57:51.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh madam chair i look forward
 
00:57:54.150 --> 00:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
hopefully we could talk about this but
 
00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:55.270 align:start position:0%
hopefully we could talk about this but
again

00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:56.549 align:start position:0%
again
uh

00:57:56.549 --> 00:57:56.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:57:57.990 --> 00:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
representative pearson thank you for
 
00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question but and through your
 
00:58:02.870 --> 00:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
experience on this particular board and
 
00:58:04.789 --> 00:58:04.799 align:start position:0%
everything ptsd
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
it could be as acute as one particular
 
00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
incident but it also has a cumulative
 
00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
effect equally as well
 
00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
it could be things going on at home the
 
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
wife leaving
 
00:58:18.549 --> 00:58:18.559 align:start position:0%
the job stinks you know other different
 
00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
things i get skipped over promotion
 
00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
oh there was a bad car accident one
 
00:58:26.069 --> 00:58:26.079 align:start position:0%
involved a kid other different things
 
00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:27.839 align:start position:0%
let's go out and have a little drink
 
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
i'll feel a little bit better
 
00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
other things and lead and you're on the
 
00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
slippery sloping too and usually these
 
00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:36.559 align:start position:0%
aren't people who are just coming out of
 
00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
the academy they're equally to be people
 
00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
that may have 15 years of service
 
00:58:44.630 --> 00:58:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh that we may need to reach out to so
 
00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
it uh
 
00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
we just can't say that it's uh
 
00:58:50.230 --> 00:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
what is the trigger point we don't know
 
00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
what that triangle point is it can
 
00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:54.880 align:start position:0%
affect anybody at any particular point
 
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
within their career or it'd be
 
00:58:59.589 --> 00:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
correct and assuming that
 
00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
well absolutely the the other thing too
 
00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
that we're touching on along with your
 
00:59:05.910 --> 00:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
own internal diagnosis of of your
 
00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:08.720 align:start position:0%
particular situation is the recognition
 
00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
amongst your peers of of things that are
 
00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:12.559 align:start position:0%
warning signs
 
00:59:13.589 --> 00:59:13.599 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
as they say you can lead a horse to
 
00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
water but in this particular case you
 
00:59:20.150 --> 00:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
know one of the things that
 
00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
has in the past has been difficult is no
 
00:59:25.030 --> 00:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
one knew where to lead the horse right
 
00:59:26.549 --> 00:59:26.559 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:59:28.309 --> 00:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
part of what this commission does has
 
00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
done is is
 
00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
making that avenue a lot more clear and
 
00:59:35.670 --> 00:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
available for those that once they do
 
00:59:38.069 --> 00:59:38.079 align:start position:0%
recognize they have a situation we can
 
00:59:39.829 --> 00:59:39.839 align:start position:0%
get them to
 
00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
the appropriate
 
00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
intervention if you will the appropriate
 
00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:46.559 align:start position:0%
remedy the appropriate counseling
 
00:59:49.109 --> 00:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
whatever it takes um you know because
 
00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
frankly in the past that was
 
00:59:54.150 --> 00:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
we you know we had some some teams in
 
00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:56.559 align:start position:0%
the state but we didn't it wasn't really
 
00:59:56.559 --> 00:59:57.589 align:start position:0%
the state but we didn't it wasn't really
broad

00:59:57.589 --> 00:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
broad
 
00:59:59.190 --> 00:59:59.200 align:start position:0%
it was too broad in the sense of you
 
01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
know if you asked a volunteer fire chief
 
01:00:03.190 --> 01:00:03.200 align:start position:0%
you got a guy in trouble where do you
 
01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
send him a lot of you got the
 
01:00:05.589 --> 01:00:05.599 align:start position:0%
firefighter salute from a lot of them
 
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
they just didn't know so
 
01:00:08.789 --> 01:00:08.799 align:start position:0%
that's something that the commission has
 
01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
also worked on and
 
01:00:14.950 --> 01:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
um and i in is ongoing you know as we're
 
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
as we're having a certain shortage of
 
01:00:19.589 --> 01:00:19.599 align:start position:0%
mental health practitioners in this
 
01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
state as we heard in reference to that
 
01:00:23.430 --> 01:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
an interstate compact in another bill
 
01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:24.230 align:start position:0%
an interstate compact in another bill
but

01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:00:26.069 --> 01:00:26.079 align:start position:0%
um you know this is this is an
 
01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
all-encompassing commission it's looking
 
01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
at it from you know from cradle to grave
 
01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:30.710 align:start position:0%
at it from you know from cradle to grave
and

01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:33.040 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
01:00:36.789 --> 01:00:36.799 align:start position:0%
i mean your your analysis of that is
 
01:00:38.309 --> 01:00:38.319 align:start position:0%
correct but
 
01:00:42.549 --> 01:00:42.559 align:start position:0%
but i want to assure you that that
 
01:00:44.230 --> 01:00:44.240 align:start position:0%
part of it is absolutely addressed in
 
01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:45.829 align:start position:0%
part of it is absolutely addressed in
this

01:00:45.829 --> 01:00:45.839 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:00:48.950 --> 01:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
follow up if i may madam champ follow
 
01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt schmidt did
 
01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.549 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt schmidt did
mention

01:00:52.549 --> 01:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
mention
 
01:00:55.109 --> 01:00:55.119 align:start position:0%
families and everything and
 
01:00:57.030 --> 01:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
has it been your experience you know
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
firefighting police officers it is a
 
01:01:01.349 --> 01:01:01.359 align:start position:0%
family orientated we all know
 
01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
everybody's kids
 
01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:01:05.589 --> 01:01:05.599 align:start position:0%
things that are going on sometimes we
 
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
know things before even the spouses do
 
01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
but sometimes chiefs do get the call or
 
01:01:14.549 --> 01:01:14.559 align:start position:0%
the union may get the call or you know
 
01:01:15.910 --> 01:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
reach out to friends within the
 
01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
department that murphy's having a
 
01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
particular problem or something like
 
01:01:21.109 --> 01:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
that so
 
01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:23.280 align:start position:0%
families are an integral part but they
 
01:01:26.069 --> 01:01:26.079 align:start position:0%
are included and they are listened to so
 
01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
yep one of the things that that occurred
 
01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
within the the training that the city of
 
01:01:32.549 --> 01:01:32.559 align:start position:0%
manchester did was in reference
 
01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:34.960 align:start position:0%
with the family members and their
 
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
avenues of intervention
 
01:01:38.789 --> 01:01:38.799 align:start position:0%
you know because of course we all sit
 
01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
down and take these trainings and we're
 
01:01:42.069 --> 01:01:42.079 align:start position:0%
given the
 
01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
you know who do you call and what do you
 
01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
do and who do you talk to and this is
 
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
the resources available
 
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
but that's been
 
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
that's been very absent in the in the
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
family member world so the the training
 
01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
that the city of manchester put on did
 
01:01:56.789 --> 01:01:56.799 align:start position:0%
just that
 
01:01:58.630 --> 01:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
for folks that were that had taken it it
 
01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
gave them hey this is the resources
 
01:02:02.789 --> 01:02:02.799 align:start position:0%
here's who you can call
 
01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
you know this is this is what you can do
 
01:02:06.950 --> 01:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
and again this is not touched in this
 
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
bill and and i don't
 
01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
i think like i said we need to walk
 
01:02:12.549 --> 01:02:12.559 align:start position:0%
before we run but but in the future that
 
01:02:16.390 --> 01:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
is something that could be looked at i
 
01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:20.150 align:start position:0%
is something that could be looked at i
carefully

01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:22.870 --> 01:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:02:26.230 --> 01:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:27.829 --> 01:02:27.839 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
01:02:33.589 --> 01:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
01:17:11.350 --> 01:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:14.480 align:start position:0%

senate and it aims to accomplish two
 
01:19:48.719 --> 01:19:49.590 align:start position:0%
senate and it aims to accomplish two
things

01:19:49.590 --> 01:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
to begin with my legislation deals with
 
01:19:55.110 --> 01:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
a private cause of action
 
01:19:57.189 --> 01:19:57.199 align:start position:0%
as we know the attorney general is
 
01:19:59.430 --> 01:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
responsible for enforcing the laws of
 
01:20:00.550 --> 01:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:20:03.430 --> 01:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we also know that at times
 
01:20:05.669 --> 01:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
they are overwhelmed with cases
 
01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
our bill provides for a civil money
 
01:20:11.990 --> 01:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
penalty or monetary enforcement
 
01:20:14.629 --> 01:20:14.639 align:start position:0%
that can be levied onto unlicensed
 
01:20:16.709 --> 01:20:16.719 align:start position:0%
practitioners that hold themselves out
 
01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
as licensed or adverse services they may
 
01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
be licensed for
 
01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
this would allow for significant
 
01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
consumer protection and allow for the
 
01:20:27.430 --> 01:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement of current statutes
 
01:20:29.430 --> 01:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
this protects new hampshire property
 
01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
owners and consumers from unlicensed
 
01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
individuals that are currently offering
 
01:20:37.669 --> 01:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
low-cost services that ultimately are
 
01:20:40.229 --> 01:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
not what the client believes them to be
 
01:20:42.629 --> 01:20:42.639 align:start position:0%
secondly my bill looks at the issue of
 
01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
non-resident licensure
 
01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
the new england region is very small an
 
01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
area and there are several instances
 
01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
where a person may live in vermont
 
01:20:53.830 --> 01:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
massachusetts or maine
 
01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
this could be a significant hindrance to
 
01:20:59.030 --> 01:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
the individual the company they work for
 
01:21:00.950 --> 01:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
and the profession as a whole due to
 
01:21:03.110 --> 01:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
limiting of an already small pool of
 
01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
potential land surveyors if we want this
 
01:21:08.550 --> 01:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
profession to grow and thrive we must
 
01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
look to the next generation of surveyors
 
01:21:12.950 --> 01:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
that may be willing to commute across
 
01:21:15.030 --> 01:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
state lines in order to obtain
 
01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
opportunities this change will make it
 
01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
easier for land surveyors
 
01:21:22.149 --> 01:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
in neighboring states
 
01:21:24.629 --> 01:21:24.639 align:start position:0%
to more easily attain a new hampshire
 
01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
license as long as the applicant meets
 
01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
the requirements for licensure as set
 
01:21:31.110 --> 01:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
forth in our statutes
 
01:21:32.950 --> 01:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
after consulting with the new hampshire
 
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
land surveyor association we discovered
 
01:21:38.229 --> 01:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
the need for some cleanup language that
 
01:21:40.470 --> 01:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
was not addressed in the original or
 
01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
amended bill so an amendment will be
 
01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
provided to the committee for your
 
01:21:47.430 --> 01:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
consideration dealing with those changes
 
01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
i am happy to try to answer any
 
01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:50.629 align:start position:0%
i am happy to try to answer any
questions

01:21:50.629 --> 01:21:50.639 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:21:52.709 --> 01:21:52.719 align:start position:0%
on the underlying bill but in the
 
01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
essence of saving time and going back to
 
01:21:57.189 --> 01:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
committee i have experts behind me that
 
01:21:58.870 --> 01:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
could probably
 
01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:00.719 align:start position:0%
be more helpful and i really thank you
 
01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
for your time and consideration on this
 
01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:03.990 align:start position:0%
for your time and consideration on this
bill

01:22:03.990 --> 01:22:04.000 align:start position:0%

01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
questions to the senator

madam chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:22:14.310 --> 01:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
question senator
 
01:22:16.950 --> 01:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
so i'm just curious um
 
01:22:18.629 --> 01:22:18.639 align:start position:0%
in the event that a person
 
01:22:18.639 --> 01:22:19.590 align:start position:0%
in the event that a person
is

01:22:19.590 --> 01:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:22:21.669 --> 01:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
has a has a
 
01:22:23.590 --> 01:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
a fine
 
01:22:25.990 --> 01:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
put on to them and they
 
01:22:29.590 --> 01:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
do not pay this fine what what exactly
 
01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
would be the consequence of that would
 
01:22:34.310 --> 01:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
it be like a lien or
 
01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
like what exactly would happen i'm gonna
 
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
defer to the experts for that for this i
 
01:22:40.950 --> 01:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
presented this bill on behalf of the
 
01:22:42.950 --> 01:22:42.960 align:start position:0%

questions

01:23:06.470 --> 01:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:08.070 --> 01:23:08.080 align:start position:0%

committee today specifically senate bill
 
01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:01.270 align:start position:0%
committee today specifically senate bill
383

01:24:01.270 --> 01:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
383
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
real estate is one of the main drivers
 
01:24:05.430 --> 01:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
of the new hampshire economy and
 
01:24:08.709 --> 01:24:08.719 align:start position:0%
surveying is extremely as an extremely
 
01:24:11.270 --> 01:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
important aspect and really the backbone
 
01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
of the real estate transaction
 
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
whether it's determining property
 
01:24:16.870 --> 01:24:16.880 align:start position:0%
boundaries and verifying title for the
 
01:24:19.270 --> 01:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
real estate transfer and transaction to
 
01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
determining areas of parcels for the
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
levying of taxes and everything in
 
01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:24.629 align:start position:0%
levying of taxes and everything in
between

01:24:24.629 --> 01:24:24.639 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
surveying is a major aspect of the new
 
01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire real estate economy
 
01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
this bill is incredibly important to
 
01:24:32.550 --> 01:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
many stakeholders in the real estate
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
industry from realtors lenders property
 
01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:36.950 align:start position:0%
industry from realtors lenders property
owners

01:24:36.950 --> 01:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
owners
 
01:24:39.430 --> 01:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
and especially the courts
 
01:24:41.990 --> 01:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
unlicensed practice occurs often and in
 
01:24:44.310 --> 01:24:44.320 align:start position:0%
many cases with disastrous results that
 
01:24:45.990 --> 01:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
can create significant financial
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
hardships for property owners
 
01:24:50.950 --> 01:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
this is why the violations and penalties
 
01:24:52.790 --> 01:24:52.800 align:start position:0%
aspect of this bill is needed
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
as stated previously surveying plays a
 
01:24:56.390 --> 01:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
significant part in the real estate
 
01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:57.430 align:start position:0%
significant part in the real estate
economy

01:24:57.430 --> 01:24:57.440 align:start position:0%
economy
 
01:24:59.750 --> 01:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
due to technology and overburdening of
 
01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
the enforcing party
 
01:25:03.189 --> 01:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
there are currently many instances where
 
01:25:04.470 --> 01:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
companies and individuals hold
 
01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
themselves out as professionals and
 
01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
perform or advertise work illegally
 
01:25:11.830 --> 01:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
the loser in this in this scenario is
 
01:25:13.270 --> 01:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
not only the consumer and other
 
01:25:15.189 --> 01:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
stakeholders i mentioned but the new
 
01:25:17.110 --> 01:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire court system and the budget as
 
01:25:18.149 --> 01:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
a whole
 
01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
as its judges that are tasked with
 
01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
making property and boundary decisions
 
01:25:24.310 --> 01:25:24.320 align:start position:0%
as our society is becoming more
 
01:25:26.229 --> 01:25:26.239 align:start position:0%
confrontational we will see our court
 
01:25:27.910 --> 01:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
system overburdened with the errors of
 
01:25:30.550 --> 01:25:30.560 align:start position:0%
unprofessional and unlicensed work
 
01:25:32.709 --> 01:25:32.719 align:start position:0%
this legislation will allow the board to
 
01:25:34.950 --> 01:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
hold a fair hearing and levy a monetary
 
01:25:36.709 --> 01:25:36.719 align:start position:0%
fine to deter this kind of work from
 
01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
being performed
 
01:25:41.669 --> 01:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
several recent examples of unlicensed
 
01:25:43.270 --> 01:25:43.280 align:start position:0%
work include a contractor who was
 
01:25:45.350 --> 01:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
setting property corners in guilford new
 
01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:46.470 align:start position:0%
setting property corners in guilford new
hampshire

01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:25:48.390 --> 01:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
the property owner that engaged the
 
01:25:50.629 --> 01:25:50.639 align:start position:0%
contractor was very happy to pay a
 
01:25:51.990 --> 01:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
reduced fee
 
01:25:54.149 --> 01:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
for this service
 
01:25:54.159 --> 01:25:55.669 align:start position:0%
for this service
however

01:25:55.669 --> 01:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:25:56.950 --> 01:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
there are always
 
01:25:58.950 --> 01:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
two parties involved in one property
 
01:25:58.960 --> 01:25:59.990 align:start position:0%
two parties involved in one property
line

01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:26:01.510 --> 01:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
and when the neighbor thought that there
 
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
was an issue they hired a surveyor
 
01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
the property corners that did have
 
01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
surveying caps on them
 
01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
were found to be set in the wrong
 
01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:12.310 align:start position:0%
were found to be set in the wrong
location

01:26:12.310 --> 01:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
location
 
01:26:14.470 --> 01:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
this issue was resolved between the two
 
01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:15.590 align:start position:0%
this issue was resolved between the two
neighbors

01:26:15.590 --> 01:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
neighbors
 
01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
there was cost that occurred between the
 
01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.189 align:start position:0%
there was cost that occurred between the
two

01:26:19.189 --> 01:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
however this could have created
 
01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:25.440 align:start position:0%
significant damages between both parties
 
01:26:27.430 --> 01:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
another example is a homeowner who hired
 
01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
a contractor to set an elevation
 
01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:30.709 align:start position:0%
a contractor to set an elevation
benchmark

01:26:30.709 --> 01:26:30.719 align:start position:0%
benchmark
 
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
in order to build a new home in
 
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
compliance with the town floodplain
 
01:26:37.189 --> 01:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
management ordinance the contractor held
 
01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
themselves out and communicated to the
 
01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:41.189 align:start position:0%
themselves out and communicated to the
client

01:26:41.189 --> 01:26:41.199 align:start position:0%
client
 
01:26:43.110 --> 01:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
that they could perform survey quality
 
01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:44.709 align:start position:0%
that they could perform survey quality
work

01:26:44.709 --> 01:26:44.719 align:start position:0%
work
 
01:26:47.030 --> 01:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the elevation benchmark
 
01:26:50.229 --> 01:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
that was set was 13 inches lower than
 
01:26:53.830 --> 01:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
what was reported due to an error
 
01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
the homeowner
 
01:26:57.750 --> 01:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
their house is now out of compliance
 
01:26:59.270 --> 01:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
with the floodplain management ordinance
 
01:27:00.390 --> 01:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
for this town
 
01:27:02.070 --> 01:27:02.080 align:start position:0%
and they're looking at tens of thousands
 
01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
of dollars
 
01:27:05.189 --> 01:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
in flood insurance
 
01:27:07.350 --> 01:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
requirements that they
 
01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:08.709 align:start position:0%
requirements that they
weren't

01:27:08.709 --> 01:27:08.719 align:start position:0%
weren't
 
01:27:11.270 --> 01:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
expecting to pay
 
01:27:12.950 --> 01:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
there are multiple companies
 
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:14.400 align:start position:0%
advertising in new hampshire on the
 
01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:15.350 align:start position:0%
advertising in new hampshire on the
internet

01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
internet
 
01:27:17.030 --> 01:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
stating on their website that they are
 
01:27:18.790 --> 01:27:18.800 align:start position:0%
professional land surveyors by state
 
01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:19.830 align:start position:0%
professional land surveyors by state
agency

01:27:19.830 --> 01:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
agency
 
01:27:21.910 --> 01:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
when in fact they hold no license or
 
01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:23.750 align:start position:0%
when in fact they hold no license or
credentials

01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
credentials
 
01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
there are also multiple examples where
 
01:27:27.750 --> 01:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
contractors have altered existing plans
 
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
that are on file in town offices that
 
01:27:31.669 --> 01:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
have the potential to create major
 
01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
hardships for all the parties involved
 
01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
i cannot stress how important this
 
01:27:39.830 --> 01:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
legislation is to the consumers and the
 
01:27:42.470 --> 01:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
property owners of new hampshire
 
01:27:44.629 --> 01:27:44.639 align:start position:0%
the second aspect of this legislation is
 
01:27:46.149 --> 01:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
the elimination of the residency
 
01:27:48.390 --> 01:27:48.400 align:start position:0%
requirement for initial licensure as a
 
01:27:50.629 --> 01:27:50.639 align:start position:0%
survey in new hampshire
 
01:27:52.709 --> 01:27:52.719 align:start position:0%
as the world and our region is growing
 
01:27:55.510 --> 01:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
smaller so too is the pool of candidates
 
01:27:57.189 --> 01:27:57.199 align:start position:0%
that are looking to enter the surveying
 
01:27:57.199 --> 01:27:58.390 align:start position:0%
that are looking to enter the surveying
field

01:27:58.390 --> 01:27:58.400 align:start position:0%
field
 
01:27:59.669 --> 01:27:59.679 align:start position:0%
there are many instances where a
 
01:28:01.270 --> 01:28:01.280 align:start position:0%
potential candidate for licensure may
 
01:28:03.830 --> 01:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
live in massachusetts maine or vermont
 
01:28:06.390 --> 01:28:06.400 align:start position:0%
but practices for a firm exclusively in
 
01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:28:10.629 --> 01:28:10.639 align:start position:0%
residency should not be a roadblock to
 
01:28:10.639 --> 01:28:12.149 align:start position:0%
residency should not be a roadblock to
licensure

01:28:12.149 --> 01:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
licensure
 
01:28:14.470 --> 01:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
and in fact
 
01:28:16.950 --> 01:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
land surveying is the only profession
 
01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
that requires residency for initial
 
01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:20.310 align:start position:0%
that requires residency for initial
licensure

01:28:20.310 --> 01:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
licensure
 
01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh physicians engineers attorneys
 
01:28:25.830 --> 01:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
landscape architects and so on do not
 
01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
have a residency requirement for initial
 
01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:29.110 align:start position:0%
have a residency requirement for initial
licensure

01:28:29.110 --> 01:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
licensure
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
by striking this aspect of the law we
 
01:28:32.629 --> 01:28:32.639 align:start position:0%
are bringing our profession in line with
 
01:28:34.629 --> 01:28:34.639 align:start position:0%
the other state licensing requirements
 
01:28:36.229 --> 01:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
and allowing the board to determine the
 
01:28:38.070 --> 01:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
eligibility of licensure based on
 
01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:39.189 align:start position:0%
eligibility of licensure based on
experience

01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
experience
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
and not residency
 
01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:44.229 align:start position:0%
and not residency
and

01:28:44.229 --> 01:28:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
i i would like to just reiterate what um
 
01:28:49.510 --> 01:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
senator rashardi had mentioned about
 
01:28:51.510 --> 01:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
some of the the technical
 
01:28:53.669 --> 01:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
corrections on the amendment that she
 
01:28:55.910 --> 01:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
brought forward for the bill and it just
 
01:28:58.709 --> 01:28:58.719 align:start position:0%
clarifies certain languages and
 
01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
corrects some of the technical language
 
01:29:03.830 --> 01:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to answer any questions
 
01:29:05.669 --> 01:29:05.679 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
01:29:07.510 --> 01:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
thank you i can see a few
 
01:29:10.550 --> 01:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh but first i don't i don't believe we
 
01:29:12.709 --> 01:29:12.719 align:start position:0%
actually got senator ricciardi's
 
01:29:12.719 --> 01:29:13.750 align:start position:0%
actually got senator ricciardi's
amendment

01:29:13.750 --> 01:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
do you have a copy i do have a copy
 
01:29:17.430 --> 01:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
thank you we will
 
01:29:19.110 --> 01:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
that will make things simpler madam
 
01:29:20.470 --> 01:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
chair is this an amendment that was
 
01:29:21.750 --> 01:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
processed by the senate because this
 
01:29:23.350 --> 01:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
comes over to us as amended by the
 
01:29:25.910 --> 01:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
senate is that irrelevant i believe this
 
01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
senator rashadi said that this came out
 
01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
after they made their amendment so this
 
01:29:34.070 --> 01:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
would be something we would want to
 
01:29:43.669 --> 01:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:46.149 --> 01:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
i think and i think we may need some
 
01:29:46.159 --> 01:29:49.030 align:start position:0%
i think and i think we may need some
help

01:29:49.030 --> 01:29:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:56.870 --> 01:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:59.270 --> 01:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
so this adds yes this adds a dish a
 
01:30:01.910 --> 01:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
great deal of additional uh
 
01:30:03.910 --> 01:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
language that's not in the bill before
 
01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:06.229 align:start position:0%
language that's not in the bill before
us

01:30:06.229 --> 01:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:30:08.709 --> 01:30:08.719 align:start position:0%
correct correct okay and i have a
 
01:30:11.350 --> 01:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
general question about land surveying
 
01:30:14.149 --> 01:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
i was i believe i was told at one time
 
01:30:15.990 --> 01:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:30:18.229 --> 01:30:18.239 align:start position:0%
tracing of deeds in new hampshire is
 
01:30:21.390 --> 01:30:21.400 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult because of the
 
01:30:23.669 --> 01:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
pre-colonial era
 
01:30:25.990 --> 01:30:26.000 align:start position:0%
way it was set up
 
01:30:27.910 --> 01:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
is the ah you're grinning so you you've
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
heard that too is is that still the case
 
01:30:33.270 --> 01:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
that it can be yeah um you know tracing
 
01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
title and and doing deed research in in
 
01:30:37.030 --> 01:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and a lot of the colonial
 
01:30:39.669 --> 01:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
states can be very challenging it's uh
 
01:30:41.270 --> 01:30:41.280 align:start position:0%
it's a very interesting and rewarding
 
01:30:43.110 --> 01:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
experience as well
 
01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:43.990 align:start position:0%
experience as well
uh

01:30:43.990 --> 01:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:30:47.110 --> 01:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
is there a specific new hampshire
 
01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:48.629 align:start position:0%
is there a specific new hampshire
legal

01:30:48.629 --> 01:30:48.639 align:start position:0%
legal
 
01:30:50.950 --> 01:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
legal knowledge
 
01:30:52.629 --> 01:30:52.639 align:start position:0%
tests that you have to take before being
 
01:30:54.629 --> 01:30:54.639 align:start position:0%
licensed as a land surveyor yes
 
01:30:56.229 --> 01:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
absolutely so
 
01:30:58.229 --> 01:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
and that i think we would want to make
 
01:31:00.629 --> 01:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
sure is included in the requirements for
 
01:31:03.270 --> 01:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
out-of-state licensure yes and and it is
 
01:31:05.430 --> 01:31:05.440 align:start position:0%
it is referenced in that um amendment
 
01:31:06.390 --> 01:31:06.400 align:start position:0%
that i just
 
01:31:08.709 --> 01:31:08.719 align:start position:0%
okay thank you we'll check for it and
 
01:31:11.110 --> 01:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes had a question and
 
01:31:13.189 --> 01:31:13.199 align:start position:0%
i believe representative o'brien thank
 
01:31:14.629 --> 01:31:14.639 align:start position:0%
you madam chair
 
01:31:15.990 --> 01:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
so i don't know if the answer to the
 
01:31:17.430 --> 01:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
question i had asked the senators in
 
01:31:18.950 --> 01:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
that amendment
 
01:31:21.270 --> 01:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
but what exactly
 
01:31:24.149 --> 01:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
is what would happen when a person says
 
01:31:27.030 --> 01:31:27.040 align:start position:0%
well i don't have the money
 
01:31:28.830 --> 01:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
it it responds to the fine thank you
 
01:31:32.229 --> 01:31:32.239 align:start position:0%
yeah so um
 
01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a very good question and
 
01:31:35.910 --> 01:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh something that you know would be
 
01:31:37.110 --> 01:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
referred to the attorney general's
 
01:31:39.270 --> 01:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
office and uh we would then you know
 
01:31:40.870 --> 01:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
obviously look for guidance from from
 
01:31:44.709 --> 01:31:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:46.229 --> 01:31:46.239 align:start position:0%
so i just want to make sure my
 
01:31:48.790 --> 01:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
understanding is of right now if
 
01:31:50.709 --> 01:31:50.719 align:start position:0%
say i went out and i did this
 
01:31:52.870 --> 01:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
and the board says you're going to pay
 
01:31:56.790 --> 01:31:56.800 align:start position:0%
us 5 000 and i say i don't have 5 000
 
01:31:59.189 --> 01:31:59.199 align:start position:0%
that's just kind of the end of it as of
 
01:32:01.750 --> 01:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
now no so as of right now let's say you
 
01:32:03.430 --> 01:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
went out let's say you went out and did
 
01:32:04.950 --> 01:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
this let's say you decided you were
 
01:32:06.390 --> 01:32:06.400 align:start position:0%
unlicensed and wanted to go out and
 
01:32:07.990 --> 01:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
practice surveying or
 
01:32:10.229 --> 01:32:10.239 align:start position:0%
do surveying work or whatever
 
01:32:12.629 --> 01:32:12.639 align:start position:0%
and you did the work um currently the
 
01:32:15.510 --> 01:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
board has no authority over anything
 
01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
that you're doing um all authority falls
 
01:32:20.550 --> 01:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
on the shoulders of the attorney general
 
01:32:22.950 --> 01:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
and you know the attorney general um
 
01:32:24.310 --> 01:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
their office is
 
01:32:26.629 --> 01:32:26.639 align:start position:0%
is very overburdened with a lot of you
 
01:32:28.870 --> 01:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
know civil and criminal matters
 
01:32:31.669 --> 01:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
whether they would choose to enforce the
 
01:32:34.229 --> 01:32:34.239 align:start position:0%
law in this situation or not would be up
 
01:32:37.830 --> 01:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
to their office um one in the one case
 
01:32:39.830 --> 01:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
that i mentioned in the guilford case
 
01:32:41.590 --> 01:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office chose not
 
01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:32:52.870 --> 01:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien
 
01:32:54.870 --> 01:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair thank
 
01:32:56.950 --> 01:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
you sir for taking my question i'm
 
01:32:59.510 --> 01:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
looking at the new section 14 and fifth
 
01:33:02.709 --> 01:33:02.719 align:start position:0%
line 15 if you have the bill but uh
 
01:33:05.110 --> 01:33:05.120 align:start position:0%
basically you're asking for uh an
 
01:33:07.510 --> 01:33:07.520 align:start position:0%
offense of ten thousand dollars for each
 
01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:08.550 align:start position:0%
offense of ten thousand dollars for each
offense

01:33:08.550 --> 01:33:08.560 align:start position:0%
offense
 
01:33:11.750 --> 01:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
and that seems pretty hefty you know
 
01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
and i'm not against that
 
01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh but on line fourteen it does say uh
 
01:33:19.110 --> 01:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
in addition to any other penalty
 
01:33:20.790 --> 01:33:20.800 align:start position:0%
provided by law
 
01:33:23.510 --> 01:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
uh if somebody's so my question is if
 
01:33:25.270 --> 01:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
somebody's doing this
 
01:33:28.390 --> 01:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
and uh on the false pretenses they could
 
01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
get a ten thousand dollar fine but could
 
01:33:33.669 --> 01:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
they not in the future void their uh
 
01:33:36.229 --> 01:33:36.239 align:start position:0%
ability to get a new hampshire license
 
01:33:38.629 --> 01:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
because they attempted to deceive sure
 
01:33:40.390 --> 01:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
so the current um
 
01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
the current enforcement and disciplinary
 
01:33:44.790 --> 01:33:44.800 align:start position:0%
action that could result in unlicensed
 
01:33:46.550 --> 01:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
practice is criminal
 
01:33:48.470 --> 01:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
you would be subject to either a miss it
 
01:33:50.709 --> 01:33:50.719 align:start position:0%
would be a misdemeanor or a felony
 
01:33:53.030 --> 01:33:53.040 align:start position:0%
offense and again that would be levied
 
01:33:54.790 --> 01:33:54.800 align:start position:0%
by you know the attorney general's
 
01:33:57.270 --> 01:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
office the the state board of licensure
 
01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
does not have any authority to enforce
 
01:34:02.149 --> 01:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
you know unlicensed practice against an
 
01:34:05.189 --> 01:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
unlicensed individual they're
 
01:34:08.229 --> 01:34:08.239 align:start position:0%
solely tasked with you know disciplining
 
01:34:11.110 --> 01:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
and overseeing the licensed community
 
01:34:12.870 --> 01:34:12.880 align:start position:0%
and the people that fall under the
 
01:34:15.270 --> 01:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
purview of the licensed statute so
 
01:34:17.110 --> 01:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
currently you know the only enforcement
 
01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
available in that scenario would be
 
01:34:21.189 --> 01:34:21.199 align:start position:0%
would be criminal
 
01:34:23.430 --> 01:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
and then i would presume that if someone
 
01:34:27.350 --> 01:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
is is applying for a license having been
 
01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
convicted of unlicensed practice would
 
01:34:31.110 --> 01:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
be considered
 
01:34:33.110 --> 01:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
poor character or whatever the
 
01:34:35.350 --> 01:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
disqualifying event is they would be
 
01:34:37.110 --> 01:34:37.120 align:start position:0%
considered not not in good standing and
 
01:34:39.110 --> 01:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
then they would have to you know certify
 
01:34:41.669 --> 01:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
on the application um as to whether or
 
01:34:43.510 --> 01:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
not you know they have been you know
 
01:34:45.189 --> 01:34:45.199 align:start position:0%
arrested or you know have a criminal
 
01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
record madam sheriff i may i totally
 
01:34:49.510 --> 01:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
concur what you said because there's a
 
01:34:51.270 --> 01:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
lot of faith in this you know
 
01:34:53.590 --> 01:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
particularly for the homeowner to have
 
01:34:55.669 --> 01:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
it done accurately so you know they
 
01:34:57.910 --> 01:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
voided that so thank you thank you amen
 
01:35:00.149 --> 01:35:00.159 align:start position:0%
thank you represent goalie
 
01:35:02.149 --> 01:35:02.159 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and i i just
 
01:35:04.790 --> 01:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to follow up with
 
01:35:08.229 --> 01:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
a comment you made about
 
01:35:09.510 --> 01:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office not
 
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
following up on some of these things
 
01:35:13.270 --> 01:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
because they may be too busy or not but
 
01:35:16.870 --> 01:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
as i look at current statute
 
01:35:18.950 --> 01:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
on line nine
 
01:35:21.350 --> 01:35:21.360 align:start position:0%
that any person who shall violate any
 
01:35:23.109 --> 01:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
other provisions in this subdivision
 
01:35:25.350 --> 01:35:25.360 align:start position:0%
shall be guilty it doesn't say they may
 
01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:26.149 align:start position:0%
shall be guilty it doesn't say they may
be

01:35:26.149 --> 01:35:26.159 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:35:28.629 --> 01:35:28.639 align:start position:0%
so if the attorney general's not office
 
01:35:28.639 --> 01:35:29.830 align:start position:0%
so if the attorney general's not office
isn't

01:35:29.830 --> 01:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
01:35:31.830 --> 01:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
taking these to court and going after
 
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
these folks where it's
 
01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:34.229 align:start position:0%
these folks where it's
pretty

01:35:34.229 --> 01:35:34.239 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
01:35:36.149 --> 01:35:36.159 align:start position:0%
specific in statute that they shall be
 
01:35:36.159 --> 01:35:37.189 align:start position:0%
specific in statute that they shall be
guilty

01:35:37.189 --> 01:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
guilty
 
01:35:37.199 --> 01:35:38.310 align:start position:0%
guilty
um

01:35:38.310 --> 01:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:41.510 --> 01:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
there's a problem going on not
 
01:35:43.510 --> 01:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
with you your board but over the
 
01:35:45.270 --> 01:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office because this
 
01:35:46.870 --> 01:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
is the first they hear of something like
 
01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:47.669 align:start position:0%
is the first they hear of something like
this

01:35:47.669 --> 01:35:47.679 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:35:47.679 --> 01:35:49.109 align:start position:0%
this
and

01:35:49.109 --> 01:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:49.119 --> 01:35:50.310 align:start position:0%
and
i

01:35:50.310 --> 01:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:35:54.229 --> 01:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
just wonder why you would think that
 
01:35:55.590 --> 01:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
if there's a reason why the attorney
 
01:35:55.600 --> 01:35:56.950 align:start position:0%
if there's a reason why the attorney
general

01:35:56.950 --> 01:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
general
 
01:35:58.149 --> 01:35:58.159 align:start position:0%
wouldn't find
 
01:36:00.470 --> 01:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
it appropriate to take on a case
 
01:36:02.310 --> 01:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
why the board would find it appropriate
 
01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
if you would have the same evidence
 
01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
01:36:05.520 --> 01:36:06.229 align:start position:0%
going forward
and

01:36:06.229 --> 01:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:36:08.709 --> 01:36:08.719 align:start position:0%
a follow-up question to that would be
 
01:36:10.390 --> 01:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
what's going to be done with
 
01:36:12.709 --> 01:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
the money that is collected that's
 
01:36:15.189 --> 01:36:15.199 align:start position:0%
because this is money that is going to
 
01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
the board
 
01:36:17.590 --> 01:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
and what does the board do with that
 
01:36:20.149 --> 01:36:20.159 align:start position:0%
money when they take in the fines
 
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
sure um so that's a really good question
 
01:36:25.350 --> 01:36:25.360 align:start position:0%
and just to be clear i am not in any way
 
01:36:27.189 --> 01:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
trying to impugn the attorney general's
 
01:36:29.910 --> 01:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
office they are they were a fantastic um
 
01:36:31.990 --> 01:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
you know office and there are a lot of
 
01:36:33.910 --> 01:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
diligent people that work very very hard
 
01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
and they deal with
 
01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
thousands and thousands and thousands of
 
01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
complaints i think it would be
 
01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
physically impossible for them you know
 
01:36:41.669 --> 01:36:41.679 align:start position:0%
based on their budget structure to
 
01:36:41.679 --> 01:36:42.550 align:start position:0%
based on their budget structure to
handle

01:36:42.550 --> 01:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
handle
 
01:36:45.830 --> 01:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
every single uh complaint um you know
 
01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
that being said
 
01:36:49.510 --> 01:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
just these two
 
01:36:53.109 --> 01:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:57.270 --> 01:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:59.189 --> 01:36:59.199 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of emotional
 
01:37:01.669 --> 01:37:01.679 align:start position:0%
aspects involved in pursuing
 
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of these issues and so the
 
01:37:05.830 --> 01:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
gentleman that i spoke to dealing with
 
01:37:08.870 --> 01:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
his home that is now you know
 
01:37:10.870 --> 01:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
where he's exposed to flood insurance as
 
01:37:12.629 --> 01:37:12.639 align:start position:0%
a result of of a new construction that
 
01:37:14.390 --> 01:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
he built by relying on you know this
 
01:37:16.229 --> 01:37:16.239 align:start position:0%
erroneous information he's an older
 
01:37:18.470 --> 01:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
gentleman and he told me i don't want to
 
01:37:19.830 --> 01:37:19.840 align:start position:0%
have to go through this i don't want to
 
01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:21.679 align:start position:0%
have to now spend thousands and
 
01:37:23.990 --> 01:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
thousands of dollars on an attorney to
 
01:37:26.950 --> 01:37:26.960 align:start position:0%
go after someone and you know start
 
01:37:29.669 --> 01:37:29.679 align:start position:0%
filing cases and you know going after
 
01:37:29.679 --> 01:37:30.870 align:start position:0%
filing cases and you know going after
this

01:37:30.870 --> 01:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
i explained that he could file a
 
01:37:34.470 --> 01:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
complaint with the attorney general and
 
01:37:36.629 --> 01:37:36.639 align:start position:0%
that certainly you know his right and
 
01:37:39.189 --> 01:37:39.199 align:start position:0%
and in statute is the disciplinary way
 
01:37:40.390 --> 01:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
to go
 
01:37:42.149 --> 01:37:42.159 align:start position:0%
and his answer was well probably nothing
 
01:37:44.470 --> 01:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
is going to happen out of that um those
 
01:37:47.430 --> 01:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
were his words not not mine uh you know
 
01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:48.470 align:start position:0%
were his words not not mine uh you know
i

01:37:48.470 --> 01:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
i agree you know unlicensed practice
 
01:37:52.790 --> 01:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
should be forcefully
 
01:37:55.030 --> 01:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
um you know gone after and and that's
 
01:37:56.070 --> 01:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
why the
 
01:37:58.310 --> 01:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
law states shall
 
01:38:01.669 --> 01:38:01.679 align:start position:0%
and felony uh because it it should be a
 
01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
significant detractor to wanting to do
 
01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:04.709 align:start position:0%
significant detractor to wanting to do
that

01:38:04.709 --> 01:38:04.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:38:06.310 --> 01:38:06.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunately what we're seeing
 
01:38:08.310 --> 01:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
historically is that this this isn't
 
01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:09.590 align:start position:0%
historically is that this this isn't
happening

01:38:09.590 --> 01:38:09.600 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:38:12.790 --> 01:38:12.800 align:start position:0%
and um you know as far as what the board
 
01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
is going to do with the money
 
01:38:16.950 --> 01:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
you know i can't answer that because i'm
 
01:38:19.669 --> 01:38:19.679 align:start position:0%
not on the board uh seeing as how this
 
01:38:21.990 --> 01:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
would be you know a new statute i'm sure
 
01:38:24.229 --> 01:38:24.239 align:start position:0%
the board would have hearings and you
 
01:38:24.239 --> 01:38:25.669 align:start position:0%
the board would have hearings and you
know

01:38:25.669 --> 01:38:25.679 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:38:27.910 --> 01:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
follow all correct procedures on on what
 
01:38:30.390 --> 01:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
to do and and deal with the money but i
 
01:38:31.990 --> 01:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
know it would fall under the office of
 
01:38:34.390 --> 01:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
professional licensure um which again i
 
01:38:36.550 --> 01:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
don't know how that structure is set up
 
01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:37.430 align:start position:0%
don't know how that structure is set up
so

01:38:37.430 --> 01:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:38:38.709 --> 01:38:38.719 align:start position:0%
you know there certainly would be
 
01:38:43.350 --> 01:38:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:45.830 --> 01:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for answering the question and
 
01:38:49.590 --> 01:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
the only question i have is
 
01:38:51.669 --> 01:38:51.679 align:start position:0%
the statute already states that they
 
01:38:53.910 --> 01:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
shall be guilty of
 
01:38:56.070 --> 01:38:56.080 align:start position:0%
a misdemeanor or if a business that they
 
01:38:58.310 --> 01:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
shall be a felony upon them and i'm just
 
01:39:01.350 --> 01:39:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:02.790 --> 01:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
the board collecting up to a ten
 
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar fine is going to help
 
01:39:05.910 --> 01:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
those aggrieved
 
01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:07.910 align:start position:0%
those aggrieved
homeowners

01:39:07.910 --> 01:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
homeowners
 
01:39:09.669 --> 01:39:09.679 align:start position:0%
any further than what the
 
01:39:11.430 --> 01:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
statute says in
 
01:39:14.310 --> 01:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
making these folks criminals
 
01:39:15.910 --> 01:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
so from
 
01:39:18.149 --> 01:39:18.159 align:start position:0%
from our perspective it's it's it's a
 
01:39:21.189 --> 01:39:21.199 align:start position:0%
civil deterrent you know um i mean what
 
01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
we want to do is
 
01:39:24.709 --> 01:39:24.719 align:start position:0%
certainly let people know look if if you
 
01:39:26.950 --> 01:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
are going to be providing unlicensed
 
01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:28.310 align:start position:0%
are going to be providing unlicensed
practice

01:39:28.310 --> 01:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
practice
 
01:39:29.669 --> 01:39:29.679 align:start position:0%
there is not only going to be this
 
01:39:32.550 --> 01:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
potential criminal uh
 
01:39:34.149 --> 01:39:34.159 align:start position:0%
discipline but there's going to be a
 
01:39:36.390 --> 01:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
monetary a civil monetary aspect of it
 
01:39:38.950 --> 01:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
and quite honestly you know the majority
 
01:39:40.709 --> 01:39:40.719 align:start position:0%
of these practitioners are going to be
 
01:39:43.830 --> 01:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
more afraid of a monetary discipline
 
01:39:46.550 --> 01:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
than they are of a of a criminal or
 
01:39:48.790 --> 01:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
or some other kind of discipline and you
 
01:39:51.189 --> 01:39:51.199 align:start position:0%
know a lot of them their attitude is ah
 
01:39:53.750 --> 01:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
you know go after me so what you know
 
01:39:56.070 --> 01:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
it's your job to come after me
 
01:39:58.870 --> 01:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
for this criminal uh enforcement um
 
01:40:00.390 --> 01:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
whereas you know a lot of them are going
 
01:40:02.629 --> 01:40:02.639 align:start position:0%
to be deterred from from practicing
 
01:40:05.189 --> 01:40:05.199 align:start position:0%
based on the potential of a civil
 
01:40:08.070 --> 01:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
monetary fine yes if you just uh get
 
01:40:09.910 --> 01:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
find somebody ten thousand dollars for
 
01:40:11.910 --> 01:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
every business card they handed out that
 
01:40:13.910 --> 01:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
says you know surveying services when
 
01:40:16.070 --> 01:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
they're not licensed that would uh
 
01:40:19.750 --> 01:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:22.229 --> 01:40:22.239 align:start position:0%
and and that's that's definitely not not
 
01:40:24.950 --> 01:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
the intent but you know certainly
 
01:40:27.669 --> 01:40:27.679 align:start position:0%
preventing the the advertising it would
 
01:40:29.030 --> 01:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
it would certainly
 
01:40:31.189 --> 01:40:31.199 align:start position:0%
strike me as more
 
01:40:31.199 --> 01:40:32.229 align:start position:0%
strike me as more
useful

01:40:32.229 --> 01:40:32.239 align:start position:0%
useful
 
01:40:34.550 --> 01:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
to take somebody that's saying their
 
01:40:36.310 --> 01:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
quality they're licensed when they
 
01:40:38.550 --> 01:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
aren't and hitting them up for every
 
01:40:40.629 --> 01:40:40.639 align:start position:0%
penny you could try to get
 
01:40:42.950 --> 01:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
and scare off the other people that that
 
01:40:45.430 --> 01:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
are in the same situation but that's my
 
01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:47.030 align:start position:0%
are in the same situation but that's my
opinion

01:40:47.030 --> 01:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
01:40:49.030 --> 01:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
all right representative
 
01:40:51.270 --> 01:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
pearson and then marsh
 
01:40:54.550 --> 01:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:55.910 --> 01:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
i'm going to channel my inner schmidt
 
01:40:57.189 --> 01:40:57.199 align:start position:0%
just a little bit
 
01:41:00.390 --> 01:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
i built a 60 000 barn on my property
 
01:41:02.310 --> 01:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
that had a very limited buildable
 
01:41:04.470 --> 01:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
footprint right here
 
01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:06.470 align:start position:0%
footprint right here
and

01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:41:08.310 --> 01:41:08.320 align:start position:0%
i can't even imagine
 
01:41:10.149 --> 01:41:10.159 align:start position:0%
what would have happened if if my
 
01:41:13.109 --> 01:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
neighbor had later on said hey
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
you're two feet onto my property i can't
 
01:41:17.590 --> 01:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
move a six i can't move a barn to that
 
01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
size it's mo the whole bottom is
 
01:41:21.669 --> 01:41:21.679 align:start position:0%
concrete right so
 
01:41:24.950 --> 01:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
it seems as though the effects of
 
01:41:27.790 --> 01:41:27.800 align:start position:0%
of improperly doing surveys has real and
 
01:41:30.629 --> 01:41:30.639 align:start position:0%
substantial consequences here
 
01:41:32.629 --> 01:41:32.639 align:start position:0%
especially when it comes to the erection
 
01:41:34.470 --> 01:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
of structures and and things of that
 
01:41:34.480 --> 01:41:35.910 align:start position:0%
of structures and and things of that
nature

01:41:35.910 --> 01:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
nature
 
01:41:37.990 --> 01:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
but my
 
01:41:39.750 --> 01:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
the question i have though is when these
 
01:41:42.390 --> 01:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
surveys are conducted they are submitted
 
01:41:45.189 --> 01:41:45.199 align:start position:0%
to a local government
 
01:41:47.910 --> 01:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
body in my case the town of derry
 
01:41:51.109 --> 01:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:53.109 --> 01:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
or i suppose if your town doesn't do it
 
01:41:54.950 --> 01:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps a county level
 
01:41:57.350 --> 01:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
takes these
 
01:42:00.550 --> 01:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
surveys i'll use in quotes would it not
 
01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:01.750 align:start position:0%
surveys i'll use in quotes would it not
be

01:42:01.750 --> 01:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:42:05.669 --> 01:42:05.679 align:start position:0%
appropriate or even advantageous to make
 
01:42:08.070 --> 01:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
in statute
 
01:42:10.790 --> 01:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
a provision where a municipality or
 
01:42:12.070 --> 01:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
political subdivision whatever you want
 
01:42:13.109 --> 01:42:13.119 align:start position:0%
to call it
 
01:42:15.669 --> 01:42:15.679 align:start position:0%
cannot accept
 
01:42:18.310 --> 01:42:18.320 align:start position:0%
a land survive survey of any type from
 
01:42:20.790 --> 01:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
an unlicensed that way these never get
 
01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
on file they can they're never used in
 
01:42:25.109 --> 01:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
any sort of governmental decisions
 
01:42:27.430 --> 01:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
and they're they're just you know
 
01:42:28.870 --> 01:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
they're out
 
01:42:31.750 --> 01:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
would that not assist in
 
01:42:34.870 --> 01:42:34.880 align:start position:0%
this venture of making sure that things
 
01:42:37.830 --> 01:42:37.840 align:start position:0%
that we have are done by
 
01:42:41.189 --> 01:42:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:42.709 --> 01:42:42.719 align:start position:0%
certainly um
 
01:42:44.629 --> 01:42:44.639 align:start position:0%
i i i don't necessarily think i'm
 
01:42:46.790 --> 01:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
prepared to speak to
 
01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:47.910 align:start position:0%
prepared to speak to
that

01:42:47.910 --> 01:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:42:49.669 --> 01:42:49.679 align:start position:0%
now because there's a lot of other
 
01:42:51.910 --> 01:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
implications um
 
01:42:54.149 --> 01:42:54.159 align:start position:0%
that go along with that but
 
01:42:56.470 --> 01:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
but certainly when a town accepts
 
01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:57.990 align:start position:0%
but certainly when a town accepts
information

01:42:57.990 --> 01:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
that you know is not
 
01:43:03.590 --> 01:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
certified by a licensed individual and
 
01:43:03.600 --> 01:43:04.950 align:start position:0%
certified by a licensed individual and
um

01:43:04.950 --> 01:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:07.270 --> 01:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
there is the potential for error in that
 
01:43:09.430 --> 01:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
and in
 
01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:11.679 align:start position:0%
the field that i work i i see that
 
01:43:13.590 --> 01:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
constantly and uh
 
01:43:15.270 --> 01:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
the example you gave of the barn you
 
01:43:17.910 --> 01:43:17.920 align:start position:0%
built that's two feet over um
 
01:43:20.070 --> 01:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
that's more common than you think and
 
01:43:22.629 --> 01:43:22.639 align:start position:0%
you know we deal with and resolve issues
 
01:43:25.270 --> 01:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
like that all the time through boundary
 
01:43:27.430 --> 01:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
line adjustments and agreements and
 
01:43:31.189 --> 01:43:31.199 align:start position:0%
easements etc so you know we we see the
 
01:43:34.390 --> 01:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:35.590 --> 01:43:35.600 align:start position:0%
whether it's
 
01:43:37.910 --> 01:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
better to have the town a requirement
 
01:43:39.910 --> 01:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
where the town must accept that
 
01:43:42.629 --> 01:43:42.639 align:start position:0%
certified work um or not i
 
01:43:45.430 --> 01:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
i think that's a discussion for
 
01:43:47.030 --> 01:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not saying that the town
 
01:43:49.510 --> 01:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
needs to accept
 
01:43:50.950 --> 01:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
something from a licensed survey or what
 
01:43:55.350 --> 01:43:55.360 align:start position:0%
i'm what i'm getting at is is that if if
 
01:43:57.669 --> 01:43:57.679 align:start position:0%
you know joe van over here that does
 
01:43:59.189 --> 01:43:59.199 align:start position:0%
surveying out of the back of a pickup
 
01:43:59.199 --> 01:44:00.070 align:start position:0%
surveying out of the back of a pickup
truck

01:44:00.070 --> 01:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
truck
 
01:44:02.149 --> 01:44:02.159 align:start position:0%
is now you know you provide you the
 
01:44:04.629 --> 01:44:04.639 align:start position:0%
service you submit it to your local town
 
01:44:05.830 --> 01:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
they're gonna go yeah this guy's not
 
01:44:08.470 --> 01:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
licensed we don't accept i'm not you see
 
01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
what i'm getting at i do and now when i
 
01:44:11.990 --> 01:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
go to
 
01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:14.639 align:start position:0%
when i went to the town of derry and
 
01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
said you know i want to do this you know
 
01:44:18.310 --> 01:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
they go all right you got to pull your
 
01:44:20.950 --> 01:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
survey map to and go through the
 
01:44:22.149 --> 01:44:22.159 align:start position:0%
planning board process and all that
 
01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
right but
 
01:44:25.189 --> 01:44:25.199 align:start position:0%
i took that from the town in good faith
 
01:44:27.270 --> 01:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
assuming that it was on the up and up
 
01:44:28.550 --> 01:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
now i know the company that did the
 
01:44:29.990 --> 01:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
surveying on my land and i know they're
 
01:44:31.750 --> 01:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
legit but but you see what i'm getting
 
01:44:33.590 --> 01:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
at if that wasn't legitimately done it
 
01:44:34.790 --> 01:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
should have it should never have been
 
01:44:36.229 --> 01:44:36.239 align:start position:0%
something i could have acquired from the
 
01:44:38.149 --> 01:44:38.159 align:start position:0%
town to start with that's that's kind of
 
01:44:39.910 --> 01:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
a safeguard that i'm asking you about
 
01:44:43.030 --> 01:44:43.040 align:start position:0%
here yeah so um i can actually give you
 
01:44:44.950 --> 01:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
an example of something similar to what
 
01:44:46.950 --> 01:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
you're talking about uh recently in a
 
01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
town up in the lakes region
 
01:44:51.270 --> 01:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
a contractor went to the town got a copy
 
01:44:52.790 --> 01:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
of a survey plan
 
01:44:55.910 --> 01:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
which was a boundary line adjustment
 
01:44:57.590 --> 01:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
the boundary line adjustment
 
01:44:57.600 --> 01:44:59.109 align:start position:0%
the boundary line adjustment
was

01:44:59.109 --> 01:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:45:01.830 --> 01:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
stamped by a surveyor showed all of the
 
01:45:03.350 --> 01:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
boundary lines of the two abutting
 
01:45:06.870 --> 01:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
properties he took the plan and uh drew
 
01:45:09.030 --> 01:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
where his garage was going to go it was
 
01:45:11.910 --> 01:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
a commercial structure
 
01:45:14.310 --> 01:45:14.320 align:start position:0%
and then he submitted that well it turns
 
01:45:16.070 --> 01:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
out that boundary line adjustment plan
 
01:45:18.470 --> 01:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
was never approved by the planning board
 
01:45:20.709 --> 01:45:20.719 align:start position:0%
nor was it ever you know approved or
 
01:45:23.590 --> 01:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
accepted by the two abutting owners so
 
01:45:26.790 --> 01:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
the boundary lines on that plan were
 
01:45:29.990 --> 01:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
erroneous they did they didn't exist
 
01:45:32.070 --> 01:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
and it was submitted to the town and
 
01:45:35.109 --> 01:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
they accepted it as a site plan
 
01:45:36.790 --> 01:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
application um
 
01:45:38.629 --> 01:45:38.639 align:start position:0%
had they approved that and gone forward
 
01:45:40.870 --> 01:45:40.880 align:start position:0%
it didn't fortunately was caught
 
01:45:42.470 --> 01:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
but but had they gone forward with that
 
01:45:44.310 --> 01:45:44.320 align:start position:0%
there would have been some significant
 
01:45:45.990 --> 01:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
problems because the line had changed
 
01:45:47.669 --> 01:45:47.679 align:start position:0%
and that garage would have then been on
 
01:45:48.870 --> 01:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
someone else's
 
01:45:50.550 --> 01:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
property so i mean that's just an
 
01:45:52.149 --> 01:45:52.159 align:start position:0%
example of kind of what you're outlining
 
01:45:54.709 --> 01:45:54.719 align:start position:0%
is the information that the towns
 
01:45:57.590 --> 01:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
have to accept should should come from a
 
01:46:01.270 --> 01:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:03.270 --> 01:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
this is not going to be easy then
 
01:46:05.669 --> 01:46:05.679 align:start position:0%
representative martian than allegro
 
01:46:07.350 --> 01:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair thank you for
 
01:46:09.669 --> 01:46:09.679 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh what you're
 
01:46:11.669 --> 01:46:11.679 align:start position:0%
describing here sounds to me an awful
 
01:46:14.310 --> 01:46:14.320 align:start position:0%
lot like deceptive business practices
 
01:46:15.750 --> 01:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
and what i'm wondering is why we're
 
01:46:18.629 --> 01:46:18.639 align:start position:0%
creating a whole section of law and and
 
01:46:21.030 --> 01:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
trying to create a mechanism to deal
 
01:46:22.950 --> 01:46:22.960 align:start position:0%
with these civil fines when we could
 
01:46:24.629 --> 01:46:24.639 align:start position:0%
just as easily
 
01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
add this as an item to the list that's
 
01:46:31.990 --> 01:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:34.070 --> 01:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
again it comes down to enforcement
 
01:46:35.750 --> 01:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
you know who who is
 
01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:36.709 align:start position:0%
you know who who is
what

01:46:36.709 --> 01:46:36.719 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:46:38.390 --> 01:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
where is the enforcement
 
01:46:40.550 --> 01:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
mechanism going to come from that's
 
01:46:42.790 --> 01:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
going to cause more
 
01:46:45.109 --> 01:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
budgetary resources that's going to
 
01:46:47.910 --> 01:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
create more significant administrative
 
01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:48.950 align:start position:0%
create more significant administrative
costs

01:46:48.950 --> 01:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
costs
 
01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:50.149 align:start position:0%
costs
and

01:46:50.149 --> 01:46:50.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:52.550 --> 01:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
you know by instituting
 
01:46:54.870 --> 01:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
a civil money penalty you know not only
 
01:46:56.550 --> 01:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
are we avoiding
 
01:46:58.390 --> 01:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
adding these additional administrative
 
01:47:01.030 --> 01:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
costs that are going to again overburden
 
01:47:04.629 --> 01:47:04.639 align:start position:0%
our enforcement agencies um but you know
 
01:47:07.030 --> 01:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to allow for uh you know a
 
01:47:09.030 --> 01:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
board to have a legitimate hearing as
 
01:47:10.070 --> 01:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
they would
 
01:47:13.109 --> 01:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
during a normal you know licensing um
 
01:47:15.990 --> 01:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
disciplinary hearing and you know levy a
 
01:47:18.950 --> 01:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
a fine which then could again provide an
 
01:47:21.189 --> 01:47:21.199 align:start position:0%
economic offset to the state and the
 
01:47:23.350 --> 01:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
state budget and the courts and you know
 
01:47:25.590 --> 01:47:25.600 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office as opposed
 
01:47:28.390 --> 01:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
to just adding another item to a list
 
01:47:30.229 --> 01:47:30.239 align:start position:0%
which is then going to create
 
01:47:32.950 --> 01:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
again another administrative enforcement
 
01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:34.390 align:start position:0%
again another administrative enforcement
layer

01:47:34.390 --> 01:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
layer
 
01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
with really no
 
01:47:39.270 --> 01:47:39.280 align:start position:0%
budgetary enforcement mechanism and you
 
01:47:40.790 --> 01:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
know that's what we're i think really
 
01:47:42.709 --> 01:47:42.719 align:start position:0%
trying to get to it at this
 
01:47:44.310 --> 01:47:44.320 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative allegra
 
01:47:48.310 --> 01:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:47:50.470 --> 01:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
um i think i'm asking a similar question
 
01:47:52.470 --> 01:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
to representative pearsons but from a
 
01:47:53.910 --> 01:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
different angle
 
01:47:57.910 --> 01:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:00.229 --> 01:48:00.239 align:start position:0%
am i correct in assuming that at present
 
01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
it it is not illegal for a professional
 
01:48:06.709 --> 01:48:06.719 align:start position:0%
but unlicensed surveyor
 
01:48:09.350 --> 01:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
to uh provide services
 
01:48:12.149 --> 01:48:12.159 align:start position:0%
for unofficial use just personal use by
 
01:48:14.470 --> 01:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
a landowner for example is is that the
 
01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:15.669 align:start position:0%
a landowner for example is is that the
case

01:48:15.669 --> 01:48:15.679 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:48:15.679 --> 01:48:16.390 align:start position:0%
case
no

01:48:16.390 --> 01:48:16.400 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:48:20.310 --> 01:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
no um you it is illegal to provide
 
01:48:23.669 --> 01:48:23.679 align:start position:0%
any kind of surveying boundary um
 
01:48:25.990 --> 01:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
services any of the services that would
 
01:48:29.270 --> 01:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
fall under the 310 a63 definition of
 
01:48:31.990 --> 01:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
surveying you know whether it's private
 
01:48:34.470 --> 01:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
or or not i'm i mean if you're talking
 
01:48:36.950 --> 01:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
about a scenario where your your friend
 
01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:38.070 align:start position:0%
about a scenario where your your friend
um

01:48:38.070 --> 01:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:40.790 --> 01:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
is going to come over and maybe help you
 
01:48:42.470 --> 01:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
look for your boundaries or something or
 
01:48:45.350 --> 01:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
look for maybe the pins or monuments
 
01:48:47.910 --> 01:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
that are called out in your deed um
 
01:48:49.590 --> 01:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
just for your own
 
01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:51.109 align:start position:0%
just for your own
personal

01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
personal
 
01:48:53.270 --> 01:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
information um i i don't necessarily
 
01:48:55.669 --> 01:48:55.679 align:start position:0%
think that would be
 
01:48:59.669 --> 01:48:59.679 align:start position:0%
encroaching on the illegal and the um
 
01:49:01.830 --> 01:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
you know practice of
 
01:49:03.189 --> 01:49:03.199 align:start position:0%
surveying because
 
01:49:06.070 --> 01:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
your property you still can go out and
 
01:49:07.910 --> 01:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
search for your own monumentation and
 
01:49:09.189 --> 01:49:09.199 align:start position:0%
and do that
 
01:49:10.790 --> 01:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
but if you're talking about
 
01:49:12.709 --> 01:49:12.719 align:start position:0%
hiring someone
 
01:49:14.550 --> 01:49:14.560 align:start position:0%
that is going to provide a surveying
 
01:49:17.030 --> 01:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
service um whether it's
 
01:49:18.629 --> 01:49:18.639 align:start position:0%
private or whether it's something you
 
01:49:22.070 --> 01:49:22.080 align:start position:0%
want to submit to a town or municipality
 
01:49:25.430 --> 01:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
that would still fall under you know the
 
01:49:27.990 --> 01:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
definition of surveying and still be
 
01:49:30.149 --> 01:49:30.159 align:start position:0%
enforceable as a as a misdemeanor or
 
01:49:30.159 --> 01:49:32.149 align:start position:0%
enforceable as a as a misdemeanor or
felony

01:49:32.149 --> 01:49:32.159 align:start position:0%
felony
 
01:49:33.589 --> 01:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
so this is where it ties in with
 
01:49:35.510 --> 01:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
representative pearson's question is
 
01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:37.430 align:start position:0%
representative pearson's question is
that

01:49:37.430 --> 01:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:49:39.589 --> 01:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
it's a good point that if it's not a
 
01:49:42.390 --> 01:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
licensed uh provider
 
01:49:44.550 --> 01:49:44.560 align:start position:0%
then the town should just
 
01:49:46.390 --> 01:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
not accept it
 
01:49:49.109 --> 01:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
but what i'm asking here is
 
01:49:51.350 --> 01:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
not providing it to a town specifically
 
01:49:53.669 --> 01:49:53.679 align:start position:0%
not providing it to a town so
 
01:49:55.350 --> 01:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
say there's a pond or a lake or some
 
01:49:57.030 --> 01:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
feature on my property and i want it
 
01:49:57.040 --> 01:49:58.550 align:start position:0%
feature on my property and i want it
surveyed

01:49:58.550 --> 01:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
surveyed
 
01:50:00.229 --> 01:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
i have no intention of using it for
 
01:50:03.510 --> 01:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:05.830 --> 01:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
and i don't feel like spending a bundle
 
01:50:07.990 --> 01:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
on a surveyor so i go online i see
 
01:50:10.070 --> 01:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
somebody who does surveying and they'll
 
01:50:13.830 --> 01:50:13.840 align:start position:0%
do it for me for a couple hundred bucks
 
01:50:15.830 --> 01:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh just confirming my original question
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
that would be illegal
 
01:50:20.229 --> 01:50:20.239 align:start position:0%
so there's currently plenty of firms
 
01:50:23.030 --> 01:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
online that you can go online enter your
 
01:50:25.430 --> 01:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
address and they'll provide you with
 
01:50:27.910 --> 01:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
some kind of an exhibit
 
01:50:29.910 --> 01:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
you know for your own use they'll say
 
01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
specifically it's not a survey
 
01:50:34.229 --> 01:50:34.239 align:start position:0%
that they're not providing surveying
 
01:50:36.870 --> 01:50:36.880 align:start position:0%
services uh and probably cost you a
 
01:50:38.870 --> 01:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
couple hundred bucks um we've seen the
 
01:50:41.990 --> 01:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
prices range per deal between 150 and
 
01:50:44.709 --> 01:50:44.719 align:start position:0%
300 dollars for for that kind of service
 
01:50:47.270 --> 01:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
um you know ultimately
 
01:50:49.109 --> 01:50:49.119 align:start position:0%
the problem we see and certainly in my
 
01:50:51.669 --> 01:50:51.679 align:start position:0%
experience is that that document always
 
01:50:53.830 --> 01:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
kind of filters its way
 
01:50:57.030 --> 01:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
out somewhere else whether it be by you
 
01:51:00.950 --> 01:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
a subsequent property owner um
 
01:51:03.350 --> 01:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
some some other information and you know
 
01:51:06.070 --> 01:51:06.080 align:start position:0%
there can be again confusion as to what
 
01:51:09.270 --> 01:51:09.280 align:start position:0%
that document is and uh you know we
 
01:51:10.390 --> 01:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
we see it
 
01:51:11.589 --> 01:51:11.599 align:start position:0%
quite a lot
 
01:51:13.589 --> 01:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:51:16.310 --> 01:51:16.320 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:51:19.109 --> 01:51:19.119 align:start position:0%
okay i think that's
 
01:51:20.550 --> 01:51:20.560 align:start position:0%
that was enough
 
01:51:22.550 --> 01:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your testimony thank
 
01:51:24.229 --> 01:51:24.239 align:start position:0%
you so much for the opportunity william
 
01:51:24.239 --> 01:51:41.990 align:start position:0%
you so much for the opportunity william
doucette

01:51:41.990 --> 01:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:44.310 --> 01:51:44.320 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is bill ducette i'm
 
01:51:46.390 --> 01:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
the chairman of the board of licensure
 
01:51:49.189 --> 01:51:49.199 align:start position:0%
for land surveyors
 
01:51:50.950 --> 01:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
a lot was gone over there and i'm going
 
01:51:55.750 --> 01:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:57.330 --> 01:51:57.340 align:start position:0%
first relative to the
 
01:51:57.340 --> 01:52:01.830 align:start position:0%
first relative to the
[Music]

01:52:01.830 --> 01:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:05.830 --> 01:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
handling of unlicensed practice
 
01:52:08.550 --> 01:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
so as as was stated the way it is done
 
01:52:11.589 --> 01:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
today if a complaint comes to the board
 
01:52:14.950 --> 01:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
and it the complaint is about somebody
 
01:52:17.350 --> 01:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
who is not licensed
 
01:52:19.350 --> 01:52:19.360 align:start position:0%
we have no jurisdiction over that
 
01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:20.629 align:start position:0%
we have no jurisdiction over that
whatsoever

01:52:20.629 --> 01:52:20.639 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
all we can do is refer that to the
 
01:52:25.910 --> 01:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office and offer our
 
01:52:25.920 --> 01:52:27.750 align:start position:0%
attorney general's office and offer our
assistance

01:52:27.750 --> 01:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
um because we feel that you know we do
 
01:52:33.589 --> 01:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
have uh knowledge that may be helpful to
 
01:52:34.870 --> 01:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
the ag's
 
01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:35.990 align:start position:0%
the ag's
on

01:52:35.990 --> 01:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:52:38.229 --> 01:52:38.239 align:start position:0%
distinguishing whether or not
 
01:52:40.790 --> 01:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
in fact per the definition surveying was
 
01:52:42.790 --> 01:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
being taken place
 
01:52:46.629 --> 01:52:46.639 align:start position:0%
um so we offer that assistance
 
01:52:50.790 --> 01:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:53.830 --> 01:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
these complaints
 
01:52:56.790 --> 01:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
may not rise to the
 
01:52:58.629 --> 01:52:58.639 align:start position:0%
level of review
 
01:53:00.390 --> 01:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
due to the
 
01:53:03.109 --> 01:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
exceptional burden that the ag has with
 
01:53:05.990 --> 01:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
with their workload
 
01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:07.030 align:start position:0%
with their workload
so

01:53:07.030 --> 01:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:53:09.109 --> 01:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
we are not asked
 
01:53:10.950 --> 01:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
for input
 
01:53:13.030 --> 01:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
to help assess whether something is
 
01:53:15.510 --> 01:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
surveying or not
 
01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:16.310 align:start position:0%
surveying or not
the

01:53:16.310 --> 01:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:53:18.709 --> 01:53:18.719 align:start position:0%
example that was given about where a
 
01:53:21.669 --> 01:53:21.679 align:start position:0%
contractor was setting property corners
 
01:53:23.270 --> 01:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
that was referred to the attorney
 
01:53:24.790 --> 01:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
general's office and they found that
 
01:53:27.669 --> 01:53:27.679 align:start position:0%
that was not surveying
 
01:53:32.870 --> 01:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:35.430 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:53:35.430 --> 01:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:37.350 --> 01:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
you you've had some very good questions
 
01:53:39.669 --> 01:53:39.679 align:start position:0%
today and as the chairman of the board i
 
01:53:41.830 --> 01:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to
 
01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
where the money goes
 
01:53:46.310 --> 01:53:46.320 align:start position:0%
how to assess whether it's five thousand
 
01:53:48.310 --> 01:53:48.320 align:start position:0%
or ten thousand we would have to lean on
 
01:53:49.750 --> 01:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
the oplc
 
01:53:53.750 --> 01:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:57.430 --> 01:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
but our our board and our public member
 
01:54:00.390 --> 01:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
deal with land surveying on a regular
 
01:54:04.149 --> 01:54:04.159 align:start position:0%
basis and we understand
 
01:54:05.910 --> 01:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
what is surveying and what is not
 
01:54:05.920 --> 01:54:07.030 align:start position:0%
what is surveying and what is not
surveying

01:54:07.030 --> 01:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
surveying
 
01:54:09.109 --> 01:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
and we think that we can provide a
 
01:54:11.109 --> 01:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
valuable role
 
01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
in assisting
 
01:54:16.149 --> 01:54:16.159 align:start position:0%
protecting the public from unlicensed
 
01:54:16.159 --> 01:54:18.550 align:start position:0%
protecting the public from unlicensed
practice

01:54:18.550 --> 01:54:18.560 align:start position:0%
practice
 
01:54:21.189 --> 01:54:21.199 align:start position:0%
and we think the monetary
 
01:54:24.709 --> 01:54:24.719 align:start position:0%
penalty that is being suggested
 
01:54:27.189 --> 01:54:27.199 align:start position:0%
would be a deterrent in
 
01:54:28.709 --> 01:54:28.719 align:start position:0%
my time on the board and i've been on
 
01:54:31.470 --> 01:54:31.480 align:start position:0%
the board since 2015
 
01:54:31.480 --> 01:54:32.870 align:start position:0%
the board since 2015
[Music]

01:54:32.870 --> 01:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:54:35.109 --> 01:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
the most severe penalty that i have seen
 
01:54:37.189 --> 01:54:37.199 align:start position:0%
for unlicensed practice was a cease and
 
01:54:41.830 --> 01:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:44.390 --> 01:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
the most severe penalty that i have seen
 
01:54:47.510 --> 01:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
imposed on unlicensed practice was a
 
01:54:54.870 --> 01:54:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:54.880 --> 01:54:56.629 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:54:56.629 --> 01:54:56.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:55:01.510 --> 01:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:05.109 --> 01:55:05.119 align:start position:0%
bill the non-licensed
 
01:55:07.510 --> 01:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
the non-residential licensure part of
 
01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:09.030 align:start position:0%
the non-residential licensure part of
this

01:55:09.030 --> 01:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:55:11.830 --> 01:55:11.840 align:start position:0%
so i know of two specific cases one is
 
01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:13.350 align:start position:0%
so i know of two specific cases one is
in

01:55:13.350 --> 01:55:13.360 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:55:14.550 --> 01:55:14.560 align:start position:0%

01:55:47.669 --> 01:55:47.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire if you live in another state
 
01:55:53.109 --> 01:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:53.119 --> 01:55:53.990 align:start position:0%
 
like

01:55:53.990 --> 01:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:55.189 align:start position:0%
like
attorneys

01:55:55.189 --> 01:55:55.199 align:start position:0%
attorneys
 
01:55:57.669 --> 01:55:57.679 align:start position:0%
doctors engineers
 
01:55:59.189 --> 01:55:59.199 align:start position:0%
there are less and less people coming
 
01:56:01.830 --> 01:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
into our profession
 
01:56:05.109 --> 01:56:05.119 align:start position:0%
if we can identify deterrence like this
 
01:56:05.119 --> 01:56:05.990 align:start position:0%
if we can identify deterrence like this
and

01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:56:08.470 --> 01:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
hopefully adjust those so that so that
 
01:56:11.750 --> 01:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
qualified people can come to us and seek
 
01:56:14.229 --> 01:56:14.239 align:start position:0%
licensure that would be a great benefit
 
01:56:16.390 --> 01:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
to all and as was
 
01:56:19.510 --> 01:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
stated early in the earlier testimony
 
01:56:21.990 --> 01:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
there's not a project going on in this
 
01:56:24.149 --> 01:56:24.159 align:start position:0%
state that does never severe involved at
 
01:56:29.189 --> 01:56:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:31.750 --> 01:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions
 
01:56:33.430 --> 01:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
thank you are there representative
 
01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:37.109 align:start position:0%
thank you are there representative
schmidt

01:56:37.109 --> 01:56:37.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:39.669 --> 01:56:39.679 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman
 
01:56:42.550 --> 01:56:42.560 align:start position:0%
so mr doucette uh
 
01:56:44.229 --> 01:56:44.239 align:start position:0%
you and i have spoken on the phone but
 
01:56:46.070 --> 01:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
it was a long time ago about
 
01:56:48.229 --> 01:56:48.239 align:start position:0%
surveying in the state of new hampshire
 
01:56:51.589 --> 01:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
but i'll restrict my questioning to
 
01:56:54.470 --> 01:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
this particular bill because i'm
 
01:56:56.629 --> 01:56:56.639 align:start position:0%
questioning whether we're the best
 
01:56:58.709 --> 01:56:58.719 align:start position:0%
committee to be dealing with this it
 
01:57:00.790 --> 01:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
seems more like something that a
 
01:57:04.070 --> 01:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
commerce should be dealing with but uh
 
01:57:07.270 --> 01:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
you have not flat out stated uh whether
 
01:57:09.030 --> 01:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
you are in support of this particular
 
01:57:10.550 --> 01:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
bill as written
 
01:57:12.149 --> 01:57:12.159 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to ask you that question
 
01:57:12.159 --> 01:57:13.430 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to ask you that question
first

01:57:13.430 --> 01:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:57:16.070 --> 01:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
i am in support of it with the amendment
 
01:57:17.830 --> 01:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
and i understand that's awkward because
 
01:57:19.830 --> 01:57:19.840 align:start position:0%
you haven't had a chance to
 
01:57:22.629 --> 01:57:22.639 align:start position:0%
review the amendment uh there were
 
01:57:25.830 --> 01:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
in a nutshell the amendment
 
01:57:29.189 --> 01:57:29.199 align:start position:0%
in my opinion solves a problem where as
 
01:57:32.070 --> 01:57:32.080 align:start position:0%
written currently if you
 
01:57:34.470 --> 01:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
it could be read that if you are
 
01:57:38.070 --> 01:57:38.080 align:start position:0%
licensed in another state
 
01:57:41.510 --> 01:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:44.790 --> 01:57:44.800 align:start position:0%
the amendment addresses that we have our
 
01:57:47.830 --> 01:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
own standards and that includes a
 
01:57:50.310 --> 01:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
exam that covers new hampshire boundary
 
01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:51.669 align:start position:0%
exam that covers new hampshire boundary
law

01:57:51.669 --> 01:57:51.679 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:57:53.750 --> 01:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
and that that is very important to the
 
01:57:56.790 --> 01:57:56.800 align:start position:0%
board um so i am in i am in favor of
 
01:57:56.800 --> 01:57:57.750 align:start position:0%
board um so i am in i am in favor of
this

01:57:57.750 --> 01:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:58:00.310 --> 01:58:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh specifically with the amendment as
 
01:58:00.320 --> 01:58:01.510 align:start position:0%
uh specifically with the amendment as
submitted

01:58:01.510 --> 01:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
submitted
 
01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:03.189 align:start position:0%
submitted
follow-up

01:58:03.189 --> 01:58:03.199 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:58:05.589 --> 01:58:05.599 align:start position:0%
so uh and you are addressing us as the
 
01:58:07.589 --> 01:58:07.599 align:start position:0%
chairman of the board and speaking on
 
01:58:09.910 --> 01:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
behalf of the board and your support of

my name is michael porter and i'm the
 
03:03:08.950 --> 03:03:08.960 align:start position:0%

certification i'm here today to talk
 
03:03:15.510 --> 03:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
about senate bill 230
 
03:03:18.710 --> 03:03:18.720 align:start position:0%

testimony if that's okay
 
03:03:25.990 --> 03:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
under current statutes body art
 
03:03:27.670 --> 03:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
practitioners require individual
 
03:03:29.990 --> 03:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
licensure but the establishments hosting
 
03:03:33.670 --> 03:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
licensed body art practitioners do not
 
03:03:34.950 --> 03:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
the structure proposed by this
 
03:03:37.030 --> 03:03:37.040 align:start position:0%
legislation mirrors other establishments
 
03:03:38.870 --> 03:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
requiring licensure including barbering
 
03:03:41.349 --> 03:03:41.359 align:start position:0%
cosmetology and aesthetics
 
03:03:42.870 --> 03:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
the proposed legislation provides
 
03:03:44.389 --> 03:03:44.399 align:start position:0%
proactive measures for the protection of
 
03:03:46.790 --> 03:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
the public health safety and welfare
 
03:03:48.230 --> 03:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
licensure of an establishment in
 
03:03:49.670 --> 03:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
accordance with rules governing any
 
03:03:51.750 --> 03:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
profession provides a professional
 
03:03:54.950 --> 03:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
licensing board the ability to inspect
 
03:03:56.469 --> 03:03:56.479 align:start position:0%
and enforce statutes and rules
 
03:03:57.910 --> 03:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
proactively without waiting for a
 
03:04:00.070 --> 03:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
consumer complaint to be filed
 
03:04:02.550 --> 03:04:02.560 align:start position:0%
while at the same time
 
03:04:04.790 --> 03:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
boosting consumer confidence
 
03:04:06.550 --> 03:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
practitioners are properly licensed and
 
03:04:08.389 --> 03:04:08.399 align:start position:0%
meet minimum standards required of
 
03:04:08.399 --> 03:04:09.990 align:start position:0%

licensure

03:04:09.990 --> 03:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
licensure
 
03:04:11.750 --> 03:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
under current statutes governing body
 
03:04:13.990 --> 03:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
art oplc is only authorized to
 
03:04:16.070 --> 03:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
investigate licensees after a complaint
 
03:04:17.510 --> 03:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
has been filed
 
03:04:19.429 --> 03:04:19.439 align:start position:0%
which means the harm may have already
 
03:04:19.439 --> 03:04:20.550 align:start position:0%
which means the harm may have already
occurred

03:04:20.550 --> 03:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
occurred
 
03:04:22.710 --> 03:04:22.720 align:start position:0%
the proposed legislation primarily
 
03:04:24.230 --> 03:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
ensures inspectors will have the
 
03:04:26.630 --> 03:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
flexibility to enter an establishment
 
03:04:28.950 --> 03:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of routine inspections
 
03:04:31.030 --> 03:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
to ensure individuals are properly
 
03:04:32.950 --> 03:04:32.960 align:start position:0%

services
 
03:04:36.230 --> 03:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
and that basic health and safety
 
03:04:38.790 --> 03:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
standards are in place
 
03:04:40.630 --> 03:04:40.640 align:start position:0%

03:04:40.640 --> 03:04:42.950 align:start position:0%
i'm now going to turn to unlicensed
practice

03:04:42.950 --> 03:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
practice
 
03:04:45.269 --> 03:04:45.279 align:start position:0%
unlicensed activity is a primary concern
 
03:04:47.590 --> 03:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
in as much as unlicensed practitioners
 
03:04:49.510 --> 03:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
have not met the minimum requirements
 
03:04:52.070 --> 03:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
for licensure set by the board including
 
03:04:55.110 --> 03:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
sanitation and health requirements
 
03:04:57.349 --> 03:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
unlicensed practice erodes consumer
 
03:04:59.429 --> 03:04:59.439 align:start position:0%
confidence in the profession and harms
 
03:05:01.349 --> 03:05:01.359 align:start position:0%
the reputation
 
03:05:02.790 --> 03:05:02.800 align:start position:0%
professionals who have met the minimum
 
03:05:04.950 --> 03:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
standards required for licensure
 
03:05:06.950 --> 03:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to the health
 
03:05:09.510 --> 03:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
and safety standards
 
03:05:11.429 --> 03:05:11.439 align:start position:0%
most times unlicensed practice is
 
03:05:13.110 --> 03:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
discovered as a result of random
 
03:05:13.120 --> 03:05:14.389 align:start position:0%
discovered as a result of random
inspections

03:05:14.389 --> 03:05:14.399 align:start position:0%
inspections
 
03:05:16.550 --> 03:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
if an establishment is not licensed we
 
03:05:18.150 --> 03:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
are not authorized to enter for the
 
03:05:19.750 --> 03:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
purposes of conducting a random
 
03:05:19.760 --> 03:05:21.110 align:start position:0%
purposes of conducting a random
inspection

03:05:21.110 --> 03:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
03:05:23.830 --> 03:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
therefore the likelihood of not
 
03:05:27.910 --> 03:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
catching unlicensed practice is high
 
03:05:30.150 --> 03:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
if unlicensed practice is reported by a
 
03:05:32.790 --> 03:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
consumer or through other means
 
03:05:35.429 --> 03:05:35.439 align:start position:0%
oftentimes the harm has already occurred
 
03:05:37.990 --> 03:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
without having the authority to enter an
 
03:05:40.309 --> 03:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
establishment we are unable to conduct
 
03:05:42.150 --> 03:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
these random inspections which limits
 
03:05:43.990 --> 03:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
our ability to discover the unlicensed
 
03:05:44.000 --> 03:05:46.070 align:start position:0%
our ability to discover the unlicensed
practice

03:05:46.070 --> 03:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
practice
 
03:05:47.830 --> 03:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
many boards have statutes that incur
 
03:05:50.070 --> 03:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties for individuals
 
03:05:51.750 --> 03:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
engaged in the license of practice and i
 
03:05:53.269 --> 03:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
can talk about a couple of cases which
 
03:05:54.870 --> 03:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
are public now
 
03:05:58.150 --> 03:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
involving uh aesthetics and barbering
 
03:06:00.070 --> 03:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
and cosmetology
 
03:06:01.990 --> 03:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
our inspectors had done some inspections
 
03:06:03.590 --> 03:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
in the southern tier of the state where
 
03:06:06.550 --> 03:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
we found um in one particular incident
 
03:06:07.910 --> 03:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
every employee of the shop was
 
03:06:07.920 --> 03:06:09.590 align:start position:0%
every employee of the shop was
unlicensed

03:06:09.590 --> 03:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
unlicensed
 
03:06:12.150 --> 03:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
so because of the fact that we regulate
 
03:06:12.160 --> 03:06:13.590 align:start position:0%
so because of the fact that we regulate
the

03:06:13.590 --> 03:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:06:15.510 --> 03:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
the shop licensure
 
03:06:17.990 --> 03:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
we were able to expedite an emergency
 
03:06:20.230 --> 03:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
suspension immediately
 
03:06:22.550 --> 03:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
through the board the board we brought
 
03:06:24.150 --> 03:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
our evidence to the board
 
03:06:25.750 --> 03:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
they immediately suspended the shop
 
03:06:27.670 --> 03:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
license which meant all operations had
 
03:06:28.790 --> 03:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
to cease
 
03:06:30.950 --> 03:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
at the same time we continued to work
 
03:06:33.349 --> 03:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
with the shop owner to
 
03:06:35.349 --> 03:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
assist with the licensure licensure
 
03:06:38.070 --> 03:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
process so that he could open
 
03:06:41.030 --> 03:06:41.040 align:start position:0%
more rapidly this took about 30 to 45
 
03:06:43.830 --> 03:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
days what we found were the five or six
 
03:06:45.590 --> 03:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
individuals were from massachusetts they
 
03:06:48.469 --> 03:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
were coming up here working unlicensed
 
03:06:53.190 --> 03:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:55.670 --> 03:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
ultimately we we brought them before the
 
03:06:57.590 --> 03:06:57.600 align:start position:0%
board for a final hearing
 
03:06:59.269 --> 03:06:59.279 align:start position:0%
they entered into a final settlement
 
03:07:01.030 --> 03:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
agreement but we also were able to make
 
03:07:03.349 --> 03:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
a referral to law enforcement because
 
03:07:05.510 --> 03:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
the shop owner knowingly engaging
 
03:07:07.590 --> 03:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
employees who are not licensed is a
 
03:07:09.590 --> 03:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
criminal offense
 
03:07:12.309 --> 03:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
that case is being prosecuted currently
 
03:07:13.750 --> 03:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
by the new hampshire attorney general's
 
03:07:13.760 --> 03:07:14.630 align:start position:0%
by the new hampshire attorney general's
office

03:07:14.630 --> 03:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
office
 
03:07:17.269 --> 03:07:17.279 align:start position:0%
we had a second case very similar
 
03:07:19.030 --> 03:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
and i highlight those cases because
 
03:07:22.389 --> 03:07:22.399 align:start position:0%
without the ability to go in and inspect
 
03:07:23.590 --> 03:07:23.600 align:start position:0%
we never would have caught these
 
03:07:23.600 --> 03:07:24.950 align:start position:0%
we never would have caught these
individuals

03:07:24.950 --> 03:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
03:07:27.110 --> 03:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
operating without a license
 
03:07:30.230 --> 03:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
subsequently both shops were reopened
 
03:07:32.150 --> 03:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
both shops are in full compliance with
 
03:07:33.510 --> 03:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
health and safety
 
03:07:33.520 --> 03:07:34.630 align:start position:0%
health and safety
standards

03:07:34.630 --> 03:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
standards
 
03:07:36.950 --> 03:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
and i believe we we did a second
 
03:07:39.670 --> 03:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
inspection on both and we were able to
 
03:07:41.670 --> 03:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
be satisfied with that
 
03:07:41.680 --> 03:07:42.630 align:start position:0%
be satisfied with that
so

03:07:42.630 --> 03:07:42.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:07:45.030 --> 03:07:45.040 align:start position:0%
currently with this particular practice
 
03:07:46.550 --> 03:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
body art
 
03:07:48.790 --> 03:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
we do not have the authority to go in
 
03:07:50.550 --> 03:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
and we do receive phone calls about
 
03:07:52.469 --> 03:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
unlicensed practice but we can't go into
 
03:07:54.630 --> 03:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
the establishment we can send a
 
03:07:56.790 --> 03:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
complaint to the individual a written
 
03:07:56.800 --> 03:07:58.150 align:start position:0%
complaint to the individual a written
complaint

03:07:58.150 --> 03:07:58.160 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
03:08:00.710 --> 03:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
but whether they respond or not
 
03:08:02.150 --> 03:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
that's really up to them we we have
 
03:08:04.150 --> 03:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
other measures if they are licensed and
 
03:08:06.550 --> 03:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
don't respond but if they're unlicensed
 
03:08:09.030 --> 03:08:09.040 align:start position:0%
then we have no authority and there's
 
03:08:10.630 --> 03:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
nothing we can do to protect the public
 
03:08:14.309 --> 03:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:16.230 --> 03:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
we have been working with a number of
 
03:08:18.469 --> 03:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
municipalities in the southern tier and
 
03:08:19.670 --> 03:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
on the eastern
 
03:08:21.429 --> 03:08:21.439 align:start position:0%
side of the state as well
 
03:08:21.439 --> 03:08:22.550 align:start position:0%
side of the state as well
where

03:08:22.550 --> 03:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:08:24.710 --> 03:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
many municipalities have told us that
 
03:08:26.870 --> 03:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
while yes they do have some enforcement
 
03:08:29.349 --> 03:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
ability they don't have the manpower and
 
03:08:30.870 --> 03:08:30.880 align:start position:0%
through cobid
 
03:08:32.790 --> 03:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
they certainly didn't have the manpower
 
03:08:35.670 --> 03:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
and so in speaking with a number of them
 
03:08:37.190 --> 03:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
they felt it would be best to have more
 
03:08:39.269 --> 03:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
of a central repository
 
03:08:42.550 --> 03:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
such as through oplc to license the shop
 
03:08:44.790 --> 03:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
give us the authority to inspect if we
 
03:08:47.110 --> 03:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
find wrongdoing
 
03:08:49.349 --> 03:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
we already have the authority to reach
 
03:08:51.349 --> 03:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
out to law enforcement but we'd also
 
03:08:53.349 --> 03:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
have the authority to reach out to the
 
03:08:55.510 --> 03:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
public boards of health uh for any
 
03:08:57.510 --> 03:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
violations that we would find and
 
03:08:58.710 --> 03:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
trigger that
 
03:08:58.720 --> 03:09:00.230 align:start position:0%
trigger that
so

03:09:00.230 --> 03:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:09:03.429 --> 03:09:03.439 align:start position:0%
we understand that this is this is a
 
03:09:06.070 --> 03:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
it's not a large scale measure or
 
03:09:08.950 --> 03:09:08.960 align:start position:0%
operation but any individual who is
 
03:09:11.110 --> 03:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
operating without a license
 
03:09:12.630 --> 03:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't meet the minimum standards
 
03:09:15.030 --> 03:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
required and is a harm and threat to the
 
03:09:19.830 --> 03:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:21.510 --> 03:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
in conclusion in conclusion the
 
03:09:23.030 --> 03:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
establishment licensure at the state
 
03:09:25.110 --> 03:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
level does provide consumers with
 
03:09:26.790 --> 03:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
confidence that the establishments and
 
03:09:28.630 --> 03:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
licensees are operating within lawful
 
03:09:31.269 --> 03:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
means and provides proactive protection
 
03:09:33.750 --> 03:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
for the public health safety and welfare
 
03:09:36.229 --> 03:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
proactive measures help identify
 
03:09:38.870 --> 03:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
issues before they arise
 
03:09:41.590 --> 03:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
if you have any additional questions or
 
03:09:43.429 --> 03:09:43.439 align:start position:0%
if you'd like to have a conversation i
 
03:09:45.510 --> 03:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
can be reached at two seven one zero one
 
03:09:47.269 --> 03:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
four zero and i'm happy to take any
 
03:09:49.830 --> 03:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
questions from this committee
 
03:09:51.910 --> 03:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr porter are there questions
 
03:09:54.309 --> 03:09:54.319 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
03:09:54.319 --> 03:09:56.830 align:start position:0%
from the committee
representative

03:09:56.830 --> 03:09:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:59.349 --> 03:09:59.359 align:start position:0%
schmidt thank you madam chair well it's
 
03:10:01.190 --> 03:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
kind of astonishing in a way to hear
 
03:10:04.469 --> 03:10:04.479 align:start position:0%
that that you have no authority it seems
 
03:10:06.469 --> 03:10:06.479 align:start position:0%
inherent it's kind of like uh the
 
03:10:08.710 --> 03:10:08.720 align:start position:0%
revenuers you know
 
03:10:10.630 --> 03:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
but of course law enforcement has the
 
03:10:12.950 --> 03:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
authority that you guys don't have they
 
03:10:15.429 --> 03:10:15.439 align:start position:0%
can go after any illegal act
 
03:10:15.439 --> 03:10:16.150 align:start position:0%
can go after any illegal act
but

03:10:16.150 --> 03:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:10:17.990 --> 03:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
what these people are doing is illegal
 
03:10:20.070 --> 03:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
but you but you're not the cops is that
 
03:10:22.870 --> 03:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
what you're basically saying
 
03:10:25.590 --> 03:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
in some senses yes
 
03:10:28.070 --> 03:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
i get a follow-up so do you have any
 
03:10:31.269 --> 03:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
idea how many uh such operations are out
 
03:10:34.710 --> 03:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
there that uh that that you're aware of
 
03:10:36.150 --> 03:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
and you would
 
03:10:38.229 --> 03:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
stop if you if you
 
03:10:40.790 --> 03:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
uh had that authority
 
03:10:43.030 --> 03:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
we we don't track the number of shops
 
03:10:45.190 --> 03:10:45.200 align:start position:0%
because it's not something that we would
 
03:10:46.550 --> 03:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
have no way to measure that that
 
03:10:48.950 --> 03:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
quantity i can tell you during covid
 
03:10:51.030 --> 03:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
we received a number of phone calls at
 
03:10:52.870 --> 03:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
the height of covid where people would
 
03:10:55.190 --> 03:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
complain that a shop was open and there
 
03:10:56.550 --> 03:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
was very little we could do we would
 
03:10:57.990 --> 03:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
refer it to the attorney general's
 
03:10:58.000 --> 03:10:59.110 align:start position:0%
refer it to the attorney general's
office

03:10:59.110 --> 03:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
office
 
03:11:02.070 --> 03:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
um but we did not have authority to go
 
03:11:04.469 --> 03:11:04.479 align:start position:0%
and inspect and give an explanation if
 
03:11:06.550 --> 03:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
we have
 
03:11:08.870 --> 03:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
under cosmetology if a shop was open and
 
03:11:10.229 --> 03:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
we had an issue i think it was up in
 
03:11:11.670 --> 03:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
littleton area
 
03:11:13.910 --> 03:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh where we were notified actually by
 
03:11:15.990 --> 03:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and so we were able to
 
03:11:17.590 --> 03:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that we had the shop
 
03:11:19.429 --> 03:11:19.439 align:start position:0%
license uh
 
03:11:21.190 --> 03:11:21.200 align:start position:0%
and because we regulate that
 
03:11:22.630 --> 03:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
send them a letter to basically cease
 
03:11:24.790 --> 03:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
and desist and and stop the practice and
 
03:11:26.469 --> 03:11:26.479 align:start position:0%
you know in compliance with with the
 
03:11:30.229 --> 03:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
orders um that person did um he did so
 
03:11:33.110 --> 03:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
one more so so the thing is you said
 
03:11:33.120 --> 03:11:34.550 align:start position:0%
one more so so the thing is you said
that

03:11:34.550 --> 03:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:11:36.950 --> 03:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
either you read or you said that the
 
03:11:38.870 --> 03:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh that several
 
03:11:41.590 --> 03:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
shops were operating illegally and
 
03:11:43.349 --> 03:11:43.359 align:start position:0%
unlicensed before
 
03:11:45.269 --> 03:11:45.279 align:start position:0%
uh i guess i couldn't say that they're
 
03:11:47.510 --> 03:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
illegal if you don't have any authority
 
03:11:49.990 --> 03:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
but um
 
03:11:50.000 --> 03:11:51.030 align:start position:0%
but um
uh

03:11:51.030 --> 03:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:11:52.870 --> 03:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
and but now they are
 
03:11:55.510 --> 03:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
up to standard they're operating
 
03:11:58.150 --> 03:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
what's their excuse for
 
03:12:00.229 --> 03:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
just ignorance that they
 
03:12:02.790 --> 03:12:02.800 align:start position:0%
i i can give you a direct quote um we
 
03:12:04.070 --> 03:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
actually had a public hearing on the
 
03:12:06.070 --> 03:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
matter um and i actually prosecuted the
 
03:12:08.150 --> 03:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
matter and uh when the individual
 
03:12:09.990 --> 03:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
appeared before the board his question
 
03:12:12.229 --> 03:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
was how many unlicensed people am i
 
03:12:15.030 --> 03:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
allowed to have in my shop before i get
 
03:12:16.550 --> 03:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
suspended and that was a legitimate
 
03:12:19.190 --> 03:12:19.200 align:start position:0%
question that he asked because
 
03:12:20.550 --> 03:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
unfortunately you know some people think
 
03:12:23.269 --> 03:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
well i can have one or two and i'm okay
 
03:12:25.990 --> 03:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
the answer from the board was zero
 
03:12:27.510 --> 03:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
and in that one that was the one who had
 
03:12:29.910 --> 03:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
five or six unlicensed
 
03:12:31.590 --> 03:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
individuals in his shop
 
03:12:33.670 --> 03:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
the reason we referred that for criminal
 
03:12:35.590 --> 03:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
prosecution was
 
03:12:38.389 --> 03:12:38.399 align:start position:0%
really the blase attitude of well how
 
03:12:40.309 --> 03:12:40.319 align:start position:0%
many am i allowed to have the second
 
03:12:42.070 --> 03:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
shop owner was not referred for criminal
 
03:12:43.830 --> 03:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
prosecution because there was a question
 
03:12:45.030 --> 03:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
as to
 
03:12:47.429 --> 03:12:47.439 align:start position:0%
what his knowledge base was of those
 
03:12:50.150 --> 03:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
individuals who he and he did employ
 
03:12:52.309 --> 03:12:52.319 align:start position:0%
we were able to work with both however
 
03:12:54.309 --> 03:12:54.319 align:start position:0%
to reopen their shops
 
03:12:54.319 --> 03:12:55.349 align:start position:0%
to reopen their shops
legally

03:12:55.349 --> 03:12:55.359 align:start position:0%
legally
 
03:12:57.510 --> 03:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
and have the protection for the public
 
03:13:01.670 --> 03:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:02.950 --> 03:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
03:13:04.550 --> 03:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
chief for taking my question sure how
 
03:13:06.150 --> 03:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
many people in your department actually
 
03:13:07.670 --> 03:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
go out and
 
03:13:09.670 --> 03:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
go after the
 
03:13:12.950 --> 03:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
businesses that are by violating this
 
03:13:14.870 --> 03:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
so currently we have two inspectors in
 
03:13:17.429 --> 03:13:17.439 align:start position:0%
the barbering cosmetology unit uh we
 
03:13:19.190 --> 03:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
have and i don't have the exact numbers
 
03:13:21.190 --> 03:13:21.200 align:start position:0%
we also have pharmacy inspectors i
 
03:13:22.790 --> 03:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
believe we have three that work with the
 
03:13:22.800 --> 03:13:23.990 align:start position:0%
believe we have three that work with the
pharmacies

03:13:23.990 --> 03:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
pharmacies
 
03:13:25.990 --> 03:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
uh we have electrical inspectors there
 
03:13:32.710 --> 03:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:34.710 --> 03:13:34.720 align:start position:0%
five mechanical inspectors and four
 
03:13:36.070 --> 03:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
electrical so
 
03:13:38.229 --> 03:13:38.239 align:start position:0%
dedicated to this in this bill is a
 
03:13:39.910 --> 03:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
request for
 
03:13:41.990 --> 03:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
another position which we would need to
 
03:13:44.870 --> 03:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
assist um in the inspections of these
 
03:13:44.880 --> 03:13:48.229 align:start position:0%
assist um in the inspections of these
shops

03:13:48.229 --> 03:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:50.710 --> 03:13:50.720 align:start position:0%
thank you are there other questions
 
03:13:53.670 --> 03:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
yes representative fontenot
 
03:13:55.670 --> 03:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair
 
03:13:59.429 --> 03:13:59.439 align:start position:0%
um can can you would this uh would this
 
03:14:03.269 --> 03:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
fall under your barbering cosmetology
 
03:14:05.590 --> 03:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
division or would this be a
 
03:14:07.110 --> 03:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
new separate
 
03:14:09.030 --> 03:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
division so it would be held it would be
 
03:14:11.429 --> 03:14:11.439 align:start position:0%
housed in the enforcement division um
 
03:14:13.590 --> 03:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
and so you know what what the specs
 
03:14:15.349 --> 03:14:15.359 align:start position:0%
would look like as far as qualifications
 
03:14:16.389 --> 03:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
we would have to work that out
 
03:14:18.630 --> 03:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
internally uh but they would just be
 
03:14:20.790 --> 03:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
another inspector within our division of
 
03:14:23.349 --> 03:14:23.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement can you tell me in general
 
03:14:25.349 --> 03:14:25.359 align:start position:0%
in this oh follow up
 
03:14:28.150 --> 03:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
in general in the state
 
03:14:30.790 --> 03:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
how many other of the professions
 
03:14:33.590 --> 03:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
require the business to be licensed as
 
03:14:36.870 --> 03:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
well as the individuals to be licensed
 
03:14:37.990 --> 03:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
i can only tell you what we have
 
03:14:40.550 --> 03:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over and that would be for
 
03:14:42.790 --> 03:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
the barbering cosmetology they have shop
 
03:14:45.990 --> 03:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
licenses um they also have apprentice
 
03:14:48.229 --> 03:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
licenses and then there's barbarian
 
03:14:50.830 --> 03:14:50.840 align:start position:0%
cosmetology or aesthetics
 
03:14:53.670 --> 03:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
um that is the only
 
03:14:53.680 --> 03:14:55.830 align:start position:0%
um that is the only
uh

03:14:55.830 --> 03:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:14:58.229 --> 03:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
i believe the only enterprise that we
 
03:15:01.590 --> 03:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh plumbers and electricians have a
 
03:15:03.910 --> 03:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
business license that is required as
 
03:15:06.309 --> 03:15:06.319 align:start position:0%
well as the individual licenses right
 
03:15:07.990 --> 03:15:08.000 align:start position:0%
and i believe that's not enforceable
 
03:15:10.309 --> 03:15:10.319 align:start position:0%
with us i believe that's a separate
 
03:15:13.030 --> 03:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
we have individual licensure with them
 
03:15:14.630 --> 03:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
but right now they're the only shops
 
03:15:16.469 --> 03:15:16.479 align:start position:0%
that i believe they're the only shops
 
03:15:20.630 --> 03:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:23.030 --> 03:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry pharma yes pharmacies also uh
 
03:15:24.790 --> 03:15:24.800 align:start position:0%
they receive permits to operate their
 
03:15:26.150 --> 03:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
pharmacies through
 
03:15:28.550 --> 03:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh oplc as well
 
03:15:30.150 --> 03:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:15:32.309 --> 03:15:32.319 align:start position:0%

03:15:44.950 --> 03:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
operated with a fake license
 
03:15:47.510 --> 03:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire
 
03:15:48.870 --> 03:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry if
 
03:15:52.630 --> 03:15:52.640 align:start position:0%
someone if you never have a case someone
 
03:15:55.190 --> 03:15:55.200 align:start position:0%
being appropriated with a fake license
 
03:15:58.070 --> 03:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
or a funny license yep okay do you have
 
03:15:59.910 --> 03:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
that case in new hampshire
 
03:16:01.670 --> 03:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
so i
 
03:16:05.110 --> 03:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of any um
 
03:16:06.950 --> 03:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
well we we've we've dealt with some
 
03:16:09.030 --> 03:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
altered and doctors like doctored
 
03:16:11.990 --> 03:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
licenses uh they might have fudged out
 
03:16:13.750 --> 03:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
the expiration date but it's somebody
 
03:16:16.950 --> 03:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
who was previously licensed um but i
 
03:16:18.550 --> 03:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
don't believe we've run into that
 
03:16:20.550 --> 03:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
situation where somebody has duplicated
 
03:16:24.150 --> 03:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
a a a fake license and hung it not that
 
03:16:28.550 --> 03:16:28.560 align:start position:0%

03:16:45.190 --> 03:16:45.200 align:start position:0%
11.
 
03:16:54.389 --> 03:16:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:56.630 --> 03:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
i apologize for that around
 
03:16:58.870 --> 03:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
line 11 on the first page it talks about
 
03:17:02.070 --> 03:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
the fact that that if the establishment
 
03:17:06.550 --> 03:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:09.269 --> 03:17:09.279 align:start position:0%
apparently anything
 
03:17:11.030 --> 03:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
that's under
 
03:17:11.040 --> 03:17:13.349 align:start position:0%
that's under
oplc

03:17:13.349 --> 03:17:13.359 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
03:17:13.359 --> 03:17:14.309 align:start position:0%
oplc
that

03:17:14.309 --> 03:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:17:16.110 --> 03:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
for the body art
 
03:17:18.870 --> 03:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
establishment license they would have a
 
03:17:20.950 --> 03:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
reduced fee
 
03:17:24.550 --> 03:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
and and then on page two
 
03:17:27.190 --> 03:17:27.200 align:start position:0%
it says
 
03:17:33.510 --> 03:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:35.429 --> 03:17:35.439 align:start position:0%
oh it has this it has essentially the
 
03:17:37.670 --> 03:17:37.680 align:start position:0%
same thing and that
 
03:17:39.269 --> 03:17:39.279 align:start position:0%
the establishment
 
03:17:41.269 --> 03:17:41.279 align:start position:0%
here's my my question
 
03:17:44.950 --> 03:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
so i'm wondering how big this scope is
 
03:17:44.960 --> 03:17:45.830 align:start position:0%
so i'm wondering how big this scope is
and

03:17:45.830 --> 03:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:17:48.309 --> 03:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
if the manager you could have a manager
 
03:17:49.910 --> 03:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
that really doesn't know anything about
 
03:17:52.309 --> 03:17:52.319 align:start position:0%
body art but they could have body art in
 
03:17:55.429 --> 03:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
their establishment so uh so can you
 
03:17:57.190 --> 03:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
straighten that out
 
03:17:58.790 --> 03:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
and i'll use and i hate to keep going
 
03:18:00.710 --> 03:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
back to my catch-all but uh barbarian
 
03:18:00.720 --> 03:18:02.229 align:start position:0%
back to my catch-all but uh barbarian
cosmetology

03:18:02.229 --> 03:18:02.239 align:start position:0%
cosmetology
 
03:18:04.309 --> 03:18:04.319 align:start position:0%
you don't have to be a licensee to
 
03:18:06.550 --> 03:18:06.560 align:start position:0%
operate a shop
 
03:18:09.750 --> 03:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
you do require a shop license
 
03:18:11.429 --> 03:18:11.439 align:start position:0%
and again
 
03:18:13.670 --> 03:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
the individuals you hire to conduct the
 
03:18:15.269 --> 03:18:15.279 align:start position:0%
services have to have the license in
 
03:18:16.710 --> 03:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
that profession
 
03:18:19.110 --> 03:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
um but we that still gives us the
 
03:18:19.120 --> 03:18:20.229 align:start position:0%
um but we that still gives us the
authority

03:18:20.229 --> 03:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
authority
 
03:18:22.229 --> 03:18:22.239 align:start position:0%
that if they hire unlicensed
 
03:18:22.239 --> 03:18:23.670 align:start position:0%
that if they hire unlicensed
practitioners

03:18:23.670 --> 03:18:23.680 align:start position:0%
practitioners
 
03:18:25.510 --> 03:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
we at least have the authority to go in
 
03:18:28.150 --> 03:18:28.160 align:start position:0%
right away if the board so chose to
 
03:18:30.469 --> 03:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
suspend the shop license which closes
 
03:18:32.229 --> 03:18:32.239 align:start position:0%
everything until they come into
 
03:18:34.710 --> 03:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
compliance so you don't have to be
 
03:18:37.590 --> 03:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
a body art practitioner in order to own
 
03:18:43.190 --> 03:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:45.030 --> 03:18:45.040 align:start position:0%
yes you really have to make sure there
 
03:18:47.510 --> 03:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
is a an appropriately licensed person
 
03:18:50.070 --> 03:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
who runs it you don't have to have a
 
03:18:52.229 --> 03:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
license to own it
 
03:18:53.830 --> 03:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
but you need
 
03:18:55.590 --> 03:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
a manager
 
03:18:55.600 --> 03:18:57.910 align:start position:0%
a manager
who's

03:18:57.910 --> 03:18:57.920 align:start position:0%
who's
 
03:18:57.920 --> 03:18:59.030 align:start position:0%
who's
licensed

03:18:59.030 --> 03:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
licensed
 
03:19:02.070 --> 03:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
under something yes for example if you
 
03:19:03.510 --> 03:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
if you're
 
03:19:05.429 --> 03:19:05.439 align:start position:0%
if your hairdresser wanted to put a
 
03:19:07.190 --> 03:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
little uh tattoo
 
03:19:09.030 --> 03:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
chair in the back of the salon they
 
03:19:11.269 --> 03:19:11.279 align:start position:0%
would not need they would get a cut rate
 
03:19:13.110 --> 03:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
on the
 
03:19:15.670 --> 03:19:15.680 align:start position:0%

other questions
 
03:19:23.040 --> 03:19:24.389 align:start position:0%
other questions
yes

03:19:24.389 --> 03:19:24.399 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:19:27.990 --> 03:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
i have a a comment the as as you see on
 
03:19:28.000 --> 03:19:29.990 align:start position:0%
i have a a comment the as as you see on

03:19:29.990 --> 03:19:30.000 align:start position:0%

the

03:19:34.870 --> 03:19:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:37.190 --> 03:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
the board already has rule making
 
03:19:39.349 --> 03:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
authority over inspection
 
03:19:44.630 --> 03:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:49.429 --> 03:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:49.439 --> 03:19:51.510 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:19:51.510 --> 03:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:19:53.429 --> 03:19:53.439 align:start position:0%
it's on page
 
03:19:55.750 --> 03:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
1 line
 
03:20:03.750 --> 03:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:07.429 --> 03:20:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:09.510 --> 03:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
if you have if you can make rules about
 
03:20:11.750 --> 03:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
it that implies you can do it
 
03:20:11.760 --> 03:20:14.950 align:start position:0%
it that implies you can do it
so

03:20:14.950 --> 03:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:17.910 --> 03:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
so yeah i so and i'm not familiar with
 
03:20:20.150 --> 03:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
the statute and i'm going to guess but
 
03:20:21.750 --> 03:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
this statute might be under the rule
 
03:20:24.469 --> 03:20:24.479 align:start position:0%
making authority of the board itself
 
03:20:27.269 --> 03:20:27.279 align:start position:0%
um as the executive director the
 
03:20:30.550 --> 03:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
body artisan advisory board correct um
 
03:20:30.560 --> 03:20:31.429 align:start position:0%
body artisan advisory board correct um
so

03:20:31.429 --> 03:20:31.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:20:33.990 --> 03:20:34.000 align:start position:0%
the problem is we there's no statutory
 
03:20:37.910 --> 03:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement of that and so
 
03:20:40.070 --> 03:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
it's the process by which
 
03:20:42.389 --> 03:20:42.399 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm not i can't answer that
 
03:20:43.990 --> 03:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
directly but i can tell you that if it's
 
03:20:45.190 --> 03:20:45.200 align:start position:0%
made by rule
 
03:20:47.590 --> 03:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
we do we do issue rule violations but a
 
03:20:49.429 --> 03:20:49.439 align:start position:0%
statutory violation
 
03:20:51.590 --> 03:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
which then makes it a potential criminal
 
03:20:51.600 --> 03:20:52.790 align:start position:0%
which then makes it a potential criminal
penalty

03:20:52.790 --> 03:20:52.800 align:start position:0%
penalty
 
03:20:55.830 --> 03:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
um is what would follow through and
 
03:20:58.070 --> 03:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
this is really a two-pronged attempt the
 
03:20:59.750 --> 03:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
first is to ensure
 
03:21:02.229 --> 03:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
that anybody who opens a shop you know
 
03:21:04.469 --> 03:21:04.479 align:start position:0%
is licensed and they're responsible for
 
03:21:06.229 --> 03:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
the activities that go on in their shop
 
03:21:08.710 --> 03:21:08.720 align:start position:0%
and if they hire unlicensed individuals
 
03:21:10.469 --> 03:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
if we don't have the authority to go
 
03:21:12.229 --> 03:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
after the unlicensed person for whatever
 
03:21:14.630 --> 03:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
the reason we do have legal authority
 
03:21:17.030 --> 03:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
under the law to hold the shop owner
 
03:21:17.040 --> 03:21:19.030 align:start position:0%
under the law to hold the shop owner
responsible

03:21:19.030 --> 03:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
03:21:21.110 --> 03:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
it's it's a little convoluted at times
 
03:21:22.710 --> 03:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
and that's why we were looking for this
 
03:21:26.150 --> 03:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
language in this statute okay because
 
03:21:28.389 --> 03:21:28.399 align:start position:0%
the i've happened to be looked further
 
03:21:30.309 --> 03:21:30.319 align:start position:0%
down in the statute
 
03:21:34.070 --> 03:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
and it's in 3 14 a 12 a person who shall
 
03:21:36.630 --> 03:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
practice or attempt to practice
 
03:21:38.710 --> 03:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
tattooing body piercing branding without
 
03:21:40.710 --> 03:21:40.720 align:start position:0%
a license shall be guilty of a class a
 
03:21:42.870 --> 03:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor or
 
03:21:45.750 --> 03:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
or a felony if you're you're a business
 
03:21:47.830 --> 03:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
and then again if you violate any other
 
03:21:49.670 --> 03:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
provision of the chapter or rules
 
03:21:51.990 --> 03:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
adopted this chapter guilt shall be
 
03:21:54.229 --> 03:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
guilty of a violation or felony of your
 
03:21:57.429 --> 03:21:57.439 align:start position:0%
business for a first offense
 
03:21:57.439 --> 03:21:59.429 align:start position:0%
business for a first offense
so

03:21:59.429 --> 03:21:59.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:21:59.439 --> 03:22:00.389 align:start position:0%
so
since

03:22:00.389 --> 03:22:00.399 align:start position:0%
since
 
03:22:02.229 --> 03:22:02.239 align:start position:0%
that sounds that you would adopt rules
 
03:22:03.429 --> 03:22:03.439 align:start position:0%
saying that the
 
03:22:04.389 --> 03:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
you have
 
03:22:06.870 --> 03:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
the authority to enter a business
 
03:22:06.880 --> 03:22:08.950 align:start position:0%
the authority to enter a business
and

03:22:08.950 --> 03:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:22:11.349 --> 03:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
and in there you will see
 
03:22:20.550 --> 03:22:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:21.830 --> 03:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
sorry i'm just reading that i'm catching
 
03:22:23.670 --> 03:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
up to you it's uh
 
03:22:25.269 --> 03:22:25.279 align:start position:0%
anyway that's that's for your
 
03:22:25.279 --> 03:22:27.269 align:start position:0%
anyway that's that's for your
information

03:22:27.269 --> 03:22:27.279 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:22:29.110 --> 03:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
i think
 
03:22:31.030 --> 03:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
not sure you don't have that the
 
03:22:35.429 --> 03:22:35.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:35.439 --> 03:22:36.870 align:start position:0%
 
it's

03:22:36.870 --> 03:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:22:39.110 --> 03:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
so my understanding and again it's and
 
03:22:40.229 --> 03:22:40.239 align:start position:0%
i'd have to take a look at this a little
 
03:22:42.870 --> 03:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
bit more the complexity but it's my
 
03:22:44.550 --> 03:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
understanding that we we just can't go
 
03:22:44.560 --> 03:22:45.750 align:start position:0%
understanding that we we just can't go
in

03:22:45.750 --> 03:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:22:47.670 --> 03:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
and and for example we'll get a phone
 
03:22:50.150 --> 03:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
call or an email that says hey you know
 
03:22:52.389 --> 03:22:52.399 align:start position:0%
uh so and so is operating an illegal
 
03:22:54.790 --> 03:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
shop and we don't there's very little we
 
03:22:57.190 --> 03:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
can do about that piece of it
 
03:22:59.670 --> 03:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
we could reach out to a licensee if they
 
03:23:01.349 --> 03:23:01.359 align:start position:0%
happen to be working there to find out
 
03:23:03.349 --> 03:23:03.359 align:start position:0%
are you licensed but
 
03:23:05.110 --> 03:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
we generally don't hear about those
 
03:23:05.120 --> 03:23:06.309 align:start position:0%
we generally don't hear about those
unless

03:23:06.309 --> 03:23:06.319 align:start position:0%
unless
 
03:23:08.070 --> 03:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
there's a complaint that comes in but i
 
03:23:10.309 --> 03:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
can take a look at this further and get
 
03:23:12.950 --> 03:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
back to you okay thank you any other
 
03:23:12.960 --> 03:23:16.309 align:start position:0%

questions

thank you madam chair
 
03:23:23.750 --> 03:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
are these people basically hiding in
 
03:23:30.870 --> 03:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:30.880 --> 03:23:34.389 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:23:34.389 --> 03:23:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:35.670 --> 03:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
some are not
 
03:23:37.670 --> 03:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
some are in plain sight some are not it
 
03:23:40.790 --> 03:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
varies it depends on on the shop itself
 
03:23:45.030 --> 03:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
it varies thank you
 
03:23:46.870 --> 03:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
okay other questions
 
03:23:52.870 --> 03:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:52.880 --> 03:23:54.550 align:start position:0%
 
mike

03:23:54.550 --> 03:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
mike
 
03:23:54.560 --> 03:23:55.830 align:start position:0%
mike
sorry

03:23:55.830 --> 03:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
03:23:59.590 --> 03:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
on the last page it talks about giving
 
03:24:02.870 --> 03:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
it talks about establishment license
 
03:24:05.590 --> 03:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
so you can give in a step well
 
03:24:07.670 --> 03:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
issue an establishment license to
 
03:24:10.389 --> 03:24:10.399 align:start position:0%
somebody who's a licensed body art
 
03:24:10.399 --> 03:24:13.110 align:start position:0%
somebody who's a licensed body art
practitioner

03:24:13.110 --> 03:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
practitioner
 
03:24:13.120 --> 03:24:13.990 align:start position:0%
practitioner
although

03:24:13.990 --> 03:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
although
 
03:24:15.750 --> 03:24:15.760 align:start position:0%
i don't even know why that needs to be
 
03:24:18.070 --> 03:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
in there because the next paragraph says
 
03:24:20.790 --> 03:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
you can give it a license establishment
 
03:24:23.190 --> 03:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
license to somebody who's not
 
03:24:24.950 --> 03:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
provided that
 
03:24:26.550 --> 03:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
you can give it to the owner provided
 
03:24:29.750 --> 03:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
that the licensed body art practitioner
 
03:24:31.910 --> 03:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
he employs
 
03:24:33.510 --> 03:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
a licensed body
 
03:24:38.389 --> 03:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:41.910 --> 03:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
so do you have a definition of manager
 
03:24:44.550 --> 03:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
and does that conflict with what
 
03:24:47.510 --> 03:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
the last question i asked you about
 
03:24:51.110 --> 03:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:54.469 --> 03:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
because on page one it says
 
03:24:58.229 --> 03:24:58.239 align:start position:0%
they can be the manager can
 
03:24:58.239 --> 03:24:59.190 align:start position:0%
they can be the manager can
have

03:24:59.190 --> 03:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:25:00.710 --> 03:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
have a
 
03:25:02.550 --> 03:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
certification or
 
03:25:02.560 --> 03:25:03.670 align:start position:0%
certification or
in

03:25:03.670 --> 03:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:25:05.670 --> 03:25:05.680 align:start position:0%
cosmetology or something it doesn't have
 
03:25:08.150 --> 03:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
to be body art and here it says body art
 
03:25:10.790 --> 03:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
it specifically says that the licensed
 
03:25:14.389 --> 03:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
body art practitioner is manager so
 
03:25:14.399 --> 03:25:15.910 align:start position:0%
body art practitioner is manager so
um

03:25:15.910 --> 03:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:17.670 --> 03:25:17.680 align:start position:0%
the the
 
03:25:19.349 --> 03:25:19.359 align:start position:0%
but the owner is the person who has to
 
03:25:20.870 --> 03:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
apply for it
 
03:25:23.110 --> 03:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
right but on the with the other page it
 
03:25:25.110 --> 03:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
said the manager could be anybody who
 
03:25:26.950 --> 03:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
was licensed
 
03:25:30.070 --> 03:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
under anything under oplc
 
03:25:32.630 --> 03:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
right right and therefore the
 
03:25:34.790 --> 03:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
person who was doing the
 
03:25:37.110 --> 03:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
body arc in the back of your hair salon
 
03:25:43.910 --> 03:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:45.510 --> 03:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
i get that part
 
03:25:47.510 --> 03:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
oh well
 
03:25:49.269 --> 03:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
but on the first page it doesn't say
 
03:25:50.630 --> 03:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
that you could have somebody with a
 
03:25:50.640 --> 03:25:52.150 align:start position:0%
that you could have somebody with a
cosmetology

03:25:52.150 --> 03:25:52.160 align:start position:0%
cosmetology
 
03:25:54.790 --> 03:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
license be the manager
 
03:25:54.800 --> 03:25:55.990 align:start position:0%
license be the manager
and

03:25:55.990 --> 03:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:25:58.150 --> 03:25:58.160 align:start position:0%
and the body art is one person in the
 
03:25:58.160 --> 03:26:00.229 align:start position:0%
and the body art is one person in the
back

03:26:00.229 --> 03:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
back
 
03:26:02.550 --> 03:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
i thought we thought we just
 
03:26:05.030 --> 03:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
confirmed that
 
03:26:07.269 --> 03:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
does it sound it sounds like a conflict
 
03:26:08.309 --> 03:26:08.319 align:start position:0%
to me
 
03:26:10.630 --> 03:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
uh i think we if
 
03:26:29.590 --> 03:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:30.830 --> 03:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
any further
 
03:26:33.429 --> 03:26:33.439 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you mr
 
03:26:35.830 --> 03:26:35.840 align:start position:0%

03:26:41.830 --> 03:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:26:43.269 --> 03:26:43.279 align:start position:0%

hearing

03:26:58.550 --> 03:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
i'll mention this has a lot of
 
03:27:01.190 --> 03:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
similarity with the house bill regarding
 
03:27:01.200 --> 03:27:02.150 align:start position:0%
similarity with the house bill regarding
the

03:27:02.150 --> 03:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:27:03.830 --> 03:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
licensure of
 
03:27:05.990 --> 03:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
massage establishments that we have an
 
03:27:09.990 --> 03:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:24.290 --> 03:27:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:24.300 --> 03:27:27.190 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:27:27.190 --> 03:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:27:31.910 --> 03:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:33.429 --> 03:27:33.439 align:start position:0%
it might be
 
03:27:35.990 --> 03:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
oh four three we need the the amendment
 
03:27:36.000 --> 03:27:37.510 align:start position:0%
oh four three we need the the amendment
from

03:27:37.510 --> 03:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:27:39.349 --> 03:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
representative representative pearson do
 
03:27:40.630 --> 03:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
you have the amendment to send a bill
 
03:27:45.510 --> 03:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:47.190 --> 03:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
okay so we're not quite ready he's going
 
03:27:49.750 --> 03:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:49.760 --> 03:27:50.710 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:27:50.710 --> 03:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:27:55.510 --> 03:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:55.520 --> 03:27:57.830 align:start position:0%
 
and

03:27:57.830 --> 03:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:27:59.429 --> 03:27:59.439 align:start position:0%
does someone have a want to make a
 
03:28:03.990 --> 03:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
motion on senate bill 325
 
03:28:06.950 --> 03:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
which is the first bill we heard
 
03:28:10.150 --> 03:28:10.160 align:start position:0%
i think so yes
 
03:28:14.070 --> 03:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
start 325 is local organization for
 
03:28:34.070 --> 03:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:35.990 --> 03:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative pearson you have a motion
 
03:28:38.790 --> 03:28:38.800 align:start position:0%
sure i'll make a motion on how to pass
 
03:28:43.110 --> 03:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:43.120 --> 03:28:46.550 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:28:46.550 --> 03:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:50.389 --> 03:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:51.510 --> 03:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
part of the reason is i want to make
 
03:28:54.070 --> 03:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
sure that the majority
 
03:28:56.630 --> 03:28:56.640 align:start position:0%
blurb is very clear on intent because
 
03:28:58.389 --> 03:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
that is part of the legal
 
03:29:00.150 --> 03:29:00.160 align:start position:0%
record of this
 
03:29:02.710 --> 03:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
and i want to reiterate senator
 
03:29:02.720 --> 03:29:04.389 align:start position:0%
and i want to reiterate senator
kavanaugh's

03:29:04.389 --> 03:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
kavanaugh's
 
03:29:04.399 --> 03:29:05.269 align:start position:0%
kavanaugh's
clear

03:29:05.269 --> 03:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
clear
 
03:29:07.349 --> 03:29:07.359 align:start position:0%
statement that this is not intended to
 
03:29:09.590 --> 03:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
modify anyone's classification in the
 
03:29:11.349 --> 03:29:11.359 align:start position:0%
pension system
 
03:29:11.359 --> 03:29:12.550 align:start position:0%
pension system
um

03:29:12.550 --> 03:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:14.550 --> 03:29:14.560 align:start position:0%
this also
 
03:29:16.630 --> 03:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
for the most part
 
03:29:18.870 --> 03:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
as we as we heard in the in the hearing
 
03:29:20.710 --> 03:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of this is kind of just a
 
03:29:22.950 --> 03:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
recognition a feel-good thing
 
03:29:25.269 --> 03:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
the only thing substantive of this
 
03:29:27.349 --> 03:29:27.359 align:start position:0%
is that this may just make the path to
 
03:29:30.469 --> 03:29:30.479 align:start position:0%
federal reimbursement for
 
03:29:33.190 --> 03:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
some declared emergencies just just that
 
03:29:34.790 --> 03:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
little bit easier
 
03:29:37.510 --> 03:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
but this doesn't really
 
03:29:39.590 --> 03:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
this doesn't really change anything too
 
03:29:41.110 --> 03:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
drastically that's not already being
 
03:29:41.120 --> 03:29:43.990 align:start position:0%
drastically that's not already being
done

03:29:43.990 --> 03:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:01.110 --> 03:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:01.120 --> 03:30:02.150 align:start position:0%
 
lackas

03:30:02.150 --> 03:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
lackas
 
03:30:04.630 --> 03:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh i was stuck in the
 
03:30:07.269 --> 03:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
senate so um pearson or someone if you
 
03:30:08.790 --> 03:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
could uh just give me an
 
03:30:10.630 --> 03:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
overview of your view of what this thing
 
03:30:13.030 --> 03:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
does thank you i'd be happy to
 
03:30:15.030 --> 03:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
so for the most part
 
03:30:15.040 --> 03:30:16.710 align:start position:0%
so for the most part
um

03:30:16.710 --> 03:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:19.030 --> 03:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
this is kind of feel good oh
 
03:30:21.269 --> 03:30:21.279 align:start position:0%
it really is as far as just recognizing
 
03:30:23.269 --> 03:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
some of the ancillary groups
 
03:30:25.830 --> 03:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
that have participated in
 
03:30:27.670 --> 03:30:27.680 align:start position:0%
not just recently this is really
 
03:30:30.229 --> 03:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
irrespective of cove but this goes back
 
03:30:31.910 --> 03:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
to all kinds of stuff actually really
 
03:30:33.830 --> 03:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
mostly weather related
 
03:30:36.070 --> 03:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
in its in its scope than anything else
 
03:30:36.080 --> 03:30:37.990 align:start position:0%
in its in its scope than anything else
but

03:30:37.990 --> 03:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:30:39.990 --> 03:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
it's just to the point of recognizing
 
03:30:41.750 --> 03:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
that beyond just what we consider the
 
03:30:43.670 --> 03:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
typical first responders
 
03:30:45.269 --> 03:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
we have other folks that have been
 
03:30:49.030 --> 03:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
pressed into service for various things
 
03:30:51.030 --> 03:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
including you know the department of
 
03:30:54.150 --> 03:30:54.160 align:start position:0%
transportation local road agents local
 
03:30:55.830 --> 03:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
highway departments and things of that
 
03:30:55.840 --> 03:30:58.150 align:start position:0%
highway departments and things of that
nature

03:30:58.150 --> 03:30:58.160 align:start position:0%
nature
 
03:31:00.229 --> 03:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
that involved anything from floods to
 
03:31:02.710 --> 03:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
washouts to
 
03:31:05.190 --> 03:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
blizzards really so
 
03:31:06.630 --> 03:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
it doesn't this doesn't change the
 
03:31:08.870 --> 03:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
structure of anything like i said it
 
03:31:11.030 --> 03:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
just really
 
03:31:13.750 --> 03:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
at best would
 
03:31:15.750 --> 03:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
make it a little easier for the state
 
03:31:17.510 --> 03:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
when they file for federal reimbursement
 
03:31:19.349 --> 03:31:19.359 align:start position:0%
on declared emergencies
 
03:31:19.359 --> 03:31:20.469 align:start position:0%
on declared emergencies
to

03:31:20.469 --> 03:31:20.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:31:21.750 --> 03:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
just have their paperwork a little bit
 
03:31:21.760 --> 03:31:22.469 align:start position:0%
just have their paperwork a little bit
more

03:31:22.469 --> 03:31:22.479 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:31:24.790 --> 03:31:24.800 align:start position:0%
in a row and that's honestly really all
 
03:31:27.190 --> 03:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
it is yeah follow up follow up so if i
 
03:31:29.830 --> 03:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
understand correctly that last part
 
03:31:34.229 --> 03:31:34.239 align:start position:0%
since uh we're saying they are um
 
03:31:36.550 --> 03:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
involved in responding to emergencies
 
03:31:37.990 --> 03:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
then you know we could file for
 
03:31:39.910 --> 03:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
reimbursement with the feds if on an
 
03:31:41.670 --> 03:31:41.680 align:start position:0%
emergency and that
 
03:31:43.269 --> 03:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
other than the recognition in that
 
03:31:45.190 --> 03:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
aspect of it this basically does nothing
 
03:31:48.309 --> 03:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
is that correct it one thing it does
 
03:31:51.510 --> 03:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
is that it explicitly says that
 
03:31:53.510 --> 03:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
public works or the road agent or
 
03:31:53.520 --> 03:31:54.710 align:start position:0%
public works or the road agent or
whomever

03:31:54.710 --> 03:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
whomever
 
03:31:57.269 --> 03:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
will be part of the incident command
 
03:31:57.279 --> 03:31:59.030 align:start position:0%
will be part of the incident command
structure

03:31:59.030 --> 03:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
structure
 
03:32:00.550 --> 03:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
all right but let's see but they
 
03:32:02.389 --> 03:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
generally are there now anyway they are
 
03:32:04.070 --> 03:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
there now yeah
 
03:32:05.590 --> 03:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a term called unified
 
03:32:07.429 --> 03:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
command and i won't get into how the
 
03:32:10.070 --> 03:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
unified command system works but that's
 
03:32:11.910 --> 03:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's uh like i said there's really
 
03:32:13.590 --> 03:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
not a huge change here to what we're
 
03:32:14.870 --> 03:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
currently doing
 
03:32:16.790 --> 03:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative schmidt
 
03:32:19.269 --> 03:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
and then allegro
 
03:32:21.190 --> 03:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so one of the
 
03:32:23.349 --> 03:32:23.359 align:start position:0%
things that i'm familiar with and i just
 
03:32:24.870 --> 03:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
want to ask you because you're clearly
 
03:32:26.950 --> 03:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
the most experienced among us with
 
03:32:29.510 --> 03:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
regard to this particular issue uh and
 
03:32:31.429 --> 03:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
for example one of the common events
 
03:32:33.349 --> 03:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
that happens in cities is
 
03:32:35.590 --> 03:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
in the wintertime you have a sewer line
 
03:32:37.590 --> 03:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
break in
 
03:32:39.349 --> 03:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
where the people got to get out there
 
03:32:39.359 --> 03:32:40.150 align:start position:0%
where the people got to get out there
and

03:32:40.150 --> 03:32:40.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:32:42.070 --> 03:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
dig open the street
 
03:32:44.229 --> 03:32:44.239 align:start position:0%
to get at it to stop the flow and so
 
03:32:45.590 --> 03:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
forth and so on
 
03:32:47.510 --> 03:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
these people are going to be
 
03:32:49.910 --> 03:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
acknowledged in the same fashion by this
 
03:32:49.920 --> 03:32:54.309 align:start position:0%
acknowledged in the same fashion by this
bill

03:32:54.309 --> 03:32:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:56.309 --> 03:32:56.319 align:start position:0%
probably not i mean realistically you
 
03:32:56.319 --> 03:32:58.469 align:start position:0%
probably not i mean realistically you
know

03:32:58.469 --> 03:32:58.479 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:33:00.309 --> 03:33:00.319 align:start position:0%
it would be one colossal humongous water
 
03:33:01.830 --> 03:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
main for the governor have to declare a
 
03:33:03.670 --> 03:33:03.680 align:start position:0%
state of emergency or water main break
 
03:33:03.680 --> 03:33:04.550 align:start position:0%
state of emergency or water main break
so

03:33:04.550 --> 03:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:33:06.790 --> 03:33:06.800 align:start position:0%
you know that's i think that's a little
 
03:33:09.510 --> 03:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
bit of a underwhelmed
 
03:33:09.520 --> 03:33:11.110 align:start position:0%
bit of a underwhelmed
event

03:33:11.110 --> 03:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
event
 
03:33:13.110 --> 03:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
for what this really is intended to do
 
03:33:15.429 --> 03:33:15.439 align:start position:0%
this is more large scale over
 
03:33:17.030 --> 03:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
big scope stuff
 
03:33:18.790 --> 03:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
because the reality is
 
03:33:21.110 --> 03:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
in if you're talking about the dead of
 
03:33:21.120 --> 03:33:22.150 align:start position:0%
in if you're talking about the dead of
winter

03:33:22.150 --> 03:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
winter
 
03:33:24.150 --> 03:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
and the line breaks and those guys are
 
03:33:26.870 --> 03:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
out there breaking open the street
 
03:33:29.269 --> 03:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
and struggling with uh
 
03:33:32.550 --> 03:33:32.560 align:start position:0%
with water and collapsing uh terrain
 
03:33:32.560 --> 03:33:33.429 align:start position:0%
with water and collapsing uh terrain
around

03:33:33.429 --> 03:33:33.439 align:start position:0%
around
 
03:33:35.190 --> 03:33:35.200 align:start position:0%
the break and so forth and so on that
 
03:33:38.469 --> 03:33:38.479 align:start position:0%
that's nothing to to uh to joke about i
 
03:33:40.870 --> 03:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying you were joking uh but
 
03:33:44.950 --> 03:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's uh it's serious stuff uh so it
 
03:33:48.630 --> 03:33:48.640 align:start position:0%
may not be worthy of a gubernatorial uh
 
03:33:51.429 --> 03:33:51.439 align:start position:0%
declaration i'm not implying that it
 
03:33:54.070 --> 03:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
should it's just that i would like to
 
03:33:58.070 --> 03:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
that serious stuff as well as fires
 
03:33:59.750 --> 03:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative schmidt
 
03:34:02.070 --> 03:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
representative allegra
 
03:34:03.990 --> 03:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
i'm going to need to be convinced to
 
03:34:06.309 --> 03:34:06.319 align:start position:0%
support this one it seems to me like an
 
03:34:06.319 --> 03:34:07.990 align:start position:0%
support this one it seems to me like an
open-ended

03:34:07.990 --> 03:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
open-ended
 
03:34:10.309 --> 03:34:10.319 align:start position:0%
and unnecessary expansion well it's a
 
03:34:12.389 --> 03:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
change of definition
 
03:34:12.399 --> 03:34:13.750 align:start position:0%
change of definition
and

03:34:13.750 --> 03:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:34:15.670 --> 03:34:15.680 align:start position:0%
as the representative earlier said
 
03:34:17.349 --> 03:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
representative pearson mentioned it's
 
03:34:17.359 --> 03:34:18.550 align:start position:0%
representative pearson mentioned it's
not

03:34:18.550 --> 03:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:34:18.560 --> 03:34:20.150 align:start position:0%
not
it

03:34:20.150 --> 03:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:34:22.389 --> 03:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have anything to do with
 
03:34:24.469 --> 03:34:24.479 align:start position:0%
compensation and that kind of stuff and
 
03:34:27.030 --> 03:34:27.040 align:start position:0%
insurance but
 
03:34:28.389 --> 03:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
it will
 
03:34:29.670 --> 03:34:29.680 align:start position:0%
it will
 
03:34:32.710 --> 03:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
we know that this is the first step
 
03:34:35.670 --> 03:34:35.680 align:start position:0%
in the ever expanding definition and and
 
03:34:35.680 --> 03:34:36.630 align:start position:0%
in the ever expanding definition and and
then

03:34:36.630 --> 03:34:36.640 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:34:39.349 --> 03:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
treatment of different positions now
 
03:34:40.950 --> 03:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
you know i mean things are listed in
 
03:34:45.510 --> 03:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:47.830 --> 03:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
a nurse
 
03:34:50.630 --> 03:34:50.640 align:start position:0%
a surgeon in the hospital
 
03:34:52.710 --> 03:34:52.720 align:start position:0%
is not a first responder
 
03:34:56.389 --> 03:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
the first responder police fire
 
03:34:58.070 --> 03:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
and a few others
 
03:35:01.190 --> 03:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
and we just keep expanding the deficit
 
03:35:02.630 --> 03:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
and definition of first responder
 
03:35:04.389 --> 03:35:04.399 align:start position:0%
there's no end to it
 
03:35:06.710 --> 03:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
um and so like i say i need i'm gonna
 
03:35:08.710 --> 03:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
need to be convinced on this one thank
 
03:35:08.720 --> 03:35:14.550 align:start position:0%
need to be convinced on this one thank
you

03:35:14.550 --> 03:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:16.950 --> 03:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
okay any other comments representative
 
03:35:16.960 --> 03:35:18.790 align:start position:0%
okay any other comments representative
o'brien

03:35:18.790 --> 03:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
o'brien
 
03:35:22.229 --> 03:35:22.239 align:start position:0%
ah thank you madam chair
 
03:35:25.349 --> 03:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
to representative allegro and to others
 
03:35:27.990 --> 03:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh i remember going and taking uh
 
03:35:30.469 --> 03:35:30.479 align:start position:0%
several classes on the incident command
 
03:35:30.479 --> 03:35:31.910 align:start position:0%
several classes on the incident command
system

03:35:31.910 --> 03:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
system
 
03:35:33.830 --> 03:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
and one of the examples that they
 
03:35:35.590 --> 03:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
brought up is
 
03:35:38.070 --> 03:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
a plane crash it did actually happen was
 
03:35:39.670 --> 03:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
in pennsylvania
 
03:35:39.680 --> 03:35:40.469 align:start position:0%
in pennsylvania
and

03:35:40.469 --> 03:35:40.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:35:43.030 --> 03:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
in this particular case a local pizza
 
03:35:43.040 --> 03:35:43.990 align:start position:0%
in this particular case a local pizza
shop

03:35:43.990 --> 03:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
shop
 
03:35:45.590 --> 03:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
came up and said
 
03:35:47.429 --> 03:35:47.439 align:start position:0%
we'll supply pizzas
 
03:35:49.429 --> 03:35:49.439 align:start position:0%
to the first responders
 
03:35:51.590 --> 03:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
at this particular incident
 
03:35:53.429 --> 03:35:53.439 align:start position:0%
and pretty soon they found out that the
 
03:35:55.349 --> 03:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
emergency workers were not eating the
 
03:35:55.359 --> 03:35:56.469 align:start position:0%
emergency workers were not eating the
pizzas

03:35:56.469 --> 03:35:56.479 align:start position:0%
pizzas
 
03:35:57.830 --> 03:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
and then somebody came up with the
 
03:36:00.150 --> 03:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
bright idea that's exactly what they're
 
03:36:02.630 --> 03:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
looking at at the crash scene
 
03:36:04.870 --> 03:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
so the thing is
 
03:36:06.870 --> 03:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
when you look at the incident command
 
03:36:09.990 --> 03:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
system it's supposed to be a flexible
 
03:36:12.710 --> 03:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
document okay that can be
 
03:36:15.750 --> 03:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
handled as small as you want but it all
 
03:36:19.030 --> 03:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
also can be expanded and to have people
 
03:36:22.070 --> 03:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
such as public works at a particular
 
03:36:24.710 --> 03:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
incident now in the case of a blizzard i
 
03:36:26.790 --> 03:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
don't know but living through
 
03:36:29.349 --> 03:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
78 at best day
 
03:36:31.910 --> 03:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
some fire companies wish they had a plow
 
03:36:35.110 --> 03:36:35.120 align:start position:0%
company a plow municipal plow running in
 
03:36:37.429 --> 03:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
front of them to get to some areas down
 
03:36:39.030 --> 03:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
the street particularly if they had a
 
03:36:41.349 --> 03:36:41.359 align:start position:0%
fire if that was done through a command
 
03:36:44.150 --> 03:36:44.160 align:start position:0%
post at that time in 78 the incident
 
03:36:46.309 --> 03:36:46.319 align:start position:0%
command system did not exist
 
03:36:48.550 --> 03:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
but in that type of situation
 
03:36:51.110 --> 03:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
the uh public works could target target
 
03:36:52.870 --> 03:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
that particular area
 
03:36:55.110 --> 03:36:55.120 align:start position:0%
so what this does to me
 
03:36:58.469 --> 03:36:58.479 align:start position:0%
uh it's already happening yeah but it
 
03:37:01.349 --> 03:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
does codify it to make sure
 
03:37:02.950 --> 03:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
and it i think it's part of the
 
03:37:05.429 --> 03:37:05.439 align:start position:0%
enlightening of looking at the incident
 
03:37:07.990 --> 03:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
command system that it is a flexible uh
 
03:37:10.790 --> 03:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
procedure that can get into it could be
 
03:37:10.800 --> 03:37:12.790 align:start position:0%
procedure that can get into it could be
logistics

03:37:12.790 --> 03:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
logistics
 
03:37:15.750 --> 03:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
it's fine when they end in two hours but
 
03:37:18.229 --> 03:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
you could have a situation that could
 
03:37:18.239 --> 03:37:19.269 align:start position:0%
you could have a situation that could
last

03:37:19.269 --> 03:37:19.279 align:start position:0%
last
 
03:37:19.279 --> 03:37:20.309 align:start position:0%
last
months

03:37:20.309 --> 03:37:20.319 align:start position:0%
months
 
03:37:22.550 --> 03:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
and that's where you really need a very
 
03:37:25.190 --> 03:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
strong incident command system and this
 
03:37:27.429 --> 03:37:27.439 align:start position:0%
could involve public works working for
 
03:37:29.110 --> 03:37:29.120 align:start position:0%
that period of time
 
03:37:30.870 --> 03:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
the fire department may actually
 
03:37:33.349 --> 03:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
de-escalate and become into some of the
 
03:37:35.429 --> 03:37:35.439 align:start position:0%
ancillary groups that would actually
 
03:37:38.389 --> 03:37:38.399 align:start position:0%
become more prominent in that regard
 
03:37:41.429 --> 03:37:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:41.439 --> 03:37:42.830 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:37:42.830 --> 03:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:37:44.950 --> 03:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative but if it lasts for
 
03:37:47.670 --> 03:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
months they're not first responders
 
03:37:49.429 --> 03:37:49.439 align:start position:0%
first responders are there on the scene
 
03:37:50.870 --> 03:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
at the time
 
03:37:52.710 --> 03:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
and issues about and i'm not being
 
03:37:54.870 --> 03:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
facetious here honestly who gets pizza
 
03:37:57.269 --> 03:37:57.279 align:start position:0%
who gets fed that kind of thing those
 
03:37:58.710 --> 03:37:58.720 align:start position:0%
aren't decisions that require an
 
03:38:00.790 --> 03:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
expansion of the definition
 
03:38:02.790 --> 03:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
of first responder
 
03:38:04.950 --> 03:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
that just requires some common sense on
 
03:38:06.870 --> 03:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
the scene you got people there they're
 
03:38:09.110 --> 03:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
working they can't go home they got to
 
03:38:10.710 --> 03:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
get some food
 
03:38:12.870 --> 03:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
give a slice of pizza
 
03:38:16.229 --> 03:38:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:17.830 --> 03:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
03:38:21.750 --> 03:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
representative bailey and then o'brien
 
03:38:23.910 --> 03:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:38:23.920 --> 03:38:24.870 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

03:38:24.870 --> 03:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:27.750 --> 03:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
i have not been best pleased with the
 
03:38:30.070 --> 03:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
both of either the scope or the duration
 
03:38:32.309 --> 03:38:32.319 align:start position:0%
of the most recent emergency
 
03:38:33.269 --> 03:38:33.279 align:start position:0%
and i
 
03:38:35.110 --> 03:38:35.120 align:start position:0%
do not like that there are people in
 
03:38:37.110 --> 03:38:37.120 align:start position:0%
this list of first responders that are
 
03:38:38.830 --> 03:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
not public
 
03:38:41.269 --> 03:38:41.279 align:start position:0%
employees and that that
 
03:38:45.030 --> 03:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
needs to change or i need to vote no
 
03:38:46.389 --> 03:38:46.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:38:48.870 --> 03:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative pearson
 
03:38:50.389 --> 03:38:50.399 align:start position:0%
so sir representative bailey i'll give
 
03:38:51.830 --> 03:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
an example the city of manchester right
 
03:38:54.229 --> 03:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
now is ems services provided by amr by
 
03:38:54.239 --> 03:38:55.590 align:start position:0%
now is ems services provided by amr by
contract

03:38:55.590 --> 03:38:55.600 align:start position:0%
contract
 
03:38:58.070 --> 03:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
that's who provides ambulance service
 
03:38:59.590 --> 03:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
they are not employees of the city of
 
03:39:01.990 --> 03:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
manchester or any actual governmental
 
03:39:04.150 --> 03:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
group it's a contracted private entity
 
03:39:05.670 --> 03:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
uh the city of nashville functions under
 
03:39:08.630 --> 03:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
the same manner so in the event of a
 
03:39:11.030 --> 03:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
even a cessna landing on elm street in
 
03:39:12.469 --> 03:39:12.479 align:start position:0%
manchester that's going to require an
 
03:39:14.389 --> 03:39:14.399 align:start position:0%
integrated act with the
 
03:39:15.830 --> 03:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
ambulance company
 
03:39:15.840 --> 03:39:16.710 align:start position:0%
ambulance company
so

03:39:16.710 --> 03:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:39:18.469 --> 03:39:18.479 align:start position:0%
non-governmental employees are
 
03:39:21.030 --> 03:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
integrated into disaster relief
 
03:39:23.510 --> 03:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
all the time this is extremely common
 
03:39:26.790 --> 03:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
and it has been for a hundred years
 
03:39:28.630 --> 03:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure what your concern is in
 
03:39:30.229 --> 03:39:30.239 align:start position:0%
the fact that that they're not
 
03:39:34.830 --> 03:39:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:34.840 --> 03:39:36.389 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:39:36.389 --> 03:39:36.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:39:39.429 --> 03:39:39.439 align:start position:0%
roxanna for monty
 
03:39:41.590 --> 03:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
thank you manager um
 
03:39:43.830 --> 03:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
i i would imagine i would address this
 
03:39:45.189 --> 03:39:45.199 align:start position:0%
question to you
 
03:39:47.269 --> 03:39:47.279 align:start position:0%
is not first responders
 
03:39:48.950 --> 03:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
actually anyone that
 
03:39:50.630 --> 03:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
comes across the scene
 
03:39:52.389 --> 03:39:52.399 align:start position:0%
preferably licensed like a licensed
 
03:39:54.630 --> 03:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
nurse a medic in the military or
 
03:39:57.910 --> 03:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
situations like that and then when the
 
03:40:00.150 --> 03:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
crew comes or the fire crew or the
 
03:40:00.160 --> 03:40:01.429 align:start position:0%
crew comes or the fire crew or the
ambulance

03:40:01.429 --> 03:40:01.439 align:start position:0%
ambulance
 
03:40:03.349 --> 03:40:03.359 align:start position:0%
that automatically gets turned over to
 
03:40:05.510 --> 03:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
them but wouldn't that person be the
 
03:40:07.030 --> 03:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
first responder
 
03:40:10.469 --> 03:40:10.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:15.510 --> 03:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:17.670 --> 03:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
if you will it's been it's been
 
03:40:20.150 --> 03:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
deemed into more professional
 
03:40:23.269 --> 03:40:23.279 align:start position:0%
categories right so
 
03:40:26.070 --> 03:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
fire fire police and fire are always
 
03:40:28.389 --> 03:40:28.399 align:start position:0%
first responders regardless of
 
03:40:31.189 --> 03:40:31.199 align:start position:0%
if an incident's an hour or a month
 
03:40:33.269 --> 03:40:33.279 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
03:40:35.110 --> 03:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
but to your point
 
03:40:36.630 --> 03:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
you know roll over on the highway you've
 
03:40:38.469 --> 03:40:38.479 align:start position:0%
got active military guys that pull over
 
03:40:39.830 --> 03:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
a nurse whatever
 
03:40:39.840 --> 03:40:40.710 align:start position:0%
a nurse whatever
um

03:40:40.710 --> 03:40:40.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:42.550 --> 03:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
are they first responders are they good
 
03:40:42.560 --> 03:40:44.870 align:start position:0%
are they first responders are they good
samaritans

03:40:44.870 --> 03:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
samaritans
 
03:40:46.469 --> 03:40:46.479 align:start position:0%
i think that i think the term first
 
03:40:48.630 --> 03:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
responder really does more apply to more
 
03:40:50.150 --> 03:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
of a professional
 
03:40:52.630 --> 03:40:52.640 align:start position:0%
role to which it is your duty to act if
 
03:40:54.710 --> 03:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
you will versus
 
03:40:58.790 --> 03:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:00.469 --> 03:41:00.479 align:start position:0%
if and if i'm not answering your
 
03:41:02.630 --> 03:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
question right please tell me if if
 
03:41:04.070 --> 03:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
you're not if i'm not explaining myself
 
03:41:04.080 --> 03:41:05.189 align:start position:0%
you're not if i'm not explaining myself
right

03:41:05.189 --> 03:41:05.199 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:41:05.199 --> 03:41:05.990 align:start position:0%
right
yeah

03:41:05.990 --> 03:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:41:08.309 --> 03:41:08.319 align:start position:0%
i'll give you a good example um
 
03:41:10.710 --> 03:41:10.720 align:start position:0%
say the coast guard uh
 
03:41:12.830 --> 03:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
the uh you know the coast guard
 
03:41:15.269 --> 03:41:15.279 align:start position:0%
auxiliary um they
 
03:41:17.670 --> 03:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
would be if they came across a an
 
03:41:19.510 --> 03:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
accident anywhere they would be
 
03:41:21.750 --> 03:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
considered first responders they're not
 
03:41:23.910 --> 03:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
employed by the government they're on
 
03:41:26.229 --> 03:41:26.239 align:start position:0%
their own own
 
03:41:30.469 --> 03:41:30.479 align:start position:0%
501 seat group but sure they would be
 
03:41:32.150 --> 03:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
see the there's a there's a whole
 
03:41:33.910 --> 03:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
program on this licensing first
 
03:41:35.269 --> 03:41:35.279 align:start position:0%
responders thing
 
03:41:37.429 --> 03:41:37.439 align:start position:0%
and i understand it a little bit
 
03:41:39.189 --> 03:41:39.199 align:start position:0%
differently than it was explained to you
 
03:41:40.710 --> 03:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
because civil air patrol is a good
 
03:41:43.110 --> 03:41:43.120 align:start position:0%
another example they're not military
 
03:41:44.790 --> 03:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
they're they're a
 
03:41:44.800 --> 03:41:47.349 align:start position:0%
they're they're a
pseudo

03:41:47.349 --> 03:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:49.269 --> 03:41:49.279 align:start position:0%
military organization that provides a
 
03:41:49.279 --> 03:41:50.710 align:start position:0%
military organization that provides a
service

03:41:50.710 --> 03:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
service
 
03:41:52.070 --> 03:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
and they have
 
03:41:54.229 --> 03:41:54.239 align:start position:0%
some statutory jurisdictional things
 
03:41:56.469 --> 03:41:56.479 align:start position:0%
involving plane crashes but that would
 
03:41:57.830 --> 03:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
be yeah i mean i would consider the
 
03:41:59.429 --> 03:41:59.439 align:start position:0%
civil air patrol first responders too
 
03:42:01.429 --> 03:42:01.439 align:start position:0%
and that and they may be and that their
 
03:42:02.950 --> 03:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
their legal classifications and
 
03:42:06.550 --> 03:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
definitions probably include that term
 
03:42:06.560 --> 03:42:07.429 align:start position:0%
definitions probably include that term
but

03:42:07.429 --> 03:42:07.439 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:42:07.439 --> 03:42:08.550 align:start position:0%
but
um

03:42:08.550 --> 03:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:11.910 --> 03:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
there's a there is a difference between
 
03:42:13.670 --> 03:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
emergency response and emergency
 
03:42:15.910 --> 03:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
management and that's been a big topic
 
03:42:17.830 --> 03:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
of conversation during the covert era as
 
03:42:20.229 --> 03:42:20.239 align:start position:0%
to when that when you go from emergency
 
03:42:23.189 --> 03:42:23.199 align:start position:0%
response to just management so
 
03:42:24.710 --> 03:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
i think in this particular case what
 
03:42:26.550 --> 03:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here isn't
 
03:42:28.389 --> 03:42:28.399 align:start position:0%
necessarily the rebuilding of a bridge
 
03:42:30.469 --> 03:42:30.479 align:start position:0%
that washed out and six months later
 
03:42:31.750 --> 03:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
we're putting a bridge back together
 
03:42:34.150 --> 03:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
that that's not first response that's
 
03:42:36.469 --> 03:42:36.479 align:start position:0%
that's just management or reconstruction
 
03:42:37.750 --> 03:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
i think what we're getting here is the
 
03:42:38.950 --> 03:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
folks that are
 
03:42:41.269 --> 03:42:41.279 align:start position:0%
involved in an initial incident that
 
03:42:42.790 --> 03:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
have been either
 
03:42:44.550 --> 03:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
through their own
 
03:42:46.710 --> 03:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
statutory function been involved or
 
03:42:48.950 --> 03:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
through conscription been
 
03:42:51.349 --> 03:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
involved into mitigating what's in an
 
03:42:51.359 --> 03:42:53.590 align:start position:0%
involved into mitigating what's in an
emergency

03:42:53.590 --> 03:42:53.600 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
03:42:55.990 --> 03:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
as far as hospital folks hospital folks
 
03:42:59.030 --> 03:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
have been used in that role
 
03:43:01.030 --> 03:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
before i mean we've pulled people out of
 
03:43:02.870 --> 03:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
hospitals for
 
03:43:04.389 --> 03:43:04.399 align:start position:0%
we've pulled surgeons out of hospitals
 
03:43:05.830 --> 03:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
for accidents on the highway where we've
 
03:43:08.229 --> 03:43:08.239 align:start position:0%
had to do some serious work
 
03:43:08.239 --> 03:43:10.070 align:start position:0%
had to do some serious work
and

03:43:10.070 --> 03:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:43:12.710 --> 03:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
that's um
 
03:43:15.349 --> 03:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
it's fairly rare
 
03:43:17.189 --> 03:43:17.199 align:start position:0%
it's fairly rare but they they do fall
 
03:43:19.349 --> 03:43:19.359 align:start position:0%
under that i i see your concern with
 
03:43:21.110 --> 03:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
this and and i that's why i asked
 
03:43:22.469 --> 03:43:22.479 align:start position:0%
senator cavanaugh you know i'm not
 
03:43:22.479 --> 03:43:23.590 align:start position:0%
senator cavanaugh you know i'm not
looking

03:43:23.590 --> 03:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
looking
 
03:43:26.229 --> 03:43:26.239 align:start position:0%
for this to become a catalyst to change
 
03:43:28.710 --> 03:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
people's classifications as far as the
 
03:43:31.269 --> 03:43:31.279 align:start position:0%
pension system or benefits or anything
 
03:43:31.279 --> 03:43:32.229 align:start position:0%
pension system or benefits or anything
else

03:43:32.229 --> 03:43:32.239 align:start position:0%
else
 
03:43:35.670 --> 03:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
i think this is just more of a of a like
 
03:43:37.429 --> 03:43:37.439 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien said we're
 
03:43:38.950 --> 03:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
codifying something that already exists
 
03:43:40.070 --> 03:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
and we're just kind of making it a
 
03:43:42.070 --> 03:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
little bit more formal
 
03:43:45.590 --> 03:43:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:45.600 --> 03:43:46.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:43:46.870 --> 03:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:46.880 --> 03:43:49.670 align:start position:0%
um
rhodes

03:43:49.670 --> 03:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:51.590 --> 03:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so
 
03:43:53.349 --> 03:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
i think this is a little bit of my
 
03:43:55.910 --> 03:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
thought with um representative allegro's
 
03:43:55.920 --> 03:43:57.030 align:start position:0%
thought with um representative allegro's
question

03:43:57.030 --> 03:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:43:57.040 --> 03:43:58.389 align:start position:0%
question
and

03:43:58.389 --> 03:43:58.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:43:59.910 --> 03:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
along with what representative o'brien
 
03:44:01.590 --> 03:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
was saying so the particular plane crash
 
03:44:03.510 --> 03:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
that he's speaking of um was about five
 
03:44:05.110 --> 03:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
miles from my backyard
 
03:44:07.189 --> 03:44:07.199 align:start position:0%
and there actually were no survivors of
 
03:44:09.429 --> 03:44:09.439 align:start position:0%
the plane crash however there were other
 
03:44:11.429 --> 03:44:11.439 align:start position:0%
emergencies that were around that area
 
03:44:11.439 --> 03:44:12.710 align:start position:0%
emergencies that were around that area
that

03:44:12.710 --> 03:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:44:15.269 --> 03:44:15.279 align:start position:0%
all of the local hospitals like in the
 
03:44:16.469 --> 03:44:16.479 align:start position:0%
event there would have been any
 
03:44:18.790 --> 03:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
survivors right the local hospitals
 
03:44:20.389 --> 03:44:20.399 align:start position:0%
would certainly have been
 
03:44:22.550 --> 03:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
first responders because it would be the
 
03:44:24.870 --> 03:44:24.880 align:start position:0%
management of that that particular
 
03:44:27.349 --> 03:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
crisis at that time right so you would
 
03:44:27.359 --> 03:44:28.389 align:start position:0%
crisis at that time right so you would
gather

03:44:28.389 --> 03:44:28.399 align:start position:0%
gather
 
03:44:28.399 --> 03:44:29.670 align:start position:0%
gather
anybody

03:44:29.670 --> 03:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
03:44:31.750 --> 03:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
there so you know when you go to school
 
03:44:33.429 --> 03:44:33.439 align:start position:0%
for the training
 
03:44:35.910 --> 03:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
for the the first response if you will
 
03:44:38.309 --> 03:44:38.319 align:start position:0%
in the crisis management all of the
 
03:44:39.830 --> 03:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
local hospitals would be would be
 
03:44:41.830 --> 03:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
involved in all of that it doesn't go on
 
03:44:45.030 --> 03:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
forever that would be that emergency for
 
03:44:46.630 --> 03:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
right then
 
03:44:47.990 --> 03:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if that answered your
 
03:44:50.870 --> 03:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:52.870 --> 03:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
no both you and pearson actually gave me
 
03:44:54.710 --> 03:44:54.720 align:start position:0%
some good wording but but that's exactly
 
03:44:57.030 --> 03:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
the point when when the plane crashed
 
03:44:58.229 --> 03:44:58.239 align:start position:0%
people didn't pick up the phone and call
 
03:44:59.510 --> 03:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
the hospital
 
03:45:00.950 --> 03:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
they picked up the phone and they called
 
03:45:02.389 --> 03:45:02.399 align:start position:0%
the professional people who were
 
03:45:04.630 --> 03:45:04.640 align:start position:0%
supposed to be there immediately and on
 
03:45:11.590 --> 03:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:13.269 --> 03:45:13.279 align:start position:0%
yeah but you can go on
 
03:45:15.830 --> 03:45:15.840 align:start position:0%
infinite these are like that yes the
 
03:45:18.710 --> 03:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
these this list includes the people
 
03:45:20.309 --> 03:45:20.319 align:start position:0%
that the
 
03:45:22.469 --> 03:45:22.479 align:start position:0%
first person first professional on the
 
03:45:24.830 --> 03:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
scene was calling in the first
 
03:45:27.349 --> 03:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
round that the first that the first
 
03:45:29.670 --> 03:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
responder was calling
 
03:45:31.269 --> 03:45:31.279 align:start position:0%
do you want to put it that way yes
 
03:45:33.429 --> 03:45:33.439 align:start position:0%
representative i can tell you in a mci
 
03:45:35.670 --> 03:45:35.680 align:start position:0%
mass casualty incident scenarios and
 
03:45:37.830 --> 03:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
trainings and preparedness every single
 
03:45:40.070 --> 03:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
person that's in this category and in
 
03:45:41.910 --> 03:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
article nine is included in those is
 
03:45:44.150 --> 03:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
those preparedness drills every single
 
03:45:45.189 --> 03:45:45.199 align:start position:0%
one of them
 
03:45:45.199 --> 03:45:46.630 align:start position:0%
one of them
so

03:45:46.630 --> 03:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:45:49.830 --> 03:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
you know that this is this is not um
 
03:45:51.830 --> 03:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
like i said this is not long-term
 
03:45:54.790 --> 03:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
management stuff this is
 
03:45:56.630 --> 03:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
this is initial stuff
 
03:45:56.640 --> 03:45:57.990 align:start position:0%
this is initial stuff
so

03:45:57.990 --> 03:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:45:59.670 --> 03:45:59.680 align:start position:0%
every there's not a single entity here
 
03:46:01.189 --> 03:46:01.199 align:start position:0%
that's listed that that i would not
 
03:46:05.110 --> 03:46:05.120 align:start position:0%
include in a mass casualty drill
 
03:46:07.349 --> 03:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
okay representative marsh and then i'm
 
03:46:09.910 --> 03:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
going to recess this discussion
 
03:46:11.670 --> 03:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
to clarify a little bit about the
 
03:46:14.710 --> 03:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
hospitals i want to
 
03:46:16.710 --> 03:46:16.720 align:start position:0%
as a hospital trustee i happen to know
 
03:46:19.030 --> 03:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
that what our emergency room personnel
 
03:46:20.309 --> 03:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
do in the emergency room is they
 
03:46:23.510 --> 03:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
communicate by radio to the emts on
 
03:46:25.830 --> 03:46:25.840 align:start position:0%
scene and actually give orders to things
 
03:46:27.670 --> 03:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
that have to be done at the time of an
 
03:46:30.550 --> 03:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
incident so they're intimately involved
 
03:46:32.469 --> 03:46:32.479 align:start position:0%
in what's happening on the scene even if
 
03:46:34.389 --> 03:46:34.399 align:start position:0%
they're not physically on that scene at
 
03:46:38.229 --> 03:46:38.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:40.550 --> 03:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
we will continue this after the next
 
03:46:42.870 --> 03:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
hearing so
 
03:46:44.710 --> 03:46:44.720 align:start position:0%
stay tuned and
 
03:46:45.590 --> 03:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
you're going to run that because i've
 
03:46:46.950 --> 03:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
got the
 
03:46:55.910 --> 03:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:58.070 --> 03:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
senator carson brought in a card but i
 
03:47:00.790 --> 03:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
don't we'll see if she's here
 
03:47:15.510 --> 03:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:15.520 --> 03:47:19.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:47:19.510 --> 03:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:21.750 --> 03:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
we are opening the public hearing for
 
03:47:25.269 --> 03:47:25.279 align:start position:0%
senate bill 358
 
03:47:25.279 --> 03:47:26.229 align:start position:0%
senate bill 358
and

03:47:26.229 --> 03:47:26.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:47:35.349 --> 03:47:35.359 align:start position:0%

03:48:53.000 --> 03:48:54.790 align:start position:0%
but i'll give it a shot has the prime
sponsor

03:48:54.790 --> 03:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
03:48:56.469 --> 03:48:56.479 align:start position:0%
senator carson just reach out to the
 
03:48:59.429 --> 03:48:59.439 align:start position:0%
governor to ask for just a simple
 
03:49:00.950 --> 03:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
declaration or proclamation from the
 
03:49:02.550 --> 03:49:02.560 align:start position:0%
governor's office rather than do this in
 
03:49:04.870 --> 03:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
statute i don't i don't know the answer
 
03:49:07.830 --> 03:49:07.840 align:start position:0%
to that question i know this bill was
 
03:49:09.349 --> 03:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
passed last
 
03:49:11.990 --> 03:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
session and died in uh in the omnibus
 
03:49:12.000 --> 03:49:12.870 align:start position:0%
session and died in uh in the omnibus

03:49:12.870 --> 03:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
sure
 
03:49:17.990 --> 03:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:31.030 --> 03:49:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:33.429 --> 03:49:33.439 align:start position:0%
who else do i have
 
03:49:40.229 --> 03:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:40.239 --> 03:51:13.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:51:13.830 --> 03:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:18.389 --> 03:51:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:21.429 --> 03:51:21.439 align:start position:0%
yes thank you i'm here to
 
03:51:23.670 --> 03:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
carol mcguire representing allenstown
 
03:51:27.110 --> 03:51:27.120 align:start position:0%
epsom in pittsfield and merrimack 29
 
03:51:27.120 --> 03:51:28.070 align:start position:0%
epsom in pittsfield and merrimack 29
and

03:51:28.070 --> 03:51:28.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:51:30.710 --> 03:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
i have here a non-germane amendment to
 
03:51:33.830 --> 03:51:33.840 align:start position:0%
senate bill 358
 
03:51:37.189 --> 03:51:37.199 align:start position:0%
which i will say assumes
 
03:51:39.349 --> 03:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
the position that the committee will not
 
03:51:41.590 --> 03:51:41.600 align:start position:0%
support it and therefore it completely
 
03:51:44.790 --> 03:51:44.800 align:start position:0%
replaces the bill
 
03:51:46.950 --> 03:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
if i'm wrong it could easily be changed
 
03:51:46.960 --> 03:51:48.150 align:start position:0%
if i'm wrong it could easily be changed
to

03:51:48.150 --> 03:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:51:51.830 --> 03:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:54.710 --> 03:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
in any event this came out of
 
03:51:56.830 --> 03:51:56.840 align:start position:0%
discussions we had
 
03:51:59.389 --> 03:51:59.399 align:start position:0%
on house bill
 
03:52:02.550 --> 03:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
1395 where which talked about the jail
 
03:52:04.309 --> 03:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
car process
 
03:52:06.790 --> 03:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
and this is a
 
03:52:11.510 --> 03:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:13.750 --> 03:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
that came out of some discussions i had
 
03:52:18.469 --> 03:52:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:21.510 --> 03:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
what it does is that it increases the
 
03:52:24.309 --> 03:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
number of members of jail car
 
03:52:24.319 --> 03:52:25.189 align:start position:0%
number of members of jail car
and

03:52:25.189 --> 03:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:52:28.389 --> 03:52:28.399 align:start position:0%
separates it into three
 
03:52:30.309 --> 03:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
divisions as it were
 
03:52:32.870 --> 03:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that is that
 
03:52:35.429 --> 03:52:35.439 align:start position:0%
the people who are serve on jail car are
 
03:52:37.830 --> 03:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
primarily from edna
 
03:52:40.950 --> 03:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
and a few from finance what we don't
 
03:52:43.349 --> 03:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
have is people with
 
03:52:45.830 --> 03:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
real knowledge about the other areas we
 
03:52:47.670 --> 03:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
write rules
 
03:52:49.750 --> 03:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:52:51.990 --> 03:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
this jail car staff
 
03:52:53.830 --> 03:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
you know will make sure it agrees with
 
03:52:57.030 --> 03:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
the letter of the law but it's
 
03:52:58.710 --> 03:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
rather difficult
 
03:53:01.110 --> 03:53:01.120 align:start position:0%
to understand the effect if you don't
 
03:53:03.189 --> 03:53:03.199 align:start position:0%
understand the
 
03:53:05.349 --> 03:53:05.359 align:start position:0%
subject of the
 
03:53:05.359 --> 03:53:06.070 align:start position:0%
subject of the
uh

03:53:06.070 --> 03:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:53:09.590 --> 03:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
of the rule there is plenty of expertise
 
03:53:11.670 --> 03:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
in the house on all these different
 
03:53:11.680 --> 03:53:13.269 align:start position:0%
in the house on all these different
areas

03:53:13.269 --> 03:53:13.279 align:start position:0%
areas
 
03:53:16.309 --> 03:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
and so by increasing the number of
 
03:53:18.790 --> 03:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
people who serve on jail car and
 
03:53:23.830 --> 03:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
concentrating them in areas of expertise
 
03:53:26.309 --> 03:53:26.319 align:start position:0%
you'll be able to get more intelligent
 
03:53:28.070 --> 03:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
review of the rules
 
03:53:30.389 --> 03:53:30.399 align:start position:0%
and better compliance with the
 
03:53:34.150 --> 03:53:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:37.510 --> 03:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
for example it in a lot of cases
 
03:53:39.189 --> 03:53:39.199 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of rules about health
 
03:53:41.189 --> 03:53:41.199 align:start position:0%
and human services
 
03:53:43.750 --> 03:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
and we know some things about it but
 
03:53:43.760 --> 03:53:45.910 align:start position:0%
and we know some things about it but
there's

03:53:45.910 --> 03:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
there's
 
03:53:48.070 --> 03:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
other things that other that other
 
03:53:50.070 --> 03:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
people who in the house would have a
 
03:53:52.550 --> 03:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
better knowledge of it would be more
 
03:53:55.510 --> 03:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
capable of saying you know this
 
03:53:57.670 --> 03:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
this may come may more or less comply
 
03:53:59.750 --> 03:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
with the law but it doesn't comply with
 
03:54:02.150 --> 03:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
legislative intent or
 
03:54:04.469 --> 03:54:04.479 align:start position:0%
this is a bad way to do something and
 
03:54:04.479 --> 03:54:06.870 align:start position:0%
this is a bad way to do something and
that's

03:54:06.870 --> 03:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:08.630 --> 03:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
the problem with one of the problems
 
03:54:10.710 --> 03:54:10.720 align:start position:0%
with administrative rules is that
 
03:54:13.429 --> 03:54:13.439 align:start position:0%
they're frequently written by people who
 
03:54:15.110 --> 03:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
aren't as knowledgeable as they ought to
 
03:54:15.120 --> 03:54:16.150 align:start position:0%
aren't as knowledgeable as they ought to
be

03:54:16.150 --> 03:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:54:19.030 --> 03:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
03:54:21.670 --> 03:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
they don't have the
 
03:54:23.349 --> 03:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
deep understanding of the subject that
 
03:54:25.030 --> 03:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
you would
 
03:54:26.389 --> 03:54:26.399 align:start position:0%
ideally have
 
03:54:29.990 --> 03:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
so what this this this amendment
 
03:54:31.189 --> 03:54:31.199 align:start position:0%
adds up
 
03:54:36.150 --> 03:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:39.590 --> 03:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:41.750 --> 03:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
nine members of the house and six
 
03:54:43.830 --> 03:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
members of the senate rather than five
 
03:54:45.670 --> 03:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
and five at the moment
 
03:54:45.680 --> 03:54:48.229 align:start position:0%
and five at the moment
and

03:54:48.229 --> 03:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:51.189 --> 03:54:51.199 align:start position:0%
separates them into three groups
 
03:54:52.710 --> 03:54:52.720 align:start position:0%
of five
 
03:54:55.830 --> 03:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
and so that you get
 
03:54:55.840 --> 03:54:58.389 align:start position:0%
and so that you get
more

03:54:58.389 --> 03:54:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:00.469 --> 03:55:00.479 align:start position:0%
more concentrated expertise in each
 
03:55:00.479 --> 03:55:01.750 align:start position:0%
more concentrated expertise in each
section

03:55:01.750 --> 03:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
section
 
03:55:04.389 --> 03:55:04.399 align:start position:0%
and there's
 
03:55:06.870 --> 03:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
the the only other significant change is
 
03:55:08.710 --> 03:55:08.720 align:start position:0%
that it would require the entire
 
03:55:08.720 --> 03:55:09.990 align:start position:0%
that it would require the entire
committee

03:55:09.990 --> 03:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:55:12.550 --> 03:55:12.560 align:start position:0%
all 15 members to get together to vote
 
03:55:15.349 --> 03:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
to make a final objection
 
03:55:17.269 --> 03:55:17.279 align:start position:0%
and submit a
 
03:55:17.279 --> 03:55:20.870 align:start position:0%
and submit a
um

03:55:20.870 --> 03:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:23.349 --> 03:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
a resolution to block the implementation
 
03:55:25.670 --> 03:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
of a rule and require a vote of the full
 
03:55:29.670 --> 03:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:31.830 --> 03:55:31.840 align:start position:0%
so i will try to answer questions if i
 
03:55:31.840 --> 03:55:35.830 align:start position:0%
so i will try to answer questions if i
can

03:55:35.830 --> 03:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:37.670 --> 03:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
representative lekkis
 
03:55:39.750 --> 03:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
03:55:42.550 --> 03:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
so looking through this we got it i i
 
03:55:45.510 --> 03:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
didn't see anything that decided what uh
 
03:55:47.110 --> 03:55:47.120 align:start position:0%
division would handle what subject and
 
03:55:48.630 --> 03:55:48.640 align:start position:0%
how it'd be broken up is that just going
 
03:55:50.870 --> 03:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
to be decided by the committee chair or
 
03:55:52.229 --> 03:55:52.239 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
03:55:55.030 --> 03:55:55.040 align:start position:0%
i would suspect it would like many other
 
03:55:56.950 --> 03:55:56.960 align:start position:0%
things it would depend on what rules are
 
03:55:58.229 --> 03:55:58.239 align:start position:0%
coming up
 
03:56:00.469 --> 03:56:00.479 align:start position:0%
are likely to come up or
 
03:56:02.710 --> 03:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
what the particular
 
03:56:04.870 --> 03:56:04.880 align:start position:0%
interest and knowledge of the
 
03:56:07.910 --> 03:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh committee members is but yes i i left
 
03:56:10.150 --> 03:56:10.160 align:start position:0%
it up to the discretion of the chair
 
03:56:10.160 --> 03:56:11.189 align:start position:0%
it up to the discretion of the chair
follow-up

03:56:11.189 --> 03:56:11.199 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:56:13.189 --> 03:56:13.199 align:start position:0%
recognize for follow-up thank you uh so
 
03:56:15.590 --> 03:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
that means that uh individual members of
 
03:56:15.600 --> 03:56:16.389 align:start position:0%
that means that uh individual members of
uh

03:56:16.389 --> 03:56:16.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:56:18.070 --> 03:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
the committee wouldn't
 
03:56:20.070 --> 03:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
always be assigned to the same division
 
03:56:22.070 --> 03:56:22.080 align:start position:0%
that might move based on what rules were
 
03:56:24.150 --> 03:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
coming in or i think would be easier if
 
03:56:25.670 --> 03:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
they were standing
 
03:56:27.670 --> 03:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
so i would expect that to be the case in
 
03:56:31.189 --> 03:56:31.199 align:start position:0%
most circumstances all right thank you
 
03:56:35.110 --> 03:56:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:37.269 --> 03:56:37.279 align:start position:0%
representative luck is did ask my
 
03:56:38.790 --> 03:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
question and i
 
03:56:38.800 --> 03:56:40.710 align:start position:0%
question and i
um

03:56:40.710 --> 03:56:40.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:42.229 --> 03:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
i was particularly interested in
 
03:56:43.590 --> 03:56:43.600 align:start position:0%
standing committees so it would be
 
03:56:45.670 --> 03:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
similar to what we do in this committee
 
03:56:47.510 --> 03:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
when we have standing subcommittees and
 
03:56:49.189 --> 03:56:49.199 align:start position:0%
we have a bill that needs to be hashed
 
03:56:51.189 --> 03:56:51.199 align:start position:0%
out we send it to that subcommittee
 
03:56:52.870 --> 03:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
right is that right
 
03:56:55.110 --> 03:56:55.120 align:start position:0%
yeah or in finance they do the same yes
 
03:56:56.950 --> 03:56:56.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:56:59.670 --> 03:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
representative pearson
 
03:57:03.110 --> 03:57:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:05.510 --> 03:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
looking at this your your uh
 
03:57:08.790 --> 03:57:08.800 align:start position:0%
you're committing 20 of the senate
 
03:57:10.309 --> 03:57:10.319 align:start position:0%
okay to this
 
03:57:14.309 --> 03:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:16.309 --> 03:57:16.319 align:start position:0%
a lot of discussion we've heard this
 
03:57:19.189 --> 03:57:19.199 align:start position:0%
year the senate is already
 
03:57:22.229 --> 03:57:22.239 align:start position:0%
overworked according to them so is this
 
03:57:24.070 --> 03:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
something that
 
03:57:25.349 --> 03:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
i know it's your amendment and you're on
 
03:57:27.110 --> 03:57:27.120 align:start position:0%
it by yourself but is this something the
 
03:57:29.349 --> 03:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
senate's down like okay with as far as
 
03:57:31.670 --> 03:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
20 of the senate being committed to jail
 
03:57:33.990 --> 03:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
car there are two answers to that first
 
03:57:35.670 --> 03:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
we have in fact discussed this with
 
03:57:38.229 --> 03:57:38.239 align:start position:0%
members of the senate and
 
03:57:40.790 --> 03:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
they have not expressed extreme pleasure
 
03:57:43.429 --> 03:57:43.439 align:start position:0%
or displeasure so
 
03:57:45.429 --> 03:57:45.439 align:start position:0%
the other thing is that
 
03:57:48.070 --> 03:57:48.080 align:start position:0%
the structure of jail car is such that
 
03:57:50.550 --> 03:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
there are there's a full complement of
 
03:57:53.510 --> 03:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
alternates and it is not at all uncommon
 
03:57:55.750 --> 03:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
even now where there's
 
03:57:57.510 --> 03:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
five senate members and five house
 
03:58:00.389 --> 03:58:00.399 align:start position:0%
members and five house alternates to
 
03:58:00.399 --> 03:58:01.189 align:start position:0%
members and five house alternates to
have

03:58:01.189 --> 03:58:01.199 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:58:04.710 --> 03:58:04.720 align:start position:0%
one or more of or of the senators
 
03:58:07.990 --> 03:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
be replaced by house alternates
 
03:58:09.750 --> 03:58:09.760 align:start position:0%
there are senate alternates too and they
 
03:58:11.269 --> 03:58:11.279 align:start position:0%
show up when they when they they're
 
03:58:11.279 --> 03:58:13.110 align:start position:0%
show up when they when they they're
interested

03:58:13.110 --> 03:58:13.120 align:start position:0%
interested
 
03:58:15.750 --> 03:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
what thank you
 
03:58:17.990 --> 03:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
so it
 
03:58:19.670 --> 03:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
with the restructuring here at some
 
03:58:21.510 --> 03:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
point there would have to be
 
03:58:24.550 --> 03:58:24.560 align:start position:0%
what constitutes a quorum
 
03:58:27.110 --> 03:58:27.120 align:start position:0%
so the quorum of a division shall be
 
03:58:29.510 --> 03:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
three members
 
03:58:29.520 --> 03:58:30.710 align:start position:0%
three members
with

03:58:30.710 --> 03:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:58:32.550 --> 03:58:32.560 align:start position:0%
five being a full complement if i'm
 
03:58:36.870 --> 03:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:36.880 --> 03:58:37.910 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:58:37.910 --> 03:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:58:37.920 --> 03:58:41.429 align:start position:0%
okay
the

03:58:41.429 --> 03:58:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:43.750 --> 03:58:43.760 align:start position:0%
as far as the
 
03:58:47.189 --> 03:58:47.199 align:start position:0%
three divisions are they
 
03:58:49.429 --> 03:58:49.439 align:start position:0%
the chairs of those
 
03:58:51.830 --> 03:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
are they staggered is it
 
03:58:53.030 --> 03:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
is the house
 
03:58:57.990 --> 03:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:01.110 --> 03:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
for the full committee the chair rotates
 
03:59:03.349 --> 03:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
it's the senate this session it'll be
 
03:59:06.229 --> 03:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
the house next session and if i didn't
 
03:59:07.910 --> 03:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
put that in that's a good thing to
 
03:59:10.309 --> 03:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
include for the divisions
 
03:59:14.070 --> 03:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:16.630 --> 03:59:16.640 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
03:59:17.670 --> 03:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
thank you i
 
03:59:18.870 --> 03:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
found the answer to my question wait a
 
03:59:21.269 --> 03:59:21.279 align:start position:0%
minute excuse me senator pearson if you
 
03:59:24.229 --> 03:59:24.239 align:start position:0%
look on page 29
 
03:59:26.710 --> 03:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
the the chair shall rotate biannually
 
03:59:30.070 --> 03:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
between the house and senate members
 
03:59:31.910 --> 03:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
right that's the over the overall
 
03:59:35.590 --> 03:59:35.600 align:start position:0%
encompassing 15 member body right yes
 
03:59:38.630 --> 03:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:40.950 --> 03:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say the same applies to these
 
03:59:42.950 --> 03:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
divisions but it it
 
03:59:47.750 --> 03:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:50.870 --> 03:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
i i found the answer to my question okay
 
03:59:56.229 --> 03:59:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:59.189 --> 03:59:59.199 align:start position:0%
um yeah this is just to get back to the
 
04:00:02.710 --> 04:00:02.720 align:start position:0%
what what is the scope of each division
 
04:00:05.670 --> 04:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me that if the
 
04:00:07.750 --> 04:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
speaker and the president of the senate
 
04:00:10.870 --> 04:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
are going to appoint members
 
04:00:12.309 --> 04:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
to the
 
04:00:13.830 --> 04:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
do they appoint the members to the
 
04:00:15.590 --> 04:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
divisions or
 
04:00:15.600 --> 04:00:16.469 align:start position:0%
divisions or
or

04:00:16.469 --> 04:00:16.479 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:00:16.479 --> 04:00:17.750 align:start position:0%
or
uh

04:00:17.750 --> 04:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:00:19.910 --> 04:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
that maybe somehow somehow it needs to
 
04:00:21.990 --> 04:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
specify either what the divisions are
 
04:00:25.030 --> 04:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
going to be in statute or
 
04:00:27.349 --> 04:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
some mechanism to determine what it is
 
04:00:29.590 --> 04:00:29.600 align:start position:0%
before the people are appointed that was
 
04:00:30.790 --> 04:00:30.800 align:start position:0%
just my thought
 
04:00:30.800 --> 04:00:33.670 align:start position:0%
just my thought
um

04:00:33.670 --> 04:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:36.710 --> 04:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
it's an interesting thought right now
 
04:00:39.429 --> 04:00:39.439 align:start position:0%
if anybody is appointed to jail car and
 
04:00:41.189 --> 04:00:41.199 align:start position:0%
shows a willingness to continue they
 
04:00:43.429 --> 04:00:43.439 align:start position:0%
will be reappointed for as long as they
 
04:00:44.930 --> 04:00:44.940 align:start position:0%
show that willingness
 
04:00:44.940 --> 04:00:47.030 align:start position:0%
show that willingness
[Laughter]

04:00:47.030 --> 04:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:00:49.670 --> 04:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
and what i would hope that the
 
04:00:51.670 --> 04:00:51.680 align:start position:0%
criteria would be
 
04:00:53.910 --> 04:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
would to have
 
04:00:56.710 --> 04:00:56.720 align:start position:0%
as wide a range of expertise
 
04:00:59.750 --> 04:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
as you can possibly get because
 
04:01:02.469 --> 04:01:02.479 align:start position:0%
of the 400 of us you know no matter what
 
04:01:04.469 --> 04:01:04.479 align:start position:0%
it is somebody's an expert
 
04:01:07.110 --> 04:01:07.120 align:start position:0%
but if you're only talking you know five
 
04:01:09.990 --> 04:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
members now or nine members
 
04:01:12.389 --> 04:01:12.399 align:start position:0%
you know you want to get
 
04:01:15.030 --> 04:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
people who have a widely varying
 
04:01:20.870 --> 04:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:23.269 --> 04:01:23.279 align:start position:0%
and not all for me dna yes
 
04:01:25.189 --> 04:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
i mean the the
 
04:01:27.189 --> 04:01:27.199 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons that we have problems
 
04:01:28.950 --> 04:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
with rules is that
 
04:01:30.830 --> 04:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
too many
 
04:01:32.790 --> 04:01:32.800 align:start position:0%
legislators don't take them very
 
04:01:32.800 --> 04:01:34.229 align:start position:0%
legislators don't take them very
seriously

04:01:34.229 --> 04:01:34.239 align:start position:0%
seriously
 
04:01:37.590 --> 04:01:37.600 align:start position:0%
and so you don't get the involvement in
 
04:01:39.030 --> 04:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
the rules
 
04:01:41.510 --> 04:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
even though they have the effect of law
 
04:01:41.520 --> 04:01:42.790 align:start position:0%
even though they have the effect of law
and

04:01:42.790 --> 04:01:42.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:01:45.429 --> 04:01:45.439 align:start position:0%
the the more people from different
 
04:01:46.950 --> 04:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
committees and different backgrounds we
 
04:01:48.550 --> 04:01:48.560 align:start position:0%
can get involved
 
04:01:51.030 --> 04:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
the more likely it is that we will help
 
04:01:54.870 --> 04:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
the agencies produce good rules
 
04:01:54.880 --> 04:01:58.710 align:start position:0%
the agencies produce good rules
so

04:01:58.710 --> 04:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:00.870 --> 04:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
are there any more questions for
 
04:02:03.990 --> 04:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:06.150 --> 04:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:02:08.870 --> 04:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question
 
04:02:14.309 --> 04:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:16.150 --> 04:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
as you know i sat in the initial
 
04:02:19.189 --> 04:02:19.199 align:start position:0%
discussions we had with the speaker and
 
04:02:19.199 --> 04:02:19.990 align:start position:0%
discussions we had with the speaker and
uh

04:02:19.990 --> 04:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:02:23.110 --> 04:02:23.120 align:start position:0%
the initial draft that came forward
 
04:02:23.120 --> 04:02:24.469 align:start position:0%
the initial draft that came forward
um

04:02:24.469 --> 04:02:24.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:26.229 --> 04:02:26.239 align:start position:0%
that was sent out to us when we had that
 
04:02:28.070 --> 04:02:28.080 align:start position:0%
working group
 
04:02:28.080 --> 04:02:31.429 align:start position:0%
working group
had

04:02:31.429 --> 04:02:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:33.510 --> 04:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
nine members from the house
 
04:02:35.349 --> 04:02:35.359 align:start position:0%
and it
 
04:02:38.389 --> 04:02:38.399 align:start position:0%
changed it to do from there it went from
 
04:02:40.630 --> 04:02:40.640 align:start position:0%
five of who should be from the same
 
04:02:40.640 --> 04:02:41.590 align:start position:0%
five of who should be from the same
party

04:02:41.590 --> 04:02:41.600 align:start position:0%
party
 
04:02:43.990 --> 04:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
this amendment before us changes that to
 
04:02:46.469 --> 04:02:46.479 align:start position:0%
six from the same party i'm
 
04:02:47.990 --> 04:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
asking if you'd be willing to go back to
 
04:02:49.510 --> 04:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
that five i think it makes it more
 
04:02:51.670 --> 04:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
workable and it keeps the percentages
 
04:02:52.630 --> 04:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
back to where they were with the
 
04:02:54.389 --> 04:02:54.399 align:start position:0%
original three pips
 
04:02:56.710 --> 04:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
that was a request of the speaker and i
 
04:02:56.720 --> 04:02:57.429 align:start position:0%
that was a request of the speaker and i
will

04:02:57.429 --> 04:02:57.439 align:start position:0%
will
 
04:02:59.110 --> 04:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
he who is going to be
 
04:03:01.189 --> 04:03:01.199 align:start position:0%
who is going to be testifying next and
 
04:03:01.199 --> 04:03:02.550 align:start position:0%
who is going to be testifying next and
um

04:03:02.550 --> 04:03:02.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:03:04.229 --> 04:03:04.239 align:start position:0%
i'll go along with whatever you guys
 
04:03:05.429 --> 04:03:05.439 align:start position:0%
agree i
 
04:03:07.429 --> 04:03:07.439 align:start position:0%
we you need to have a solid presence
 
04:03:09.910 --> 04:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
from both parties i agree with that and
 
04:03:12.469 --> 04:03:12.479 align:start position:0%
i agree i i understand i i know joe kai
 
04:03:14.790 --> 04:03:14.800 align:start position:0%
when they work they
 
04:03:16.630 --> 04:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
generally don't work wrong party lines
 
04:03:18.389 --> 04:03:18.399 align:start position:0%
they work as a working group for the
 
04:03:19.990 --> 04:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
best interest in making sure the rules
 
04:03:21.670 --> 04:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
are and so i'm just hoping we can stay
 
04:03:24.710 --> 04:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
closer to the center thank you
 
04:03:27.110 --> 04:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions
 
04:03:29.590 --> 04:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman maguire
 
04:03:35.429 --> 04:03:35.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:37.189 --> 04:03:37.199 align:start position:0%
uh thank you and
 
04:03:39.270 --> 04:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um
 
04:03:39.280 --> 04:03:40.469 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um
[Music]

04:03:40.469 --> 04:03:40.479 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:03:43.030 --> 04:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
as representative probably just said
 
04:03:45.750 --> 04:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
this is something that
 
04:03:48.630 --> 04:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
we've been working on
 
04:03:50.710 --> 04:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
realistically for probably the past 10
 
04:03:50.720 --> 04:03:51.590 align:start position:0%
realistically for probably the past 10
years

04:03:51.590 --> 04:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:03:53.349 --> 04:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
trying to come up with some solutions to
 
04:03:55.670 --> 04:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
fix gel car
 
04:03:55.680 --> 04:03:57.830 align:start position:0%
fix gel car
and

04:03:57.830 --> 04:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:03:59.670 --> 04:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
gel car has been given an almost
 
04:04:02.389 --> 04:04:02.399 align:start position:0%
impossible task
 
04:04:04.550 --> 04:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
if you look at the amount of paperwork
 
04:04:06.790 --> 04:04:06.800 align:start position:0%
they're giving on any given day when
 
04:04:07.830 --> 04:04:07.840 align:start position:0%
they meet
 
04:04:10.550 --> 04:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh it can be you know this much
 
04:04:12.870 --> 04:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
paperwork on on a table
 
04:04:14.150 --> 04:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:04:16.389 --> 04:04:16.399 align:start position:0%
i mean i'll use the analogy of
 
04:04:19.830 --> 04:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh we'll pass a one paragraph bill in
 
04:04:21.429 --> 04:04:21.439 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
04:04:22.630 --> 04:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
and they'll
 
04:04:23.990 --> 04:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
the the
 
04:04:25.750 --> 04:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
separate department will come up with a
 
04:04:27.670 --> 04:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
50 60 page
 
04:04:31.030 --> 04:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
list of administrative rules
 
04:04:34.150 --> 04:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
i've seen it happen
 
04:04:37.349 --> 04:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
and what we're trying to do here is to
 
04:04:39.189 --> 04:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
make it more effective and more
 
04:04:39.199 --> 04:04:40.469 align:start position:0%
make it more effective and more
realistic

04:04:40.469 --> 04:04:40.479 align:start position:0%
realistic
 
04:04:43.830 --> 04:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:46.389 --> 04:04:46.399 align:start position:0%
the amount of things coming back and
 
04:04:48.229 --> 04:04:48.239 align:start position:0%
i've had to do this myself a number of
 
04:04:50.550 --> 04:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
times through the years
 
04:04:52.469 --> 04:04:52.479 align:start position:0%
where i've gone to the administrative
 
04:04:52.479 --> 04:04:53.510 align:start position:0%
where i've gone to the administrative
roles

04:04:53.510 --> 04:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
roles
 
04:04:56.950 --> 04:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
and i'm saying this isn't what we passed
 
04:04:58.150 --> 04:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:04:59.590 --> 04:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
when i served all those years on
 
04:05:01.269 --> 04:05:01.279 align:start position:0%
transportation and i said this isn't
 
04:05:03.750 --> 04:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
what we passed this wasn't the intent
 
04:05:05.510 --> 04:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
and they put it in administrative rules
 
04:05:08.710 --> 04:05:08.720 align:start position:0%
and then we had to go back and fix it
 
04:05:11.830 --> 04:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
is this going to be the solution
 
04:05:14.550 --> 04:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
probably not completely
 
04:05:14.560 --> 04:05:15.269 align:start position:0%
probably not completely
but

04:05:15.269 --> 04:05:15.279 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:05:17.510 --> 04:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
this is a start
 
04:05:19.110 --> 04:05:19.120 align:start position:0%
now there's some other things that we
 
04:05:20.710 --> 04:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
04:05:23.030 --> 04:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
and uh something that i've felt is
 
04:05:23.040 --> 04:05:24.070 align:start position:0%
and uh something that i've felt is
needed

04:05:24.070 --> 04:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
needed
 
04:05:25.269 --> 04:05:25.279 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:05:27.269 --> 04:05:27.279 align:start position:0%
maybe and i can't remember when we had
 
04:05:30.870 --> 04:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
our meetings who suggested it is maybe
 
04:05:33.269 --> 04:05:33.279 align:start position:0%
every committee in the house
 
04:05:35.110 --> 04:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
will have a separate subcommittee to go
 
04:05:37.110 --> 04:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
over the rules too before they go to
 
04:05:39.269 --> 04:05:39.279 align:start position:0%
jail car to make sure that they're the
 
04:05:40.870 --> 04:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
intent of what the legislation was
 
04:05:40.880 --> 04:05:41.990 align:start position:0%
intent of what the legislation was
passed

04:05:41.990 --> 04:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
passed
 
04:05:44.469 --> 04:05:44.479 align:start position:0%
that could be the next step
 
04:05:46.950 --> 04:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
so this is the first step
 
04:05:46.960 --> 04:05:49.590 align:start position:0%
so this is the first step
um

04:05:49.590 --> 04:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:52.150 --> 04:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
i truly believe it's going to help
 
04:05:54.229 --> 04:05:54.239 align:start position:0%
make a better set of rules coming out of
 
04:05:55.510 --> 04:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
gel car
 
04:05:58.710 --> 04:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
especially if it acts like the
 
04:06:00.309 --> 04:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee does
 
04:06:02.630 --> 04:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
where a department
 
04:06:04.870 --> 04:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
certain departments are
 
04:06:04.880 --> 04:06:05.990 align:start position:0%
certain departments are
regularly

04:06:05.990 --> 04:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
regularly
 
04:06:07.429 --> 04:06:07.439 align:start position:0%
you know are appointed to each one of
 
04:06:07.439 --> 04:06:08.389 align:start position:0%
you know are appointed to each one of
the

04:06:08.389 --> 04:06:08.399 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:06:10.950 --> 04:06:10.960 align:start position:0%
finance committee divisions
 
04:06:12.870 --> 04:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm assuming that this is the
 
04:06:14.469 --> 04:06:14.479 align:start position:0%
basically the same way that this will
 
04:06:14.479 --> 04:06:15.510 align:start position:0%
basically the same way that this will
work

04:06:15.510 --> 04:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:06:18.309 --> 04:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
uh you'll have the you know five house
 
04:06:21.349 --> 04:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
members and uh the senate members and
 
04:06:21.359 --> 04:06:23.030 align:start position:0%
members and uh the senate members and
they'll

04:06:23.030 --> 04:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
they'll
 
04:06:24.870 --> 04:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
you know hopefully work with their
 
04:06:27.910 --> 04:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
expertise on that uh on that sub on that
 
04:06:30.950 --> 04:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh division of gel car
 
04:06:34.550 --> 04:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
i can tell you um having worked on
 
04:06:36.550 --> 04:06:36.560 align:start position:0%
appointing members to gel car a number
 
04:06:37.670 --> 04:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
of times
 
04:06:37.680 --> 04:06:38.550 align:start position:0%
of times
um

04:06:38.550 --> 04:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:40.790 --> 04:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
it's worse than pulling teeth
 
04:06:43.750 --> 04:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
in many cases uh some people love it
 
04:06:47.189 --> 04:06:47.199 align:start position:0%
uh i know peter's been on it for uh
 
04:06:51.510 --> 04:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
years 16 years and god bless you
 
04:06:53.030 --> 04:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
04:06:55.110 --> 04:06:55.120 align:start position:0%
you know it's been very hard to define
 
04:06:56.870 --> 04:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
because of the intensity of the amount
 
04:06:59.110 --> 04:06:59.120 align:start position:0%
of work that you get uh when gel car
 
04:06:59.120 --> 04:07:00.389 align:start position:0%
of work that you get uh when gel car
meets

04:07:00.389 --> 04:07:00.399 align:start position:0%
meets
 
04:07:02.950 --> 04:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
this is one step forward uh we've got
 
04:07:04.790 --> 04:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
some other things um
 
04:07:06.469 --> 04:07:06.479 align:start position:0%
that hopefully uh through the years
 
04:07:09.990 --> 04:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:12.309 --> 04:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
is it going to be the
 
04:07:12.319 --> 04:07:13.670 align:start position:0%
is it going to be the
solution

04:07:13.670 --> 04:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
solution
 
04:07:15.910 --> 04:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
i guess we won't know until we try it
 
04:07:18.150 --> 04:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
but what we're doing right now
 
04:07:20.630 --> 04:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
isn't the solution and so this is the
 
04:07:23.030 --> 04:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
first step moving forward
 
04:07:27.750 --> 04:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:29.910 --> 04:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
i think that's i'm open to
 
04:07:33.510 --> 04:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:37.349 --> 04:07:37.359 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for the speaker
 
04:07:39.990 --> 04:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
look at you out of the hot seat so quick
 
04:07:41.830 --> 04:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
everybody's scared out of their minds to
 
04:07:42.390 --> 04:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
ask him
 
04:07:42.400 --> 04:07:44.309 align:start position:0%
ask him
[Laughter]

04:07:44.309 --> 04:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:07:47.030 --> 04:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
now's your chance representatives
 
04:07:49.910 --> 04:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker okay thank you
 
04:08:14.469 --> 04:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:18.710 --> 04:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
okay so for the record peter schmidt
 
04:08:21.110 --> 04:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
representing dover wards one and two
 
04:08:22.950 --> 04:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
which is stratford
 
04:08:25.750 --> 04:08:25.760 align:start position:0%
district 19
 
04:08:28.630 --> 04:08:28.640 align:start position:0%
20 years in the house
 
04:08:31.269 --> 04:08:31.279 align:start position:0%
16 years on jail car
 
04:08:34.149 --> 04:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
um i wouldn't say i love it but it's
 
04:08:36.309 --> 04:08:36.319 align:start position:0%
something that has to be done
 
04:08:38.550 --> 04:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:08:40.870 --> 04:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
i don't have a family so i have more
 
04:08:43.429 --> 04:08:43.439 align:start position:0%
time than most of you probably do
 
04:08:48.070 --> 04:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:48.080 --> 04:08:50.229 align:start position:0%
 
but

04:08:50.229 --> 04:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:08:51.990 --> 04:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
i i have to
 
04:08:54.870 --> 04:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
oppose this idea because i think it is
 
04:08:57.670 --> 04:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
fundamentally wrong-headed and i will
 
04:08:59.510 --> 04:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
tell you why
 
04:09:02.309 --> 04:09:02.319 align:start position:0%
you have to understand that
 
04:09:04.389 --> 04:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
that the
 
04:09:07.189 --> 04:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
executive branch is granted a certain
 
04:09:09.269 --> 04:09:09.279 align:start position:0%
amount of the
 
04:09:12.229 --> 04:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
power of the legislature to make
 
04:09:12.239 --> 04:09:13.189 align:start position:0%
power of the legislature to make
laws

04:09:13.189 --> 04:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
laws
 
04:09:14.389 --> 04:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
rules are
 
04:09:16.630 --> 04:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
have the force and effective laws
 
04:09:16.640 --> 04:09:17.670 align:start position:0%
have the force and effective laws
um

04:09:17.670 --> 04:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:19.830 --> 04:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
as it has already been alluded to by
 
04:09:23.590 --> 04:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:23.600 --> 04:09:24.389 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:09:24.389 --> 04:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:09:24.399 --> 04:09:25.670 align:start position:0%
and
so

04:09:25.670 --> 04:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:09:28.950 --> 04:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
but as a trade-off for the
 
04:09:28.960 --> 04:09:30.630 align:start position:0%
but as a trade-off for the
[Music]

04:09:30.630 --> 04:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:09:32.870 --> 04:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh for the authority that is given to
 
04:09:35.510 --> 04:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
the executive branch to make those laws
 
04:09:37.590 --> 04:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
there is a jail car in the state of new
 
04:09:39.590 --> 04:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire in any case
 
04:09:42.389 --> 04:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
which has the power to
 
04:09:44.630 --> 04:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
vet those rules
 
04:09:46.710 --> 04:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
to see that the
 
04:09:49.110 --> 04:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
uh that the rules that are written
 
04:09:52.630 --> 04:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
by the executive branch departments uh
 
04:09:57.349 --> 04:09:57.359 align:start position:0%
do not ex primarily they're therefore
 
04:10:00.309 --> 04:10:00.319 align:start position:0%
pillars of objection but the two main
 
04:10:01.349 --> 04:10:01.359 align:start position:0%
ones are
 
04:10:03.990 --> 04:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
a rule cannot exceed legislative
 
04:10:04.000 --> 04:10:05.269 align:start position:0%
a rule cannot exceed legislative
authority

04:10:05.269 --> 04:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
authority
 
04:10:08.070 --> 04:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
can't it can't permit more than
 
04:10:08.080 --> 04:10:08.830 align:start position:0%
can't it can't permit more than
the

04:10:08.830 --> 04:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:10:11.030 --> 04:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
statute permits
 
04:10:12.950 --> 04:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
and the other one is it can't violate
 
04:10:14.710 --> 04:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
legislative intent
 
04:10:16.229 --> 04:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
i think those are pretty
 
04:10:19.110 --> 04:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
straightforward and understandable
 
04:10:20.790 --> 04:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
you can ask me a question if you have
 
04:10:20.800 --> 04:10:21.590 align:start position:0%
you can ask me a question if you have
one

04:10:21.590 --> 04:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:10:21.600 --> 04:10:23.189 align:start position:0%
one
but

04:10:23.189 --> 04:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:10:25.910 --> 04:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh that's what gel car does
 
04:10:25.920 --> 04:10:26.790 align:start position:0%
uh that's what gel car does
but

04:10:26.790 --> 04:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:10:29.990 --> 04:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
the idea that you're going to have a gel
 
04:10:32.630 --> 04:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
car which is as expert
 
04:10:32.640 --> 04:10:33.510 align:start position:0%
car which is as expert
as

04:10:33.510 --> 04:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:10:33.520 --> 04:10:34.469 align:start position:0%
as
the

04:10:34.469 --> 04:10:34.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:10:37.590 --> 04:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
professions that it writes rules for
 
04:10:40.630 --> 04:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
is just fundamentally wrong-headed
 
04:10:43.189 --> 04:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
the rules are not written by
 
04:10:45.750 --> 04:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
legislators the statutes are written by
 
04:10:48.550 --> 04:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
legislators but very often
 
04:10:49.830 --> 04:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
those of you who've been here for a
 
04:10:51.590 --> 04:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
while or even for a relatively short
 
04:10:54.309 --> 04:10:54.319 align:start position:0%
period of time know that very often the
 
04:10:54.319 --> 04:10:55.510 align:start position:0%
period of time know that very often the
the

04:10:55.510 --> 04:10:55.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:10:57.030 --> 04:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
bills that we
 
04:11:00.229 --> 04:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
that we vet in our committees are bills
 
04:11:03.429 --> 04:11:03.439 align:start position:0%
that come from outside
 
04:11:03.439 --> 04:11:04.229 align:start position:0%
that come from outside
right

04:11:04.229 --> 04:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:11:06.550 --> 04:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
they come from outside
 
04:11:08.550 --> 04:11:08.560 align:start position:0%
and not necessarily from a citizen who
 
04:11:11.189 --> 04:11:11.199 align:start position:0%
has an idea sometimes the citizens have
 
04:11:13.269 --> 04:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
ideas that are good sometimes they have
 
04:11:15.830 --> 04:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
ideas that frankly are pretty bad
 
04:11:19.670 --> 04:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
or unworkable in terms of legal
 
04:11:22.070 --> 04:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
voting and legal basis
 
04:11:22.080 --> 04:11:24.149 align:start position:0%
voting and legal basis
so

04:11:24.149 --> 04:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:11:26.950 --> 04:11:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:29.590 --> 04:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
a statute which
 
04:11:31.110 --> 04:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
says what it says
 
04:11:33.269 --> 04:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
gets adopted by the legislature signed
 
04:11:34.950 --> 04:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
off on by the governor
 
04:11:34.960 --> 04:11:35.990 align:start position:0%
off on by the governor
then

04:11:35.990 --> 04:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:11:37.830 --> 04:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
something is going to have to be done by
 
04:11:40.710 --> 04:11:40.720 align:start position:0%
and large to implement that statute
 
04:11:44.229 --> 04:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
and that's the rule that's written
 
04:11:46.710 --> 04:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
and that rule is going to be more
 
04:11:49.189 --> 04:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
precise because it's kind of like
 
04:11:51.189 --> 04:11:51.199 align:start position:0%
the difference between a blueprint and a
 
04:11:51.199 --> 04:11:52.790 align:start position:0%
the difference between a blueprint and a
house

04:11:52.790 --> 04:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
house
 
04:11:52.800 --> 04:11:53.510 align:start position:0%
house
the

04:11:53.510 --> 04:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:11:55.670 --> 04:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
print may be the basis but it doesn't
 
04:11:58.309 --> 04:11:58.319 align:start position:0%
have every nail in it
 
04:12:01.590 --> 04:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have any every
 
04:12:03.910 --> 04:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
every aspect of the house
 
04:12:07.269 --> 04:12:07.279 align:start position:0%
the builders have to come up with that
 
04:12:10.870 --> 04:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
and so uh the the rule is going to be
 
04:12:10.880 --> 04:12:11.830 align:start position:0%
and so uh the the rule is going to be
longer

04:12:11.830 --> 04:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
longer
 
04:12:16.229 --> 04:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
than the statute overwhelmingly but but
 
04:12:17.830 --> 04:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean that it's going to be
 
04:12:19.030 --> 04:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
and i have to disagree with the
 
04:12:20.790 --> 04:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
speaker's characterization that a
 
04:12:24.630 --> 04:12:24.640 align:start position:0%
one-page statute can have a 60-page rule
 
04:12:27.429 --> 04:12:27.439 align:start position:0%
uh i've been doing this for 16 years
 
04:12:30.469 --> 04:12:30.479 align:start position:0%
i've never seen anything like that
 
04:12:32.389 --> 04:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
it's going to have more because it has
 
04:12:35.269 --> 04:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
all the details in it
 
04:12:37.750 --> 04:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
but the rule but the rule is written
 
04:12:40.149 --> 04:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
not by
 
04:12:40.159 --> 04:12:41.990 align:start position:0%
not by
by

04:12:41.990 --> 04:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:12:42.000 --> 04:12:43.269 align:start position:0%
by
some

04:12:43.269 --> 04:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
some
 
04:12:46.550 --> 04:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
legislative body it's written by
 
04:12:46.560 --> 04:12:47.590 align:start position:0%
legislative body it's written by
the

04:12:47.590 --> 04:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:12:49.110 --> 04:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
agency that
 
04:12:53.510 --> 04:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:56.790 --> 04:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
and the people in that agency
 
04:12:56.800 --> 04:12:57.830 align:start position:0%
and the people in that agency
are

04:12:57.830 --> 04:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:13:01.269 --> 04:13:01.279 align:start position:0%
very heavily experienced in that area
 
04:13:03.189 --> 04:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
and they work together with the
 
04:13:05.910 --> 04:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
profession that that statute is going to
 
04:13:08.149 --> 04:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
govern and that rule is going to is
 
04:13:11.349 --> 04:13:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:13.110 --> 04:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
and therefore
 
04:13:15.750 --> 04:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
it's a give and take
 
04:13:18.389 --> 04:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
and when the agency's done writing the
 
04:13:18.399 --> 04:13:20.790 align:start position:0%
and when the agency's done writing the
rule

04:13:20.790 --> 04:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:20.800 --> 04:13:21.750 align:start position:0%
 
then

04:13:21.750 --> 04:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
then
 
04:13:23.910 --> 04:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
there's a public hearing
 
04:13:25.830 --> 04:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
no that's not the jail car hearing it's
 
04:13:28.070 --> 04:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
the first hearing after the rule is
 
04:13:28.080 --> 04:13:29.030 align:start position:0%
the first hearing after the rule is
written

04:13:29.030 --> 04:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
written
 
04:13:30.309 --> 04:13:30.319 align:start position:0%
and after that
 
04:13:32.070 --> 04:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
give and take and back and forth has
 
04:13:32.080 --> 04:13:33.670 align:start position:0%
give and take and back and forth has
happened

04:13:33.670 --> 04:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
happened
 
04:13:36.229 --> 04:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
and the stakeholders that is the
 
04:13:37.910 --> 04:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
profession that is going to be
 
04:13:39.189 --> 04:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
influenced and
 
04:13:40.630 --> 04:13:40.640 align:start position:0%
regulated there
 
04:13:42.630 --> 04:13:42.640 align:start position:0%
has an opportunity to say
 
04:13:44.870 --> 04:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
that won't work we don't like that and
 
04:13:46.710 --> 04:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
so forth and so on
 
04:13:46.720 --> 04:13:47.670 align:start position:0%
so forth and so on
and

04:13:47.670 --> 04:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:13:49.590 --> 04:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
the agency has to take that into
 
04:13:52.630 --> 04:13:52.640 align:start position:0%
consideration they can't just ignore it
 
04:13:54.710 --> 04:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
because one of the members of the jail
 
04:13:56.550 --> 04:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
car and you're looking at him will
 
04:13:58.309 --> 04:13:58.319 align:start position:0%
always ask
 
04:14:00.070 --> 04:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
this point that you're bringing up in
 
04:14:01.830 --> 04:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
the i have to say there's a second
 
04:14:04.070 --> 04:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
04:14:05.830 --> 04:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
and that's the public hearing before
 
04:14:07.990 --> 04:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
jail car
 
04:14:10.389 --> 04:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
and i always ask if there's any if
 
04:14:13.189 --> 04:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
there's any public testimony
 
04:14:15.030 --> 04:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
this objection that you're bringing up
 
04:14:15.040 --> 04:14:16.309 align:start position:0%
this objection that you're bringing up
mr

04:14:16.309 --> 04:14:16.319 align:start position:0%
mr
 
04:14:16.319 --> 04:14:17.349 align:start position:0%
mr
mr

04:14:17.349 --> 04:14:17.359 align:start position:0%
mr
 
04:14:17.359 --> 04:14:19.030 align:start position:0%
mr
practitioner

04:14:19.030 --> 04:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
practitioner
 
04:14:22.790 --> 04:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
was that objection brought up in the
 
04:14:26.229 --> 04:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
in the fat first public hearing
 
04:14:27.990 --> 04:14:28.000 align:start position:0%
and if it was brought up
 
04:14:30.070 --> 04:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
and it's not reflected
 
04:14:33.189 --> 04:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
in some change in the rule
 
04:14:34.630 --> 04:14:34.640 align:start position:0%
that doesn't
 
04:14:39.030 --> 04:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:41.110 --> 04:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt could i ask you
 
04:14:44.389 --> 04:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
to speak specifically to the to
 
04:14:45.990 --> 04:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
to the amendment
 
04:14:48.229 --> 04:14:48.239 align:start position:0%
not necessarily to
 
04:14:50.950 --> 04:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
what exactly joe carr is doing now
 
04:14:53.670 --> 04:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
but the amendment is going to change
 
04:14:55.750 --> 04:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
the makeup of jelcar
 
04:14:58.469 --> 04:14:58.479 align:start position:0%
in order to better
 
04:14:59.990 --> 04:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
get into
 
04:15:02.870 --> 04:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
the substance of the rule
 
04:15:05.349 --> 04:15:05.359 align:start position:0%
we the argument is we need more
 
04:15:07.429 --> 04:15:07.439 align:start position:0%
expertise on the part of
 
04:15:07.439 --> 04:15:08.229 align:start position:0%
expertise on the part of
uh

04:15:08.229 --> 04:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:15:11.110 --> 04:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
of the members of the gel car because we
 
04:15:13.110 --> 04:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
they they don't know enough about things
 
04:15:16.229 --> 04:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
other than several of us who are on edna
 
04:15:19.189 --> 04:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
which has a lot of overlap with
 
04:15:20.790 --> 04:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh which elkhart that's one of the
 
04:15:23.910 --> 04:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
reasons when i got appointed to edna
 
04:15:26.630 --> 04:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
16 years ago i also got put on the gel
 
04:15:26.640 --> 04:15:27.510 align:start position:0%
16 years ago i also got put on the gel
car

04:15:27.510 --> 04:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
car
 
04:15:27.520 --> 04:15:29.590 align:start position:0%
car
okay

04:15:29.590 --> 04:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:15:32.630 --> 04:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
i get to testify madam chair okay
 
04:15:35.349 --> 04:15:35.359 align:start position:0%
and but the thing is
 
04:15:37.030 --> 04:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
i understand what i'm talking about
 
04:15:39.429 --> 04:15:39.439 align:start position:0%
because i've been doing it for 16 years
 
04:15:41.590 --> 04:15:41.600 align:start position:0%
and in that time i've missed i think two
 
04:15:45.030 --> 04:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
meetings gelco meets once a month
 
04:15:47.910 --> 04:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
at least every month
 
04:15:49.990 --> 04:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
that's one of the defects
 
04:15:51.990 --> 04:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
that's one of the defects of this
 
04:15:53.140 --> 04:15:53.150 align:start position:0%
proposed fix
 
04:15:53.150 --> 04:15:54.389 align:start position:0%
proposed fix
[Music]

04:15:54.389 --> 04:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:15:56.309 --> 04:15:56.319 align:start position:0%
that the suggestion that that we're
 
04:15:58.630 --> 04:15:58.640 align:start position:0%
going to have the committees vet the
 
04:15:58.640 --> 04:16:00.710 align:start position:0%
going to have the committees vet the
rules

04:16:00.710 --> 04:16:00.720 align:start position:0%
rules
 
04:16:03.110 --> 04:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
that's just not going to work
 
04:16:05.429 --> 04:16:05.439 align:start position:0%
because the committees only function
 
04:16:07.910 --> 04:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
from january
 
04:16:10.790 --> 04:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
to june at the latest then we're off the
 
04:16:12.309 --> 04:16:12.319 align:start position:0%
rest of the time
 
04:16:14.149 --> 04:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
who's going to vet the rules on the rest
 
04:16:16.469 --> 04:16:16.479 align:start position:0%
of the year
 
04:16:19.030 --> 04:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
we have a one meeting every month and if
 
04:16:21.830 --> 04:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
it's needed we have two meetings a month
 
04:16:21.840 --> 04:16:22.710 align:start position:0%
it's needed we have two meetings a month
okay

04:16:22.710 --> 04:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:16:25.110 --> 04:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
and they go on for as long as we have
 
04:16:26.870 --> 04:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
business to deal with
 
04:16:29.590 --> 04:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
so uh so
 
04:16:31.750 --> 04:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
this concept is just not going to work
 
04:16:33.110 --> 04:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
for one thing
 
04:16:34.710 --> 04:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
more members
 
04:16:37.030 --> 04:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
from this from the house on the basis of
 
04:16:39.510 --> 04:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
expertise the expertise is not going to
 
04:16:42.149 --> 04:16:42.159 align:start position:0%
be in the house it's in the agency or
 
04:16:44.550 --> 04:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
the department that writes the rule in
 
04:16:46.469 --> 04:16:46.479 align:start position:0%
conjunction with the practitioners of
 
04:16:48.309 --> 04:16:48.319 align:start position:0%
the rule
 
04:16:51.510 --> 04:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
the expertise is already there
 
04:16:53.670 --> 04:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
what does the gel card do
 
04:16:57.349 --> 04:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really vet the rule either
 
04:16:59.670 --> 04:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
the rule is vetted by the three
 
04:17:02.389 --> 04:17:02.399 align:start position:0%
full-time attorneys that the jail car
 
04:17:02.399 --> 04:17:03.670 align:start position:0%
full-time attorneys that the jail car
employs

04:17:03.670 --> 04:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
employs
 
04:17:05.830 --> 04:17:05.840 align:start position:0%
they go over the rule
 
04:17:08.389 --> 04:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
every aspect of the rule if it's a
 
04:17:10.790 --> 04:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
semicolon in place of a comma or vice
 
04:17:13.269 --> 04:17:13.279 align:start position:0%
versa that gets fixed if it should be
 
04:17:15.990 --> 04:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
there and not there that all gets fixed
 
04:17:19.189 --> 04:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
that's nitpicky kind of stuff but also
 
04:17:22.389 --> 04:17:22.399 align:start position:0%
the rule has to absolutely implement the
 
04:17:25.590 --> 04:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
statute to the greatest degree possible
 
04:17:27.910 --> 04:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
and if it doesn't implement the statute
 
04:17:29.990 --> 04:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
the attorneys will say there's a
 
04:17:32.710 --> 04:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
conflict with this statute or that
 
04:17:34.229 --> 04:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
statute in other words you've got
 
04:17:36.710 --> 04:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
statutes butting heads usually it's the
 
04:17:39.349 --> 04:17:39.359 align:start position:0%
new statute which is deemed to have
 
04:17:41.830 --> 04:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
uh the greater sway because it's the
 
04:17:44.149 --> 04:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
more recent statute
 
04:17:46.229 --> 04:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
but sometimes you get a budding and
 
04:17:47.990 --> 04:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
they'll and the then the jail car
 
04:17:50.229 --> 04:17:50.239 align:start position:0%
attorney will show with arrows and so
 
04:17:51.830 --> 04:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
forth you have to look at this to see
 
04:17:53.590 --> 04:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
how it looks
 
04:17:53.600 --> 04:17:54.469 align:start position:0%
how it looks
so

04:17:54.469 --> 04:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:17:57.429 --> 04:17:57.439 align:start position:0%
the idea that that the uh that the jail
 
04:17:59.830 --> 04:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
car attorneys are overwhelmed i don't
 
04:18:01.910 --> 04:18:01.920 align:start position:0%
know they they bring in the rules every
 
04:18:04.070 --> 04:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
time that they've they've gone over and
 
04:18:07.910 --> 04:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
they'll say uh you know this this is a
 
04:18:10.070 --> 04:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
problem here
 
04:18:13.590 --> 04:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
and then the agency gets gets to come in
 
04:18:15.990 --> 04:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
and and and they get to testify and they
 
04:18:18.630 --> 04:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
get to say uh this is the reason we're
 
04:18:20.710 --> 04:18:20.720 align:start position:0%
doing it this way
 
04:18:23.269 --> 04:18:23.279 align:start position:0%
and since the agency is the one that's
 
04:18:25.590 --> 04:18:25.600 align:start position:0%
actually overseeing and working with the
 
04:18:25.600 --> 04:18:27.910 align:start position:0%
actually overseeing and working with the
public

04:18:27.910 --> 04:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:18:29.990 --> 04:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
and if they say this is the only way we
 
04:18:32.149 --> 04:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
can do it
 
04:18:34.229 --> 04:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
then by and large the jail card will se
 
04:18:36.309 --> 04:18:36.319 align:start position:0%
and the attorneys will say
 
04:18:38.550 --> 04:18:38.560 align:start position:0%
the jail card the previous gel card 10
 
04:18:41.030 --> 04:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
years ago had the same objections and
 
04:18:44.870 --> 04:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
the and the gel car approved it
 
04:18:47.670 --> 04:18:47.680 align:start position:0%
so it's not a willy-nilly
 
04:18:49.750 --> 04:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
jamming stuff down people's throats the
 
04:18:52.309 --> 04:18:52.319 align:start position:0%
public has a great deal of involvement
 
04:18:53.269 --> 04:18:53.279 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:18:56.070 --> 04:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
the development of rules and the agency
 
04:18:58.710 --> 04:18:58.720 align:start position:0%
has the expertise not the legislature
 
04:19:01.750 --> 04:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
it's the agency that has the expertise
 
04:19:03.590 --> 04:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
one other aspect that's very important
 
04:19:05.429 --> 04:19:05.439 align:start position:0%
to understand and that is
 
04:19:07.750 --> 04:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
that getting people to serve on the gel
 
04:19:12.469 --> 04:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:14.710 --> 04:19:14.720 align:start position:0%
alluded to the fact that i
 
04:19:17.349 --> 04:19:17.359 align:start position:0%
have been on for a long time he said he
 
04:19:19.830 --> 04:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
implicitly said i love it i don't love
 
04:19:21.670 --> 04:19:21.680 align:start position:0%
it but i recognize that it has to be
 
04:19:23.670 --> 04:19:23.680 align:start position:0%
done and it's better to have somebody do
 
04:19:25.030 --> 04:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
it that knows what he's doing
 
04:19:26.389 --> 04:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt will you take
 
04:19:28.149 --> 04:19:28.159 align:start position:0%
questions i will
 
04:19:31.269 --> 04:19:31.279 align:start position:0%
representative pearson thank you i
 
04:19:32.389 --> 04:19:32.399 align:start position:0%
i have a
 
04:19:32.399 --> 04:19:34.630 align:start position:0%
i have a
couple

04:19:34.630 --> 04:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
couple
 
04:19:36.790 --> 04:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
um one of them is
 
04:19:39.670 --> 04:19:39.680 align:start position:0%
you made a comment about the committee's
 
04:19:41.189 --> 04:19:41.199 align:start position:0%
vetting the rules
 
04:19:42.309 --> 04:19:42.319 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's what's going on
 
04:19:44.070 --> 04:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
here the committees themselves are not
 
04:19:46.070 --> 04:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
vetting the rules they're making up
 
04:19:48.870 --> 04:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
they're expanding jail car in
 
04:19:50.309 --> 04:19:50.319 align:start position:0%
but the you know if there's a if there's
 
04:19:51.910 --> 04:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
a health and human service related
 
04:19:53.269 --> 04:19:53.279 align:start position:0%
question it's not going to the health
 
04:19:54.870 --> 04:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
and human services committee i'm
 
04:19:56.630 --> 04:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
alluding to the fact that the speaker
 
04:19:59.429 --> 04:19:59.439 align:start position:0%
said this is only a first step he he had
 
04:20:02.149 --> 04:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
acknowledged this probably won't work
 
04:20:03.830 --> 04:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
i agree with him that
 
04:20:05.830 --> 04:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
this probably might work okay so i've
 
04:20:07.110 --> 04:20:07.120 align:start position:0%
got to deal with what's what's in front
 
04:20:07.910 --> 04:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
of me
 
04:20:09.429 --> 04:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
not the theory of what's going to happen
 
04:20:11.590 --> 04:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
he said he said we'd like to get to the
 
04:20:13.750 --> 04:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
point where the committees are going to
 
04:20:15.990 --> 04:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
view the rules
 
04:20:18.550 --> 04:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
you want to come back in the summer time
 
04:20:20.389 --> 04:20:20.399 align:start position:0%
all every month
 
04:20:23.670 --> 04:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
for five or six hours to go over
 
04:20:27.990 --> 04:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know a 15 page or 30-page rule
 
04:20:29.429 --> 04:20:29.439 align:start position:0%
that's not in here
 
04:20:32.070 --> 04:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
we already virtually cannot find enough
 
04:20:34.630 --> 04:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
senators to to meet the quorum
 
04:20:36.870 --> 04:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
requirements right now so my second my
 
04:20:38.710 --> 04:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
second question for you representative
 
04:20:42.229 --> 04:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
schmidt is in your 16 years have you not
 
04:20:43.349 --> 04:20:43.359 align:start position:0%
ever seen
 
04:20:47.269 --> 04:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
an agency overstep its authority
 
04:20:49.990 --> 04:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
i i can give you a specific example
 
04:20:52.469 --> 04:20:52.479 align:start position:0%
where the committee over the agency
 
04:20:54.630 --> 04:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
overstepped the authority and that was
 
04:20:55.750 --> 04:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
when the
 
04:20:57.510 --> 04:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
smoking ban was
 
04:21:01.110 --> 04:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
was put through but there was no hammer
 
04:21:04.469 --> 04:21:04.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:08.630 --> 04:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
therefore the agency the agency said
 
04:21:09.990 --> 04:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
this is going to be
 
04:21:10.000 --> 04:21:11.349 align:start position:0%
this is going to be
ignored

04:21:11.349 --> 04:21:11.359 align:start position:0%
ignored
 
04:21:13.750 --> 04:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
if there's no sanction and so they put
 
04:21:17.030 --> 04:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
in a fifty dollar administrative fine
 
04:21:18.469 --> 04:21:18.479 align:start position:0%
you're recognized for following the
 
04:21:20.389 --> 04:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
attorney said
 
04:21:23.670 --> 04:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
there's no basis for this so we
 
04:21:26.550 --> 04:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
as a jail car we voted for a joint
 
04:21:28.550 --> 04:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
resolution saying
 
04:21:31.030 --> 04:21:31.040 align:start position:0%
there's no authority for this the agency
 
04:21:32.950 --> 04:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
agreed but they said
 
04:21:34.790 --> 04:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
this is going to have no effect if
 
04:21:37.189 --> 04:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
there's no hammer
 
04:21:38.469 --> 04:21:38.479 align:start position:0%
well you okay and that and you've
 
04:21:40.149 --> 04:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
alluded into my third question here that
 
04:21:42.469 --> 04:21:42.479 align:start position:0%
involves attorneys
 
04:21:42.479 --> 04:21:43.269 align:start position:0%
involves attorneys
it

04:21:43.269 --> 04:21:43.279 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:21:43.279 --> 04:21:44.229 align:start position:0%
it
you're

04:21:44.229 --> 04:21:44.239 align:start position:0%
you're
 
04:21:45.510 --> 04:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
from what i'm gathering what you're
 
04:21:47.030 --> 04:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
saying is that really jail car should
 
04:21:49.510 --> 04:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
just be a handful of attorneys
 
04:21:51.030 --> 04:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
and not
 
04:21:52.710 --> 04:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
because because you've made statements
 
04:21:54.309 --> 04:21:54.319 align:start position:0%
in reference to will the attorneys hash
 
04:21:56.870 --> 04:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
it out the attorneys determine this
 
04:21:58.469 --> 04:21:58.479 align:start position:0%
i think this goes a little you know i'm
 
04:21:59.830 --> 04:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
not subjugating the authority of the
 
04:22:01.429 --> 04:22:01.439 align:start position:0%
legislature to a handful of attorneys in
 
04:22:03.510 --> 04:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
a committee to to oversee rules and
 
04:22:05.189 --> 04:22:05.199 align:start position:0%
that's not what jail car is so clearly
 
04:22:07.110 --> 04:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
it's more than just
 
04:22:09.590 --> 04:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
a handful of gel car attorneys deciding
 
04:22:11.990 --> 04:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
what flies and what doesn't right
 
04:22:13.349 --> 04:22:13.359 align:start position:0%
the attorneys
 
04:22:16.550 --> 04:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
look at whether the rule implements the
 
04:22:16.560 --> 04:22:17.750 align:start position:0%
look at whether the rule implements the
statute

04:22:17.750 --> 04:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:22:20.389 --> 04:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
it does not exceed legislative authority
 
04:22:22.870 --> 04:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
it does not violate legislative intent
 
04:22:25.349 --> 04:22:25.359 align:start position:0%
if the rule does that the attorneys put
 
04:22:28.790 --> 04:22:28.800 align:start position:0%
on the consent calendar
 
04:22:30.710 --> 04:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
just like we have a consent calendar in
 
04:22:32.870 --> 04:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
the house you're all familiar with
 
04:22:34.070 --> 04:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
there's also a
 
04:22:36.469 --> 04:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
consent calendar on gel car
 
04:22:38.790 --> 04:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
and if the attorneys say this rule meets
 
04:22:41.590 --> 04:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
the statutory requirements implements
 
04:22:44.070 --> 04:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
the statute perfectly it goes on the ins
 
04:22:45.750 --> 04:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
consent calendar
 
04:22:47.429 --> 04:22:47.439 align:start position:0%
any member of the gel car can pull it
 
04:22:49.590 --> 04:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
off just like we can take off any
 
04:22:51.349 --> 04:22:51.359 align:start position:0%
anything in the house
 
04:22:52.550 --> 04:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
but the
 
04:22:55.670 --> 04:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
if if if the rule is perfect
 
04:22:58.469 --> 04:22:58.479 align:start position:0%
we don't ordinarily do anything except
 
04:23:00.389 --> 04:23:00.399 align:start position:0%
adopt the the
 
04:23:02.550 --> 04:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
jail car consent calendar
 
04:23:04.469 --> 04:23:04.479 align:start position:0%
with one vote the same way it happens in
 
04:23:07.429 --> 04:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
the house but if there's a problem
 
04:23:10.870 --> 04:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
where the attorneys say this is
 
04:23:13.670 --> 04:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
this is does not
 
04:23:15.910 --> 04:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
in our opinion does not meet the statute
 
04:23:15.920 --> 04:23:17.590 align:start position:0%
in our opinion does not meet the statute
perfectly

04:23:17.590 --> 04:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
perfectly
 
04:23:17.600 --> 04:23:18.630 align:start position:0%
perfectly
the

04:23:18.630 --> 04:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:23:21.030 --> 04:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
the agency is going to get to argue for
 
04:23:22.790 --> 04:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
why they want to do it that way and
 
04:23:24.790 --> 04:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
that's the only way to do it and the
 
04:23:26.950 --> 04:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
jail car can then say
 
04:23:29.510 --> 04:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
we understand why you can do it
 
04:23:31.750 --> 04:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
and you have that authority
 
04:23:34.070 --> 04:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
and we're going to approve that aspect
 
04:23:35.830 --> 04:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
or they may say
 
04:23:37.429 --> 04:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
we don't like this
 
04:23:39.349 --> 04:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
then we file a preliminary objection
 
04:23:43.429 --> 04:23:43.439 align:start position:0%
then the agency has 45 days in order to
 
04:23:45.429 --> 04:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
uh to fix that situation and
 
04:23:47.750 --> 04:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly the agency is able to fix
 
04:23:50.950 --> 04:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
it in a way that meets the statutory
 
04:23:50.960 --> 04:23:52.149 align:start position:0%
it in a way that meets the statutory
content

04:23:52.149 --> 04:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
content
 
04:23:53.670 --> 04:23:53.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative are there any
 
04:23:56.149 --> 04:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
04:23:57.670 --> 04:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony is there
 
04:23:59.670 --> 04:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
anybody else that wishes to testify i'm
 
04:24:01.429 --> 04:24:01.439 align:start position:0%
not done but you're shutting me off but
 
04:24:04.229 --> 04:24:04.239 align:start position:0%
i will fight this because this will not
 
04:24:07.349 --> 04:24:07.359 align:start position:0%
work thank you representative schmidt
 
04:24:08.710 --> 04:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else that wishes to
 
04:24:12.870 --> 04:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
testify that he's not already
 
04:24:14.630 --> 04:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
i will close the public hearing for
 
04:24:57.110 --> 04:24:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:01.110 --> 04:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:02.229 --> 04:25:02.239 align:start position:0%
we have
 
04:25:05.429 --> 04:25:05.439 align:start position:0%
yes we were yes the fire marshal is here
 
04:25:07.269 --> 04:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
and this time is valuable can we perhaps
 
04:25:08.309 --> 04:25:08.319 align:start position:0%
do that one
 
04:25:10.630 --> 04:25:10.640 align:start position:0%
okay we have two bills that we must
 
04:25:12.070 --> 04:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
execute today
 
04:25:12.080 --> 04:25:14.389 align:start position:0%
execute today
and

04:25:14.389 --> 04:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:25:16.550 --> 04:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you and since the fire marshal is
 
04:25:19.750 --> 04:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
here on senate bill 443
 
04:25:21.510 --> 04:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
let's take that one up
 
04:25:24.790 --> 04:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
and we'll resume the fight on 325
 
04:25:28.630 --> 04:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:35.110 --> 04:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:55.349 --> 04:25:55.359 align:start position:0%

[Music]

04:26:20.149 --> 04:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:26:21.670 --> 04:26:21.680 align:start position:0%
h as
 
04:26:24.710 --> 04:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
was just passed out to you guys
 
04:26:28.830 --> 04:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
what the amendment does is it adds
 
04:26:32.070 --> 04:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
similar a similar intent
 
04:26:34.389 --> 04:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
of language into the duties of the state
 
04:26:36.149 --> 04:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
fire marshal
 
04:26:39.110 --> 04:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
along with um
 
04:26:41.189 --> 04:26:41.199 align:start position:0%
the overall bill which is which handles
 
04:26:41.199 --> 04:26:42.710 align:start position:0%
the overall bill which is which handles
the

04:26:42.710 --> 04:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:26:45.830 --> 04:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
building code side of things i i think
 
04:26:47.189 --> 04:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
it's important that if we're going to
 
04:26:47.199 --> 04:26:48.389 align:start position:0%
it's important that if we're going to
have

04:26:48.389 --> 04:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:26:50.389 --> 04:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
um some checks and balances within the
 
04:26:52.229 --> 04:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
building code parts of things we need to
 
04:26:54.229 --> 04:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
also have those in reference to the fire
 
04:26:55.510 --> 04:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
code as well
 
04:26:57.349 --> 04:26:57.359 align:start position:0%
so what the amendment does is it adds
 
04:26:59.269 --> 04:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
obviously the the part on line 12 that's
 
04:27:00.469 --> 04:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
in bold
 
04:27:03.830 --> 04:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
that the local amendments must
 
04:27:06.469 --> 04:27:06.479 align:start position:0%
be reviewed by the state fire marshal
 
04:27:08.710 --> 04:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
prior to enforcement
 
04:27:11.510 --> 04:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
that the fire marshal reviews those
 
04:27:14.149 --> 04:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
local codes to make sure that they're
 
04:27:16.229 --> 04:27:16.239 align:start position:0%
actually legitimate
 
04:27:17.990 --> 04:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
and that
 
04:27:20.550 --> 04:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
the state fire marshal's office
 
04:27:23.830 --> 04:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
publishes those along with
 
04:27:23.840 --> 04:27:24.710 align:start position:0%
publishes those along with
the

04:27:24.710 --> 04:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:27:28.469 --> 04:27:28.479 align:start position:0%
state fire code this will substantially
 
04:27:31.110 --> 04:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
help the transparency in the confusion
 
04:27:34.070 --> 04:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
that builders have and homeowners have
 
04:27:34.080 --> 04:27:35.750 align:start position:0%
that builders have and homeowners have
between

04:27:35.750 --> 04:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
between
 
04:27:38.389 --> 04:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
various communities because right now
 
04:27:40.710 --> 04:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
there's not quite one-stop shopping here
 
04:27:40.720 --> 04:27:41.830 align:start position:0%
there's not quite one-stop shopping here
and

04:27:41.830 --> 04:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:27:43.510 --> 04:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
i think it's ridiculous that an
 
04:27:45.830 --> 04:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
electrician has to go through a massive
 
04:27:48.790 --> 04:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
amount of invested investigative work to
 
04:27:50.070 --> 04:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
figure out what's going to fly in
 
04:27:50.080 --> 04:27:51.269 align:start position:0%
figure out what's going to fly in
bedford

04:27:51.269 --> 04:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
bedford
 
04:27:52.229 --> 04:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:27:54.950 --> 04:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
go over to seabrook and go oh man okay
 
04:27:56.149 --> 04:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
there's a local
 
04:27:58.550 --> 04:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
ordinance we didn't even know about so
 
04:28:01.030 --> 04:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
this is you know this will
 
04:28:03.830 --> 04:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
this will help to um
 
04:28:06.229 --> 04:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
to make that process easier and
 
04:28:08.710 --> 04:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
also it will make things where they have
 
04:28:10.389 --> 04:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
since been vetted and
 
04:28:12.070 --> 04:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
that you don't have a local official
 
04:28:14.149 --> 04:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
creating code that has not been adopted
 
04:28:16.870 --> 04:28:16.880 align:start position:0%
by any sort of legislative body
 
04:28:18.950 --> 04:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
was there a second madam chair
 
04:28:21.349 --> 04:28:21.359 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes seconded
 
04:28:23.750 --> 04:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your second
 
04:28:26.229 --> 04:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
representative pearson covered it okay
 
04:28:28.550 --> 04:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh representative pearson i have a
 
04:28:30.630 --> 04:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
a small complaint
 
04:28:33.030 --> 04:28:33.040 align:start position:0%
about this amendment it doesn't include
 
04:28:33.040 --> 04:28:34.710 align:start position:0%
about this amendment it doesn't include
the

04:28:34.710 --> 04:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:28:37.269 --> 04:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
uh requirement that the legislative
 
04:28:39.429 --> 04:28:39.439 align:start position:0%
history be provided to the building code
 
04:28:42.710 --> 04:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
board prior to enforcement which was
 
04:28:49.349 --> 04:28:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:51.750 --> 04:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
say that again
 
04:28:54.309 --> 04:28:54.319 align:start position:0%
the amendment that
 
04:28:57.510 --> 04:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
i drafted and you made this correction
 
04:28:59.429 --> 04:28:59.439 align:start position:0%
to the fight to the when we were
 
04:29:01.750 --> 04:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
trying to incorporate the fire code was
 
04:29:03.510 --> 04:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
primarily done
 
04:29:06.710 --> 04:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
to have a requirement that the
 
04:29:09.349 --> 04:29:09.359 align:start position:0%
legislative history of a local building
 
04:29:11.750 --> 04:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
code change be submitted prior to
 
04:29:11.760 --> 04:29:13.429 align:start position:0%
code change be submitted prior to
enforcement

04:29:13.429 --> 04:29:13.439 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
04:29:14.469 --> 04:29:14.479 align:start position:0%
so there's
 
04:29:16.389 --> 04:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
it's at the end of section four there
 
04:29:17.269 --> 04:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
was a
 
04:29:19.189 --> 04:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
a new clause
 
04:29:19.199 --> 04:29:20.309 align:start position:0%
a new clause
and

04:29:20.309 --> 04:29:20.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:29:22.149 --> 04:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
this doesn't do that
 
04:29:25.110 --> 04:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
the the one i got from you
 
04:29:26.870 --> 04:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
in red was just
 
04:29:29.990 --> 04:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
inserting areas of
 
04:29:32.070 --> 04:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
of the fire code after the building code
 
04:29:33.830 --> 04:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
and the fire marshal can speak to why
 
04:29:56.070 --> 04:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:58.149 --> 04:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
that was very important for the building
 
04:30:01.030 --> 04:30:01.040 align:start position:0%
code and that's why we started with that
 
04:30:09.030 --> 04:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:12.149 --> 04:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:14.309 --> 04:30:14.319 align:start position:0%
representative lekkis
 
04:30:16.630 --> 04:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
thank you so this may be
 
04:30:18.950 --> 04:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
related but um
 
04:30:20.550 --> 04:30:20.560 align:start position:0%
in the original bill for the building
 
04:30:22.790 --> 04:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
code there's various things you know
 
04:30:22.800 --> 04:30:24.229 align:start position:0%
code there's various things you know
requiring

04:30:24.229 --> 04:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
requiring
 
04:30:26.950 --> 04:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
um when things need to be provided to
 
04:30:29.510 --> 04:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
the billing code review board but also
 
04:30:31.750 --> 04:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
timelines on when they have to respond
 
04:30:33.189 --> 04:30:33.199 align:start position:0%
what happens
 
04:30:36.229 --> 04:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
if they don't respond in time
 
04:30:36.239 --> 04:30:36.830 align:start position:0%
if they don't respond in time
and

04:30:36.830 --> 04:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:30:36.840 --> 04:30:38.229 align:start position:0%
and
[Music]

04:30:38.229 --> 04:30:38.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:30:40.630 --> 04:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
under what circumstances the municipal
 
04:30:43.429 --> 04:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
code can be enforced and i don't see
 
04:30:45.189 --> 04:30:45.199 align:start position:0%
any of that detail in the amendment with
 
04:30:50.630 --> 04:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:52.309 --> 04:30:52.319 align:start position:0%
uh perhaps we should let the
 
04:30:59.670 --> 04:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:04.710 --> 04:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:06.550 --> 04:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
good afternoon sean toomey the state
 
04:31:09.189 --> 04:31:09.199 align:start position:0%
fire marshal for the record um so i know
 
04:31:11.030 --> 04:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
we've been working on this the last i
 
04:31:11.040 --> 04:31:11.910 align:start position:0%
we've been working on this the last i
think

04:31:11.910 --> 04:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:31:14.149 --> 04:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
almost 24 hours so i apologize if
 
04:31:16.710 --> 04:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
there's any uh clunkiness to the process
 
04:31:16.720 --> 04:31:17.429 align:start position:0%
there's any uh clunkiness to the process
but

04:31:17.429 --> 04:31:17.439 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:31:19.830 --> 04:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
the original uh bill that was presented
 
04:31:21.750 --> 04:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
in the senate had some language on the
 
04:31:23.750 --> 04:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
fire code and a lot of language on the
 
04:31:24.950 --> 04:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
building code
 
04:31:24.960 --> 04:31:26.070 align:start position:0%
building code
and

04:31:26.070 --> 04:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:31:28.469 --> 04:31:28.479 align:start position:0%
when we presented
 
04:31:30.389 --> 04:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
the building code side and the fire code
 
04:31:30.399 --> 04:31:31.189 align:start position:0%
the building code side and the fire code
side

04:31:31.189 --> 04:31:31.199 align:start position:0%
side
 
04:31:33.830 --> 04:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
had some complications on the process
 
04:31:33.840 --> 04:31:34.630 align:start position:0%
had some complications on the process
and

04:31:34.630 --> 04:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:31:36.710 --> 04:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
we all work together to try to come up
 
04:31:38.469 --> 04:31:38.479 align:start position:0%
with something for some reason the fire
 
04:31:40.630 --> 04:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
code side fell off altogether and the
 
04:31:42.950 --> 04:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
building code process got
 
04:31:44.550 --> 04:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
very specific on timelines and things
 
04:31:46.469 --> 04:31:46.479 align:start position:0%
like that representative pearson reached
 
04:31:47.429 --> 04:31:47.439 align:start position:0%
out to me
 
04:31:49.830 --> 04:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
again yesterday and said you know can we
 
04:31:52.469 --> 04:31:52.479 align:start position:0%
put the fire code stuff back in and i
 
04:31:54.630 --> 04:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
said sure what we need to really do is
 
04:31:57.670 --> 04:31:57.680 align:start position:0%
make sure that uh the reviews would come
 
04:32:00.229 --> 04:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
to the fire marshal's office and make
 
04:32:01.910 --> 04:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
sure that it had been properly vetted
 
04:32:04.229 --> 04:32:04.239 align:start position:0%
through the local legislative process
 
04:32:05.910 --> 04:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
that it wasn't the intent is though it's
 
04:32:07.429 --> 04:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
not made up by the local inspector or
 
04:32:10.309 --> 04:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
the local fire chief um that it doesn't
 
04:32:11.830 --> 04:32:11.840 align:start position:0%
conflict with the state fire code or
 
04:32:13.910 --> 04:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
lessen the state fire code and that we
 
04:32:16.309 --> 04:32:16.319 align:start position:0%
provide a publishing on our website so
 
04:32:17.750 --> 04:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
that it was available to everyone so
 
04:32:19.670 --> 04:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
that one of the concerns that we find is
 
04:32:21.189 --> 04:32:21.199 align:start position:0%
that it's sometimes difficult to find
 
04:32:23.750 --> 04:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
local amendments um all you know all
 
04:32:25.429 --> 04:32:25.439 align:start position:0%
over the state so we would have a link
 
04:32:27.349 --> 04:32:27.359 align:start position:0%
from our website somakodu state fire
 
04:32:29.189 --> 04:32:29.199 align:start position:0%
code here's the statewide amendments
 
04:32:30.389 --> 04:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
here's the local amendments and then
 
04:32:32.149 --> 04:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
they could follow it off
 
04:32:32.159 --> 04:32:33.349 align:start position:0%
they could follow it off
properly

04:32:33.349 --> 04:32:33.359 align:start position:0%
properly
 
04:32:36.149 --> 04:32:36.159 align:start position:0%
i think that the i just found the the
 
04:32:37.990 --> 04:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
draft amendment that uh representative
 
04:32:41.110 --> 04:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
maguire put together uh yesterday uh it
 
04:32:42.630 --> 04:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
talks about the procedural history of
 
04:32:44.950 --> 04:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
local adoption relating to relating to
 
04:32:46.469 --> 04:32:46.479 align:start position:0%
the published notice public hearing and
 
04:32:47.990 --> 04:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
vote of approval shall be submitted to
 
04:32:50.070 --> 04:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
the board within 30 days of an enactment
 
04:32:52.469 --> 04:32:52.479 align:start position:0%
or adoption and prior to enforcement i
 
04:32:54.070 --> 04:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
have no issue with that being added in
 
04:32:55.510 --> 04:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
procedurally if you guys
 
04:32:57.189 --> 04:32:57.199 align:start position:0%
feel necessary to do that i can
 
04:32:59.189 --> 04:32:59.199 align:start position:0%
definitely support that
 
04:33:01.030 --> 04:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
one of the things that
 
04:33:02.950 --> 04:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
the board of fire control
 
04:33:02.960 --> 04:33:03.990 align:start position:0%
the board of fire control
uh

04:33:03.990 --> 04:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:33:05.510 --> 04:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
was the original thought was the board
 
04:33:07.189 --> 04:33:07.199 align:start position:0%
of fire control would hear
 
04:33:09.349 --> 04:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
the or receive sorry receive the
 
04:33:10.789 --> 04:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
amendments at the local level on the
 
04:33:12.629 --> 04:33:12.639 align:start position:0%
fire code issues the problem is that
 
04:33:14.551 --> 04:33:14.561 align:start position:0%
board meets quarterly and we don't want
 
04:33:16.789 --> 04:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
to slow down the process for the locals
 
04:33:18.230 --> 04:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
the building code review board meets
 
04:33:21.269 --> 04:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
monthly um so the thought is that if it
 
04:33:23.109 --> 04:33:23.119 align:start position:0%
came directly to the me as the fire
 
04:33:25.109 --> 04:33:25.119 align:start position:0%
marshal that we could just do a quick
 
04:33:27.109 --> 04:33:27.119 align:start position:0%
administrative review and keep the
 
04:33:29.029 --> 04:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
process going that's i guess that's why
 
04:33:30.390 --> 04:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
we didn't go with the very strict
 
04:33:33.269 --> 04:33:33.279 align:start position:0%
timelines um as is in the board of fire
 
04:33:34.551 --> 04:33:34.561 align:start position:0%
control because this was more of
 
04:33:37.510 --> 04:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
administrative review within the office
 
04:33:39.349 --> 04:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to answer any questions or
 
04:33:41.830 --> 04:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
providing more additional information
 
04:33:44.150 --> 04:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
04:33:46.629 --> 04:33:46.639 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i i can
 
04:33:49.910 --> 04:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
understand the the purpose for having
 
04:33:52.470 --> 04:33:52.480 align:start position:0%
you your office review a proposed
 
04:33:54.629 --> 04:33:54.639 align:start position:0%
amendment so that it doesn't conflict
 
04:33:57.590 --> 04:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
and all that sort of thing i i do not
 
04:33:57.600 --> 04:33:59.510 align:start position:0%
and all that sort of thing i i do not
understand

04:33:59.510 --> 04:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
understand
 
04:34:03.590 --> 04:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
the value of having local
 
04:34:06.470 --> 04:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
um ordinances
 
04:34:06.480 --> 04:34:07.910 align:start position:0%
um ordinances
on

04:34:07.910 --> 04:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:34:10.230 --> 04:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
your website i think it's
 
04:34:12.070 --> 04:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
it seems to me like a lot of
 
04:34:14.789 --> 04:34:14.799 align:start position:0%
administrative back and forth
 
04:34:17.590 --> 04:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
anybody who's going to be doing any kind
 
04:34:20.150 --> 04:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
of building or renovation
 
04:34:22.551 --> 04:34:22.561 align:start position:0%
to a property is going to go to the
 
04:34:22.561 --> 04:34:23.590 align:start position:0%
to a property is going to go to the
local

04:34:23.590 --> 04:34:23.600 align:start position:0%
local
 
04:34:26.470 --> 04:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
office to get their building permit and
 
04:34:26.480 --> 04:34:27.269 align:start position:0%
office to get their building permit and
should

04:34:27.269 --> 04:34:27.279 align:start position:0%
should
 
04:34:29.510 --> 04:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
not have a problem finding
 
04:34:32.869 --> 04:34:32.879 align:start position:0%
the appropriate amendments
 
04:34:32.879 --> 04:34:33.670 align:start position:0%
the appropriate amendments
so

04:34:33.670 --> 04:34:33.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:34:35.750 --> 04:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
can you respond to that
 
04:34:37.269 --> 04:34:37.279 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you so one of the
 
04:34:38.709 --> 04:34:38.719 align:start position:0%
things that we've learned over the last
 
04:34:40.869 --> 04:34:40.879 align:start position:0%
couple years is that the design
 
04:34:42.310 --> 04:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
professionals and the contractors are
 
04:34:44.230 --> 04:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
having trouble finding that information
 
04:34:44.240 --> 04:34:45.109 align:start position:0%
having trouble finding that information
so

04:34:45.109 --> 04:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:34:47.590 --> 04:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
we have we have the state building code
 
04:34:49.349 --> 04:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
and the state fire code information on
 
04:34:50.789 --> 04:34:50.799 align:start position:0%
this department of safety and the state
 
04:34:53.029 --> 04:34:53.039 align:start position:0%
fire marshal's office website and we
 
04:34:54.470 --> 04:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
just want to make it easier for the
 
04:34:56.310 --> 04:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
design professionals and contractors and
 
04:34:58.629 --> 04:34:58.639 align:start position:0%
anyone for that matter that sort of a
 
04:35:01.189 --> 04:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
one-stop shop so they can it's it may
 
04:35:02.470 --> 04:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
simply be a link to the city of
 
04:35:05.109 --> 04:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
manchester or dover or the town of
 
04:35:05.119 --> 04:35:06.310 align:start position:0%
manchester or dover or the town of
um

04:35:06.310 --> 04:35:06.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:07.830 --> 04:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
you know whatever town it happens to be
 
04:35:10.230 --> 04:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
pittsburgh um you know so that it's just
 
04:35:12.390 --> 04:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
a it's a it's based on feedback we've
 
04:35:14.551 --> 04:35:14.561 align:start position:0%
received from the industry in an attempt
 
04:35:18.869 --> 04:35:18.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:20.150 --> 04:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
yes it's
 
04:35:22.390 --> 04:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
the the thing is that
 
04:35:25.269 --> 04:35:25.279 align:start position:0%
many times the local ordinances are not
 
04:35:28.310 --> 04:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
quite as easy to find as one would hope
 
04:35:29.429 --> 04:35:29.439 align:start position:0%
they would be
 
04:35:31.830 --> 04:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
and the other issue is that
 
04:35:33.349 --> 04:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
in many cases
 
04:35:35.750 --> 04:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
the that i've heard the ordinances are
 
04:35:38.310 --> 04:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
not actually officially adopted
 
04:35:38.320 --> 04:35:39.029 align:start position:0%
not actually officially adopted
the

04:35:39.029 --> 04:35:39.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:35:41.269 --> 04:35:41.279 align:start position:0%
inspector just says oh well in in
 
04:35:43.109 --> 04:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
bedford we do it this way and therefore
 
04:35:45.029 --> 04:35:45.039 align:start position:0%
you must do it that way or you won't get
 
04:35:47.349 --> 04:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
your certificate of occupancy
 
04:35:51.269 --> 04:35:51.279 align:start position:0%
and so by having the
 
04:35:52.629 --> 04:35:52.639 align:start position:0%
the the
 
04:35:55.269 --> 04:35:55.279 align:start position:0%
the local amendments
 
04:35:55.279 --> 04:35:56.390 align:start position:0%
the local amendments
available

04:35:56.390 --> 04:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
available
 
04:35:58.949 --> 04:35:58.959 align:start position:0%
the homeowner or whomever can say
 
04:36:01.029 --> 04:36:01.039 align:start position:0%
to the inspector well
 
04:36:03.269 --> 04:36:03.279 align:start position:0%
i don't see that requirement in your
 
04:36:05.189 --> 04:36:05.199 align:start position:0%
local ordinance
 
04:36:05.199 --> 04:36:06.070 align:start position:0%
local ordinance
and

04:36:06.070 --> 04:36:06.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:36:08.949 --> 04:36:08.959 align:start position:0%
it'll be more effective to uh to settle
 
04:36:13.990 --> 04:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:18.150 --> 04:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:20.869 --> 04:36:20.879 align:start position:0%
so i i'm still having a hard time
 
04:36:22.470 --> 04:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
understanding why somebody who's going
 
04:36:24.470 --> 04:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
to do construction
 
04:36:26.070 --> 04:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
to a building
 
04:36:29.349 --> 04:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
can't find the local ordinance
 
04:36:29.359 --> 04:36:30.869 align:start position:0%
can't find the local ordinance
and

04:36:30.869 --> 04:36:30.879 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:36:33.269 --> 04:36:33.279 align:start position:0%
i'm just concerned about you get
 
04:36:35.510 --> 04:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
something in two places and they're not
 
04:36:38.949 --> 04:36:38.959 align:start position:0%
necessarily the same thing anymore
 
04:36:38.959 --> 04:36:40.150 align:start position:0%
necessarily the same thing anymore
and

04:36:40.150 --> 04:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:36:40.160 --> 04:36:40.789 align:start position:0%
and
i

04:36:40.789 --> 04:36:40.799 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:36:43.429 --> 04:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
do you have individuals that complain
 
04:36:45.349 --> 04:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
that they can't find the local ordinance
 
04:36:47.109 --> 04:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
or is this something
 
04:36:51.189 --> 04:36:51.199 align:start position:0%
that you hear only from contractors
 
04:36:53.269 --> 04:36:53.279 align:start position:0%
i think the concern about it being in
 
04:36:55.429 --> 04:36:55.439 align:start position:0%
two spots is valid and hopefully we can
 
04:36:57.510 --> 04:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
work to alleviate as much of that as
 
04:36:59.269 --> 04:36:59.279 align:start position:0%
possible i'm sure it won't be
 
04:37:02.709 --> 04:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
perfect um it's we hear it a lot like so
 
04:37:03.830 --> 04:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
this especially in the smaller
 
04:37:05.429 --> 04:37:05.439 align:start position:0%
communities that don't have a lot of
 
04:37:06.709 --> 04:37:06.719 align:start position:0%
them don't have code enforcement better
 
04:37:08.949 --> 04:37:08.959 align:start position:0%
than roughly 50 percent of the state
 
04:37:10.390 --> 04:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
um is what we've been told have no
 
04:37:12.310 --> 04:37:12.320 align:start position:0%
building officials so it's very
 
04:37:13.910 --> 04:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
difficult for someone to go into the
 
04:37:16.869 --> 04:37:16.879 align:start position:0%
city hall town hall and ask for for the
 
04:37:18.230 --> 04:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
information when they don't even have
 
04:37:19.990 --> 04:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
that official building a court official
 
04:37:21.990 --> 04:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't even exist so it's on the
 
04:37:24.869 --> 04:37:24.879 align:start position:0%
contractor to build it properly um
 
04:37:26.470 --> 04:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
but there may be some ordinance buried
 
04:37:26.480 --> 04:37:27.910 align:start position:0%
but there may be some ordinance buried
somewhere

04:37:27.910 --> 04:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
04:37:30.150 --> 04:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
the question is frequent um and it comes
 
04:37:32.709 --> 04:37:32.719 align:start position:0%
from the contracting world and and the
 
04:37:34.310 --> 04:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
design professional world it's something
 
04:37:35.590 --> 04:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
that through some of the study
 
04:37:36.789 --> 04:37:36.799 align:start position:0%
committees that we've had over the last
 
04:37:38.470 --> 04:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
couple years trying to improve the code
 
04:37:40.789 --> 04:37:40.799 align:start position:0%
process we continually hear
 
04:37:42.150 --> 04:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
that this is a challenge and we're just
 
04:37:45.590 --> 04:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out a solution to to
 
04:37:47.910 --> 04:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
minimize the the obstacles i guess for
 
04:37:49.670 --> 04:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
lack of a better word for the people
 
04:37:53.910 --> 04:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:55.269 --> 04:37:55.279 align:start position:0%
madam chair can i expand on that just a
 
04:37:57.670 --> 04:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
little bit yes um representative fellows
 
04:38:00.869 --> 04:38:00.879 align:start position:0%
if you look at both um lines 28 through
 
04:38:05.109 --> 04:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
31 in the original bill and
 
04:38:10.709 --> 04:38:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:13.189 --> 04:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
and also
 
04:38:17.750 --> 04:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:20.070 --> 04:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
so those are those are building codes
 
04:38:21.830 --> 04:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
which is where i
 
04:38:21.840 --> 04:38:23.029 align:start position:0%
which is where i
developed

04:38:23.029 --> 04:38:23.039 align:start position:0%
developed
 
04:38:23.039 --> 04:38:24.709 align:start position:0%
developed
my

04:38:24.709 --> 04:38:24.719 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:38:28.629 --> 04:38:28.639 align:start position:0%
my point that this is very convoluted
 
04:38:30.709 --> 04:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
back and forth and you know i didn't ask
 
04:38:32.789 --> 04:38:32.799 align:start position:0%
you this question because this says
 
04:38:36.150 --> 04:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
building code but the notion that first
 
04:38:39.109 --> 04:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
first you send a a proposed amendment in
 
04:38:41.189 --> 04:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
for an advisory
 
04:38:42.709 --> 04:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:38:42.719 --> 04:38:44.869 align:start position:0%
you know
evaluation

04:38:44.869 --> 04:38:44.879 align:start position:0%
evaluation
 
04:38:46.709 --> 04:38:46.719 align:start position:0%
advisory opinion
 
04:38:48.230 --> 04:38:48.240 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:38:51.029 --> 04:38:51.039 align:start position:0%
assuming they they say it's okay you
 
04:38:53.029 --> 04:38:53.039 align:start position:0%
have to send it back again
 
04:38:53.039 --> 04:38:54.470 align:start position:0%
have to send it back again
before

04:38:54.470 --> 04:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:38:56.789 --> 04:38:56.799 align:start position:0%
before you i don't even know it's so
 
04:38:59.189 --> 04:38:59.199 align:start position:0%
many back and forth that's the problem
 
04:38:59.199 --> 04:38:59.910 align:start position:0%
many back and forth that's the problem
so

04:38:59.910 --> 04:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:39:02.230 --> 04:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
there will so as far as as far as the
 
04:39:03.910 --> 04:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
the publishing and the referencing that
 
04:39:05.590 --> 04:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
the in particular the fire code that the
 
04:39:06.949 --> 04:39:06.959 align:start position:0%
city fire marshals would have there
 
04:39:09.349 --> 04:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
would be no surprises because the local
 
04:39:09.359 --> 04:39:10.470 align:start position:0%
would be no surprises because the local
amendments

04:39:10.470 --> 04:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
04:39:12.709 --> 04:39:12.719 align:start position:0%
their office has to see
 
04:39:15.590 --> 04:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
so the local community cannot just
 
04:39:17.590 --> 04:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
would not enact a local ordinance
 
04:39:20.470 --> 04:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
without them knowing about it
 
04:39:22.390 --> 04:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
and that would keep
 
04:39:24.230 --> 04:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
whether they whether they use just
 
04:39:26.789 --> 04:39:26.799 align:start position:0%
referencing like a hyperlink or whatever
 
04:39:28.869 --> 04:39:28.879 align:start position:0%
in reference to that or if they
 
04:39:31.670 --> 04:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
specifically outline it in some manner
 
04:39:33.510 --> 04:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
there's never there shouldn't be a
 
04:39:35.029 --> 04:39:35.039 align:start position:0%
situation where a local community
 
04:39:35.039 --> 04:39:36.230 align:start position:0%
situation where a local community
adopted

04:39:36.230 --> 04:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
adopted
 
04:39:38.150 --> 04:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
a local fire code ordinance without them
 
04:39:40.310 --> 04:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
knowing about it
 
04:39:40.320 --> 04:39:42.150 align:start position:0%
knowing about it
yes

04:39:42.150 --> 04:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:39:44.150 --> 04:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
well they can submit something for for
 
04:39:46.310 --> 04:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
an advisory opinion they can
 
04:39:48.310 --> 04:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
they can bring it to the people and the
 
04:39:50.550 --> 04:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
people might say no or the people might
 
04:39:51.750 --> 04:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
say yes
 
04:39:51.760 --> 04:39:53.270 align:start position:0%
say yes
so

04:39:53.270 --> 04:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:39:55.110 --> 04:39:55.120 align:start position:0%
that's why there is
 
04:39:57.510 --> 04:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
a two-step process because you want to
 
04:39:59.910 --> 04:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that what the people
 
04:40:03.110 --> 04:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
consider and vote on is technically
 
04:40:03.120 --> 04:40:04.470 align:start position:0%
consider and vote on is technically
accurate

04:40:04.470 --> 04:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
04:40:04.480 --> 04:40:05.270 align:start position:0%
accurate
that

04:40:05.270 --> 04:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:40:05.280 --> 04:40:06.390 align:start position:0%
that
right

04:40:06.390 --> 04:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:40:09.110 --> 04:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
but the part the part that i'm
 
04:40:10.708 --> 04:40:10.718 align:start position:0%
i don't like
 
04:40:13.830 --> 04:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
is the idea that it has to reside with
 
04:40:15.750 --> 04:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:40:17.830 --> 04:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's the part that that i don't
 
04:40:20.868 --> 04:40:20.878 align:start position:0%
like the approval i have absolutely i'm
 
04:40:23.350 --> 04:40:23.360 align:start position:0%
fine with that but that it has to be
 
04:40:25.430 --> 04:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
stored by the state the other thing i
 
04:40:27.830 --> 04:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
did and i was nothing to do with fire
 
04:40:29.990 --> 04:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
codes i didn't look at those i did look
 
04:40:31.830 --> 04:40:31.840 align:start position:0%
at building codes
 
04:40:33.750 --> 04:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
so i went to
 
04:40:35.670 --> 04:40:35.680 align:start position:0%
i had to google it i didn't know it was
 
04:40:38.070 --> 04:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
under safety but that's where it is and
 
04:40:39.350 --> 04:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
i can see
 
04:40:41.670 --> 04:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
the international building codes you
 
04:40:43.510 --> 04:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
know for buildings for residential
 
04:40:45.350 --> 04:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
plumbing blah blah blah so i looked at
 
04:40:47.350 --> 04:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
the residential ones
 
04:40:49.990 --> 04:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
and as a person
 
04:40:52.470 --> 04:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
who i'm not going to be doing any like
 
04:40:54.868 --> 04:40:54.878 align:start position:0%
additions to my property but some people
 
04:40:54.878 --> 04:40:55.830 align:start position:0%
additions to my property but some people
might

04:40:55.830 --> 04:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
might
 
04:40:57.670 --> 04:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
you can see
 
04:41:01.510 --> 04:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
those building codes you cannot copy and
 
04:41:04.868 --> 04:41:04.878 align:start position:0%
like paste them they're copyrighted yes
 
04:41:04.878 --> 04:41:06.070 align:start position:0%
like paste them they're copyrighted yes
so

04:41:06.070 --> 04:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:41:10.230 --> 04:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
i i don't you know if you want to if
 
04:41:12.150 --> 04:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
if the state wants to do something if
 
04:41:13.350 --> 04:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
you're going to if you're going to make
 
04:41:15.750 --> 04:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
them put the ordinances there it ought
 
04:41:18.390 --> 04:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
to be user friendly which it's not if
 
04:41:20.470 --> 04:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
you can't you know you got to scroll
 
04:41:22.390 --> 04:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
down this thing you can't search it you
 
04:41:25.270 --> 04:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
can't copy and paste it well that's
 
04:41:28.310 --> 04:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
so okay so i have many several beefs
 
04:41:30.070 --> 04:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
well that's fine but the
 
04:41:32.070 --> 04:41:32.080 align:start position:0%
to be honest there are very few
 
04:41:33.750 --> 04:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
communities in the state that are
 
04:41:36.708 --> 04:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
actually going to make local ordinances
 
04:41:38.708 --> 04:41:38.718 align:start position:0%
and changes to the state building code
 
04:41:40.390 --> 04:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
or the state buyer code
 
04:41:42.550 --> 04:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
there are very few and it's primarily
 
04:41:44.310 --> 04:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
going to be the cities
 
04:41:46.550 --> 04:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
holderness i'm pretty sure does not have
 
04:41:46.560 --> 04:41:47.830 align:start position:0%
holderness i'm pretty sure does not have
any

04:41:47.830 --> 04:41:47.840 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:41:49.830 --> 04:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
town specific ordinances and i know
 
04:41:52.230 --> 04:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
epsom doesn't
 
04:41:54.550 --> 04:41:54.560 align:start position:0%
wilderness does not i'm not a hundred
 
04:41:56.788 --> 04:41:56.798 align:start position:0%
percent sure about plymouth plymouth
 
04:41:56.798 --> 04:41:57.670 align:start position:0%
percent sure about plymouth plymouth
mike

04:41:57.670 --> 04:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
mike
 
04:42:00.230 --> 04:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
representative schmidt
 
04:42:03.830 --> 04:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman uh uh so it was
 
04:42:06.310 --> 04:42:06.320 align:start position:0%
brought up in a previous meeting of the
 
04:42:06.320 --> 04:42:07.750 align:start position:0%
brought up in a previous meeting of the
committee

04:42:07.750 --> 04:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:42:11.430 --> 04:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
and i spoke with mr rancourt
 
04:42:13.270 --> 04:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
about a statement that was made i
 
04:42:15.190 --> 04:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
believe by him with regard to the fact
 
04:42:15.200 --> 04:42:15.990 align:start position:0%
believe by him with regard to the fact
that

04:42:15.990 --> 04:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:42:18.070 --> 04:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
certain size towns
 
04:42:20.550 --> 04:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
cannot make any change to the
 
04:42:22.948 --> 04:42:22.958 align:start position:0%
to the building code anyway correct
 
04:42:24.310 --> 04:42:24.320 align:start position:0%
could that be restated for the
 
04:42:27.350 --> 04:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
committee's benefit in mind
 
04:42:29.590 --> 04:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
i believe that if a town does not have
 
04:42:32.070 --> 04:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
code enforcement it cannot make changes
 
04:42:34.230 --> 04:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
to the state building code is that what
 
04:42:37.030 --> 04:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
you you said mr reincard yeah which
 
04:42:39.510 --> 04:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
makes perfect sense exactly it does make
 
04:42:41.510 --> 04:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
perfect sense and approximately
 
04:42:43.190 --> 04:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
approximately two thirds important for
 
04:42:45.110 --> 04:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
everybody to realize that all those
 
04:42:47.430 --> 04:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
towns are out of the fight so to speak
 
04:42:50.470 --> 04:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
with regard to making changes
 
04:42:53.110 --> 04:42:53.120 align:start position:0%
yes and that's why i'm sure that that my
 
04:42:54.948 --> 04:42:54.958 align:start position:0%
town does not have any local building
 
04:42:56.470 --> 04:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
code changes so we don't have a code
 
04:42:58.628 --> 04:42:58.638 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer
 
04:43:00.708 --> 04:43:00.718 align:start position:0%
the city of dover might well either you
 
04:43:07.110 --> 04:43:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:09.270 --> 04:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
okay very good
 
04:43:11.990 --> 04:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
so you so you might have specific
 
04:43:14.230 --> 04:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
city-specific building code amendments
 
04:43:16.150 --> 04:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
that you want to
 
04:43:20.390 --> 04:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:22.150 --> 04:43:22.160 align:start position:0%
what's that
 
04:43:22.160 --> 04:43:22.868 align:start position:0%
what's that
and

04:43:22.868 --> 04:43:22.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:43:24.948 --> 04:43:24.958 align:start position:0%
and for the benefit of the peop
 
04:43:27.030 --> 04:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
this is such a small state that that
 
04:43:27.040 --> 04:43:28.070 align:start position:0%
this is such a small state that that
people

04:43:28.070 --> 04:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:43:30.390 --> 04:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
who are located in portsmouth are also
 
04:43:32.470 --> 04:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
likely to be working in rochester and
 
04:43:32.480 --> 04:43:33.510 align:start position:0%
likely to be working in rochester and
dover

04:43:33.510 --> 04:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
dover
 
04:43:35.590 --> 04:43:35.600 align:start position:0%
and probably manchester and derry as
 
04:43:35.600 --> 04:43:38.628 align:start position:0%
and probably manchester and derry as
well

04:43:38.628 --> 04:43:38.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:40.470 --> 04:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
anyway most of the population of this
 
04:43:43.590 --> 04:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
state is in the bottom 25 miles
 
04:43:45.110 --> 04:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
above the
 
04:43:47.350 --> 04:43:47.360 align:start position:0%
the massachusetts border
 
04:43:50.070 --> 04:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
exactly all right any other comments or
 
04:43:50.080 --> 04:43:52.390 align:start position:0%
exactly all right any other comments or
concerns

04:43:52.390 --> 04:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
04:43:54.070 --> 04:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
any questions for the fire marshal while
 
04:43:56.150 --> 04:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
we're here
 
04:43:57.510 --> 04:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:43:57.520 --> 04:44:00.708 align:start position:0%
all right
um

04:44:00.708 --> 04:44:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:03.110 --> 04:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
so i've submitted i've submitted to ols
 
04:44:05.590 --> 04:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
your request for that
 
04:44:05.600 --> 04:44:07.270 align:start position:0%
your request for that
inadvertent

04:44:07.270 --> 04:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
inadvertent
 
04:44:09.830 --> 04:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
leaving out on the part of page two
 
04:44:12.230 --> 04:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
section four that's something that's so
 
04:44:12.240 --> 04:44:13.270 align:start position:0%
section four that's something that's so
the

04:44:13.270 --> 04:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:44:15.190 --> 04:44:15.200 align:start position:0%
ols is going to rewrite this amendment
 
04:44:17.510 --> 04:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
to include that
 
04:44:18.868 --> 04:44:18.878 align:start position:0%
at the bottom the rest of it will stay
 
04:44:20.550 --> 04:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
the same that's why we the the
 
04:44:23.430 --> 04:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
discussion continued so all right so
 
04:44:24.470 --> 04:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
we'll just have to we'll have to wait
 
04:44:26.150 --> 04:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
for all this to so you're talking about
 
04:44:27.670 --> 04:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
they're going to rewrite this with just
 
04:44:29.910 --> 04:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
like those extra four words at the
 
04:44:32.470 --> 04:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
bottom of section four yep line
 
04:44:34.230 --> 04:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
twenty-eight i'm still going to be not
 
04:44:36.628 --> 04:44:36.638 align:start position:0%
supporting okay thank you i can accept
 
04:44:36.638 --> 04:44:37.590 align:start position:0%
supporting okay thank you i can accept
that

04:44:37.590 --> 04:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:44:39.510 --> 04:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
representative goalie
 
04:44:41.910 --> 04:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just one quick
 
04:44:43.910 --> 04:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
question and i'm not sure whether
 
04:44:46.310 --> 04:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
this can be done or not where
 
04:44:48.230 --> 04:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
each amendment deals with
 
04:44:49.590 --> 04:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
different sections of the bill can we
 
04:44:50.868 --> 04:44:50.878 align:start position:0%
not adopt
 
04:44:52.948 --> 04:44:52.958 align:start position:0%
both amendments
 
04:44:54.470 --> 04:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
without having to have them made into
 
04:44:54.480 --> 04:44:55.430 align:start position:0%
without having to have them made into
one

04:44:55.430 --> 04:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:44:58.150 --> 04:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
they've got to make one anyway for that
 
04:45:00.550 --> 04:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
so i just had them just add it to this
 
04:45:02.550 --> 04:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
so just one stop shopping i guess it's
 
04:45:03.910 --> 04:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
they gotta they've got it drafted anyway
 
04:45:05.350 --> 04:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
in some way they would have to come up
 
04:45:07.350 --> 04:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
with an amendment to do that because i
 
04:45:07.360 --> 04:45:09.110 align:start position:0%
with an amendment to do that because i
haven't

04:45:09.110 --> 04:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
haven't
 
04:45:10.868 --> 04:45:10.878 align:start position:0%
i asked for one and then we changed what
 
04:45:12.470 --> 04:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
we wanted so
 
04:45:12.480 --> 04:45:13.590 align:start position:0%
we wanted so
um

04:45:13.590 --> 04:45:13.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:13.600 --> 04:45:14.708 align:start position:0%
um
okay

04:45:14.708 --> 04:45:14.718 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:45:16.230 --> 04:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
we're gonna need a different amount
 
04:45:18.070 --> 04:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
looking in time concerns as to whether
 
04:45:20.070 --> 04:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
or not they'd have this done quickly or
 
04:45:21.430 --> 04:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
not and
 
04:45:25.910 --> 04:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:27.750 --> 04:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative pearson expressed the
 
04:45:30.310 --> 04:45:30.320 align:start position:0%
urge i expressed the urgency in in it
 
04:45:33.270 --> 04:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you okay
 
04:45:35.350 --> 04:45:35.360 align:start position:0%
is there any other discussion or debate
 
04:45:35.360 --> 04:45:36.310 align:start position:0%
is there any other discussion or debate
on

04:45:36.310 --> 04:45:36.320 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:45:37.670 --> 04:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
04:45:39.750 --> 04:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
presuming that we will get the final
 
04:45:43.830 --> 04:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:46.070 --> 04:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative lepis thank you i'm not
 
04:45:47.990 --> 04:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
quite sure exactly what that additional
 
04:45:50.708 --> 04:45:50.718 align:start position:0%
line will be it's at the at the end of
 
04:45:53.190 --> 04:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
section four
 
04:45:58.628 --> 04:45:58.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:01.430 --> 04:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
well 28 just says or adoption but right
 
04:46:04.070 --> 04:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
you replace the period with a comma and
 
04:46:11.910 --> 04:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:14.628 --> 04:46:14.638 align:start position:0%
oh so the change will be on that section
 
04:46:16.788 --> 04:46:16.798 align:start position:0%
yes not the amendment
 
04:46:18.628 --> 04:46:18.638 align:start position:0%
okay no the
 
04:46:20.868 --> 04:46:20.878 align:start position:0%
the amendment from representative pearce
 
04:46:23.110 --> 04:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
starts after that
 
04:46:25.030 --> 04:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
i'm sure they'll figure out a way to
 
04:46:27.110 --> 04:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
make it as confusing as possible
 
04:46:29.910 --> 04:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
so so the amendment
 
04:46:31.430 --> 04:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
this part of the amendment the existing
 
04:46:33.270 --> 04:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
amendment we're not expecting to change
 
04:46:35.910 --> 04:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
at all just add to it okay thank you
 
04:46:35.920 --> 04:46:37.510 align:start position:0%
at all just add to it okay thank you
okay

04:46:37.510 --> 04:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:46:44.470 --> 04:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:46.470 --> 04:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
i think procedurally we'll have to
 
04:46:46.480 --> 04:46:47.510 align:start position:0%
i think procedurally we'll have to
withdraw

04:46:47.510 --> 04:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
withdraw
 
04:46:51.670 --> 04:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:54.390 --> 04:46:54.400 align:start position:0%
okay sorry jackie
 
04:46:56.310 --> 04:46:56.320 align:start position:0%
i trust you've got plenty of forms this
 
04:46:58.788 --> 04:46:58.798 align:start position:0%
is where this is being coming well i
 
04:46:59.990 --> 04:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
don't even know
 
04:47:01.830 --> 04:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
okay fine hang
 
04:47:03.670 --> 04:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
okay this is the right one okay all
 
04:47:06.150 --> 04:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
right yes okay
 
04:47:08.788 --> 04:47:08.798 align:start position:0%
we will post we will postpone this
 
04:47:10.788 --> 04:47:10.798 align:start position:0%
at least to deal with with the other
 
04:47:12.070 --> 04:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
bill which
 
04:47:14.830 --> 04:47:14.840 align:start position:0%
i don't believe has any amendments
 
04:47:18.708 --> 04:47:18.718 align:start position:0%
325 uh no
 
04:47:21.990 --> 04:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
138 438 i have an amendment for that
 
04:47:22.000 --> 04:47:24.070 align:start position:0%
138 438 i have an amendment for that
good

04:47:24.070 --> 04:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
good
 
04:47:26.470 --> 04:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
senate bill 438
 
04:47:28.628 --> 04:47:28.638 align:start position:0%
representative sent anastasia you have a
 
04:47:28.638 --> 04:47:31.990 align:start position:0%
representative sent anastasia you have a
motion

04:47:31.990 --> 04:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:34.470 --> 04:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh yes uh motion in expedient to
 
04:47:37.350 --> 04:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
legislate for senate bill 438
 
04:47:41.350 --> 04:47:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:43.510 --> 04:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
bracket second by representative lucas
 
04:47:47.270 --> 04:47:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:50.390 --> 04:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh sure this is just uh this bill you
 
04:47:51.990 --> 04:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
know adds protectionism to the law
 
04:47:54.070 --> 04:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
that's for special interest
 
04:47:55.670 --> 04:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
as far as uh
 
04:47:56.868 --> 04:47:56.878 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:48:00.310 --> 04:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh steel production um
 
04:48:01.430 --> 04:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
04:48:03.910 --> 04:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
i guess there's canada subsidizes their
 
04:48:05.670 --> 04:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
their steel in some way
 
04:48:08.550 --> 04:48:08.560 align:start position:0%
by uh with electricity or whatever um so
 
04:48:10.150 --> 04:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
for us to respond to that
 
04:48:12.230 --> 04:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
by subsidizing our steel with taxpayer
 
04:48:13.670 --> 04:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
money doesn't seem like an appropriate
 
04:48:13.680 --> 04:48:17.510 align:start position:0%
money doesn't seem like an appropriate
solution

04:48:17.510 --> 04:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:19.190 --> 04:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
representative lackas
 
04:48:20.948 --> 04:48:20.958 align:start position:0%
thank you and one of the arguments for
 
04:48:22.470 --> 04:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
this was that there would be some sort
 
04:48:23.350 --> 04:48:23.360 align:start position:0%
of a
 
04:48:24.948 --> 04:48:24.958 align:start position:0%
multiplier effect because the money
 
04:48:27.110 --> 04:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
would be spent locally but
 
04:48:29.030 --> 04:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
if the money is left with the taxpayers
 
04:48:30.390 --> 04:48:30.400 align:start position:0%
they're going to spend it somehow as
 
04:48:32.550 --> 04:48:32.560 align:start position:0%
well which is also going to support
 
04:48:35.030 --> 04:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
local jobs businesses and whatever so
 
04:48:36.948 --> 04:48:36.958 align:start position:0%
i don't uh i don't think that's a
 
04:48:39.190 --> 04:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
terribly effective argument
 
04:48:40.788 --> 04:48:40.798 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:48:42.628 --> 04:48:42.638 align:start position:0%
in general we shouldn't be
 
04:48:44.150 --> 04:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
doing this sort of thing as my view
 
04:48:45.350 --> 04:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:48:48.310 --> 04:48:48.320 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that it's appropriate for
 
04:48:51.110 --> 04:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
itl because
 
04:48:53.350 --> 04:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
we're essentially giving the industry a
 
04:48:55.670 --> 04:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
blank check with this bill
 
04:48:58.230 --> 04:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
that we had no information from anyone
 
04:49:00.230 --> 04:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
in the state procurement offices or
 
04:49:01.750 --> 04:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
public works
 
04:49:05.430 --> 04:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
as to how many contracts are involved
 
04:49:08.230 --> 04:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
and what kind of a cost impact it might
 
04:49:11.990 --> 04:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:13.190 --> 04:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
we're we're
 
04:49:13.200 --> 04:49:14.390 align:start position:0%
we're we're
allowing

04:49:14.390 --> 04:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
allowing
 
04:49:17.430 --> 04:49:17.440 align:start position:0%
the total contract to increase by 25
 
04:49:17.440 --> 04:49:18.628 align:start position:0%
the total contract to increase by 25
percent

04:49:18.628 --> 04:49:18.638 align:start position:0%
percent
 
04:49:20.550 --> 04:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
when the steel is maybe 10 percent of
 
04:49:22.948 --> 04:49:22.958 align:start position:0%
the total contract
 
04:49:25.750 --> 04:49:25.760 align:start position:0%
if i understand the math correctly
 
04:49:27.910 --> 04:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
an unscrupulous producer could triple
 
04:49:29.590 --> 04:49:29.600 align:start position:0%
the cost to the steel
 
04:49:31.590 --> 04:49:31.600 align:start position:0%
and there'd be no excuse not to accept
 
04:49:33.670 --> 04:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
that bit
 
04:49:35.190 --> 04:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying they would but it's
 
04:49:36.628 --> 04:49:36.638 align:start position:0%
possible that's what the numbers would
 
04:49:37.990 --> 04:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
work out
 
04:49:39.910 --> 04:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm
 
04:49:41.990 --> 04:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
i don't like the criminal penalties i
 
04:49:44.948 --> 04:49:44.958 align:start position:0%
don't like the restrictions on capacity
 
04:49:47.510 --> 04:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
and i don't know what we're getting in
 
04:49:51.430 --> 04:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
response for this extra money the
 
04:49:53.670 --> 04:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
the steel producers say they can't
 
04:49:55.590 --> 04:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
compete on price
 
04:49:58.150 --> 04:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
but can they compete on quality or
 
04:50:01.110 --> 04:50:01.120 align:start position:0%
delivery or reliability or something
 
04:50:03.110 --> 04:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
like that and if so
 
04:50:05.430 --> 04:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
what kind of a trade-off do we get
 
04:50:07.350 --> 04:50:07.360 align:start position:0%
we don't know because we don't have any
 
04:50:10.070 --> 04:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
information on it
 
04:50:11.750 --> 04:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
representative pearson you had a comment
 
04:50:13.190 --> 04:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
i do thank you
 
04:50:13.200 --> 04:50:14.070 align:start position:0%
i do thank you
um

04:50:14.070 --> 04:50:14.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:16.390 --> 04:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
couple things
 
04:50:20.070 --> 04:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
with this um i i would i'm curious as to
 
04:50:22.070 --> 04:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
what that representative gross amendment
 
04:50:25.430 --> 04:50:25.440 align:start position:0%
looks like first of all um secondly
 
04:50:28.788 --> 04:50:28.798 align:start position:0%
23 states are already doing this
 
04:50:28.798 --> 04:50:30.868 align:start position:0%
23 states are already doing this
and

04:50:30.868 --> 04:50:30.878 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:50:32.948 --> 04:50:32.958 align:start position:0%
my concern
 
04:50:36.150 --> 04:50:36.160 align:start position:0%
is is that we have effectively now since
 
04:50:37.750 --> 04:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
the 1970s
 
04:50:37.760 --> 04:50:39.030 align:start position:0%
the 1970s
pushed

04:50:39.030 --> 04:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
pushed
 
04:50:41.110 --> 04:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
almost all of our industry out of the
 
04:50:43.190 --> 04:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
united states
 
04:50:43.200 --> 04:50:43.910 align:start position:0%
united states
it's

04:50:43.910 --> 04:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:50:45.830 --> 04:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
you couldn't have dreamed up a more
 
04:50:47.830 --> 04:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
colossal conundrum than what we've done
 
04:50:50.550 --> 04:50:50.560 align:start position:0%
and and is a glowing example of this
 
04:50:51.990 --> 04:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
problem is the fact that the auto
 
04:50:53.830 --> 04:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
industry has come to a screeching halt
 
04:50:55.270 --> 04:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
because we don't have anybody that makes
 
04:50:57.750 --> 04:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
chips in this country anymore my town my
 
04:51:00.310 --> 04:51:00.320 align:start position:0%
district had hadco a massive circuit
 
04:51:00.320 --> 04:51:01.110 align:start position:0%
district had hadco a massive circuit
board

04:51:01.110 --> 04:51:01.120 align:start position:0%
board
 
04:51:03.910 --> 04:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facility it's gone
 
04:51:03.920 --> 04:51:05.830 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facility it's gone
so

04:51:05.830 --> 04:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:51:09.190 --> 04:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
we have some homeland we have security
 
04:51:10.708 --> 04:51:10.718 align:start position:0%
implications and a lot of things now
 
04:51:12.070 --> 04:51:12.080 align:start position:0%
that we have just surrendered to
 
04:51:17.750 --> 04:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:19.350 --> 04:51:19.360 align:start position:0%
where does this stop
 
04:51:21.350 --> 04:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
i mean we
 
04:51:22.868 --> 04:51:22.878 align:start position:0%
right now there was there was some
 
04:51:24.628 --> 04:51:24.638 align:start position:0%
discussion i heard about well you know
 
04:51:26.150 --> 04:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
the federal government should just put
 
04:51:28.310 --> 04:51:28.320 align:start position:0%
tariffs on steel they do there are
 
04:51:30.230 --> 04:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
tariffs on steel at the federal level
 
04:51:32.470 --> 04:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
until you drill a hole in the steel and
 
04:51:34.868 --> 04:51:34.878 align:start position:0%
the second you drill a hole in the steel
 
04:51:37.030 --> 04:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
now it is something that is engineered
 
04:51:40.230 --> 04:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
and it's literally a loophole
 
04:51:42.788 --> 04:51:42.798 align:start position:0%
literally a loophole that the chinese
 
04:51:44.788 --> 04:51:44.798 align:start position:0%
are using to dump
 
04:51:47.430 --> 04:51:47.440 align:start position:0%
mass quantities of steel right through a
 
04:51:49.830 --> 04:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
tariff into this country
 
04:51:51.510 --> 04:51:51.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm just
 
04:51:53.190 --> 04:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
when you know enough's enough with this
 
04:51:56.470 --> 04:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
this is we we're we're basically just
 
04:51:58.550 --> 04:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
destroying our
 
04:52:00.310 --> 04:52:00.320 align:start position:0%
industries one at a time in this country
 
04:52:02.788 --> 04:52:02.798 align:start position:0%
and and i'm done with it so
 
04:52:04.310 --> 04:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
i think that i don't i don't support the
 
04:52:04.320 --> 04:52:05.510 align:start position:0%
i think that i don't i don't support the
itl

04:52:05.510 --> 04:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
itl
 
04:52:07.910 --> 04:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
i think if you know an interim study
 
04:52:10.390 --> 04:52:10.400 align:start position:0%
would be would seem logical here
 
04:52:13.110 --> 04:52:13.120 align:start position:0%
um in this case but
 
04:52:16.470 --> 04:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:18.070 --> 04:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
and like i said i'd like to i'm curious
 
04:52:19.350 --> 04:52:19.360 align:start position:0%
as to what representative grote's
 
04:52:21.190 --> 04:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
amendment looks like
 
04:52:22.948 --> 04:52:22.958 align:start position:0%
representative marshall
 
04:52:25.270 --> 04:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh yes i can't support itl either i
 
04:52:27.750 --> 04:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
think this bill ought to pass uh i speak
 
04:52:29.590 --> 04:52:29.600 align:start position:0%
from this personally i grew up in the
 
04:52:33.030 --> 04:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
steel city in pittsburgh pennsylvania
 
04:52:34.708 --> 04:52:34.718 align:start position:0%
vice chairman rhodes knows the steel
 
04:52:37.190 --> 04:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
city uh we
 
04:52:39.430 --> 04:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
used to have uh blast furnaces and
 
04:52:41.910 --> 04:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
fabrication plants lining the rivers and
 
04:52:44.230 --> 04:52:44.240 align:start position:0%
and the surrounding towns were where the
 
04:52:46.310 --> 04:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
fabrication was done including butler
 
04:52:47.910 --> 04:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
which was mentioned
 
04:52:50.310 --> 04:52:50.320 align:start position:0%
near where i grew up uh they also made
 
04:52:53.030 --> 04:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
railroad cars in in butler to see what's
 
04:52:55.270 --> 04:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
happened to the blue-collar workers in
 
04:52:57.830 --> 04:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
that community as industry has left
 
04:53:00.390 --> 04:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
is is truly sad
 
04:53:01.990 --> 04:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
they don't have the good jobs that they
 
04:53:03.350 --> 04:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
used to have
 
04:53:05.190 --> 04:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
and as representative pearson says
 
04:53:07.110 --> 04:53:07.120 align:start position:0%
enough is enough we need to be able to
 
04:53:11.350 --> 04:53:11.360 align:start position:0%
protect our existing industries uh from
 
04:53:11.360 --> 04:53:12.788 align:start position:0%
protect our existing industries uh from
really

04:53:12.788 --> 04:53:12.798 align:start position:0%
really
 
04:53:15.670 --> 04:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
non-competitive practices uh where their
 
04:53:17.270 --> 04:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
industry is subsidized in foreign
 
04:53:19.430 --> 04:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
countries including china so i cannot
 
04:53:23.030 --> 04:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:25.590 --> 04:53:25.600 align:start position:0%
okay representative goalie
 
04:53:27.830 --> 04:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and i too will not
 
04:53:32.310 --> 04:53:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:34.948 --> 04:53:34.958 align:start position:0%
i think we all know
 
04:53:39.030 --> 04:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
american products are quality products
 
04:53:40.708 --> 04:53:40.718 align:start position:0%
we look at some of the stuff we get from
 
04:53:43.030 --> 04:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
other countries china
 
04:53:44.628 --> 04:53:44.638 align:start position:0%
any of the other countries and we look
 
04:53:46.230 --> 04:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
at it we know right away it's not
 
04:53:48.948 --> 04:53:48.958 align:start position:0%
american made
 
04:53:51.670 --> 04:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
i have faith in the american product and
 
04:53:53.830 --> 04:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
i have faith in the american steel and
 
04:53:55.590 --> 04:53:55.600 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna support um vote against the
 
04:53:57.830 --> 04:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
itl so we can have another motion and i
 
04:53:59.510 --> 04:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
believe there will be an amendment
 
04:54:01.510 --> 04:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
coming forward removing the 25 percent
 
04:54:02.948 --> 04:54:02.958 align:start position:0%
which i think will make this an even
 
04:54:05.510 --> 04:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
better bill to support uh actually
 
04:54:07.350 --> 04:54:07.360 align:start position:0%
representative goalie if you remove that
 
04:54:10.788 --> 04:54:10.798 align:start position:0%
limit there is no way that the state
 
04:54:13.590 --> 04:54:13.600 align:start position:0%
could object to any price for american
 
04:54:13.600 --> 04:54:16.150 align:start position:0%
could object to any price for american
steel

04:54:16.150 --> 04:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
steel
 
04:54:16.160 --> 04:54:17.990 align:start position:0%
steel
regardless

04:54:17.990 --> 04:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
regardless
 
04:54:19.670 --> 04:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
so representative bailey and then
 
04:54:19.680 --> 04:54:21.270 align:start position:0%
so representative bailey and then
allegro

04:54:21.270 --> 04:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
allegro
 
04:54:23.590 --> 04:54:23.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
04:54:26.390 --> 04:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
if new hampshire was to impose its own
 
04:54:29.430 --> 04:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
tariff on canada it would be almost as
 
04:54:34.070 --> 04:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:36.868 --> 04:54:36.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:38.550 --> 04:54:38.560 align:start position:0%
actually representative likas did i yet
 
04:54:41.030 --> 04:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
did i recognize you to speak uh not yet
 
04:54:42.830 --> 04:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
oh these two of them
 
04:54:45.430 --> 04:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
sorry and uh
 
04:54:47.110 --> 04:54:47.120 align:start position:0%
with that last one i think that i have a
 
04:54:51.030 --> 04:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:53.190 --> 04:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
i may come back to it sorry okay we'll
 
04:54:56.070 --> 04:54:56.080 align:start position:0%
come back to you representative allegro
 
04:54:58.708 --> 04:54:58.718 align:start position:0%
i can't top that one but i i actually
 
04:55:00.868 --> 04:55:00.878 align:start position:0%
started off on the other side of this
 
04:55:03.190 --> 04:55:03.200 align:start position:0%
fence um
 
04:55:05.110 --> 04:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
i agree with every sentiment of everyone
 
04:55:09.430 --> 04:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:11.510 --> 04:55:11.520 align:start position:0%
it's true including the most recent
 
04:55:11.520 --> 04:55:12.868 align:start position:0%
it's true including the most recent
comments

04:55:12.868 --> 04:55:12.878 align:start position:0%
comments
 
04:55:12.878 --> 04:55:14.470 align:start position:0%
comments
um

04:55:14.470 --> 04:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:16.628 --> 04:55:16.638 align:start position:0%
but it's also true that
 
04:55:18.390 --> 04:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh we were
 
04:55:20.070 --> 04:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
i think presented with some hollow
 
04:55:23.110 --> 04:55:23.120 align:start position:0%
testimony about you know economic
 
04:55:24.948 --> 04:55:24.958 align:start position:0%
multipliers and things like that as
 
04:55:26.788 --> 04:55:26.798 align:start position:0%
representative lekkis points out when
 
04:55:28.948 --> 04:55:28.958 align:start position:0%
money stays in the consumer's pocket and
 
04:55:31.670 --> 04:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
then is spent locally it has its own
 
04:55:33.830 --> 04:55:33.840 align:start position:0%
multiplier effect
 
04:55:38.150 --> 04:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:42.310 --> 04:55:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:44.310 --> 04:55:44.320 align:start position:0%
by way of trade agreements at the
 
04:55:46.470 --> 04:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
federal level
 
04:55:48.070 --> 04:55:48.080 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:55:50.788 --> 04:55:50.798 align:start position:0%
i would support the itl
 
04:55:52.310 --> 04:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
but there's also a great deal of merit i
 
04:55:53.510 --> 04:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
think in the
 
04:55:55.590 --> 04:55:55.600 align:start position:0%
interim study
 
04:55:55.600 --> 04:55:57.510 align:start position:0%
interim study
model

04:55:57.510 --> 04:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
model
 
04:55:59.670 --> 04:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
okay representative blackis
 
04:56:01.190 --> 04:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
04:56:02.948 --> 04:56:02.958 align:start position:0%
regarding the
 
04:56:05.910 --> 04:56:05.920 align:start position:0%
the assumption of quality american being
 
04:56:08.150 --> 04:56:08.160 align:start position:0%
better i'm not disagreeing or agreeing
 
04:56:09.590 --> 04:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
with that but
 
04:56:11.350 --> 04:56:11.360 align:start position:0%
um i mean that's something that the
 
04:56:13.430 --> 04:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
procurement people can take into account
 
04:56:14.550 --> 04:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
04:56:16.628 --> 04:56:16.638 align:start position:0%
they don't have to take the lowest bid
 
04:56:18.628 --> 04:56:18.638 align:start position:0%
if it's going to be not meet the quality
 
04:56:18.638 --> 04:56:19.830 align:start position:0%
if it's going to be not meet the quality
requirements

04:56:19.830 --> 04:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
04:56:21.830 --> 04:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh just based on costs so i i don't
 
04:56:26.550 --> 04:56:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:28.708 --> 04:56:28.718 align:start position:0%
it's not representative
 
04:56:31.670 --> 04:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you i will be voting against itl
 
04:56:33.590 --> 04:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
and against interim study should that
 
04:56:35.270 --> 04:56:35.280 align:start position:0%
motion happen
 
04:56:37.190 --> 04:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
i think that there are
 
04:56:37.200 --> 04:56:38.628 align:start position:0%
i think that there are
four

04:56:38.628 --> 04:56:38.638 align:start position:0%
four
 
04:56:41.110 --> 04:56:41.120 align:start position:0%
large fabricators in new hampshire
 
04:56:42.390 --> 04:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
who hire
 
04:56:45.190 --> 04:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
significant number of people
 
04:56:47.110 --> 04:56:47.120 align:start position:0%
and those people
 
04:56:47.120 --> 04:56:49.270 align:start position:0%
and those people
work

04:56:49.270 --> 04:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
work
 
04:56:51.590 --> 04:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
for those industries in supplying
 
04:56:53.510 --> 04:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
product to new hampshire
 
04:56:55.030 --> 04:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
when they can
 
04:56:57.510 --> 04:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
remove my amendment does remove the 25
 
04:56:58.948 --> 04:56:58.958 align:start position:0%
percent and i disagree with
 
04:57:01.110 --> 04:57:01.120 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire in that it makes
 
04:57:03.030 --> 04:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
the bill ineffective because they can't
 
04:57:05.590 --> 04:57:05.600 align:start position:0%
compete because there are other reasons
 
04:57:07.910 --> 04:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
that the that the
 
04:57:10.390 --> 04:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
state can
 
04:57:12.310 --> 04:57:12.320 align:start position:0%
there are other exceptions in the bill
 
04:57:15.190 --> 04:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
that the state can use to exempt
 
04:57:17.350 --> 04:57:17.360 align:start position:0%
this puts new hampshire
 
04:57:20.628 --> 04:57:20.638 align:start position:0%
businesses on 11 level playing field and
 
04:57:23.350 --> 04:57:23.360 align:start position:0%
to think that it's a subsidy
 
04:57:25.910 --> 04:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
is inaccurate in my estimation
 
04:57:27.910 --> 04:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:57:30.070 --> 04:57:30.080 align:start position:0%
representative phillips
 
04:57:31.990 --> 04:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
um yeah just the amendment that you're
 
04:57:34.150 --> 04:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
talking about are you going to um take
 
04:57:38.470 --> 04:57:38.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:40.150 --> 04:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
did you consider
 
04:57:42.868 --> 04:57:42.878 align:start position:0%
making 25 well we can't debate the
 
04:57:46.390 --> 04:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
amendment until we are ready to
 
04:57:48.788 --> 04:57:48.798 align:start position:0%
right now we're discussing itl
 
04:57:48.798 --> 04:57:50.628 align:start position:0%
right now we're discussing itl
okay

04:57:50.628 --> 04:57:50.638 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:57:52.788 --> 04:57:52.798 align:start position:0%
and you can't amend a bill
 
04:57:55.110 --> 04:57:55.120 align:start position:0%
when you're considering itl
 
04:57:56.550 --> 04:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
uh represent pearson did you have
 
04:57:57.910 --> 04:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
another comment i do uh you know i'm
 
04:58:00.788 --> 04:58:00.798 align:start position:0%
just thinking about you know the tech
 
04:58:02.868 --> 04:58:02.878 align:start position:0%
what we're doing right now we local
 
04:58:04.150 --> 04:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
communities in the state of new
 
04:58:07.270 --> 04:58:07.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire offers tax incentives for for
 
04:58:08.550 --> 04:58:08.560 align:start position:0%
different industries to come into the
 
04:58:10.628 --> 04:58:10.638 align:start position:0%
state right now we already do that
 
04:58:12.470 --> 04:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
so this is really
 
04:58:12.480 --> 04:58:13.270 align:start position:0%
so this is really
not

04:58:13.270 --> 04:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:58:15.430 --> 04:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
that far off the lines of of some of the
 
04:58:17.190 --> 04:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
things that the status does to
 
04:58:17.200 --> 04:58:18.948 align:start position:0%
things that the status does to
incentivize

04:58:18.948 --> 04:58:18.958 align:start position:0%
incentivize
 
04:58:20.390 --> 04:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh you know i can think of in particular
 
04:58:21.910 --> 04:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
the walmart warehouse and raymond there
 
04:58:24.628 --> 04:58:24.638 align:start position:0%
was substantial tax breaks that were
 
04:58:26.230 --> 04:58:26.240 align:start position:0%
given to them for a decade to put that
 
04:58:28.628 --> 04:58:28.638 align:start position:0%
facility in new hampshire versus another
 
04:58:31.190 --> 04:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
state so we we kind of already play that
 
04:58:31.200 --> 04:58:32.070 align:start position:0%
state so we we kind of already play that
game

04:58:32.070 --> 04:58:32.080 align:start position:0%
game
 
04:58:32.080 --> 04:58:33.990 align:start position:0%
game
um

04:58:33.990 --> 04:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:35.830 --> 04:58:35.840 align:start position:0%
in in a slightly different way the other
 
04:58:37.510 --> 04:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
thing too just thinking about is a hot
 
04:58:39.910 --> 04:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
rod guy the auto industry and i mean i
 
04:58:41.110 --> 04:58:41.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate the fact that the japanese
 
04:58:42.788 --> 04:58:42.798 align:start position:0%
automakers have put plants in tennessee
 
04:58:44.628 --> 04:58:44.638 align:start position:0%
and the carolinas and all that but at
 
04:58:47.030 --> 04:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
the end of the day the final ultimate
 
04:58:49.510 --> 04:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
profit buck still goes back to japan
 
04:58:49.520 --> 04:58:51.750 align:start position:0%
profit buck still goes back to japan
so

04:58:51.750 --> 04:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:58:51.760 --> 04:58:53.350 align:start position:0%
so
i'm

04:58:53.350 --> 04:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
04:58:56.868 --> 04:58:56.878 align:start position:0%
very concerned again about
 
04:58:59.750 --> 04:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
the manufacturing
 
04:58:59.760 --> 04:59:01.510 align:start position:0%
the manufacturing
and

04:59:01.510 --> 04:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:59:03.910 --> 04:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
the various industries that we are just
 
04:59:06.390 --> 04:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
forcing out and steel
 
04:59:09.510 --> 04:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
steel as in a specific example here is
 
04:59:13.190 --> 04:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
something we use to build the navy so
 
04:59:14.868 --> 04:59:14.878 align:start position:0%
i know that's more of a
 
04:59:16.868 --> 04:59:16.878 align:start position:0%
outside the necessarily the borders of
 
04:59:18.948 --> 04:59:18.958 align:start position:0%
new hampshire but
 
04:59:20.948 --> 04:59:20.958 align:start position:0%
just as a general rule this is this is a
 
04:59:25.190 --> 04:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:28.628 --> 04:59:28.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:31.270 --> 04:59:31.280 align:start position:0%
so i won't be supporting the itl motion
 
04:59:31.280 --> 04:59:32.310 align:start position:0%
so i won't be supporting the itl motion
because

04:59:32.310 --> 04:59:32.320 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:59:33.270 --> 04:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
i think
 
04:59:35.990 --> 04:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
the answer to a number of the questions
 
04:59:38.390 --> 04:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
that have been raised is to interim
 
04:59:40.708 --> 04:59:40.718 align:start position:0%
study the bill so that we get those
 
04:59:42.788 --> 04:59:42.798 align:start position:0%
questions answered
 
04:59:45.670 --> 04:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
i don't like the idea
 
04:59:47.590 --> 04:59:47.600 align:start position:0%
tariffs for one thing that were
 
04:59:47.600 --> 04:59:48.708 align:start position:0%
tariffs for one thing that were
mentioned

04:59:48.708 --> 04:59:48.718 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
04:59:50.708 --> 04:59:50.718 align:start position:0%
who pays the tariffs it's not the
 
04:59:52.310 --> 04:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
foreign countries that pay the tariffs
 
04:59:54.470 --> 04:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
it's the american consumers who pay the
 
04:59:56.788 --> 04:59:56.798 align:start position:0%
tariffs so that was a a
 
04:59:58.868 --> 04:59:58.878 align:start position:0%
convenient misrepresentation by a
 
05:00:00.390 --> 05:00:00.400 align:start position:0%
certain former
 
05:00:00.400 --> 05:00:01.350 align:start position:0%
certain former
person

05:00:01.350 --> 05:00:01.360 align:start position:0%
person
 
05:00:03.990 --> 05:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
with regard to tariffs being the answer
 
05:00:06.948 --> 05:00:06.958 align:start position:0%
the answer is we don't know
 
05:00:10.230 --> 05:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
enough about the totality of this this
 
05:00:12.708 --> 05:00:12.718 align:start position:0%
is not the commerce committee where we
 
05:00:15.030 --> 05:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
deal with such issues on a regular basis
 
05:00:17.190 --> 05:00:17.200 align:start position:0%
and i think we should definitely not go
 
05:00:19.110 --> 05:00:19.120 align:start position:0%
itl because it's kind of a slap in the
 
05:00:21.510 --> 05:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
face at the very least that we have
 
05:00:23.430 --> 05:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
questions that we don't even
 
05:00:25.270 --> 05:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
get answered before we make a final
 
05:00:25.280 --> 05:00:26.868 align:start position:0%
get answered before we make a final
decision

05:00:26.868 --> 05:00:26.878 align:start position:0%
decision
 
05:00:28.868 --> 05:00:28.878 align:start position:0%
representing broda
 
05:00:30.470 --> 05:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
i also want to remind the committee that
 
05:00:32.390 --> 05:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
this is going to finance and since this
 
05:00:33.830 --> 05:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
is a state
 
05:00:35.910 --> 05:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
issue they can decide whether or not the
 
05:00:37.590 --> 05:00:37.600 align:start position:0%
state can afford it
 
05:00:40.070 --> 05:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
and lastly had other
 
05:00:41.990 --> 05:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
believe me as we've never seen in other
 
05:00:44.628 --> 05:00:44.638 align:start position:0%
hearings had departments involved with
 
05:00:46.390 --> 05:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
the state been interested in this they
 
05:00:48.708 --> 05:00:48.718 align:start position:0%
would have testified so we didn't hear
 
05:00:50.788 --> 05:00:50.798 align:start position:0%
from them and that that
 
05:00:53.430 --> 05:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
silence is telling thank you
 
05:00:55.670 --> 05:00:55.680 align:start position:0%
yeah i will say that i did reach out to
 
05:00:55.680 --> 05:00:57.910 align:start position:0%
yeah i will say that i did reach out to
the

05:00:57.910 --> 05:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:59.430 --> 05:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
administrative services in their
 
05:01:01.190 --> 05:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
procurement department
 
05:01:03.270 --> 05:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
and the person i spoke to said yes well
 
05:01:06.230 --> 05:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
we buy steel but at a grand total of
 
05:01:08.230 --> 05:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
six or seven hundred thousand dollars a
 
05:01:08.240 --> 05:01:09.350 align:start position:0%
six or seven hundred thousand dollars a
year

05:01:09.350 --> 05:01:09.360 align:start position:0%
year
 
05:01:11.430 --> 05:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
so it wouldn't fall under the purview of
 
05:01:13.830 --> 05:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
the spill and i have been unable to
 
05:01:16.230 --> 05:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
reach the people in transportation or
 
05:01:18.948 --> 05:01:18.958 align:start position:0%
public works that would be making larger
 
05:01:18.958 --> 05:01:20.310 align:start position:0%
public works that would be making larger
contracts

05:01:20.310 --> 05:01:20.320 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
05:01:23.110 --> 05:01:23.120 align:start position:0%
representative fellows um yes that that
 
05:01:25.510 --> 05:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
was one of my thoughts that that
 
05:01:27.990 --> 05:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire rarely build
 
05:01:29.910 --> 05:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
builds a whole building that would
 
05:01:32.628 --> 05:01:32.638 align:start position:0%
require this amount of steel but we do
 
05:01:34.150 --> 05:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
have coming up
 
05:01:37.030 --> 05:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
um hopefully a new parking garage which
 
05:01:39.910 --> 05:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
i assume will have lots of steel in it i
 
05:01:41.830 --> 05:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
certainly hope so
 
05:01:44.628 --> 05:01:44.638 align:start position:0%
and and so then that kind of makes me
 
05:01:46.470 --> 05:01:46.480 align:start position:0%
wonder about the effective date because
 
05:01:49.590 --> 05:01:49.600 align:start position:0%
this is effective january
 
05:01:49.600 --> 05:01:51.270 align:start position:0%
this is effective january
23

05:01:51.270 --> 05:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
23
 
05:01:53.910 --> 05:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
well that's probably good we could if we
 
05:01:56.070 --> 05:01:56.080 align:start position:0%
passed this we could
 
05:01:58.390 --> 05:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
hopefully be saying that we want our
 
05:02:01.030 --> 05:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
parking garage built with american steel
 
05:02:02.470 --> 05:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
because i don't think they'd start
 
05:02:05.510 --> 05:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
before then but i don't know that would
 
05:02:07.990 --> 05:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
be interesting to know thank you
 
05:02:10.390 --> 05:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
anyone else represent judy yes thank you
 
05:02:10.400 --> 05:02:11.670 align:start position:0%
anyone else represent judy yes thank you
madam

05:02:11.670 --> 05:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
madam
 
05:02:14.550 --> 05:02:14.560 align:start position:0%
uh i don't like to
 
05:02:17.670 --> 05:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
i don't want to support itl
 
05:02:19.910 --> 05:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
the reason why because i don't want to
 
05:02:19.920 --> 05:02:21.350 align:start position:0%
the reason why because i don't want to
close

05:02:21.350 --> 05:02:21.360 align:start position:0%
close
 
05:02:24.310 --> 05:02:24.320 align:start position:0%
the business doors here in new hampshire
 
05:02:26.390 --> 05:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
because uh
 
05:02:28.150 --> 05:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
what we are doing here
 
05:02:31.270 --> 05:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
in america i would like to say to see it
 
05:02:33.110 --> 05:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
stay in america
 
05:02:36.310 --> 05:02:36.320 align:start position:0%
because i remember one of uh the owner
 
05:02:39.110 --> 05:02:39.120 align:start position:0%
they were talking about um
 
05:02:39.120 --> 05:02:40.708 align:start position:0%
they were talking about um
overseas

05:02:40.708 --> 05:02:40.718 align:start position:0%
overseas
 
05:02:43.110 --> 05:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
they are the one who making money
 
05:02:46.948 --> 05:02:46.958 align:start position:0%
on top of us so i i cannot support itl
 
05:02:50.310 --> 05:02:50.320 align:start position:0%
because i don't want uh
 
05:02:53.350 --> 05:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
those owners to close their doors
 
05:02:55.270 --> 05:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:02:57.110 --> 05:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes
 
05:02:59.030 --> 05:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman so there was
 
05:03:01.590 --> 05:03:01.600 align:start position:0%
some discussion about
 
05:03:03.910 --> 05:03:03.920 align:start position:0%
well in canada they they pay the light
 
05:03:05.830 --> 05:03:05.840 align:start position:0%
bills for the businesses and they pay
 
05:03:07.750 --> 05:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
the health insurance for the employees
 
05:03:09.910 --> 05:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
and etc etc etc
 
05:03:11.910 --> 05:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
and that is the exact reason why i
 
05:03:14.230 --> 05:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
actually want to support this bill is
 
05:03:16.948 --> 05:03:16.958 align:start position:0%
because the businesses that are here do
 
05:03:19.110 --> 05:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
have to pay their electric bills
 
05:03:19.120 --> 05:03:20.708 align:start position:0%
have to pay their electric bills
and

05:03:20.708 --> 05:03:20.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:03:23.830 --> 05:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
because we are fantastic
 
05:03:25.430 --> 05:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
you know it's kind of a double-edged
 
05:03:27.510 --> 05:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
sword for the for the employers but yes
 
05:03:29.190 --> 05:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
they do have to pay health insurance if
 
05:03:30.390 --> 05:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
they have people who work over a certain
 
05:03:31.750 --> 05:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
amount of hours
 
05:03:34.550 --> 05:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
and it the it has to stop somewhere and
 
05:03:36.948 --> 05:03:36.958 align:start position:0%
we have to also start somewhere we have
 
05:03:38.868 --> 05:03:38.878 align:start position:0%
to start getting this back
 
05:03:40.948 --> 05:03:40.958 align:start position:0%
and i didn't realize until
 
05:03:43.270 --> 05:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
representative pearson told me he told
 
05:03:44.708 --> 05:03:44.718 align:start position:0%
us i don't know how many states are
 
05:03:44.718 --> 05:03:45.670 align:start position:0%
us i don't know how many states are
already

05:03:45.670 --> 05:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
already
 
05:03:47.430 --> 05:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
doing such things
 
05:03:52.550 --> 05:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:54.390 --> 05:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
i just think good conscious cannot sit
 
05:03:56.310 --> 05:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
here and say
 
05:03:59.750 --> 05:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
and and say no i i i just can't do that
 
05:04:00.788 --> 05:04:00.798 align:start position:0%
and i
 
05:04:02.070 --> 05:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
i just think i need the record to say
 
05:04:06.230 --> 05:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:08.550 --> 05:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
yes represent pearson thank you um i sit
 
05:04:10.948 --> 05:04:10.958 align:start position:0%
on the state procurement commission
 
05:04:12.550 --> 05:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
and we've never specifically addressed
 
05:04:14.070 --> 05:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
steel but i will note that one of the
 
05:04:16.230 --> 05:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
sponsors of this bill senator carson is
 
05:04:17.830 --> 05:04:17.840 align:start position:0%
the chairman of the state procurement
 
05:04:17.840 --> 05:04:19.750 align:start position:0%
the chairman of the state procurement
commission

05:04:19.750 --> 05:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
commission
 
05:04:19.760 --> 05:04:23.030 align:start position:0%
commission
yes

05:04:23.030 --> 05:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:25.190 --> 05:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
yes well
 
05:04:28.310 --> 05:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
my concern is that as the people who
 
05:04:28.320 --> 05:04:29.910 align:start position:0%
my concern is that as the people who
testified

05:04:29.910 --> 05:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
testified
 
05:04:32.948 --> 05:04:32.958 align:start position:0%
told us in the hallway after the hearing
 
05:04:35.190 --> 05:04:35.200 align:start position:0%
that there's a policy decision here on
 
05:04:37.270 --> 05:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
how much more we want to pay for steel
 
05:04:39.510 --> 05:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
to support their businesses
 
05:04:39.520 --> 05:04:40.390 align:start position:0%
to support their businesses
and

05:04:40.390 --> 05:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:04:41.830 --> 05:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
clearly it was the people whose
 
05:04:43.990 --> 05:04:44.000 align:start position:0%
businesses would benefit from this bill
 
05:04:46.470 --> 05:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
that showed up to testify they were all
 
05:04:48.628 --> 05:04:48.638 align:start position:0%
people in the iron business who expected
 
05:04:51.510 --> 05:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
to get contracts that would be
 
05:04:53.830 --> 05:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
that they so that they would be able to
 
05:04:54.948 --> 05:04:54.958 align:start position:0%
deal with
 
05:04:56.230 --> 05:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
05:04:57.750 --> 05:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
cheaper foreign
 
05:04:57.760 --> 05:04:59.190 align:start position:0%
cheaper foreign
competition

05:04:59.190 --> 05:04:59.200 align:start position:0%
competition
 
05:05:01.430 --> 05:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
and those are the people who showed up
 
05:05:03.990 --> 05:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:06.708 --> 05:05:06.718 align:start position:0%
and we're asking the taxpayers to come
 
05:05:08.550 --> 05:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
up with more money we don't know how
 
05:05:08.560 --> 05:05:09.430 align:start position:0%
up with more money we don't know how
much

05:05:09.430 --> 05:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
much
 
05:05:09.440 --> 05:05:11.430 align:start position:0%
much
to

05:05:11.430 --> 05:05:11.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:05:13.190 --> 05:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
place business with these
 
05:05:15.990 --> 05:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
these companies rather than others
 
05:05:18.550 --> 05:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
or to tilt the playing field towards
 
05:05:21.750 --> 05:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
them so that they can get more contracts
 
05:05:23.190 --> 05:05:23.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm
 
05:05:25.590 --> 05:05:25.600 align:start position:0%
opposed to that and i'm
 
05:05:27.910 --> 05:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
very very strongly opposed to doing we
 
05:05:30.390 --> 05:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
don't know how much money is involved
 
05:05:31.350 --> 05:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to have a question in
 
05:05:33.590 --> 05:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
reference to the
 
05:05:38.390 --> 05:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:40.948 --> 05:05:40.958 align:start position:0%
the the the four or five entities that
 
05:05:40.958 --> 05:05:41.750 align:start position:0%
the the the four or five entities that
came

05:05:41.750 --> 05:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
came
 
05:05:43.590 --> 05:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
to us that are exist in the state of new
 
05:05:45.270 --> 05:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire i would presume would all be
 
05:05:47.910 --> 05:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
bidding on these jobs but this doesn't
 
05:05:50.470 --> 05:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
really force it
 
05:05:52.390 --> 05:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
to be in new hampshire only right this
 
05:05:55.510 --> 05:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
it could be a firm from mass or maine or
 
05:05:57.430 --> 05:05:57.440 align:start position:0%
mass domain or uh
 
05:05:58.868 --> 05:05:58.878 align:start position:0%
or from
 
05:06:01.830 --> 05:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
chicago or right so so so there will not
 
05:06:04.150 --> 05:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
be a lack of of bidders
 
05:06:06.788 --> 05:06:06.798 align:start position:0%
to these jobs this is not funneling into
 
05:06:06.798 --> 05:06:07.670 align:start position:0%
to these jobs this is not funneling into
a

05:06:07.670 --> 05:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:06:10.550 --> 05:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
single entity monopoly there there are
 
05:06:12.150 --> 05:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
there will still be the bidding process
 
05:06:13.750 --> 05:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
and all that right
 
05:06:13.760 --> 05:06:17.830 align:start position:0%
and all that right
yes

05:06:17.830 --> 05:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:19.750 --> 05:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
yes version of like us
 
05:06:22.390 --> 05:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
um thank you as uh
 
05:06:24.070 --> 05:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
you know as mentioned the only people uh
 
05:06:26.390 --> 05:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
testifying were uh in the people in the
 
05:06:28.470 --> 05:06:28.480 align:start position:0%
business and supporting it and it's the
 
05:06:31.430 --> 05:06:31.440 align:start position:0%
classic problem of concentrated benefits
 
05:06:33.670 --> 05:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
and diffuse costs um
 
05:06:35.750 --> 05:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
there are you know a limited number of
 
05:06:35.760 --> 05:06:37.190 align:start position:0%
there are you know a limited number of
uh

05:06:37.190 --> 05:06:37.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:06:39.190 --> 05:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
businesses that would uh benefit from
 
05:06:40.470 --> 05:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
this uh we just heard from the ones in
 
05:06:42.150 --> 05:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
new hampshire but there you know there's
 
05:06:43.190 --> 05:06:43.200 align:start position:0%
going to be some one was from
 
05:06:45.670 --> 05:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
massachusetts ah okay thank you
 
05:06:45.680 --> 05:06:46.868 align:start position:0%
massachusetts ah okay thank you
um

05:06:46.868 --> 05:06:46.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:06:47.990 --> 05:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
but the people that are going to be
 
05:06:50.230 --> 05:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
paying the price are
 
05:06:52.470 --> 05:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
the the uh you know individual taxpayers
 
05:06:52.480 --> 05:06:53.830 align:start position:0%
the the uh you know individual taxpayers
and

05:06:53.830 --> 05:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:06:54.788 --> 05:06:54.798 align:start position:0%
i mean for the most part they're
 
05:06:56.708 --> 05:06:56.718 align:start position:0%
probably not aware of this at all
 
05:06:59.350 --> 05:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
and the amount each would be affected
 
05:07:01.190 --> 05:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
would be small enough that it doesn't
 
05:07:01.200 --> 05:07:01.990 align:start position:0%
would be small enough that it doesn't
make

05:07:01.990 --> 05:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
make
 
05:07:04.070 --> 05:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
sense for them to come in and testify
 
05:07:07.590 --> 05:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
you know against it but it does add up
 
05:07:09.830 --> 05:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
across um all of them
 
05:07:11.430 --> 05:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
so i think you know as the
 
05:07:13.510 --> 05:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
representatives of those taxpayers i i
 
05:07:15.430 --> 05:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
see it as my job
 
05:07:17.670 --> 05:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
to represent them and protect them in
 
05:07:24.310 --> 05:07:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:26.230 --> 05:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
i think that the new hampshire residents
 
05:07:28.948 --> 05:07:28.958 align:start position:0%
would be rather surprised to find
 
05:07:31.270 --> 05:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
that the things that are built in new
 
05:07:33.190 --> 05:07:33.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire using
 
05:07:35.350 --> 05:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
is not using
 
05:07:37.670 --> 05:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
first of all new hampshire
 
05:07:39.910 --> 05:07:39.920 align:start position:0%
providers and second of all american
 
05:07:42.150 --> 05:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
steel i think that is the
 
05:07:42.160 --> 05:07:43.750 align:start position:0%
steel i think that is the
misunderstanding

05:07:43.750 --> 05:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding
 
05:07:45.910 --> 05:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
that excuse me that people have in new
 
05:07:48.868 --> 05:07:48.878 align:start position:0%
hampshire and i think taxpayers
 
05:07:50.708 --> 05:07:50.718 align:start position:0%
are should be
 
05:07:52.628 --> 05:07:52.638 align:start position:0%
would need to know that
 
05:07:55.030 --> 05:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
and i can't believe that anyone in this
 
05:07:57.830 --> 05:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
room is going to think that
 
05:07:59.750 --> 05:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
costs of things are going to skyrocket
 
05:08:01.670 --> 05:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
because we're
 
05:08:03.430 --> 05:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
passing this bill we don't know but
 
05:08:05.110 --> 05:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
we're speculating there's going to be a
 
05:08:07.750 --> 05:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
large amount and i think that's
 
05:08:07.760 --> 05:08:09.110 align:start position:0%
large amount and i think that's
um

05:08:09.110 --> 05:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:10.788 --> 05:08:10.798 align:start position:0%
an inappropriate
 
05:08:14.830 --> 05:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:17.350 --> 05:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
representatives um
 
05:08:19.510 --> 05:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
this is mostly a question i think but we
 
05:08:21.350 --> 05:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
keep talking about american steel but
 
05:08:24.070 --> 05:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
this the source of steel is not
 
05:08:26.230 --> 05:08:26.240 align:start position:0%
local it's not american
 
05:08:28.868 --> 05:08:28.878 align:start position:0%
it's only the manufacturing right the
 
05:08:31.990 --> 05:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
reshaping of it this bill specifies that
 
05:08:33.990 --> 05:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
the steel in question
 
05:08:36.708 --> 05:08:36.718 align:start position:0%
be smelted and made in america
 
05:08:38.948 --> 05:08:38.958 align:start position:0%
it does it doesn't say in new hampshire
 
05:08:40.470 --> 05:08:40.480 align:start position:0%
because there are no smelters in new
 
05:08:42.390 --> 05:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire okay that's that's my
 
05:08:44.470 --> 05:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah if i had made a follow-up
 
05:08:44.480 --> 05:08:45.270 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah if i had made a follow-up
then

05:08:45.270 --> 05:08:45.280 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:08:48.150 --> 05:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
i i would feel uneasy giving since we
 
05:08:49.670 --> 05:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
don't mention new hampshire here i'm not
 
05:08:51.190 --> 05:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
sure we're benefiting new hampshire
 
05:08:53.670 --> 05:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
company necessarily companies
 
05:08:55.110 --> 05:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
because they could come from elsewhere
 
05:08:57.350 --> 05:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
chicago anywhere
 
05:08:57.360 --> 05:08:58.788 align:start position:0%
chicago anywhere
um

05:08:58.788 --> 05:08:58.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:09:01.030 --> 05:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
so maybe that's the correction that
 
05:09:05.110 --> 05:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
needs to be made at least so thank you
 
05:09:06.868 --> 05:09:06.878 align:start position:0%
representative marsh
 
05:09:09.190 --> 05:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
yes i want to share that i pressed the
 
05:09:10.948 --> 05:09:10.958 align:start position:0%
people who testified pretty hard as to
 
05:09:12.390 --> 05:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
the source of their raw material we
 
05:09:14.390 --> 05:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
finally got some answers that they're
 
05:09:16.550 --> 05:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
mostly using smelters where they don't
 
05:09:17.990 --> 05:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
have recycled steel they're using
 
05:09:20.868 --> 05:09:20.878 align:start position:0%
smelters from down south such as alabama
 
05:09:25.190 --> 05:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:27.110 --> 05:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for that information
 
05:09:29.750 --> 05:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
any other comments or discussion
 
05:09:32.470 --> 05:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you madam chair
 
05:09:32.480 --> 05:09:34.070 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you madam chair
so

05:09:34.070 --> 05:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:09:36.070 --> 05:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
in regards to the
 
05:09:37.750 --> 05:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
you know asking the taxpayers to you
 
05:09:40.788 --> 05:09:40.798 align:start position:0%
know to come up with with more money
 
05:09:43.830 --> 05:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
i i believe every single day there's
 
05:09:48.390 --> 05:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
somebody whether it's at a local
 
05:09:49.910 --> 05:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
select board meeting it's a school board
 
05:09:51.510 --> 05:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
meeting or here in the legislator of the
 
05:09:52.708 --> 05:09:52.718 align:start position:0%
senate that
 
05:09:54.788 --> 05:09:54.798 align:start position:0%
somebody is asking the taxpayers come up
 
05:09:56.788 --> 05:09:56.798 align:start position:0%
with some more money for something
 
05:09:58.708 --> 05:09:58.718 align:start position:0%
whether it's you know it's
 
05:10:00.550 --> 05:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
it's necessarily a pet project or
 
05:10:02.868 --> 05:10:02.878 align:start position:0%
something to this scale but every single
 
05:10:04.948 --> 05:10:04.958 align:start position:0%
day we're asking people to come up with
 
05:10:06.628 --> 05:10:06.638 align:start position:0%
with money that we all are not going to
 
05:10:08.310 --> 05:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
necessarily agree with but i do know
 
05:10:10.310 --> 05:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
personally when i go to the store and i
 
05:10:12.310 --> 05:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
see something that's marked made from
 
05:10:15.030 --> 05:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
china or marked from usa even if i'm
 
05:10:15.040 --> 05:10:16.150 align:start position:0%
china or marked from usa even if i'm
paying

05:10:16.150 --> 05:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
paying
 
05:10:18.628 --> 05:10:18.638 align:start position:0%
20 cents more a dollar more i i
 
05:10:21.350 --> 05:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
personally tend to to buy that so again
 
05:10:23.270 --> 05:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to stick with my
 
05:10:25.510 --> 05:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
it has to stop and start
 
05:10:25.520 --> 05:10:29.750 align:start position:0%
it has to stop and start
someplace

05:10:29.750 --> 05:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:32.150 --> 05:10:32.160 align:start position:0%
representative bailey
 
05:10:34.070 --> 05:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
i i would just sort of comment that a
 
05:10:36.708 --> 05:10:36.718 align:start position:0%
choice of that is your personal choice
 
05:10:38.628 --> 05:10:38.638 align:start position:0%
whereas here we're deciding what the
 
05:10:41.350 --> 05:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
taxpayers will pay for a price what
 
05:10:43.510 --> 05:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
price they will pay and i don't think
 
05:10:48.948 --> 05:10:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:51.190 --> 05:10:51.200 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chair
 
05:10:55.190 --> 05:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
i think the topic is a double edged
 
05:10:56.550 --> 05:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
steel so
 
05:10:59.590 --> 05:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
i'm basically um i can see both sides
 
05:10:59.600 --> 05:11:00.550 align:start position:0%
i'm basically um i can see both sides
um

05:11:00.550 --> 05:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:02.550 --> 05:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
and uh but i will be voting against the
 
05:11:02.560 --> 05:11:05.350 align:start position:0%
and uh but i will be voting against the
itl

05:11:05.350 --> 05:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
itl
 
05:11:05.360 --> 05:11:07.270 align:start position:0%

um the idea of interim study was floated
 
05:13:44.550 --> 05:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
and i think that's a reasonable
 
05:13:44.560 --> 05:13:45.830 align:start position:0%
and i think that's a reasonable
alternative

05:13:45.830 --> 05:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
05:13:49.270 --> 05:13:49.280 align:start position:0%

1422 removes the subparagraph referring
 
05:19:03.750 --> 05:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
to the 20 percent
 
05:19:07.190 --> 05:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
25 percent increasing
 
05:19:09.990 --> 05:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
the allowable increase in cost as an
 
05:19:10.000 --> 05:19:11.190 align:start position:0%
the allowable increase in cost as an
exception

05:19:11.190 --> 05:19:11.200 align:start position:0%
exception
 
05:19:11.200 --> 05:19:12.230 align:start position:0%
exception
to

05:19:12.230 --> 05:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:19:13.830 --> 05:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
a waiver
 
05:19:15.030 --> 05:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
from um
 
05:19:15.040 --> 05:19:16.868 align:start position:0%
from um
purchasing

05:19:16.868 --> 05:19:16.878 align:start position:0%
purchasing
 
05:19:18.628 --> 05:19:18.638 align:start position:0%
and this was
 
05:19:21.990 --> 05:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
as discussed during the itl motion
 
05:19:24.470 --> 05:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
concern to many people because they felt
 
05:19:24.480 --> 05:19:25.270 align:start position:0%
concern to many people because they felt
that

05:19:25.270 --> 05:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:19:27.590 --> 05:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
it would add padding
 
05:19:29.030 --> 05:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
to the
 
05:19:29.040 --> 05:19:29.990 align:start position:0%
to the
um

05:19:29.990 --> 05:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:19:30.000 --> 05:19:31.110 align:start position:0%
um
quotes

05:19:31.110 --> 05:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
quotes
 
05:19:33.350 --> 05:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
and therefore i remove that
 
05:19:37.750 --> 05:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
and um there and should other
 
05:19:39.750 --> 05:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
should the um
 
05:19:43.110 --> 05:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
department of the the das find
 
05:19:45.510 --> 05:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
they can also find a waiver upon being
 
05:19:47.990 --> 05:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with public service public
 
05:19:50.550 --> 05:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
interest which could refer to the cost
 
05:19:52.788 --> 05:19:52.798 align:start position:0%
and also is not produced and fabricated
 
05:19:54.788 --> 05:19:54.798 align:start position:0%
in the united states and insufficient
 
05:19:58.230 --> 05:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:01.030 --> 05:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
and also it's not fabricated that
 
05:20:03.270 --> 05:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
would be in public interest so the
 
05:20:05.670 --> 05:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
public interest is part is still part of
 
05:20:05.680 --> 05:20:07.030 align:start position:0%
public interest is part is still part of
this

05:20:07.030 --> 05:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:20:09.510 --> 05:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
bill and therefore
 
05:20:12.628 --> 05:20:12.638 align:start position:0%
could include cost as a public interest
 
05:20:13.910 --> 05:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
if the
 
05:20:16.230 --> 05:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
price is out of line with what the
 
05:20:18.788 --> 05:20:18.798 align:start position:0%
community can afford
 
05:20:20.390 --> 05:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
that's a very long explanation i
 
05:20:20.400 --> 05:20:21.910 align:start position:0%
that's a very long explanation i
apologize

05:20:21.910 --> 05:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
05:20:23.430 --> 05:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
representative marsh do you wish to
 
05:20:25.350 --> 05:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
speak to your second uh yes i want to
 
05:20:28.230 --> 05:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
say that putting into statute a uh
 
05:20:31.030 --> 05:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
bidding process where up to a 25
 
05:20:33.110 --> 05:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh premium is allowed is the practical
 
05:20:35.190 --> 05:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
guarantee that you'll get 24 and a half
 
05:20:38.070 --> 05:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
percent uh bids on your contract so that
 
05:20:40.230 --> 05:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
should not go into statute and i agree
 
05:20:41.750 --> 05:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
entirely with the representative grota
 
05:20:43.830 --> 05:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
that the first uh
 
05:20:45.350 --> 05:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
point that application the project would
 
05:20:47.270 --> 05:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
be inconsistent with the public interest
 
05:20:50.548 --> 05:20:50.558 align:start position:0%
uh gives them plenty of leeway to uh put
 
05:20:53.510 --> 05:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
through waivers when necessary
 
05:20:55.750 --> 05:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
representative laccas
 
05:20:55.760 --> 05:20:57.030 align:start position:0%
representative laccas
um

05:20:57.030 --> 05:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:58.708 --> 05:20:58.718 align:start position:0%
i mean i understand that the argument
 
05:21:01.270 --> 05:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
about not putting 25 in because it would
 
05:21:02.940 --> 05:21:02.950 align:start position:0%
attract such bids but
 
05:21:02.950 --> 05:21:04.788 align:start position:0%
attract such bids but
[Music]

05:21:04.788 --> 05:21:04.798 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:21:07.350 --> 05:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
public interest is pretty fuzzy and
 
05:21:09.350 --> 05:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
since we're already indicating that
 
05:21:11.750 --> 05:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
we're willing to provide subsidies
 
05:21:13.750 --> 05:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
i mean the question is that at what
 
05:21:16.948 --> 05:21:16.958 align:start position:0%
what's the threshold for the das to uh
 
05:21:18.548 --> 05:21:18.558 align:start position:0%
to claim it's inconsistent with the
 
05:21:20.788 --> 05:21:20.798 align:start position:0%
public interest you could argue any
 
05:21:23.190 --> 05:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
um bump in price is inconsistent with
 
05:21:25.350 --> 05:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
the public interest and given that we
 
05:21:28.628 --> 05:21:28.638 align:start position:0%
we removed it i'm not sure
 
05:21:30.150 --> 05:21:30.160 align:start position:0%
under what circumstances they would be
 
05:21:31.750 --> 05:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
able to claim that i'm not comfortable
 
05:21:34.628 --> 05:21:34.638 align:start position:0%
with this
 
05:21:37.030 --> 05:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
representative pearson and then fellows
 
05:21:39.910 --> 05:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
if i because i'm truly trying to digest
 
05:21:42.150 --> 05:21:42.160 align:start position:0%
what the removal of
 
05:21:44.470 --> 05:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
four means to me it looks like it it
 
05:21:44.480 --> 05:21:45.910 align:start position:0%
four means to me it looks like it it
makes

05:21:45.910 --> 05:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
makes
 
05:21:45.920 --> 05:21:47.750 align:start position:0%
makes
the

05:21:47.750 --> 05:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:21:48.948 --> 05:21:48.958 align:start position:0%
it gives the department of
 
05:21:51.510 --> 05:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
administrative services now a greater
 
05:21:54.868 --> 05:21:54.878 align:start position:0%
ability to waive this
 
05:21:57.030 --> 05:21:57.040 align:start position:0%
because you know you had a you had this
 
05:21:59.990 --> 05:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
25 more criteria well that's essentially
 
05:22:03.270 --> 05:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
gone away so now we've
 
05:22:04.310 --> 05:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
this would give the department
 
05:22:06.868 --> 05:22:06.878 align:start position:0%
administrative services
 
05:22:09.110 --> 05:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
greater flexibility
 
05:22:11.830 --> 05:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
to not follow this so
 
05:22:13.510 --> 05:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't think this makes
 
05:22:14.868 --> 05:22:14.878 align:start position:0%
makes it more difficult i think it makes
 
05:22:16.948 --> 05:22:16.958 align:start position:0%
it easier for the state to
 
05:22:18.390 --> 05:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
to say now we're going with something
 
05:22:18.400 --> 05:22:20.230 align:start position:0%
to say now we're going with something
else

05:22:20.230 --> 05:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
else
 
05:22:21.990 --> 05:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative phillips
 
05:22:25.350 --> 05:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair um actually if
 
05:22:27.030 --> 05:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
i were going to
 
05:22:30.070 --> 05:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
make an amendment i would take the 25
 
05:22:32.310 --> 05:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
and make it lower but
 
05:22:35.590 --> 05:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
um that's aside for now and
 
05:22:37.510 --> 05:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
i would just respond to representative
 
05:22:37.520 --> 05:22:38.628 align:start position:0%
i would just respond to representative
leckus

05:22:38.628 --> 05:22:38.638 align:start position:0%
leckus
 
05:22:41.510 --> 05:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
that if you look on line 18
 
05:22:44.788 --> 05:22:44.798 align:start position:0%
it says so assume assume that the 25
 
05:22:46.150 --> 05:22:46.160 align:start position:0%
comes out
 
05:22:47.830 --> 05:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
it says in granting a waiver the
 
05:22:49.910 --> 05:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
department shall consider all
 
05:22:52.788 --> 05:22:52.798 align:start position:0%
appropriate factors including
 
05:22:54.230 --> 05:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
any cost
 
05:22:56.868 --> 05:22:56.878 align:start position:0%
so they but they'll have to explain why
 
05:23:00.470 --> 05:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
they did it so they'll they can say
 
05:23:04.230 --> 05:23:04.240 align:start position:0%
you know the cost is you know
 
05:23:05.830 --> 05:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
100 000
 
05:23:05.840 --> 05:23:07.350 align:start position:0%
100 000
higher

05:23:07.350 --> 05:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
higher
 
05:23:09.110 --> 05:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:23:11.190 --> 05:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
that's why we're going to grant a waiver
 
05:23:13.750 --> 05:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
and go with foreign steel but they have
 
05:23:20.548 --> 05:23:20.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:23.030 --> 05:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else
 
05:23:25.030 --> 05:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
i agree with representative fellows that
 
05:23:26.628 --> 05:23:26.638 align:start position:0%
if you're going to that the more
 
05:23:28.708 --> 05:23:28.718 align:start position:0%
appropriate thing to do would be to save
 
05:23:31.350 --> 05:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
steel as a small part of these contracts
 
05:23:32.948 --> 05:23:32.958 align:start position:0%
therefore it should only increase the
 
05:23:34.628 --> 05:23:34.638 align:start position:0%
total cost by
 
05:23:37.590 --> 05:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
two percent or something like that
 
05:23:37.600 --> 05:23:39.110 align:start position:0%
two percent or something like that
but

05:23:39.110 --> 05:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:23:41.990 --> 05:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
but uh that's not what we're discussing
 
05:23:48.708 --> 05:23:48.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:50.470 --> 05:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
all right the motion is to adopt

05:28:14.230 --> 05:28:14.240 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:28:18.070 --> 05:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:20.708 --> 05:28:20.718 align:start position:0%
okay i'm gonna noodle all this out after
 
05:28:21.750 --> 05:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:28:23.350 --> 05:28:23.360 align:start position:0%
do you what's that one do we have your
 
05:28:27.110 --> 05:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
amendment representative uh no no
 
05:28:27.120 --> 05:28:31.910 align:start position:0%
amendment representative uh no no
okay

05:28:31.910 --> 05:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:35.030 --> 05:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
well if we don't have the amendment for
 
05:28:37.670 --> 05:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
house bill 433
 
05:28:40.470 --> 05:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
let's move back to our debate on
 
05:28:46.788 --> 05:28:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:48.708 --> 05:28:48.718 align:start position:0%
where we had been
 
05:28:50.708 --> 05:28:50.718 align:start position:0%
which had an octopass motion by
 
05:28:52.708 --> 05:28:52.718 align:start position:0%
representative pearson second by
 
05:28:55.030 --> 05:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
representative schuett
 
05:28:59.190 --> 05:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:01.750 --> 05:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
all right give everyone a moment to
 
05:29:03.990 --> 05:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
remember representative schuett
 
05:29:06.150 --> 05:29:06.160 align:start position:0%
thank you um i just wanted to make the
 
05:29:08.070 --> 05:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
comment that uh
 
05:29:09.990 --> 05:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
this committee and in fact the full
 
05:29:10.000 --> 05:29:11.510 align:start position:0%
this committee and in fact the full
house

05:29:11.510 --> 05:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
house
 
05:29:14.830 --> 05:29:14.840 align:start position:0%
voted last year in favor of house bill
 
05:29:17.590 --> 05:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
356 i believe it was
 
05:29:17.600 --> 05:29:19.270 align:start position:0%
356 i believe it was
that

05:29:19.270 --> 05:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:29:22.628 --> 05:29:22.638 align:start position:0%
recognized public works employees
 
05:29:24.868 --> 05:29:24.878 align:start position:0%
as part of the first responder team in
 
05:29:26.868 --> 05:29:26.878 align:start position:0%
certain circumstances for the fact of
 
05:29:28.868 --> 05:29:28.878 align:start position:0%
granting them death benefits if they're
 
05:29:32.390 --> 05:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
killed in one of those circumstances
 
05:29:34.470 --> 05:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
so i i think
 
05:29:36.390 --> 05:29:36.400 align:start position:0%
that certainly shows the argument that
 
05:29:39.030 --> 05:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
public works employees who are on the
 
05:29:42.230 --> 05:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
scene of emergencies
 
05:29:44.548 --> 05:29:44.558 align:start position:0%
should qualify well i'd like to comment
 
05:29:46.548 --> 05:29:46.558 align:start position:0%
that there doesn't appear to be
 
05:29:46.558 --> 05:29:47.350 align:start position:0%
that there doesn't appear to be
much

05:29:47.350 --> 05:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
much
 
05:29:50.390 --> 05:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
discrepancy with including or
 
05:29:52.548 --> 05:29:52.558 align:start position:0%
much difficulty to anyone with including
 
05:29:55.110 --> 05:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
public works employees it's the whole
 
05:29:57.190 --> 05:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
long list of other
 
05:30:00.150 --> 05:30:00.160 align:start position:0%
people that are not normally considered
 
05:30:02.548 --> 05:30:02.558 align:start position:0%
first responders
 
05:30:04.868 --> 05:30:04.878 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
05:30:07.910 --> 05:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure that i got it right but
 
05:30:10.788 --> 05:30:10.798 align:start position:0%
i tried to look up in the rsas
 
05:30:13.190 --> 05:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
and under homeland security
 
05:30:15.510 --> 05:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
to see what this would impact because
 
05:30:17.750 --> 05:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
this is just a definition
 
05:30:21.030 --> 05:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
of first responders and and i could it i
 
05:30:23.750 --> 05:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
only came up it only found one word one
 
05:30:23.760 --> 05:30:24.708 align:start position:0%
only came up it only found one word one
place

05:30:24.708 --> 05:30:24.718 align:start position:0%
place
 
05:30:27.110 --> 05:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
where it said first responder
 
05:30:29.270 --> 05:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
which didn't have anything really didn't
 
05:30:31.990 --> 05:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
have any impact at all
 
05:30:32.000 --> 05:30:33.430 align:start position:0%
have any impact at all
so

05:30:33.430 --> 05:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:30:33.440 --> 05:30:34.868 align:start position:0%
so
okay

05:30:34.868 --> 05:30:34.878 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:30:37.110 --> 05:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
uh representative allegro and then lakas
 
05:30:38.788 --> 05:30:38.798 align:start position:0%
and then chew it again
 
05:30:40.390 --> 05:30:40.400 align:start position:0%
yeah i too tried to look up the
 
05:30:42.230 --> 05:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
definition of first responders and i
 
05:30:45.430 --> 05:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
found it in about a half a dozen regular
 
05:30:45.440 --> 05:30:46.708 align:start position:0%
found it in about a half a dozen regular
dictionaries

05:30:46.708 --> 05:30:46.718 align:start position:0%
dictionaries
 
05:30:49.590 --> 05:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
and uh words do have meaning
 
05:30:51.510 --> 05:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
and also in a department of labor
 
05:30:51.520 --> 05:30:52.628 align:start position:0%
and also in a department of labor
document

05:30:52.628 --> 05:30:52.638 align:start position:0%
document
 
05:30:54.948 --> 05:30:54.958 align:start position:0%
and i saw definitions like
 
05:30:57.750 --> 05:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
a person such as a police officer or emt
 
05:30:59.430 --> 05:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
who was among those responsible for
 
05:31:01.430 --> 05:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
going immediately to the scene of an
 
05:31:03.430 --> 05:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
accident or emergency blah blah blah a
 
05:31:05.910 --> 05:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
person employed in the public sector emt
 
05:31:10.708 --> 05:31:10.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:13.830 --> 05:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
a police officer firefighter emt a
 
05:31:16.150 --> 05:31:16.160 align:start position:0%
military related website said they're
 
05:31:17.990 --> 05:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
the first to arrive and help at
 
05:31:19.830 --> 05:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
emergency scenes
 
05:31:23.750 --> 05:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh department of labor uh lists um
 
05:31:26.708 --> 05:31:26.718 align:start position:0%
a bunch of criteria and and detectives
 
05:31:28.230 --> 05:31:28.240 align:start position:0%
deputy sheriff so they're a little bit
 
05:31:31.270 --> 05:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
more expansive police officers
 
05:31:33.510 --> 05:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
highway patrol officers and so on they
 
05:31:35.750 --> 05:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
include those definitions
 
05:31:35.760 --> 05:31:38.230 align:start position:0%
include those definitions
those

05:31:38.230 --> 05:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:41.030 --> 05:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
positions under first responders
 
05:31:43.110 --> 05:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
i think that we could go on
 
05:31:46.310 --> 05:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
expanding and expanding and expanding
 
05:31:47.830 --> 05:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
and we're just changing the meaning of
 
05:31:50.628 --> 05:31:50.638 align:start position:0%
the english in the english language
 
05:31:50.638 --> 05:31:52.070 align:start position:0%
the english in the english language
and

05:31:52.070 --> 05:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:31:54.310 --> 05:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
at the moment it may not have
 
05:31:54.320 --> 05:31:56.070 align:start position:0%
at the moment it may not have
implications

05:31:56.070 --> 05:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
implications
 
05:31:56.080 --> 05:31:56.868 align:start position:0%
implications
for

05:31:56.868 --> 05:31:56.878 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:31:59.510 --> 05:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
benefits and insurance and all kinds of
 
05:32:01.590 --> 05:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
stuff like that but
 
05:32:03.110 --> 05:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
you know clearly if the department of
 
05:32:05.510 --> 05:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
labor is defining it
 
05:32:05.520 --> 05:32:07.750 align:start position:0%
labor is defining it
well

05:32:07.750 --> 05:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:32:09.750 --> 05:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
all of those implications are to be
 
05:32:12.230 --> 05:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
included at some point
 
05:32:13.830 --> 05:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
representative lackas
 
05:32:15.430 --> 05:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
05:32:17.910 --> 05:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
i think you heard earlier i may not have
 
05:32:19.590 --> 05:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
the words exactly right but basically
 
05:32:23.190 --> 05:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
it's a symbolic or recognizing and
 
05:32:25.030 --> 05:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
i mean i don't
 
05:32:26.948 --> 05:32:26.958 align:start position:0%
have any huge concerns about this but i
 
05:32:29.350 --> 05:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
don't really see any serious value in it
 
05:32:31.830 --> 05:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
and so i intend to vote against the otp
 
05:32:33.750 --> 05:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
just on that thank you
 
05:32:35.750 --> 05:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
representative schuett
 
05:32:37.750 --> 05:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:32:39.830 --> 05:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
i would further point out that
 
05:32:43.030 --> 05:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic we heard about
 
05:32:45.190 --> 05:32:45.200 align:start position:0%
ambulances lined up
 
05:32:47.350 --> 05:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
bringing patients
 
05:32:50.548 --> 05:32:50.558 align:start position:0%
who in fact many of whom were dying
 
05:32:51.830 --> 05:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
of covid
 
05:32:55.030 --> 05:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
to emergency rooms and the nurses
 
05:32:55.040 --> 05:32:56.548 align:start position:0%
to emergency rooms and the nurses
doctors

05:32:56.548 --> 05:32:56.558 align:start position:0%
doctors
 
05:32:58.628 --> 05:32:58.638 align:start position:0%
people at the hospitals who were
 
05:33:00.548 --> 05:33:00.558 align:start position:0%
receiving those patients
 
05:33:02.868 --> 05:33:02.878 align:start position:0%
i would say we're acting under emergency
 
05:33:02.878 --> 05:33:05.350 align:start position:0%
i would say we're acting under emergency
conditions

05:33:05.350 --> 05:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
05:33:08.150 --> 05:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
as first responder
 
05:33:08.160 --> 05:33:09.510 align:start position:0%
as first responder
and

05:33:09.510 --> 05:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:33:11.670 --> 05:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
anyone else we're all back up to speed
 
05:33:15.590 --> 05:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:15.600 --> 05:33:17.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:33:17.030 --> 05:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:33:19.190 --> 05:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh in that case the motion is ought to
 
05:33:21.590 --> 05:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
pass by representative pearson
 
05:33:24.150 --> 05:33:24.160 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
05:34:22.548 --> 05:34:22.558 align:start position:0%
we meant house rules so that the clerks
 
05:34:24.548 --> 05:34:24.558 align:start position:0%
get a little shock collar maybe for the
 
05:34:27.750 --> 05:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
chairs to remind them
 
05:34:31.030 --> 05:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
actually just just re redo the sheet so
 
05:34:33.430 --> 05:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
that they say so that i'm at the bottom
 
05:34:35.830 --> 05:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
but in this case i think i will vote yes
 
05:34:38.948 --> 05:34:38.958 align:start position:0%
for this symbolic bill okay
 
05:34:42.230 --> 05:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
the vote is 1524
 
05:34:43.510 --> 05:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:34:45.590 --> 05:34:45.600 align:start position:0%

yes ma'am is there going to be a
 
05:34:55.190 --> 05:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:57.030 --> 05:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
all right representative allegro i've

05:35:06.470 --> 05:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
procedural question in reference to
 
05:35:08.070 --> 05:35:08.080 align:start position:0%

bill

05:35:08.868 --> 05:35:08.878 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:35:11.030 --> 05:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
you you filed amendment that is still
 
05:35:13.190 --> 05:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
that deals with part four my amendment
 
05:35:15.110 --> 05:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
deals with part five could we not as a
 
05:35:16.548 --> 05:35:16.558 align:start position:0%
committee adopt both amendments and then
 
05:35:18.788 --> 05:35:18.798 align:start position:0%
ols do we have both of them well yours
 
05:35:20.230 --> 05:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
exists and mine exists because you
 
05:35:22.548 --> 05:35:22.558 align:start position:0%
emailed us yours oh so they do both
 
05:35:22.558 --> 05:35:23.590 align:start position:0%
emailed us yours oh so they do both
exist

exist
 
05:35:25.670 --> 05:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely okay so then that'll take
 
05:35:26.708 --> 05:35:26.718 align:start position:0%
care of that
 
05:35:28.628 --> 05:35:28.638 align:start position:0%
it being a deadline
 
05:35:31.510 --> 05:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
okay so 325 is not all consent correct
 
05:35:42.788 --> 05:35:42.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:44.070 --> 05:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
05:35:46.230 --> 05:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
okay so which one okay which amendment
 
05:35:48.230 --> 05:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
do we do we want to adopt you we had
 
05:35:50.310 --> 05:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
started with the amendment for we should
 
05:35:52.230 --> 05:35:52.240 align:start position:0%
finish your amendment since
 
05:35:54.310 --> 05:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
is being delayed
 
05:35:55.750 --> 05:35:55.760 align:start position:0%
yeah we're not going to need ols at this
 
05:35:57.910 --> 05:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
point okay
 
05:36:01.510 --> 05:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
we are through with senate bill 325
 
05:36:04.868 --> 05:36:04.878 align:start position:0%
and we still have senate bill
 
05:36:09.030 --> 05:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
358 443 440 433
 
05:36:09.040 --> 05:36:10.590 align:start position:0%
358 443 440 433
443

05:36:10.590 --> 05:36:10.600 align:start position:0%
443
 
05:36:13.830 --> 05:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
443 god i should not be doing my taxes
 
05:36:15.430 --> 05:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
tonight that's for sure
 
05:36:16.948 --> 05:36:16.958 align:start position:0%
that's true
 
05:36:18.628 --> 05:36:18.638 align:start position:0%
okay so we are
 
05:36:20.708 --> 05:36:20.718 align:start position:0%
considering the amendment from
 
05:36:23.510 --> 05:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
representative pearson yes it was and
 
05:36:24.470 --> 05:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
due to
 
05:36:26.390 --> 05:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
technical difficulties we will then
 
05:36:29.350 --> 05:36:29.360 align:start position:0%
consider my amendment
 
05:36:29.360 --> 05:36:30.788 align:start position:0%
consider my amendment
correct

05:36:30.788 --> 05:36:30.798 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:36:32.548 --> 05:36:32.558 align:start position:0%
okay yep so
 
05:36:34.230 --> 05:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
yeah since both of these amendments deal
 
05:36:36.868 --> 05:36:36.878 align:start position:0%
with a different part they'll
 
05:36:40.788 --> 05:36:40.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:42.708 --> 05:36:42.718 align:start position:0%
house staff about this
 
05:36:46.230 --> 05:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
no it is 1426 that's the uh
 
05:36:48.788 --> 05:36:48.798 align:start position:0%
the first amendment is
 
05:36:51.830 --> 05:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
amendment 1426 h which representative
 
05:36:54.230 --> 05:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
pearson passed around earlier deals with
 
05:36:55.910 --> 05:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
section five
 
05:36:57.430 --> 05:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
yep okay
 
05:36:59.910 --> 05:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
so we we did have discussion with this
 
05:37:01.830 --> 05:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
the state fire marshal has weighed in on
 
05:37:03.510 --> 05:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
on his concerns
 
05:37:03.520 --> 05:37:04.948 align:start position:0%
on his concerns
um

05:37:04.948 --> 05:37:04.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:07.030 --> 05:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
or not his concerns how how this makes
 
05:37:08.868 --> 05:37:08.878 align:start position:0%
the world better for him
 
05:37:08.878 --> 05:37:10.230 align:start position:0%
the world better for him
and

05:37:10.230 --> 05:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:37:12.548 --> 05:37:12.558 align:start position:0%
uh in his office
 
05:37:14.390 --> 05:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
and uh we did hear from representative
 
05:37:16.708 --> 05:37:16.718 align:start position:0%
fellows and as to her concerns as well
 
05:37:19.110 --> 05:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the score you know the
 
05:37:20.470 --> 05:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
okay if you're keeping score that's kind
 
05:37:21.910 --> 05:37:21.920 align:start position:0%
of where we are
 
05:37:24.470 --> 05:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
yes back to the i think it's the third
 
05:37:26.390 --> 05:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
inning on this one
 
05:37:28.548 --> 05:37:28.558 align:start position:0%
so is does anyone else wish to comment
 
05:37:31.750 --> 05:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
on this amendment representative fellows
 
05:37:33.830 --> 05:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
just to add to what i previously said
 
05:37:35.830 --> 05:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
that i think it's like way too much
 
05:37:39.430 --> 05:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy and a burden on the the um
 
05:37:42.150 --> 05:37:42.160 align:start position:0%
local communities also i would like to
 
05:37:44.788 --> 05:37:44.798 align:start position:0%
point out that on the fiscal note that
 
05:37:48.070 --> 05:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
there's a cost of 72 000
 
05:37:51.030 --> 05:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
to do this because somebody wants a
 
05:37:51.040 --> 05:37:53.110 align:start position:0%
to do this because somebody wants a
position

05:37:53.110 --> 05:37:53.120 align:start position:0%
position
 
05:37:55.590 --> 05:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
yes the cost is within the department of
 
05:37:55.600 --> 05:37:56.548 align:start position:0%
yes the cost is within the department of
safety

05:37:56.548 --> 05:37:56.558 align:start position:0%
safety
 
05:37:58.628 --> 05:37:58.638 align:start position:0%
and the building control board to
 
05:38:01.510 --> 05:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:02.948 --> 05:38:02.958 align:start position:0%
i'd like can i add to this
 
05:38:04.548 --> 05:38:04.558 align:start position:0%
representative pearson thank you madam
 
05:38:05.910 --> 05:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
chair um also in discussions with the
 
05:38:07.430 --> 05:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
state fire marshal
 
05:38:09.030 --> 05:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
as some of you may or may not be aware
 
05:38:12.150 --> 05:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
the state agencies go through a period
 
05:38:15.270 --> 05:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
of uh review i'm gonna butcher this but
 
05:38:16.868 --> 05:38:16.878 align:start position:0%
tech review will call it to update your
 
05:38:19.830 --> 05:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
websites and you guys seem to be kind of
 
05:38:22.708 --> 05:38:22.718 align:start position:0%
near the on deck circle right now anyway
 
05:38:25.350 --> 05:38:25.360 align:start position:0%
so what a what a great time to to make a
 
05:38:27.590 --> 05:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
couple of changes to their website when
 
05:38:29.910 --> 05:38:29.920 align:start position:0%
they're already up for
 
05:38:31.510 --> 05:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
an overhaul through the normal
 
05:38:33.270 --> 05:38:33.280 align:start position:0%
scheduling process of
 
05:38:35.030 --> 05:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
of this so
 
05:38:36.628 --> 05:38:36.638 align:start position:0%
convenient it might cost less than the
 
05:38:36.638 --> 05:38:37.990 align:start position:0%
convenient it might cost less than the
decision

05:38:37.990 --> 05:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
decision
 
05:38:39.910 --> 05:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
amazingly timely
 
05:38:41.750 --> 05:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
one never knows does one representative
 
05:38:42.788 --> 05:38:42.798 align:start position:0%
like us
 
05:38:44.628 --> 05:38:44.638 align:start position:0%
thank you actually my concern is that
 
05:38:46.628 --> 05:38:46.638 align:start position:0%
the process may be a little too simple
 
05:38:47.830 --> 05:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
but um
 
05:38:49.670 --> 05:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
there is a more detailed process laid
 
05:38:51.190 --> 05:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
out for building codes i would have
 
05:38:53.430 --> 05:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
preferred a similar process here for the
 
05:38:55.670 --> 05:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
fire codes but
 
05:38:57.910 --> 05:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
given the circumstances i will uh i will
 
05:38:59.110 --> 05:38:59.120 align:start position:0%
support this
 
05:38:59.120 --> 05:39:00.470 align:start position:0%
support this
yeah

05:39:00.470 --> 05:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:39:02.150 --> 05:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
i'd like to comment there are probably
 
05:39:04.868 --> 05:39:04.878 align:start position:0%
far fewer amendments to the building to
 
05:39:07.750 --> 05:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
the fire code than the building codes
 
05:39:10.150 --> 05:39:10.160 align:start position:0%
which would make it less
 
05:39:12.868 --> 05:39:12.878 align:start position:0%
less critical that we specify the
 
05:39:16.548 --> 05:39:16.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:18.470 --> 05:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
because i mean i've i've actually never
 
05:39:20.548 --> 05:39:20.558 align:start position:0%
heard of it anyone talking about an
 
05:39:23.750 --> 05:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
amendment to the fire code
 
05:39:25.190 --> 05:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
and that's part of where this problem
 
05:39:27.990 --> 05:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
lies is that they're the the actual
 
05:39:30.070 --> 05:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate procedure
 
05:39:32.628 --> 05:39:32.638 align:start position:0%
locally to go through a your local
 
05:39:35.510 --> 05:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
legislative process of formally adopting
 
05:39:37.830 --> 05:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
seems to not really occur
 
05:39:37.840 --> 05:39:39.110 align:start position:0%
seems to not really occur
and

05:39:39.110 --> 05:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:39:40.708 --> 05:39:40.718 align:start position:0%
well no wonder we don't know about them
 
05:39:40.718 --> 05:39:41.430 align:start position:0%
well no wonder we don't know about them
and

05:39:41.430 --> 05:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:39:44.830 --> 05:39:44.840 align:start position:0%
this and because of that we have
 
05:39:47.910 --> 05:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
rogue bureaucrats in essence creating
 
05:39:50.628 --> 05:39:50.638 align:start position:0%
things that don't really exist so
 
05:39:52.070 --> 05:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
you know you can't just make this stuff
 
05:39:54.070 --> 05:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
up on the fly anymore that's never been
 
05:39:55.830 --> 05:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
okay and it certainly should not be okay
 
05:39:58.230 --> 05:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
moving forward representative blackis
 
05:39:59.910 --> 05:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
thank you that's actually why i'm uh
 
05:40:01.030 --> 05:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
even though with some concern i'm
 
05:40:03.430 --> 05:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
willing to support it because uh
 
05:40:07.110 --> 05:40:07.120 align:start position:0%
ad hoc rules are are not legitimate and
 
05:40:09.030 --> 05:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
i'd like to see that change thank you
 
05:40:09.040 --> 05:40:10.708 align:start position:0%

chair the um aside from the the two
 
05:44:28.070 --> 05:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
little tweaks that we did you know we've
 
05:44:29.270 --> 05:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
we've uh
 
05:44:31.110 --> 05:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
we heard from the the players in this
 
05:44:34.548 --> 05:44:34.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:36.310 --> 05:44:36.320 align:start position:0%
we have a long a long history of some
 
05:44:38.628 --> 05:44:38.638 align:start position:0%
frustrations with with how things have
 
05:44:40.390 --> 05:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
gone in the past and this
 
05:44:40.400 --> 05:44:41.670 align:start position:0%
gone in the past and this
will

05:44:41.670 --> 05:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
will
 
05:44:43.990 --> 05:44:44.000 align:start position:0%
smooth some of that out so
 
05:44:44.000 --> 05:44:45.430 align:start position:0%
smooth some of that out so
um

05:44:45.430 --> 05:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:44:47.030 --> 05:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
i think that this is this is going to
 
05:44:47.040 --> 05:44:48.390 align:start position:0%
i think that this is this is going to
work

05:44:48.390 --> 05:44:48.400 align:start position:0%
work
 
05:44:49.910 --> 05:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
and i think this is going to work not
 
05:44:51.270 --> 05:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
only just for the contractors because we
 
05:44:52.628 --> 05:44:52.638 align:start position:0%
don't certainly just represent them but
 
05:44:53.510 --> 05:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
i think it's going to work for joe
 
05:44:55.110 --> 05:44:55.120 align:start position:0%
homeowner too so
 
05:44:57.350 --> 05:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
i'm certainly in favor of this
 
05:45:00.628 --> 05:45:00.638 align:start position:0%
this change and uh
 
05:45:00.638 --> 05:45:01.350 align:start position:0%
this change and uh
in

05:45:01.350 --> 05:45:01.360 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:45:03.590 --> 05:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
tightening up what we're doing
 
05:45:05.750 --> 05:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
representing goldie
 
05:45:08.150 --> 05:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i think this is a
 
05:45:10.948 --> 05:45:10.958 align:start position:0%
big step forward in the codes and i
 
05:45:11.830 --> 05:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
think there's going to be a lot of
 
05:45:13.030 --> 05:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
people out there that are going to
 
05:45:14.548 --> 05:45:14.558 align:start position:0%
appreciate this change
 
05:45:14.558 --> 05:45:15.430 align:start position:0%
appreciate this change
yes

05:45:15.430 --> 05:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:45:18.150 --> 05:45:18.160 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
05:45:20.390 --> 05:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
i'd like to comment that this was a
 
05:45:22.470 --> 05:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the study committee on
 
05:45:23.990 --> 05:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
building codes
 
05:45:24.000 --> 05:45:25.910 align:start position:0%
building codes
and

05:45:25.910 --> 05:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:45:28.070 --> 05:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
keeping track of the municipal
 
05:45:28.080 --> 05:45:29.990 align:start position:0%
keeping track of the municipal
amendments

05:45:29.990 --> 05:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
05:45:32.708 --> 05:45:32.718 align:start position:0%
has always been a hassle
 
05:45:32.718 --> 05:45:33.510 align:start position:0%
has always been a hassle
and

05:45:33.510 --> 05:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:45:35.990 --> 05:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
this is this does not require any
 
05:45:38.230 --> 05:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
municipality to go back
 
05:45:41.590 --> 05:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
and re-adopt its current amendments nor
 
05:45:43.430 --> 05:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
to send any of its current amendments
 
05:45:45.670 --> 05:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
the building code review board
 
05:45:47.670 --> 05:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
however with the state building code
 
05:45:50.470 --> 05:45:50.480 align:start position:0%

05:49:21.750 --> 05:49:21.760 align:start position:0%

subcommittee one suggestion was that the
 
05:49:25.760 --> 05:49:28.070 align:start position:0%
subcommittee one suggestion was that the
um

05:49:28.070 --> 05:49:28.080 align:start position:0%

05:49:35.840 --> 05:49:36.708 align:start position:0%
just to verify license status
but

05:49:36.708 --> 05:49:36.718 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:49:38.788 --> 05:49:38.798 align:start position:0%
when we asked them for some language to
 
05:49:42.788 --> 05:49:42.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:45.350 --> 05:49:45.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of bureaucracy and rather
 
05:49:47.110 --> 05:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
expensive as well
 
05:49:50.788 --> 05:49:50.798 align:start position:0%
and since the problems are
 
05:49:53.430 --> 05:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
concentrated in the cities and the
 
05:49:55.030 --> 05:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
larger towns
 
05:49:55.040 --> 05:49:56.230 align:start position:0%
larger towns
it

05:49:56.230 --> 05:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:49:58.788 --> 05:49:58.798 align:start position:0%
requiring statewide licensure of the
 
05:49:58.798 --> 05:50:00.470 align:start position:0%
requiring statewide licensure of the
establishments

05:50:00.470 --> 05:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
establishments
 
05:50:04.788 --> 05:50:04.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:08.390 --> 05:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:09.990 --> 05:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
anyone that's right you weren't there
 
05:50:12.868 --> 05:50:12.878 align:start position:0%
when we were discussing that
 
05:50:18.788 --> 05:50:18.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:18.798 --> 05:50:20.310 align:start position:0%

author of this
 
05:52:39.110 --> 05:52:39.120 align:start position:0%
um having been filed by senator birdsell
 
05:52:39.120 --> 05:52:40.470 align:start position:0%
um having been filed by senator birdsell
this

05:52:40.470 --> 05:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:52:42.470 --> 05:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
continues the commission this is not one
 
05:52:44.150 --> 05:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
of those derelict commissions that exist
 
05:52:46.390 --> 05:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
on paper that the speaker has to figure
 
05:52:48.150 --> 05:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
out somebody to sit on this commission
 
05:52:48.160 --> 05:52:48.868 align:start position:0%
out somebody to sit on this commission
is

05:52:48.868 --> 05:52:48.878 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:52:52.070 --> 05:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
quite active it does meet monthly
 
05:52:55.190 --> 05:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
and its work is ongoing
 
05:52:58.390 --> 05:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
as we discussed earlier the the simple
 
05:53:00.390 --> 05:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
changing of the date wouldn't quite work
 
05:53:02.150 --> 05:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
because the
 
05:53:04.230 --> 05:53:04.240 align:start position:0%
when you write a bill for a commission
 
05:53:07.350 --> 05:53:07.360 align:start position:0%
the bills indicate what the purpose and
 
05:53:10.708 --> 05:53:10.718 align:start position:0%
scope of the commission is and
 
05:53:10.718 --> 05:53:11.510 align:start position:0%
scope of the commission is and
that

05:53:11.510 --> 05:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:53:14.470 --> 05:53:14.480 align:start position:0%
as as an ongoing commission is a little
 
05:53:16.708 --> 05:53:16.718 align:start position:0%
bit fluid and and has tweaked a little
 
05:53:18.390 --> 05:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
bit so that the language can just kind
 
05:53:21.030 --> 05:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
of stay where it is
 
05:53:23.270 --> 05:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
the biggest thing here
 
05:53:25.110 --> 05:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
with this is
 
05:53:25.120 --> 05:53:29.190 align:start position:0%
with this is
um

05:53:29.190 --> 05:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:31.350 --> 05:53:31.360 align:start position:0%
actually hold on one second
 
05:53:33.110 --> 05:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
this is not early right i don't i have
 
05:53:34.470 --> 05:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
an amendment i need to draft to this so
 
05:53:36.150 --> 05:53:36.160 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna i gotta withdraw that motion
 
05:53:39.030 --> 05:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
because i'm not as i'm as i'm looking at
 
05:53:40.708 --> 05:53:40.718 align:start position:0%
you what about the dispatchers and
 
05:53:43.590 --> 05:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
making clear that it does not work so i
 
05:53:45.510 --> 05:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
did something brilliant and i have two
 
05:53:47.110 --> 05:53:47.120 align:start position:0%
copies of the same bill and made notes
 
05:53:48.948 --> 05:53:48.958 align:start position:0%
on both of them and didn't combine them
 
05:53:50.150 --> 05:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
together so
 
05:53:52.628 --> 05:53:52.638 align:start position:0%
i trust they will be the final result
 
05:53:52.638 --> 05:53:54.230 align:start position:0%
i trust they will be the final result
congratulations

05:53:54.230 --> 05:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
congratulations
 
05:53:54.240 --> 05:53:55.270 align:start position:0%
congratulations

all right so yeah we're gonna i gotta i

gotta write a quick amendment on this so
 
05:54:00.150 --> 05:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna withdraw sorry all right we
 
05:54:02.390 --> 05:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
that motion is withdrawn
 
05:54:04.948 --> 05:54:04.958 align:start position:0%
that sound effect is amazing
 
05:54:06.210 --> 05:54:06.220 align:start position:0%
oh i didn't realize that
 
05:54:06.220 --> 05:54:08.470 align:start position:0%
oh i didn't realize that
[Laughter]

05:54:08.470 --> 05:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
05:54:10.470 --> 05:54:10.480 align:start position:0%

05:54:13.350 --> 05:54:13.360 align:start position:0%
ready um i have a question of the chair
 
05:54:15.990 --> 05:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
yeah the amendment that i have on 3 30
 
05:54:19.110 --> 05:54:19.120 align:start position:0%
do you feel that's non-germane
 
05:54:19.120 --> 05:54:21.270 align:start position:0%
do you feel that's non-germane
or

05:54:21.270 --> 05:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:54:26.868 --> 05:54:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:28.868 --> 05:54:28.878 align:start position:0%
no now the uh she wants to add an
 
05:54:31.270 --> 05:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
oversight committee to senate bill 330
 
05:54:33.670 --> 05:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
yeah and we're altering the do you have
 
05:54:35.270 --> 05:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
enough number
 
05:54:38.070 --> 05:54:38.080 align:start position:0%
yes i have uh okay
 
05:54:41.350 --> 05:54:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:43.910 --> 05:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
we'll add a hearing for it
 
05:54:43.920 --> 05:54:46.070 align:start position:0%
we'll add a hearing for it
yeah

05:54:46.070 --> 05:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:54:49.190 --> 05:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
the oplc oversight yeah
 
05:54:51.830 --> 05:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
yeah this is this is something that we
 
05:54:51.840 --> 05:54:54.150 align:start position:0%
yeah this is this is something that we
interesting

05:54:54.150 --> 05:54:54.160 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
05:54:56.708 --> 05:54:56.718 align:start position:0%
senate bill 330 has a study committee on
 
05:54:56.718 --> 05:54:58.390 align:start position:0%
senate bill 330 has a study committee on
oplc

05:54:58.390 --> 05:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
05:54:58.400 --> 05:55:00.310 align:start position:0%
oplc
and

05:55:00.310 --> 05:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:55:02.070 --> 05:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
some of it's germain is some of it is
 
05:55:05.030 --> 05:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:06.310 --> 05:55:06.320 align:start position:0%
i'm sure i believe there was also some
 
05:55:07.990 --> 05:55:08.000 align:start position:0%
discussion as to
 
05:55:10.150 --> 05:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
an amendment perhaps in reference to
 
05:55:12.310 --> 05:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
senate bill 330 pulling these this
 
05:55:13.990 --> 05:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
entire boxing and wrestling commission
 
05:55:15.830 --> 05:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
out of the oplc
 
05:55:17.990 --> 05:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
okay so it sounds like we're not quite
 
05:55:18.000 --> 05:55:19.590 align:start position:0%
okay so it sounds like we're not quite
ready

05:55:19.590 --> 05:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
ready
 
05:55:22.390 --> 05:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
to exact that unless
 
05:55:24.390 --> 05:55:24.400 align:start position:0%
unless you wanted to discuss it
 
05:55:29.190 --> 05:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:42.868 --> 05:55:42.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:44.708 --> 05:55:44.718 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
05:55:46.788 --> 05:55:46.798 align:start position:0%
the thing is that the for the the first
 
05:55:48.788 --> 05:55:48.798 align:start position:0%
part which is the amendment
 
05:55:48.798 --> 05:55:49.670 align:start position:0%
part which is the amendment
on

05:55:49.670 --> 05:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
on
 
05:55:51.750 --> 05:55:51.760 align:start position:0%
revising the the study committee is
 
05:55:54.310 --> 05:55:54.320 align:start position:0%
perfectly germane right the second
 
05:55:59.350 --> 05:55:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:01.590 --> 05:56:01.600 align:start position:0%
is that this in the field here what's
 
05:56:01.600 --> 05:56:04.548 align:start position:0%
is that this in the field here what's
that

05:56:04.548 --> 05:56:04.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:15.030 --> 05:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:18.390 --> 05:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if yeah this is
 
05:56:18.400 --> 05:56:23.510 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if yeah this is
um

05:56:23.510 --> 05:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:25.990 --> 05:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
it seems germane to me because this is a
 
05:56:29.350 --> 05:56:29.360 align:start position:0%
bill about overs about the operation
 
05:56:31.590 --> 05:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
of the oplc
 
05:56:36.070 --> 05:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:38.310 --> 05:56:38.320 align:start position:0%
an oversight it already includes a study
 
05:56:45.430 --> 05:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:01.670 --> 05:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:06.070 --> 05:57:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:07.350 --> 05:57:07.360 align:start position:0%
i just
 
05:57:07.360 --> 05:57:08.470 align:start position:0%
i just
yeah

05:57:08.470 --> 05:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:57:10.230 --> 05:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
i just thought as a commission i mean
 
05:57:12.230 --> 05:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
it's a committee we felt uncomfortable
 
05:57:14.310 --> 05:57:14.320 align:start position:0%
at least i do of putting boxing and
 
05:57:16.708 --> 05:57:16.718 align:start position:0%
wrestling under oplc because they don't
 
05:57:18.708 --> 05:57:18.718 align:start position:0%
issue any licenses for that and i think
 
05:57:21.110 --> 05:57:21.120 align:start position:0%
we should look at it i think it's better
 
05:57:23.510 --> 05:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
suited under the lottery group
 
05:57:25.830 --> 05:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
rather than oplc and i
 
05:57:27.110 --> 05:57:27.120 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
05:57:30.310 --> 05:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
this amendment is fine other than that i
 
05:57:32.230 --> 05:57:32.240 align:start position:0%
think it's important that we take that
 
05:57:34.310 --> 05:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
out of oplc i just don't it has no place
 
05:57:36.310 --> 05:57:36.320 align:start position:0%
in there i don't think
 
05:57:36.320 --> 05:57:37.350 align:start position:0%
in there i don't think
i'm

05:57:37.350 --> 05:57:37.360 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
05:57:39.430 --> 05:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
i'm not following sorry i was
 
05:57:40.708 --> 05:57:40.718 align:start position:0%
concentrating on something oh that's
 
05:57:43.030 --> 05:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
okay representative stuart i just want i
 
05:57:46.230 --> 05:57:46.240 align:start position:0%
just mentioned that your
 
05:57:48.788 --> 05:57:48.798 align:start position:0%
amendment keeps the boxing and wrestling
 
05:57:51.670 --> 05:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
commission in oplc
 
05:57:55.190 --> 05:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
um i did discuss that with the chair and
 
05:57:56.948 --> 05:57:56.958 align:start position:0%
uh she felt that
 
05:57:59.430 --> 05:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
we could make that deletion if we chose
 
05:58:01.670 --> 05:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
to that's correct uh
 
05:58:06.548 --> 05:58:06.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:06.558 --> 05:58:14.708 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:58:14.708 --> 05:58:14.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:16.548 --> 05:58:16.558 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't i don't have a problem with
 
05:58:22.390 --> 05:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:22.400 --> 05:58:23.590 align:start position:0%
 
listen

05:58:23.590 --> 05:58:23.600 align:start position:0%
listen
 
05:58:23.600 --> 05:58:25.510 align:start position:0%
listen
dude

05:58:25.510 --> 05:58:25.520 align:start position:0%
dude
 
05:58:27.590 --> 05:58:27.600 align:start position:0%
do you want to talk about what what the
 
05:58:29.350 --> 05:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
amendment yeah that's uh
 
05:58:30.948 --> 05:58:30.958 align:start position:0%
representative goalie you have a comment
 
05:58:30.958 --> 05:58:32.548 align:start position:0%
representative goalie you have a comment
or

05:58:32.548 --> 05:58:32.558 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:58:34.868 --> 05:58:34.878 align:start position:0%
no i was just gonna question if we were
 
05:58:37.110 --> 05:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
just discussing the amendment right now
 
05:58:40.310 --> 05:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
um obviously this is not ready for
 
05:58:42.150 --> 05:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
an exec session because of the original
 
05:58:43.910 --> 05:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
bill that needed boxing commission
 
05:58:45.510 --> 05:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
removed out of it but i was just
 
05:58:46.868 --> 05:58:46.878 align:start position:0%
questioning where we are and where we're
 
05:58:46.878 --> 05:58:47.990 align:start position:0%
questioning where we are and where we're
at

05:58:47.990 --> 05:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
at
 
05:58:51.270 --> 05:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
well at the moment we
 
05:58:53.830 --> 05:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
well we're discussing this this
 
05:58:56.868 --> 05:58:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:58.548 --> 05:58:58.558 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't want it to be declared
 
05:59:00.628 --> 05:59:00.638 align:start position:0%
non-germane if we don't hold a hearing
 
05:59:01.510 --> 05:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
on it
 
05:59:03.590 --> 05:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
so i want to confirm that before we
 
05:59:05.190 --> 05:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
accept it okay
 
05:59:07.270 --> 05:59:07.280 align:start position:0%
but we could
 
05:59:09.670 --> 05:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
take take a look at it since we're here
 
05:59:11.750 --> 05:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
and we also want to
 
05:59:13.990 --> 05:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
take a straw poll on whether or not we
 
05:59:15.510 --> 05:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
want to
 
05:59:18.150 --> 05:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
take out moving the boxing and rex
 
05:59:20.470 --> 05:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
wrestling commission because that's a
 
05:59:24.230 --> 05:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
separation yes representative schmidt
 
05:59:26.868 --> 05:59:26.878 align:start position:0%
so who is driving this
 
05:59:30.230 --> 05:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh move to put the boxing commission
 
05:59:35.030 --> 05:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
to in oplc as opposed to where it is now
 
05:59:37.590 --> 05:59:37.600 align:start position:0%
that's a very good question we don't we
 
05:59:40.150 --> 05:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
have two problems yes the first problem
 
05:59:42.070 --> 05:59:42.080 align:start position:0%
is that the committee on legislative
 
05:59:42.080 --> 05:59:43.510 align:start position:0%
is that the committee on legislative
administration

05:59:43.510 --> 05:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
administration
 
05:59:46.070 --> 05:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
deleted the the administrative
 
05:59:48.310 --> 05:59:48.320 align:start position:0%
attachment of the boxing and wrestling
 
05:59:48.320 --> 05:59:49.430 align:start position:0%
attachment of the boxing and wrestling
commission

05:59:49.430 --> 05:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
commission
 
05:59:49.440 --> 05:59:50.390 align:start position:0%
commission
to

05:59:50.390 --> 05:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:59:53.990 --> 05:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:55.830 --> 05:59:55.840 align:start position:0%
so that at the moment they don't report
 
06:00:01.430 --> 06:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:03.990 --> 06:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
i'm fine with pulling it out because i
 
06:00:04.000 --> 06:00:04.788 align:start position:0%
i'm fine with pulling it out because i
think

06:00:04.788 --> 06:00:04.798 align:start position:0%
think
 
06:00:06.628 --> 06:00:06.638 align:start position:0%
even though it definitely is kind of an
 
06:00:08.470 --> 06:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
odd duck i think you could make an
 
06:00:10.470 --> 06:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
argument for it but there's certainly
 
06:00:12.470 --> 06:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
some opposition and it
 
06:00:14.548 --> 06:00:14.558 align:start position:0%
it's been working this way is there a
 
06:00:15.910 --> 06:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
problem with it being under the
 
06:00:18.390 --> 06:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
06:00:20.070 --> 06:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know if there's a problem or not
 
06:00:21.350 --> 06:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
but when i
 
06:00:23.990 --> 06:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
i was sitting in on senate edna as
 
06:00:25.910 --> 06:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
we typically do with house bills just in
 
06:00:27.990 --> 06:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
case they need introduction
 
06:00:30.548 --> 06:00:30.558 align:start position:0%
and this was introduced in senate edna
 
06:00:33.830 --> 06:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm looking at the
 
06:00:35.190 --> 06:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
colleague that was sitting next to me
 
06:00:37.270 --> 06:00:37.280 align:start position:0%
going we we never heard i've never heard
 
06:00:39.270 --> 06:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
of this how did and it really should
 
06:00:39.280 --> 06:00:39.990 align:start position:0%
of this how did and it really should
have

06:00:39.990 --> 06:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
06:00:41.670 --> 06:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
i guess it probably should have come to
 
06:00:43.190 --> 06:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
us but it went to legend admin that's
 
06:00:43.200 --> 06:00:44.070 align:start position:0%
us but it went to legend admin that's
why

06:00:44.070 --> 06:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
why
 
06:00:45.510 --> 06:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
that's why none of us have any idea that
 
06:00:47.270 --> 06:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
that even happened
 
06:00:47.280 --> 06:00:48.788 align:start position:0%
that even happened
so

06:00:48.788 --> 06:00:48.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:00:48.798 --> 06:00:49.750 align:start position:0%
so
they

06:00:49.750 --> 06:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
they
 
06:00:51.430 --> 06:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
somebody thought that it needed to be
 
06:00:52.948 --> 06:00:52.958 align:start position:0%
removed out of the secretary of state's
 
06:00:54.948 --> 06:00:54.958 align:start position:0%
office but they didn't put it anywhere
 
06:00:57.190 --> 06:00:57.200 align:start position:0%
it's just floating if that if that bill
 
06:00:58.948 --> 06:00:58.958 align:start position:0%
makes it through the senate it's a it's
 
06:01:01.030 --> 06:01:01.040 align:start position:0%
a board that exists that reports i guess
 
06:01:03.030 --> 06:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
in theory to no one
 
06:01:03.040 --> 06:01:04.310 align:start position:0%
in theory to no one
so

06:01:04.310 --> 06:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:01:06.150 --> 06:01:06.160 align:start position:0%
it's a governor i guess it's but it you
 
06:01:10.230 --> 06:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
know as an executive function but
 
06:01:10.240 --> 06:01:11.910 align:start position:0%
know as an executive function but
this

06:01:11.910 --> 06:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:01:14.230 --> 06:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
this this piece of legislation says now
 
06:01:15.670 --> 06:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
okay now we're going to put it over in
 
06:01:17.350 --> 06:01:17.360 align:start position:0%
oplc i don't know why that didn't go
 
06:01:18.948 --> 06:01:18.958 align:start position:0%
through the other bill but clearly the
 
06:01:19.910 --> 06:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
senate and the house were not
 
06:01:21.190 --> 06:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
communicating with each other in
 
06:01:22.788 --> 06:01:22.798 align:start position:0%
reference to this
 
06:01:24.628 --> 06:01:24.638 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden massive interest in the
 
06:01:26.470 --> 06:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
boxing and wrestling commission
 
06:01:28.628 --> 06:01:28.638 align:start position:0%
so i you know i just i don't think it's
 
06:01:30.628 --> 06:01:30.638 align:start position:0%
appropriate to go under oplc
 
06:01:31.910 --> 06:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
at all i think
 
06:01:33.030 --> 06:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
if you look at what some of the other
 
06:01:34.788 --> 06:01:34.798 align:start position:0%
states do especially in nevada that
 
06:01:36.628 --> 06:01:36.638 align:start position:0%
falls under their lottery gaming
 
06:01:38.628 --> 06:01:38.638 align:start position:0%
commission or whatever it's a big deal
 
06:01:40.830 --> 06:01:40.840 align:start position:0%
in nevada you know a big
 
06:01:43.430 --> 06:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
deal they have all kinds of events like
 
06:01:45.830 --> 06:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
that we have very relatively few right
 
06:01:47.430 --> 06:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
well it does need to go somewhere i
 
06:01:49.350 --> 06:01:49.360 align:start position:0%
didn't they didn't need to go someplace
 
06:01:51.670 --> 06:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
but if it's with the secretary of state
 
06:01:53.350 --> 06:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
and it's not really causing a problem
 
06:01:55.270 --> 06:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
why don't we just leave it right there
 
06:01:56.708 --> 06:01:56.718 align:start position:0%
well because we've lost control of that
 
06:01:59.110 --> 06:01:59.120 align:start position:0%
that animal is already in the senate oh
 
06:02:00.230 --> 06:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
that's already passed the house on
 
06:02:00.240 --> 06:02:01.830 align:start position:0%
that's already passed the house on
consent

06:02:01.830 --> 06:02:01.840 align:start position:0%
consent
 
06:02:04.150 --> 06:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
yeah the thing of it is the boxing and
 
06:02:06.150 --> 06:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
wrestling commission doesn't have much
 
06:02:06.160 --> 06:02:07.270 align:start position:0%
wrestling commission doesn't have much
interaction

06:02:07.270 --> 06:02:07.280 align:start position:0%
interaction
 
06:02:09.430 --> 06:02:09.440 align:start position:0%
interaction with other parts of the
 
06:02:10.868 --> 06:02:10.878 align:start position:0%
state government
 
06:02:13.830 --> 06:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
they run their own operations they
 
06:02:13.840 --> 06:02:14.628 align:start position:0%
they run their own operations they
they

06:02:14.628 --> 06:02:14.638 align:start position:0%
they
 
06:02:14.638 --> 06:02:15.510 align:start position:0%
they
uh

06:02:15.510 --> 06:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:02:17.430 --> 06:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
license the uh
 
06:02:21.590 --> 06:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
the umpires and things like that and
 
06:02:23.910 --> 06:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
basically to a per a live person that
 
06:02:26.390 --> 06:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
can give them a twenty dollar bill
 
06:02:30.310 --> 06:02:30.320 align:start position:0%
and they provide a noticeable
 
06:02:32.868 --> 06:02:32.878 align:start position:0%
a surplus to which goes into the general
 
06:02:34.788 --> 06:02:34.798 align:start position:0%
fund they're
 
06:02:36.470 --> 06:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
not really
 
06:02:38.310 --> 06:02:38.320 align:start position:0%
something that would be appropriate in
 
06:02:38.320 --> 06:02:39.190 align:start position:0%
something that would be appropriate in
the

06:02:39.190 --> 06:02:39.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:02:39.200 --> 06:02:41.430 align:start position:0%
the
oplc

06:02:41.430 --> 06:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
06:02:41.440 --> 06:02:43.270 align:start position:0%
oplc
um

06:02:43.270 --> 06:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:45.350 --> 06:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
lottery would be okay if we wanted to
 
06:02:47.350 --> 06:02:47.360 align:start position:0%
put him there or back to the secretary
 
06:02:49.350 --> 06:02:49.360 align:start position:0%
of state is fine as far as i'm concerned
 
06:02:51.510 --> 06:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
like you say there hasn't i have not
 
06:02:54.230 --> 06:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
heard of any problems
 
06:02:55.830 --> 06:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
representative lackas
 
06:02:57.910 --> 06:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
yeah um yeah i don't think it belongs
 
06:03:00.548 --> 06:03:00.558 align:start position:0%
under oplc i mean we could just if it's
 
06:03:02.310 --> 06:03:02.320 align:start position:0%
not going to cause a serious problem to
 
06:03:03.750 --> 06:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
just let it float somewhere under the
 
06:03:05.510 --> 06:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
governor if they pretty much run on
 
06:03:07.270 --> 06:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
their own i don't know that there's a
 
06:03:09.430 --> 06:03:09.440 align:start position:0%
problem with that i'd be okay with that
 
06:03:11.190 --> 06:03:11.200 align:start position:0%
or if somebody get an amendment to put
 
06:03:13.830 --> 06:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
it under lottery whatever but it's not
 
06:03:13.840 --> 06:03:15.670 align:start position:0%
it under lottery whatever but it's not
oplc

06:03:15.670 --> 06:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
06:03:17.190 --> 06:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
my only concern is to look on the
 
06:03:18.948 --> 06:03:18.958 align:start position:0%
lottery commissioner's face when this
 
06:03:20.708 --> 06:03:20.718 align:start position:0%
goes through and they go what did we
 
06:03:23.030 --> 06:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
just inherit because as of right now
 
06:03:24.708 --> 06:03:24.718 align:start position:0%
they have no idea we're even talking
 
06:03:26.070 --> 06:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
about this right
 
06:03:27.670 --> 06:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
is there some
 
06:03:29.750 --> 06:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
serious problem caused by
 
06:03:32.310 --> 06:03:32.320 align:start position:0%
taking it not putting it no or
 
06:03:34.390 --> 06:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
taking not putting an oplc let it float
 
06:03:35.990 --> 06:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
and deal with something next year after
 
06:03:37.670 --> 06:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
talking the laundry room i can tell
 
06:03:39.990 --> 06:03:40.000 align:start position:0%
representative schuett lingoli
 
06:03:42.150 --> 06:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i would be
 
06:03:45.430 --> 06:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
happy if the committee chooses to remove
 
06:03:45.440 --> 06:03:46.390 align:start position:0%
happy if the committee chooses to remove
that

06:03:46.390 --> 06:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:03:47.670 --> 06:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
to have
 
06:03:50.070 --> 06:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
this amendment redrafted
 
06:03:52.230 --> 06:03:52.240 align:start position:0%
removing that and then that would allow
 
06:03:53.830 --> 06:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
you time to
 
06:03:55.910 --> 06:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
schedule a
 
06:03:57.510 --> 06:03:57.520 align:start position:0%
non-jermaine amendment hearing if
 
06:04:02.150 --> 06:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:05.750 --> 06:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:09.110 --> 06:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:10.868 --> 06:04:10.878 align:start position:0%
the more i look at this the more i see
 
06:04:12.310 --> 06:04:12.320 align:start position:0%
why it shouldn't be going where it's
 
06:04:14.708 --> 06:04:14.718 align:start position:0%
going i mean when you
 
06:04:16.868 --> 06:04:16.878 align:start position:0%
when you look at the commission through
 
06:04:18.628 --> 06:04:18.638 align:start position:0%
the office of professional licensure and
 
06:04:20.708 --> 06:04:20.718 align:start position:0%
certification shall collect five percent
 
06:04:23.590 --> 06:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
of gross receipts that is totally out of
 
06:04:25.590 --> 06:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
line on what the oplc does they
 
06:04:27.030 --> 06:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be collecting money for
 
06:04:28.548 --> 06:04:28.558 align:start position:0%
organizations to be transferred into
 
06:04:30.628 --> 06:04:30.638 align:start position:0%
their fund that's one of them one big
 
06:04:32.868 --> 06:04:32.878 align:start position:0%
reason why i will not support this we
